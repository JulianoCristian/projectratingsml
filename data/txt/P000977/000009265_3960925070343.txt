PROJECT COMPLETION RZPORT
PREFACZ
Credit 1095-GUB was approved on January 13, 1981, to assist the
Petroleum Exploration Project.  The objectives of the Project were defined
in accordance with the conclusions of studies financed through two advances
for a Project Preparation Facility, which vere granted respectively in May
and December, 1980, for a total amount of US$550,000. The main components
of the project included: (i) new seismic data acquisition in offshore
areas; (i') preparation of a report on the petroleum potential of the
country; (iii) the promotion of the Guinea Bi3sau sedimentary basin to
attract interest of oil companies; and (iv) institution building. The
amount of the Credit was SDR5,400,000. The Credit's Closing Date was
extended for three successive periods up to June 30, 1986. The Credit was
fully disbursed.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Industry
and Energy Division of the Technical Department and the Industry and Energy
Operations Division of the Western Africa Department, Africa Regional
Office, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan,
Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and the Executing Agency on April 4,
1989, for conments by May 19, 1989, but none were received.

zGSImI..
1.       With a GCP per capita of US$170 at the beginning of the project,
Guinea Bhisau was one of the poorest countries in Africa. Among the mny
drawbacks the country suffered, 'ransport was a major constraint, and oil
imports were a burden on the economy.
2.       The issue of transport was addressed under a first IDA-assisted
operation (in February 1980), through Credit 878-GUB for an amount of
US$9,000,000. The second project, financed through Credit 1095-GUB,
addressed the petroleum issues. This Credit of SDR 5.4 million, which is
under review, was approved on January 13, 1981. The Government of Guinea
Bissau was the Borrower, and the implementing agency was the national
petroleum corporation Petrominas, which reports to the Ministry of Industry
and Natural Resourceb (MINR).
3.       Credit 1095-GUB was followed by an additional IDA operation,
Credit 1334-GUB, approved on March 15, 1983, for SDR11,900,000, which
financed the continuation of exploration promotion activities started under
the first project. This latter credit will be reviewed in a separate
P.C.R.
4.       The Government of Guinea Bissau had long considered oil
exploration as a key priority for the country. The Government had,
approximately at the time when the Project was identified, contracted the
consulting company Atlantic Resources Limited (A.R.L.) to assist them in
increasing their knowledge ox the country's hydroca-bon potential.
5.       A few oil companies had presented proposals for petroleum
exploration contracts. However, according to the recomnendations of its
consultant, the Government decided to delay negotiations with oil
companies, until the evaluation of the hydrocarbon potential of the country
was completed.
6.       An IDA mission in February 1981, found the Government's approach
sound, and consistent with the Association's policy. The mission
identified and recommended a project, which included the financing of
geophysical works aimed at filling gaps in petroleum information and in
strengthening Petrominas' managing and technical capabilities.
7.       The IDA mission also recommended the use of a Project Preparation
Facility for the detailed preparation of the project, and the financing of
seismic reprocessing, which could help in defining a program for new
seismic acquisitions in offshore areas.  The Government had expressed the
desire to retain its consultant to supervise the operations to be
implemented under the IDA Project.
8.       A PPF of US$400,000 was granted in May 1980, and increased to
US*550.000 in December 1980.  The components of Credit 1095-GUI were



outlined on the basis of results of the studies implemented under the PPF
and prepared by the consultant company. These includeds (i) seimilc
reprocessing; (ii) evaluation of the scopn of the Project; and (iii)
determination of corresponding costs.
9.       The objective of the Project was to promote the resumption of
offshore hydrocarbon exploration in the country. To achieve this
objective, t'be Projoct aimed at: (i) strengthening the capacity of
Petrominas to evaluate exploration data; (ii) acquiring new ezploration
data using state of t;e art technology; (Cii) enabling the Government to
offer new acreage for exploration by foreign companies on the basis of new
information; and (iv) negotiating exploration production contracts on the
basis of appropriate legislation and model contract.
10.      The Project consisted of:
- geopaysical work, including new seismic data acquisition (3,000
km), and reprocessing of existing seismic data (3,000 km);
- consultant's services (geological studies, promotion, accounting,
legal and economic assistance);
- training of Petromines' technicians;
- providing Petrominas with facilities and equipment, including two
prefabricated buildings.
11.      The amount of the credit, SDR4,500,000, was fully disbursed.  The
last disbursement was made in August 1986.
12.      The main component of the project, a seismic survey in offshore
waters, was satisfactorily implemented (the contractor wlas Digicon, from
Houston). The consultant company progressively integrated all available
data, and presented petroleum exploration results during a promotional
seminar held in November 1981. The promotion seminar was attended by
thirty five oil companies; eleven data packages were sold for a total of
US$1,200,000. But a long period elapsed before a new Hydrocarbon Law, a
revised fiscal regime, and a model contract were published. The initial
interest shown by oil companies had shrunk by then, and only one
exploration production contract was signed with a consortium of oil
companies led by Elf-Aquitaine on February 11, 1984. As of today, the
consortium has drilled one well, which was dry, but provided valuable
geologic information.
13.      The reorganization of the petroleum sector in Guinea Bissau has
progressed, but is not yet completed. As a result of the advice of its
management consultants (Robert Nathan and Associates, Washington, D.C.),
Petrominas was released from its responsibilities for the mining sector
(transferred to the MINR) and was reorganized and renamed Petroguin.



-vi -
14.      The last components of the project (institution building)
progressed less satisfactorily: (i) the building for Petrominas was not
started at the completion date of the Credit; (it) accounting procedures
were still in need of upgrading when the project was completed, and
accounting irregularities continued to occur. The accounting issues were
addressed within the framework of the ongoing Credit 1334-GUB.
15.      The delays in impleme nting the above mentioned project components
derived from the initial concentration of all efforts by Petrominas towards
getting the technical and legal work off the ground and getting exploration
activities going. Further delays were originated by slow decision making
on the part of the Borrower.
16.      The consultants hired for the various components of the project
performed generally excellent work, which met with the approval of both the
Borrower and the Association. While one consulting firm provided very
satisfactory technical work, their financial management and their invoicing
procedures, according to Arthur Young's audit report, were not fully
satisfactory.
17.      The Association actively supervised the implementation of the main
components of the Project, making a special effort in guiding to its end
the technical work. Also the Association's role was decisive in persuading
the Government of Guinea Bissau in enacting a petroleum law and then
improving it substantially. However, the Association was too lenient in
tne supervision of other components of the Project, particularly the
administratior and invoicing of one of the consultants' contracts as well
as the accounting procedures of Petromina3.
Conclusions
18.      The petroleum strategy adopted by the Government called for a
swift appraisal of Guinea Bissau sedimentary basins hydrocarbon potential
to enable the Government to negotiate exploration agreements properly, and
a thorough review of the existing hydrocarbon legislation.
19.      The belated publication of a Petroleum Law resulted in a decrease
of the interest initially shown by the oil industry.
20.      However, a petroleum exploration contract was awarded to a group
of oil companies led by Elf-Aquitaine, and the project may thus be
considered successful.
21.      Petrominas' concentration in getting off the ground teclnical
operations, and preparing a new petroleum law, led it to put aside the
other project components, whose implementation requires IDA's further
assistance, particularly in the field of equipment and training.



GUINEA BISSAU
FIRST PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROJECT
CREDIT 1095-GUB
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. Introduction
1.01     The project under review was the first IDA lending operation in
Guinea Bissau in the Energy field. Its main objective was to attract
investments from foreign oil companies in an atte-;t to help reduce the
countr-'s total dependence on imported petroleum products by the
development of domestic oil and gas reserves.
1.02     Although Guinea Bissau has a variety of potential energy
resources, the sector is still at an early stage of development. The
forests, which cover 702 of the national territory, are poorly exploited,
and there is a large but untapped hydrologic potential. Furthermore,
Guinea Bissau's promising offshore sedimentary basins have barely been
explored.
1.03     In 1979, 692 of the energy demand in the country was met by
firewood and charcoal, and 312 by imported petroleum products. Total power
consumption was around 30 Gwh, 602 of which was accounted for by the
capital city. Imported petroleum products amounted to 22,000 metric tons,
or 30 kg per capita.
1.04     Despite their small size, petroleum imports had become a growing
burden on the balance of payments. In 1979, they rose to an amount
equivalent to 36Z of merchandise exports. T2he success of the Government's
ongoing power expansion projects would significantly increase petroleum
products imports. The Government attaches, consequently, high priority to
the search for hydrocarbons.
1.05     The Government agency in charge of petroleum exploration was
Petrominas, a state enterprise created in 1977, reporting to the Ministry
of Natural Resources. In 1980, Petrominas had a skeleton staff of
i.nexperienced personnel. Whatever the future efforts required to
strengthen this staff, Petrominas will require the support of specialized
consultants for a few years. Petrominas financial resources consisted of
budgetarv allocations. Its total allocation for 1980 was in the order of
US$1.15 million, of which US$1 million was devoted to a consultant's
contract for the compilation and review of existing data.
1.06     Hydrocarbon exploration and production was governed by a
Portuguese Concession Law dating back to the 1920's, which the Government
rightly considered as obsolete. The Government had thus decided tn prepare
a new Petroleum Law, more suitable to attract foreigr. investments.



1.07   The sedimentary area of Guinea Bissau includes 107,000 km2, of which
33,000 km2 are located enshore, 42,000 km2 in the shallow water area (water
depth less than 200 m), and 30,000 km2 in the deep water area (water depth
more than 200 m). Petroleum exploration started in 1958, when Esso
obtained an onshore concession from Portugal. Esso carried out geophysicai
surveys and drilled four wells, which were dry. Afte 1966, Esso
concentrated its efforts on the offshore, wher: it recorded about 14,000
line km of seismic data and drilled five wells, *11 of which had shows of
oil and gas. Of special interest is well PGP-3, drilled in 1977, which
tested a few barrels of good quality oil. Overall, acquired results,
albeit limited, are bearing out the potential of the Guinea Bissau offshore
sedimentary basin.
1.08     Several U.S. and European oil companies had expressed interest in
signing petroleum exploration contracts. Shell, Pecten, Chevron, Seagap,
had presented explicit proposals. However, the Government's consultant
strongly advised Guinea Bissau officials to postpone any negotiation w.th
oil companies, pending a thorough evaluation of hydrocarbon plays in the
country, with the view of adapting the exploration contracts to the
attractiveness of the different areas in the national sedimentary basins.
The Government followed their consultanit's recommendation.
1.09     The Association considered this Government approach to oil
exploration as sound, assuming that this evaluation would be done quickly
enough, in order not to discourage oil companies from maintaining their
original offers. Based on this policy, the identificat,on of the project
was made.

II. Project Identification and Preparation
2.01     A mission from the Programs Department, visiting Bissau in the
summer of 1979, discussed with the Government the prospects for petroleum
exploration. The mission reported that the Government had recently
received various cLc.tract offers from international oil companies and that
the Government wam particularly interested in appraising the exploration
data currently available on Guinea Bissau, in order to be in a stronger
position to assess the options available. The Government was also
interested in receiving technical assistance in strategy formulation and
evaluation of petroleum contracts. An exploration consultant
-J. C. Ferrand and Associates - was commissioned by the Bank to visit
Guinea Bissau in order to identify the country's needs in terms of
assistance in petroleum exploration. Following this mission, in December
1979, the Government sent to the Association a request to finance a project
focussed on the following points:
- implementation of a regional geologic study integrating all
existing data;
- implementation of complementary work, with a view to accelerate
petroleum exploration and production;
- training of Petrominas staff; and
- providing Petrominas with the necessary laboratory and office
equipment and vehicles.
Responding to this request, a mission from the Energy Department visited
Guinea Bissau from February 16 to February 20, 1980, to identify the
components of the proposed project.
2.02     The mission supported the Government's petroleum policy outlined
above (paragraph 1.08) on grounds that integration of all technical data,
with 'aodern reprocessing and additional seismic work, especially in those
areas w4.th insufficient coverage, was needed to upgrade possible petroleum
prospeccs before fruitful discussions could be started with oil companies.
2.03     The mission recommended that the following work be included in the
project:
- a two-phase reprocessing of old seismic lines; as a first step, a
test was to be made to define the best reprocessing technique, and
as a second step, a large number of lines had to be reprocessed,
either to complement new data acquisition, or to upgrade specific
prospects, such as the PGO3 structure or any salt piercements;
- a seismic survey, aimed at completing previous studies, which were
partially incomplete, and partially obsolete; and



- the results of this seismic data acquisition and reprocessing were
to be integrated with all existing data into a regional geological
study of Guinea Bissau's sedimentary basins, in order to assess
their hydrocarbon potential. Results would be presented to the
oil industry during petroleum exploration promotion seminars.
2.04     The mission also i'entified the following other actions as needed
to optimize the prospects of promoting petroleum exploration:
- updating of the Petroleum Law, drafting a model contract, and
defining a block by block exploration trategy;
- technical assistance to Petrominas, iuicluding expert advice in
negotiations with oil companies, training programs, hiring of
outside experts, acquisition of laboratory equipment, and
reorganization of Petrominas;
2.05     The mission also suggested the use of a Project Preparation
Facility fot the detailed preparation of the Project, and for the first
phase of the proposed seismic program, namely, reprocessing 1000 km of old
seismic lines.
Cost estimates for the proposed PPF program were as follows:
a. Reprocessing of around 1000 km of seismic lines            200,000
b. Supervision of reprocessing, preparativn of a
preliminary report for the appraisal of the
IDA preject                                              109,500
c. Travels - reproduction of documents-drafting                40,500
Total                                                     400,000
2.06     The Association accepted the recommendations of the identification
mission, and granted in July 1980 a US$400,000 advance for a Project
Preparation Facility.  The Government wished to entrust the work to be
covered by the PPF to a consulting firm. The Association approved the
Government's proposal.
2.07     In June 1980, the firm forwarded to the Association an evaluation
report of the project. The main components of the proposed project were
detailed and costs were estimated. Furthermore, the firm recommended the
construction of two prefabricated office buildings, in order to provide
favorable working conditions for Petrominas staff, and decent housing
conditions for foreign consultants. Total project cost was estimated -t
US$6.8 million.
2.08     In July 1980, an appraisal mission from the Association met in
Lisbon with Guinea Bissau officials and representatives of the consultants.
The project was appraised, based on the firm's report. Results of the
mission were described in an "Issues Paper," dated August 13, 1980.
Project costs were increased to US$7.1 million by the addition of a new



- 5 -
component 'Energy Planning' (US$0.3 million), which was later on discarded
by the Association upon the request of Petrominas. The report mentioned
also that a border dispute with Senegal, regarding the continental
platform, was one of the major unresolved issues of the project.
2.09     Seismic reprocessing was delayed because of longer than expected
negotiations with Exxon regarding procedures and confidentiality. Also
Exxon insisted that all tapes should be copied at the same time.
Furthermore, many of these tapedi were recorded on 7 and 21 track formats
which were out of use, and they !iad to be changed to the normal 9 track
format. The financial needs fo; carrying a seismic reprocessing test
exceeded thus the amount provided for in the PPF.  An increase of the PPF
for an amount of US$150,000 was granted by the Association in December
1980.
2.10     Seismic reprocessing tests were successfully carried out by
Digicon Geophysical Corporation, and proved the usefulness of reprocessing
a further 3300 km of seismic lines, and of newly acquiring 2500 line kms.
The seismic survey was to be implemented during the February/March Cry
season, in order to meet the work program timetable. For this reason, the
consultant retained by the Government, acting foL Petrominas, proceeded to
select the geophysical company which would be in charge of the survey
before the Development Credit Agreement had been signed.
2.1'     The Credit Agreement was signed on January 15, 1981.  The
implementing agency was Petrominas. The total amount of the loan was SDR
5.4 million, which at the exchange %.'rrent rate on the day of signature of
the Credit Agreement was equivalent to US$6.98, including the amount of the
PPF (US$550,000), and with a participation of Petrominas in local currency
equivalent to US$180,000.
2.12     The Project, as finally defined, included the following major
components.
A. Exploration
(a) Seismic surveying of approximately 2,200 line km on a
reconnaissance grid completing the existing data; and of
approximately 300 line km on a detailed grid around well
PGO3.
(b) Processing of the new seismic data and reprocessing of
approximately 3000 line kms of existing seismic data.
B. Preparation and Implementation of Promotion
(a) Review, compilation, and integration of all existing
geophysical data into a report describing the national
petroleum potential.



(b) Preparation of a draft petroleum la" and model agreements,
and of related economic analysis thereafter.
(c) Promotion of the national petroleum potential to oil
companies and, if possible, negotiation of exploration
contracts.
(d) Monitoring of the exploration activities of companies after
exploration contracts had been entered.
C. Assistance to Petrominas
(a) Establishing of an improved accounting system in Petrominas
enabling it inter alia, to monitor and to aud.,t expenditures
by oil exploration companies.
(b) Establishment and execution of a training program consisting
of providing for:
- fellowships abroad for two geologists, two 6.ophysicists,
and for the staff in charge of following exploration
activities of oil companies; and
- on-the-job training for designated staff.
D. Provision of Necessary Facilities
(a) Installation and equipment of two prefabricated buildings to
house a basic laboratory, library, offices, and storage for
well samples, and to serve as living quarters for the
consultants employed under the Project.
(b) Provision of vehicles for use under the Project.
E. Basin Study
Participation in a geological and geophysical study of the
sedimentary basins shared with the Republic of Senegal and the
Republic of Gambia.
2.13     The Project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1983.
According to the program timetable, the integrated geological study (B(a)
above) was expected to be produced by March or April 1982. In order to
meet this deadline, new seismic data was to be acquired in February/March
1981. Processing of new seismic lines and reprocessing of previouisly
acquired seismic data were to be completed by September 1981.



III. Implementation of the Project
Exploration
Seismic Acquisition
3.01     The seismic survey was implemented on schedule during the dry
season of February/April 1981.
3.02     Three experienced companies submitted bids: C.G.G. of France,
Western and Digicon of the U.S.A. (Houston, Texas).  Digicon was awarded
the contract, primarily because of the quick availability of a Digicon
seismic vessel. A joint venture was set up between Petrominas and Digicon.
This latter had agreed to finance an integrated speculative survey covering
the same number of line kms as that funded by Petrominas. The survey was
shot from February 18, 1981 to April 10, 1981. It consisted of an
approximately regular grid, with 1964 kms shot for Petrominas account, and
1979 kms for Digicon's account. The program was restricted between the 20
m and the 1500 m bathymetric contour lines. Extending the program into
shallow -waters, between the islands, would have presented an undue risk for
the deep water seismic vessel.
3.03     Field results were good to fair.  They permitted a good structural
definition of the different geological provinces: platform, paleoslope, and
salt diapirs area, with a detailed mapping of the well PGO3 area. Five
different horizons, from top Paleocene to a pre-Aptian layer, were mapped
within the whole covered area. Results were good enough to be used for a
seismic s'ratigraphy study, which was implemented in 1984.
3.04     A total of 3,943 line kms of profiles were shot, as compared to
the 2,500 kms provided for under the Project Agreement. More detailed and
accurate maps were thus obtained. Owing to Digicon's participation in the
financing of the survey, and although the unit cost was higher than
initially estimated, the total cost for the Government was US$1,732,796, as
compared with the budgeted amount of SDR1.8 million, or approcimately
US$1.9 million.
Seismic Reprocessinig
3.05     The consulting firm, acting for Petrominas, awarded to Digicon the
contract to reprocess existing seismic data. The reprocessing focussed on
the data obtained from the digital marine surveys which had been shot for
Esso, between 1956 and 1968, by Geophysical Service International and by
United Geophysical Corporation. Special emphasis was put on the shallow
water area, where the seismic vessel could not operate. A total of 5,300
kms of seismic lines was reprocessed on schedule between March and
Sep'ember 1981. Other lines were reprocessed to replace lines for which
Es,o film copies were unreadable, and to upgrade the results around the
PGCI well structur- and other salt piercements.



- 8 -
3.06     The data, in particular mu.tifold seismic, were greatly improved.
Attenuation of shallow generating muitiples was the most important key to
enhancement of the data. The reprocessing of the data permitted a general
mapping of the shallow water area. However, when the time comes to promote
to the oil industry this part of the basin, more data will be needed, and a
shallow water seismic survey would be implemented, under Project 1334-GUB.
3.07     Total cost for reprocessing old seismic data, and for processing
newly acquired Digicon data, was US$978,892. This figure compares with an
estimated cost of $700,000 for processing and reprocessing, as presented
into the President's Report. No specific cost breakdown for processing or
reprocessing was entered into the budget included into the Project
Agreement. Total cost of seismic operations, acquisition, processing and
reprocessing, was US$2.7 million, i.e., slightly over the appraisal
estimate of US$2.6 million.
3.08     All seismic tapes acquired in Guinea Bissau are stored, in safe
condition, in various places outside the country.
Implementation of Petroleum Exploration Promotion Seminar
3.09     The contract to implement a regional study and prepare a
geological report, was concluded between Petrominas and Atlantic Resources
Limited (ARL) by direct negotiation. The need for a fast implementation of
the exploration program was considered by the Association sufficient
justification for employing the consulting firm, which had designed the
program and was thus deemed to be in the best position to implement it
expeditiously. However, the firm's invoicing under their initial contract
with Guinea Bissau gave rise to disputes and to a loss of trust in the firm
by Petrominas officials. This caused delays in the negotiation of the new
contract with the firm. The pending issues were finally clarified with the
help of the Association, and the new contract was signed in October iCQe'
The work started immediately, as required by the situation.
3.10     In June 1981, Hunt Oil Company had submitted a petroleum
exploration proposal to the Government. In order to provide incentive to
other interested companies to bid, the Government had decided to offer some
acreage for bidding by December 1981. Bidding on the remaining acreage
would take place later on, with an initial tentative date being set by mid-
1982. The regional geological evaluation report could not be expected to
be ready before April 1982. However, at Petrominas' request, the
consulting firm prepared by November 1981 a presentation to the oil
industry of the conceptual plays existing in the defined acreage.
3.11     The Government did not have the time, during this short period, to
enact a Petroleum Law, define a fiscal regime, nor prepare a model
contract.



-9-
Promotion Seminar
3.12     The promotion seminar took place in Lisbon, on November 23, 1981.
The promoted acreage consisted of 6 blocks, each 2,200 sq. km in size
including the PGO3 vell area. The seminar vas successful. A total of 35
oil companies sent 70 representatives to the seminar. The oil companies
yere however generally disappointed since a petroleum law and a model
contract were not available immediately. The Government decided then to
postpone the deadline for the submission of bids, which was originally
scheduled for December 31, 1981, by a month or two. This deadline would be
later on further extended to 1983.
3.13     Thirteen companies bought the technical data package, which
included Digicon's seismic information which was sold for US$350,000, and
the regional study, which was to be completed by April 1982 by the
consulting firm, and was sold for US$50,000. Taking into account the joint
venture agreement with Digicor, the Government, through Petrominas received
from the documents sale a revenue of US$1.2 million.
Regional Study
3.14     The consulting firm completed its regional geological evaluation
report in June 1982, two months late. Several plays were described in the
Cenozoic and the Mesozoic. With the exception of possible traps related
with salt diapirs, all other conceptual plays corresponded to stratigraphic
traps. No mention was made of Paleozic plays. Overall, the report was
generally considered good.
3.15     As a conclusion of their studies, the firm recommended that a
shallow water survey should be conducted in the near shore areas.
Increased geological knowledge of this zone would allow to include it in
the next round of bidding. As there were no remaining funds in the Credit
under review to finance this seismic survey, the Government submitted a
request for the financing of a second petroleum exploration project in late
September 1982.
Preparation of the Petroleum Law
3.16     Rather than entrusting preparation of the Petroleum Law to legal
consultants, the Government decided to seek advice from a variety of
sources, including the World Bank, and then draft the legislation
themselves. An interministerial team, including Portuguese lawyers, was
set up for this purpose. In March 1982, within the scope of a cooperation
agreement with the Government of Algeria, an Algerian delegation presented
to the Government the draft of a Petroleum Code, which the Association
found to be consistent with industry practice. The Algerians stressed the
need for fiscal flexibility to accommodate marginal field situations.
Since Petrominas did not have the benefit of legal advice from specialized
consultants, the Association decided to assist the Government during this
period, provided appropriate literature and materials, and offered comments
on the draft petroleum exploration legislation. For the same purpose, IDA
missions visited Bissau in February, April, May and June 1982.



- 10 -
3.17     Petrominas also asked for comments frcm oil companies on the draft
legal documents. Then in September 1982, following IDA's advice,
Petrominas contracted the British company Hydrocarbons Associates
Incorporated (HAI) to assist them in finalizing the Petroleum Law, in
preparing a model contract and in negotiating exploration contracts with
oil companies.
3.18     Upon reviewing the final draft of the Petroleum Law, the
Association and HAI concluded that this Law would not deter any company
interested in exploring in Guinea Bissau from entering into negotiations,
and that most of the problems raised by the new Law could be resolved by
clarifying the intent of the Law rather than changing its substance,
provided, however, that the Government would be responsive to the
industry's concerns on the proposed model contract.
3.19     The new Hydrocarbon Law was approved by the Council of Ministers
on May 25, 1982 and published in the Official Bulletin on May 31, 1982.
Main Characteristics of the Petroleum Law
3.20     The Law considers two successive exploration periods.  The initial
period lasts 5 years. The renewal is limited to 2 years, and entails a
fifty percent reduction in the size of the area originally awarded. It is
also  ,ntingent upon complete fulfillment of the minimum financial and
technical programs established in the original decree of award. Upon a
commercial discovery, a 20-year wxploitation concession may be awarded.
3.21     The Petroleum Law also specified that Petrominas must have at
least a fifty-one percent share in the production of liquid or gaseous
hydrocarbons that may be discovered. However, after preliminary
discussions with oil companies, the Government decided to leave the equity
participation open to a negotiation.
3.22     The Law's main potential problems identified by the Association
were as follows:
(a)  P.ocedures for moving from an Exploration License to a
Production Concession were not clearly established. Other
ambiguit-es include: size of exploitation concession,
continuity of exploration licence after award of an
exploitation concession, time limit on Government's delay in
awarding an exploitation concession.
(D)  The meaning of the formulated State equity participation was
not clear, and a participation wformula" had to be worked
out.
3.23     In 1985, a revision of the Law addressed these issues.  IDA and
HAI, considered that the Petroleum Law, as revised, was acceptable, and did
not need any further amendment.



- 11 -
Fiscal Regime
3.24     the fiscal system was elaborated by the Government and discussed
vith IDA. An understanding was reached on the outline of a system which
should suit Guinea Bissau's national objectives vhile preserving ample
incentives for new investors. The principal elements of the fiscal regime
are as followst
(a) Royalty: the maximum royalty on oil is 201, and is to be
established specifically in the Petroleum Exploration contracts;
(b) Income Tax: The foreign oil companies in Guinea Bissau would be
subject to corporate taxes in accordance with the Industrial Tax
Code. IDA has evaluated this tax to be about 45Z.
(c) Supplementary Tax (or Additional Profit Tax (APT)): a charge on
the after-tax net cash flow of contractors which would escalate
with contractor's rate of return on investment. The rates of the
additional profit tax would be fixed, by negotiation in each
contract.
3.25     Some companies objected to inclusion of APT in the fiscal regime,
arguing that they did not like the idea of their profit potential tapering
off as field profitability increased.
3.26     While Guinea Bissau's petroleum potential is fair to good, the
probability of a giant discovery is low. Under these conditions it may be
questioned whether the APT clause, was in Guinea Bissau's best interest,
since it may dampen the already lukewarn interest of investors.
Model Contract
3.27     This document was designed to address a few conceris of oil the
industry regarding the Petroleum Law. The model contract s?ecified that
the level of the state's equity participation was to be ag:eed with the
companies. All monies up to commercial discovery would be advanced by oil
companies. Petrominas would pay for its share of development costs and
reimburse exploration advances from its share of production. Commercial
discovery would be determined by oil companies.
3.28     The implementation of the program as entered in the petroleum
exploration contract would be governed by a Management Committee with equal
representation of Petrominas and oil companies. However, companies'
decision would prevail during exploration and appraisal periods.
Bidding Procedures
3.29     The legal framework of petroleum exploration contracts in Guinea
Bissau was presented to the oil industry in Houston, Texas on December 15,
1982, together with an announcement of the blocks being offered. During the
presentation, the Government indicated flexibility in addressing the
concerns of oil companies.



- 12 -
3.30     The deadline for submission of bids, initially set for December
31, 1981, was eventually postponed to April 30, 1983. This delay was due
to the belated publication of the Petroleum Law.
3.31     Oil companies were invited to bid on the following params:
Work program
Level of Government equity participation
Royalty
Threshold rates of return for triggering or increasing
supplementary tax rates.
Oil Companies' Activity
3.32     A bid was presentDd by a group including Elf-Aquitaine (operator),
Texaco, B.P., and Wintershall. Petrominas was assisted by H.A.I. during
the subsequent negotiations. The bid was for blocks 5 and 6, i.e., the
southern part of the area offered. Water depths in the blocks range from
less than 50 ms to more than 200 ms.
3.33     Negotiations started quickly and proceeded satisfactorily.
Eventually, a petroleum exploration contract was signed on February 9,
1984. The contract provided for an exploration period of three years,
renewable twice for two years (3,2,2), and called for the drilling of a
well within the first two years of the contract.
3.34     Contractual terms included:
-  a State equity participation percentage escalating from 252 to
50?, tied to productivity level (from less than 100,000 bopd to
more than 250,000 bopd);
a royalty, based on consortium's share of produced oil, and
escalating from 1OZ (between 0 and 75,000 bopd) to 202; and
-  a supplementary tax increasing from 202 to 30?, in proportion with
the increasing of the companies' rate of return, and in inverse
ratio to water depth.
3.35     The consortium drilled a well, wlhich bottomed at 3805 m, in
May/June 1984, at a cost of about US$9 million. Although the well was dry,
it yielded useful information on the geology of the area. In following up
these activities, PetrominAg was assisted by their exploration consultant,
A.R.L.
3.36     While four oil companies had applied for petroleum exploration
contracts in 1979. and although representatives of 35 and 32 companies had
attended the pronotion seminars on November 23, 1981 and December 15, 1982,
respectively, only one petroleum exploration contract was signed. The loss
of the oil companies' interest in Guinea Bissau was due to the combination
of the first decline of oil prices, the belated enactment of the new



- 13 -
petroleum legislation, the original requirement of 512 Guinea Bissau equity
participation in development, and the inclusion of an additional profit
tax.
Assistance to Petrominas
Institutional Organization
3.37     When the Project under review was started, a number of agencies
were involved in the energy sector: (i) the Commissariat of Natural
Resources (C.E.R.N.), later on transferred into the Ministry of Natural
Resources (MRN), which was inter alia responsible for the evaluation and
development Or hydrocarbon potential; (ii) the National Corporation for
Petroleum and Minerals (Petrominas), a state entity under the aegis of MRN,
which was inter alia in charge of petroleum and mineral exploration and
development; (iii) the Ministry of Energy and Industry (MEI),; which had
reponsibility for supervising the power subsector and the petroleum and
butane distributing companies; and (iv) the Director General of Industry
(DGI), which was responsible for the industrial sector, and included the
petroleum products distribution company DICOL and the butane distribution
company Guinegaz.
3.38     'n 1983, the firm Robert N. Nathan from Washington, was selected
to provide assistance in drawing up the statutes of Petrominas. In July
1984, Robert N. Nathan presented to the Government a set of draft statutes,
which received formal agreement from Guinea Bissau's authorities in 1986,
and led to the renaming of Petrominas into Petroguin.
3.39     Petroguin is organized as a public sector company with a certain
degree of autonomy. The Director General is appointed by the Council of
Ministers. Petroguin is controlled by a Board chaired by the Minister of
Natural Resources and Industry. The general policy of the sector
(agreements with foreign companies, annual financial planning, budgets,
etc.) is under the authority of the Minister of Natural Resources and
Industry.
3.40     This double control exercised by the Minister of Natural Resources
and Industry limits the degree of independence of Petroguin, and dilutes
its responsibilities, in particular with regard to expenses. The main
prevailing issue however, is establishing a system to ensure the financing
of Petroguin.
3.41     Upon a study of the internal organization of Petroguin, Robert N.
Nathan recommended that existing staff receive further training and
experience, in order to assume the responsibilities of the different
positions described in the organizational chart.
3.42     After Robert N. Nathan's task was over, a major reorganization
occurred in the energy sector in Guinea Bissau. The Ministry of Natural
Resources and the Ministry of Energy and Industry were merged, in August
1984, into the Ministry of Natural Resources and Industry. The latter has



- 14 -
two departments, the Department of Energy and the Department of Industry.
In addition to its former responsibilities in pe.roleum and mining, the
Ministry also covers inter alia the import and distribution of oil and gas
through the state company DICOL.
Accounting Procedure - Auditing
3.43     In September 1981, Petrominas chose the Portuguese branch of
Arthur Young to audit the accounts corresponding to work implemented under
the Project. The same company was also in charge of assisting Petrominas
in establishing a proper accounting system and in training their
accountants. Both these tasks have been implemented.
3.44     Audit reports were prepared on a very regular basis.  During the
first years of the contract, these reports evidenced some unorthodox
accounting techniques. However, the 1986 audit report gives a clean bill
of health to Petrominas accounts.
3.45     In view of the lack of experience of Petrominas' accountants, only
a basic, very simple accounting system was initially set up under the
guidance of Arthur Young. Such a system, which could not provide a
reliable control of accounts, was improved under Credit 1334-GUB, and
operates now satisfactorily.
Training
3.46     Training needs were discussed by Petrominas with the Association
starting in the summer of 1983. A few proposals were explored without
success (training with Petrobras, or at Texas University), but eventually,
in May 1984, Petrominas decided to entrust the training of its staff to a
firm specialized in training. Oil and Gas Consultants, Inc. (OGCI) of
Tulsa, Oklahoma. The one-year training program included an initial period
of training in the English language, followed by formal courses
interspersed with short-term technical courses and on-the-job training.
Three Guineans were sent by Petrominas to follow this training program with
OGCI, in early 1985. The cost of this program was high. The initial
allocation of US$80,000 for training was increased to US$145,607, which
were actually disbursed. In addition, the petroleum exploration contract
signed with Elf-Aquitaine provided an amount of US$50,000 per year for
training. Geologists and geophysicists as well as adminirtrative officers,
received training in the offices of ELF, and one geophysicist was on the
seismic boat during the ELF survey. The belated training program
implemented during 1985-1986 in the USA and in France, and on-the-job in
Guinea Bissau, was intense. Results of this program, and the needs for any
further training, have to be assessed.
3.47     Petrominas made up for the lack of experienced staff by hiring,
when necessary, foreign consultants. In order to follow the technical
activities of Elf-Aquitaine in Guinea Bissau, Petrominas thus signed an
assistance contract with the Portuguese firm Partex, which provided the



- 15 -
servLces of well-site geologists, geophysicLsts, and petroleum engLneers on
an on-call basis. Partex also assisted Petromlnas in establlshing a fillng
system.
ProvLsLon of Necessary Facilities
3.48     Absorbed in other priorities, Petrominas delayed the constructlon
of a building for office facilities until 1983. By this time the
Government, deviating from the CrediL Agreement program (which provided for
prefabricated buildings) embarked with IDA's agreement on a project for
constructlng a permanent building. Costs were sLgnficantly higher.
Petrominas declded to supplement IDA's financiztg wlth the revenue from the
sale of seismic data. In August 1983, preliminary plans for the buildlng
were submitted to the Association. Following comments from IDA and the
Government, a revised plan was presented to an IDA missblon visiting Guinea
BLssau 'n February 1984. The proposed timetable called for construction to
begln towards the end of 1984. At the date of comp! tion of the Project
under review, the construction had not yet started. The main reason for
this delay is that the Central Bank of Guinea Bissau collected and disposed
of the hard currency derived from the sales of promotional documents. In
early 1987, this issue had not yet been resolved. An amount of US$36,000
was paid under the Credit 1095-GUB, to f.nance preparation of the building
plans.
3.49     Purchase of equipment was limited to office equipment (mainly
typewriters) and vehicles. Lack of proper housing precluded the purchase
of any laboratory equipment. Total disbursements amount to approximately
US$100,000.
3.eo     Disbursements for preparation of building construction and
purchase of equipment totalled approximately US$150,000, as compared with
the intially budgeted amount of US$493,000 (or SDR410,000). As shown in
paragraph VI below (Financial Aspects and Disbursements), the remaining
funds were transferred to Category 2 of the Credit agreement,
'Consultants".

IV. Border Dispute with Senegal
4.01     rho border dispute with Senegal had been considered by IDA, during
the preparation of the Project, as the Project's only significant issue.
The Government of Senegal had obtained assistance from IDA in the
evaluation of possible petroleum reserves in the Dome Flore structure which
was situated in the disputed area. An IDA mission had also visited Guinea
Bissau to reassure the Government that the Association was not taking sides
in this dispute. The Bissau Government was satisfied with IDA's
clarifications. So far the dispute is still unsettled. The two
governments will probably agree to submit this litigation to international
arbitration. This issue, however, has not prevented two groups of oil
companies to sign petroleum exploration contracts in the northern offsnore
area of Guinea Bissau near the disputed area.

V. Comments on the Implementation of the Project
5.01     Time-wise, delays of Petrominas in tackling the training and
equipment issues, and the signature of the Elf Aquitaine contract luring
the third year of the Project, prompted IDA to grant three succesdive one-
year extensions. The Credit was formally closed on December 31, 1986.
However, the Credit amount was fully disbursed by August 21, 1985, and this
date should be considered as the completion date of the Project.
5.02     The exploration components of the Credit were implemented
according to the schedule. In spite of IDA's efforts, preparation of legal
documents took a much longer time than could be expected. Oil companies
attracted by a promotional seminar held in November 1981, could not apply
for a petroleum exploration contract before April 30, 1983. This time lag
is the main reason why, in spite of the interest shown by many oil
companies before, during and after the promotional seminar, only one group
presented a bid. The first indications of a decline of international oil
prices occurred precisely at that time. Furthermore, the Petroleum Law, as
finally promulgated, required a state equity participation of S1X in all
joint ventures.
5.03     The belated implementation of some important components of the
Project, mainly those dealing with training for Petrominas' staff and
procurement of office facilities and equipment, have left room, at the
completion date of the Project, for further IDA assistance to Guinea
Bissau.

VI. Financial Aspects and Disbursements
6.01     IDA financed all of the Project's foreign exchange requirements,
and no problem arose regarding availability of funds.
6.02     An amount of US$550,000 was granted to finance a Project
Preparation Facility, but only US$319,000 were actually disbursed. The
remaining funds were transferred to Credit 1095-GUB under a special
category.
6.03     Although the Credit was to be disbursed over a total of six years,
most of the funds were disbursed during the first three years of the
Project.  By September 1982 and September 1983 respectively, 661 and 862 of
the Credit's amount had been already disbursed. Credit fundL were totally
disbursed by August 1986, when the last invoice related to Credit 1095-GUB,
was paid with Credit 1334-GUB funds.
6.04     The following table indicates the disbursements by category, as
compared with the corresponding amounts allocated in the Credit Agreement.

6.05     The bulk of the disbursements were made to meet Atlantic
Resources' invoicing, which amounted to approximately 422 of the Credit
amount.
6.06     A breakdown of disbursements, in US dollars for companies and the
calendar year, is given as an attachment to this report.

VII. Procurement
7.01     The main Project components included:
Seismic (offshore) data acquisition (Part A.1) and data processing
(Part A.2 (a)); reprocessing of existing seismic data (Part A.2
(b)); consulting services for petroleum exploration and accounting
(Parts A.2 (c), A.3, A.4 and A.5); and provision of prefabricated
office facilities and vehicles.
(a) Seismic Data Acquisition (Part A.1)
Procurement of this component was implemented in accordance with
the provisions set forth in schedule 3 of the Credit Agreement.
Bids were invited for carrying out a 3,943 line km marine seismic
survey with the condition that the selected company would enter
into a joint venture with Petrominas, and agree to finance half of
the program (semi-speculative contract). Of the companies
invited, only three presented bids: Western (U.S.), C.G.G.
(France) and Digicon (U.K.). Digicon's offer only was in total
compliance with bidding conditions. Furthermore, Digicon had a
seismic vessel available which could undertake the survey without
delays. The contract was thus awarded to Digicon at a net cost to
Petrominas of US$1,732,796. Although processing of acquired
seismic data was recorded as a separate project component (Part
A.2 (b)) of the Project, Digicon was also entrusted with
processing of their own acquired data. For reasons of convenience
and homogeneity, as well as of cost, Digicon was also entrusted
with the reprocessing of previously acquired seismic data (Parts A
and C). Both Petrominas and IDA saw no advantage in calling for
bids for this work.
(b) Consultant's Services (Parts A.2 (c) and A3 to A5)
- Preparation of Promotion Efforts. Atlantic Resources Ltd.
(A.R.L.) was selected and contracted directly without any
preliminary call for bids, to prepare a regional petroleum
geology synthesis report, and organize petroleum exploration
seminars. Since A.R.L. was already working in Guinea Bissau at
the wake of the Project, direct contracting with A.R.L. was
expected to lead to a swift implementation of the work program,
which was a key condition to the success of the adopted
strategy. Furthermore, A.R.L.'s knowledge of the area led to
expect that they would prepare good geological reports, which
they did.
- Auditing. Petrominas selected Arthur Young of Portugal, based
on their good reputation for reporting on petroleum accounting
to audit the Project's accounts, and to assist Petrominas in



- 20 -
establishing proper accounting procedures. IDA had no
objection regarding this selection. The total amount of the
Arthur Young contract was US$147,662.
Training
7.02     Staff shortages at Petrominas, together with the workload of this
staff, made it difficult to organize any training programs. The initial
project completion date was over, and the SDR 80,000 amount provided for in
the Credit Agreement for "Training" remained untouched. Following
unsuccessful attempts by Petrominas to negotiate training contracts with
Braspetro or with Texas University, Petrominas contracted the firm OGCI,
which offered a convenient training program for Petrominas' staff,
including a crash course in English. To avoid further delays, Petrominas
hired OGCI through direct negotiations, and IDA did not object.
Institutional Improvements
7.03     Petrominas selected the consulting firm Robert Nathan to assist
with its reorganization on the basis of the firm's good performance in
similar tasks in other countries. IDA agreed with this choice. The
contract amount was slightly over US$50,000.
Legal Consultants
7.04     After long delays in preparing the legal framework for petroleum
exploration contracts, the Government finally decided to hire Mr. A.
Sahakian, of Hydrocazbon Associates of the U.K., as a consultant on legal
issues and on negotiations with oil companies. This choice was based upon
Mr. Sahakian's long experience, well known to IDA, in legal and commercial
aspects of petroleum legislations, and in negotiating with oil companies.
Prefabricated Buildings and Equipment
7.05     Petrominas was not able to implement the construction of the
prefahricated office buildings, because its attention was fully absorbed
during most of the life of the Project by technical and legal issues
related to the promotion efforts. Thereafter, Petrominas gave up the idea
of acquiring prefabricated units, on grounds that these could not stand the
Guinea Bissau tropical climate, and, upon IDA's preliminary agreement, it
decided to procure later a permanent office building, within the frame of
the 1334-GUB Credit. However, Petrominas hired the Portuguese firm ARIPA
for preparing architectural plans and bid specifications for the new
building.
7.06     Besides the payment made to ARIPA, only US$99,442 were spent on
vehicles and equipment, as compared with the US$530,000 allocated to this
category in the Credit Agreement (on the basis of an exchange rate of
SDR 1 = US$1.3). Procurec.ent was made in compliance with the Credit
Agreement provisions, on the basis of quotations from at least three
suppliers.

VIII. Performance of Consultants
(a) Legal
8.01     Hydrocarbon Associates Incorporated (RAI) demonstrated an
excellent performance in assisting the Government and Petrominas in the
preparation of the Petroleum Law and other legal documents, and in
negotiating with oil companies.
(b) Auditing
8.02     Arthur Young prepared good audit reports, and identified a few
accounting operations not conforming with generally accepted accounting
practice in Petrominas' accounts. However, as this consulting firm
assisted Petrominas in the establishment and enhancements of its accounting
system, anI in the training of its accountants, Petroguin's accounting
process is now quite reliable.
(c) Management and Organization
8.03     Aside from preparing the By-laws and Statute of Petroguin, Robert
N. Nathan identified correctly the weak points within the organization of
the Guinean Agency, and made appropriate recommendations which led to
setting up the present organization of Petroguin. However, the
corresponding staffing of Petroguin is not yet completed.
(d) Exploration
8.04     The consulting firm produced a technically sound evaluative report
on Guirea Bissau's hydrocarbon potential and the staff it assigned to this
task did an overall good job. No significant delays did occur. However,
according to both Petroguin and Arthur Young, the firm's performance on
financial matters was much less satisfactory (e.g. expenses generally
exceeded budgeted amounts, without having obtained previous approval of
Petrominas). More generally, the firm did not always abide by the
provisions of the consultant's contract. The firm's invoices were not
always adequately supported. The firm's behavior led to a misunderstanding
between Petrominas and the firm. IDA's attempt to end the dispute aroused
momentarily Petrominas' suspicion that IDA was supporting the firm.



- 22 -
IX. IDA Performance
9.01     IDA participated actively in ensuring that the exploration
components of the Project were implemented in accordance with state-of-the-
art technology, and on schedule. Agreed modifications to the technical
work program of the Project (such as increase in seismic data acquisition,
and in seismic lines reprocessing) were beneficial to the country,
resulting in an increased geological knowledge of Guinea Bissau's
sedimentary basins. IDA's role was also decisive in promoting the
enactment of a new petroleum legislation by the Government. However, IDA
did not pay sufficient attention either to the consulting firm's financial
behaviour, nor to Petrominas' accounts, and relied too heavily on
the consulting firm's recommendations. It should be noted that Petrominas
took about 18 months to appoint auditing consultants (Arthur D. Young).
IDA's lax initial supervision on these issues can be attributed to the need
to concentrate on technical matters, and particularly in assisting
Petrominas in the review of the Petroleum Law and contractural issues.



- 23 -
X. Borrower Performance
10.1     Petrominas performed a good job in getting the exploration
activities off the ground. However, their decision to draft legal
documents without outside assistance resulted in a long delay before the
Petroleum Law was published. This was in turn the main reason for the lack
or loss of enthusiasm of the oil industry with regard to the April 1982
call for bids.
10.2     The other components of the Project, ?articularly the
establishment of reliable accounting procedures, implementation of a
comprehensive training program for Petrominas' staff, and the construction
of an office building, suffered from the concentration of Petrominas on
exploration and legal efforts.
10.3     Finally, relations between IDA and the Borrower were generally
good, however, the Borrower consistently failed to answer promptly IDA's
communications during the entire life of the Project.
Project 1334-GUB
10.4     As was mentioned in paragraph 3.12 the retommendation was made to
extend the second round of promotion into shallow water areas. The cost of
the seismic survey considered in these shallow water areas exceeded the
remaining available funds under Credit 1095-GUB, and for this reason a new
Project Agreement was prepared, and signed on March 29, 1983, with the
effective date being June 14, 1983. As a result of this, two Projects,
1095-GUB and 1334-GUB, co-existed during three years and a half.
Discrimination between operations implemented and disbursements made under
the two projects is not always possible. Furthermore, as the funds under
the 1334-GUB Credit are nearly totally comr,itted, the conclusions of the
present review, regarding Guinea Bissau's further needs for IDA's
assistance, will still be applicable once Credit 1334-GUB is completed.



- 24 -
XI. Conclusions and Recommendations
11.1     The initial petroleum strategy adopted by the Government, under
the consulting firm's insistence that an assessment of the hydrocarbons
potential of the country be prepared before starting negotiations with oil
companies, was jeopardized by the belated approval of the Petroleum Laf.
The sixteen month gap between the first petroleum exploration promotional
seminar, and the opening of the bidding period, acted as a deterrent
towards attracting the oil companies. The first indications of a decline
in international oil prices contributed in dampening the initial interest
of the oil companies. Another deterrrent was the Government's error of
including in the new Petroleum Law the requirement of a 512 state equity
participation.
11.2     Under these circumstances, it may be considered as a success that
one group of companies, led by Elf, signed a petroleum exploration
contract, and drilled a wel.. Furthermore, following the second round of
petroleum exploration promotional seminars financed under the second
Project, another oil company, Shell Pecten, is negotiating a new contract,
including drilling commitments.
11.3     The geological knowledge of the country has been greatly enhanced.
Thus, although not even mentioned as a possible target in the initial
report by the consulting firm, the Paleozic prospects emerged from the
firm's studies as one of the most attractive conceptual plays in Guinea
Bissau.
11.4     Exclusive concentration of Petrominas on exploration promotion
activities, and then on revising the Petroleum Legislation led the national
Agency to neglect other components of the Project. These were mainly
institution building aspects regarding corporate management and financial
planning, accounting systems, management of technical affairs and training.
11.5     I'i May 1987, a mission visited Bissau to review the results of
both projects 1095-GUB and 1334-GUB, and to identify Petroguin's needs for
further assistance from IDA. Although the impact of the two petroleum
projects was fruitful for Guinea Bissau, much remains to be done. Areas
where IDA could be of further assistance to Guinea Bissau were identified.
TTpon discussions with officials of Petroguin, the components of a possible
new technical assistance were identified.
11.6     Judging from the history of the project under review, it is
evident that the initial lack of experience of Petrominas in petroleum
affairs reduced the benefits that this national agency could have otherwise
drawn from IDA's financial assistance. In retrospective, the hiring of an



- 25 -
experienced resident exploration advisor, independent from the consulting
firms and contractors involved in the implementation of the Project, would
have enhanced the initial situation of Petrominas in terms of negotiations
with contractors, preparation of a new petroleum law, etc.
11.7     This conclusion is probably valid for similar projects in other
LDCs, provided that the selected resident advisor has the experience and
qualifications to make a valuable contribution in the process of know-how
transferring and develop a team-spirit with the local agency personnel.
