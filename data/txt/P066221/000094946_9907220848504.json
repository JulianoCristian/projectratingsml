(MSOEs), as well as, the emergency\n            economic disruption, due to the conflict in Kosovo. Within\n            the strategic context, the project will support the\n            completion of enterprises privatization, and, will focus on\n            poverty alleviation and human capital development, by\n            targeting social assistance programs, and, upgrading social\n            services. The main project components will include: 1) labor\n            restructuring, to be financed through severance payments -\n            regulated by law - for those workers displaced by bankruptcy\n            or MSOEs' restructuring. In addition, social\n            monitoring, will ensure needed social services are met.\n            Limited assistance will be provided to develop employment\n            services; 2) labor redeployment, which will facilitate those\n            workers who, were either displaced due to labor\n            restructuring or the conflict in Kosovo, or, are long-term\n            unemployed, or first time job seekers, into the labor force.\n            An administrative framework will be established, enabling\n            government agencies to provide organizational services, as\n            needed, for redeployment issues; 3) social benefits, to\n            improve social programs effectiveness, and, develop\n            institutional capacity, to evaluate social protection and\n            labor market programs; and, 4) project management, to ensure\n            an effective administration."}, "docdt": "1999-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
