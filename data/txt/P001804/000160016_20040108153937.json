follows: the project outcome is satisfactory, the\n            project's sustainability is likely, the institutional\n            development impact is substantial, and the Bank and Borrower\n            performance are both satisfactory. These are some of the\n            lessons extrapolated from this project:  A Successful\n            post-conflict transitional model: The project's\n            relatively large size of investment, number of donors, and\n            number of contracts and the relative weak institutional\n            capacity puts it in the category of complex projects. Yet,\n            the success of the Mozambican experience under the ROCS\n            project confirmed the validity of the hypothesis on which\n            the project was initially conceived --that flexible overall\n            design, phased investment plans and annual project reviews\n            can lead to effective outcome even under weak institutional\n            environment, provided the project design incorporates\n            technical assistance, training and supervision, and up-front\n            policy reform to manage the risks. This view was shared by\n            other donors. The approach helped mobilize significant share\n            of the needed resources and helped remove the transport\n            bottleneck with significant positive impact on post-conflict\n            reconstruction of Mozambique. 2) The Road Fund Dilemma: On\n            one hand there was a resource need and on the other hand\n            there was a resource gap due to the cap imposed on road fund\n            revenues. As a lead agency, IDA's response played a\n            critical role in harmonizing the competing demands of the\n            donors and helped the government meet its international\n            commitments.  Flexibility with respect to conditionality\n            constraints, particularly in a post-conflict society, is\n            critical to bridge resource gaps during the transitional\n            adjustment period, and the conflicting demands of\n            international development agencies. 3) Social orientation of\n            the project: Though mitigating measures for HIV/AIDS was not\n            included in the original design, the supervision team\n            together with the Borrower addressed social issues by\n            including an HIV/AIDS component, piloted in one subproject\n            area and expanded it to all subprojects. This experiment -\n            16 - has led to social clauses, which oblige contractors for\n            the welfare and protection of their workers, particularly,\n            from the spread of HIV/AIDS. In addition, supervision has\n            led to improvement in the mechanisms of monitoring and\n            evaluating the social and economic impact of the project.\n            Such proactive stance of supervision team need to be\n            encouraged and such team should be recognized for its\n            innovative approaches. 4) Appropriate engineering planning\n            and design:  The flexibility of the project design allowed\n            to quickly respond to the urgent needs for road repair\n            following floods. However, unless for emergency operation,\n            it is preferable to approach the road sector and road works\n            with a systematic approach with appropriate detailed design\n            prior to starting works."}, "docdt": "2003-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
