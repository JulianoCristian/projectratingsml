TH4AILAND
APPRAISAL OF THTRD BANGKOK PORT PROJECT
SUD-§AIY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project which would increase capacity and
efficiency at the port of Bangkok. This medium-sized, deep-water port, at
the mouth of the Chao Phraya river, is the largest in Thailand and handles
95% of the country's imports and 80% of its exports; traffic at KNong Toi,
the main wharves, is expected to increase from 2.3 million tons in 1969 to
3.25 million tons in 1975. About 1,900 ships now use the port each year.
ii.       In recent years traffic growth resulted in congestion which, in
1967, was so severe that surcharges were placed on freight rates by the
shipping conference lines serving the port. For the six months they were
in force they cost Thailand's economy about US$4 million in added foreign
exchange costs. Through improved productivity some modest investments in
mechanization and other measures, the immediate congestion problems were
alleviated and the surcharges removed. However, increasing traffic is
causing congestion to recur and, unless a major expansion of the port's
berthing capacity takes place, not only is the re-imposition of surcharges
likely but Thailand's development objectives will be jeopardized.
iii.      The project consists of the construction of four deep-water
berths, two lighterage berths, two transit sheds and consultants' and
expert assistance in various fields of port management and operations.
Total costs are estimated at US$21.0 million equivalent, of which the
proposed loan would cover the foreign exchange component - US$12.5 million.
The project is based on a feasibility study made by the Consultants (NEDECO)
for the Port Authority of Thailand (PAT). PAT will be responsible for the
execution of the project.
iv.       Detailed economic evaluation of the proposed project (involving
the use of a simulation model) shows an expected return in excess of 20%
and indicates that the project is properly sized.
v.        Work. and procurement procedures on two previous port loans were
satisfactory1' The Bank's international competitive bidding procedures
would apply to this project. Work is exDected to take about four years
and be completed in December 1973.
vi.       The port is administered by PAT under the jurisdiction of the
Ministries of Finance and Communications. It is reasonably well-managed
and financially viable. In order to improve productivity and to permit
1/
37-TH, US$4.4 million equivalent in 1950.
151-7H, US$3.4 million equivalent in 1956.



better use of existing and future port assets, PAT has agreed to engage
management consultants to study the feasibility of adopting a multiple
shift system for cargo handling and other related port operations. S.teps
will be taken in agreement with the Bank to implement the consultants'
recommendations not later than January 1, 1972.
vii.      In order to maintain a strong financial position and secure an
adequate contribution towards future port development, PAT has agreed that
tariffs will be reasonably related to costs, that the financial rate of
return on net fixed assets in use will be not less than 8% p.a. and that
long-term debt will not be incurred unless net cash revenue is and will
remain at least 1 3/4 times the maximum debt service requirements.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$12.5
million to PAT over 20 years including a four-year grace period. Substan-
tial issues on which agreement has been reached during negotiations are
listed in Chapter 7.



APPRAISAL OF THIRD BANGKOK PORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Port Authority of Thailand (PAT) has requested Bank assist-
ance in financing a project to expand and improve port facilities at
Bangkok. PAT had originally proposed a project comprising construction
of six deep-water and two lighterage berths and ancillary facilities,
equipment, and reaLignment of the bar channel. This project is part of
PAT's development program estimated to cost 0 1,195 million over the next
five years. As a result of the Bank's evaluation,including a simulation
of expected port requirements, the project has been scaled down to consist
of the construction of four deep-water berths, two lighterage berths, two
transit sheds and ancillary works. It also includes consultants' and
expert assistance for project engineering, construction supervision and
various aspects of port management and operations.
1.02      The estimated cost of the project is about US$21.0 million and
the proposed loan of US$12.5 million would meet the estimated foreign ex-
change component.
1.03      The Banlk has previously made two port loans for the Port of
Bangkok.  The first (37-TH) in 1950, for US$4.4 million was for dredging
the bar charnel and purchasing rails, equipment, cranes, a tugboat and
navigation aids; it was fully disbursed by 1955. The second (l1l-TH), in
1956, for US$3.4 million was for purchasing two hopper dredgers and a clam-
shell dredger, and was fully disbursed in 1958. Work and procurement under
both loans was satisfactory, although dredging performance has since
deteriorated.
1.04      Seven other transport loans have been made to Thailand:  three
railway loans and four highway loans; they are described in Annex 1.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of a Bank appraisal mission
consisting of Messrs. T. M. Malkani (Engineer), L. Y. Pouliquen (Economist)
and K. C. Rodley (Financial Analyst) in October 1969. Mrs. Comer (Program-
mer/Analyst) prepared the simulation model used in the economic evaluation.

2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Thailand (Map 1), with an area of about 510,000 km 2, is roughly
the size of France. Its main coastline is on the Gulf of Thailand to the
south; however, the southern isthmus also borders on the Indian Ocean.
The population of 36.5 million is increasing rapidly at about 3.3% annually;
although generally well distributed there is concentration in the central
lowland plains of the Chao Phraya river, especially around Bangkok, the
capital. With a population of 2.8 million, Bangkok is the main comer-
cial and industrial center.  Other towns are relatively small.
2.02      GDP at 1969 market prices is estimated at US$6.0 billion equi-
valent.  During 1964-1968, both population and economic growth were rapid,
the latter averaging 8% per annum. Slow agricultural development was more
than compensated by the rapid expansion of industry, construotion and
mining which averaged 12% annually. Both exports and imports increased
about 14% per annum. Per capita GNP increased by 25%, reaching about
US$145 equivalent in 1969.
2.03      Immediate future prospects are less favorablsi. There are in-
dications of an economic slowdown due to the possibility of sizeable
reductions in U.S. military spending. During 1971-1975 the export growth
rate is expected to decline to an average of about 4% annually which,
despite an average import rate of only 6% annually will result in an in-
creasing trade deficit. The economy is expected to grow at a rate of
about 6% to 7% annually over the next five years.
B. The Transport Sector
2.04      The main transport arteries run from north to south, following
the direction of most mountain ranges and rivers, with a lateral network
of secondary roads, canals, waterways, etc., feeding into them.;. Most
urban centers are in the lower central region while food groirLng areas
are mainly along rivers and canals, usually north of this region. The
Chao Phraya is the most important river; it also extends from north to
south in the central plain. The headwaters from the catchment areas of
its four main feeder rivers, Ping, Wang, Yom and Nan, lie in hilly north-
ern Thailand.
Highways
2.05      The major road network radiates from Bangkok. The Department
of Highways (under the Ministry of National Development) is responsible
for administration, construction and maintenance of the national highway
network and main feeder roads. Although primary and secondary paved high-
ways now total over 6,000 kmm, major improvements are needed to carry the



- 3 -
increasing traffic resulting from the country's rapid economic develop-
ment. The Government's seven-year investment program (1965-1971) con-
tains nearly US$400 million for the construction or reconstruction of
4,500 km of roads, including a few four-lane roads and the paving of
3,100 km of existing roads.  The Bank highway loans constitute an inte-
gras part of this program (Annex l).
Air Transport
2.06      The Don Maung airport in Bangkok is the international airport
serving Thailand, and 26 international air carriers provide service. It
is a strategically located transit hub for international airlines serv-
ing all Asia. Some improvements are being made to the airport but in
view of the increase in traffic, further expansion of facilities is being
considered. Thai Airways International provides international services
to neighboring countries using medium range jets, and Thai Airways pro-
vides domestic services to a network of internal airports using smaller
aircraft.
Railways
2.07       The State Railway controls over 3,700 km of efficient and
viable railways, also radiating from Bangkok. In 1968, about 5.5 mil-
lion tons were carried by rail. A five-year investment program (1967-
1971) for purchase of rolling stock, relaying of lines, etc., estimated
to cost US$90 million, with a foreign exchange requirement of approximate-
ly US$41 million, is being carried out.
Inland Waterways
2.08      An extensive inland waterways system of 1,600 km is widely used
by both cargo and passenger traffic. These rivers and canals serve a farm
population of 9 to 10 million in the central plain and carry over half the
10 million ton rice crop. In 1968, over eight million tons of building
sand moved over the system. Considerable quantities of teak for export
are floated in rafts to Bangkok.
2.09      Despite wide use of the waterways, the Government has made little
effort to develop them and inadequate attention and poor maintenance have
frequently resulted in decreasing navigational depths. The potential of
the waterways has been considered in the transport coordination study
mentioned below (para. 2.11).
Ports
2.10      Thailand has some 22 ports. Bangkok is the largest and, ex-
cluding crude oil handles about 95,) of the country's imports, about 2.6
million tons, and 80/, of its exports, about five million tons.  Crude oil
is imported at Srirneha, some 100 km southeast of Bangkok.  I'ext is
Settahip, a five-berth deep-water port with an oil jetty, built by the U.S.



- 4 -
in 1965-66 and located about 170 km south of Bangkok, on the east of the
Gulf of Thailand. Sattahip is Thai property but presently utilized ex-
clusively for discharging U.S. military cargo. It handles about one million
tons annually, mostly in container form. The next three ports, in order of
importance, are Songkla, on the west of the Gulf of Thailand, and Kantang
and Phuket on the Andaman Sea. These ports are fairly specialized and their
traffic, mostly exports, is independent of Bangkok's.  Songkla, the second
largest commercial port, handles about 250,000 tons of cargo annually and,
together with Kantang, most of the rubber production.  Phuket, the country's
third deep-water port handles all refined tin production. The remaining
sixteen ports are coastal with relatively shallow channels. NEDECO is
presently making a feasibility study for the development of a new deep-water
port at Laem Krabang on the east of the Gulf of Thailand about 120 km from
Bangkok (paras. 3.16-3 .18).
Transport Coordination
2.11      The recent rapid development of the transport sector prompted the
Bank to advise the Government to undertake a transport coordination study.
It was carried out by Wilbur Smith and Associates/Lyon Associates, with
USAID financing and in close cooperation with the Bank. The study was to
provide guidelines for: (i) establishing an appropriate coordinating or-
ganization which would inter alia, prepare investment programs for the
various transport modes; and (ii) improving regulation of transport activi-
ties. The October 1969 draft final report, reviewed within the Bank and
USAID, identified the following major transport coordination problems:
(i) faulty pricing policy in road and rail transport; (ii) inefficiency
and high costs resulting from ETO's (the Government-owned Express Transport
Organization) monopoly position in the trucking industry, particularly for
pick-up services from railway stations and Bangkok port;  and  (iii) the
need to centralize transport planning services. The Bank and USAID have
suggested ways of improving the report and a new draft is being prepared.
However, nothing in the report affects the conclusions of this appraisal.

3. THE PORT OF BANGKOK
A. Present and Future Organization and Administration
3.01      In 1951, as a condition of Loan 37-TH, PAT was established as
an autonomous organization to take over administration of the New Harbour,
which consists of the Klong Toi wharves and other riparian areas of the
Chao Phraya river. PAT handles all port operations; it also dredges and
maintains the navigation channel of the river fram Memorial Bridge to the
sea, including the bar channel (Map 2). Unless special customs exemptions
are obtained, all import cargoes must, by law, be discharged at Klong Toi
wharves. The Harbour Department, also under the Ministry of Communications,
controls pilotage, which is compulsory for vessels of 500 tons or more,
from the entrance of the bar channel.
3.02      PAT is directly responsible to the Ministries of Communications
and Finance. Its annual capital budget is subject to the approval of the
Council of Ministers. It is managed by a Board of Commissioners consisting
of a Chairman, a Director and nine members. Of the members, seven are
senior Government officials and two are Army officers.   The Director, also
an Armyofficer, who until recently was a part-time port off icial has now
been appointed full-time and has two full-time Deputy Directors. Chiefs
of various service and operational departments assist in carrying out port
functions.
3.03      Port management is reasonably satisfactory.  In order to give
port users representation on PAT's Board of Commissioners, the Government
agreed during negotiations to appoint at least one person with extensive
experience in commercial management to the Board.
Accounting System
3.04      PAT's general accounting system is good. However, the costing
system needs updating and PAT requires assistance in establishing a modern
costing section to revise rates and introduce a more effective form of
budgetary cost control. During negotiations, PAT agreed to engage an
accounting expert for this purpose under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank.
B. Port Facilities
3.05      The bar channel to Bangkok port is dredged to 8.5 m and to a width
of 100 m. With a mean tidal range of 1.54 m the maximum draft of vessels
that can cross the bar channel is limited to 8.5 m (i.e. 10,000 to 12,000 dwt
vessels). The navigational channel in the river is dredged from 8.5 to U1.S m.
The tortuou  narrow navigational channel bars entry of ships longer than
172 m (565 ft) and draft restrictions are imposed for ships longer than 145 m
(476 ft).



- 6 -
3.o6      Bangkok port facilities stretch along some 47 km of the Chao Phraya
river. l4ost of the facilities are between 26 and 47 km upstream from the
Gulf of Thailand but somae wharves and anchorages are situated closer to the
mouth of the river (Map 2). The main deep-water facilities, and the loca-
tion of the proposed project, are the Klong Toi wharves, which are controlled
by PAT and extend betwieen 26.5 km and 28.5 km from the mouth. These wharves
consist of 10 berths of a total length of 1,660 m with a dredged depth of
11.0 m. Other port facilities, not under PAT jurisdiction, include 82 private
and public wharves, landing places and finger piers along a considerable
distance of the river and 33 midstream anchorages and moorings at different
locations. Opposite Klong Toi wharves, PAT proposes constructing 36 mid-
stream dolphins which are expected to be ccmpleted by the end of 1971.
Further details of Bangkok port, facilities, floating craft, and plant are
given in Annex 2.
C.  Transport Connections to the Port
3.07      Bangkok is located at the center of the country's various transport
networks.  The main networks used by the port are roads for imports and
waterways for exports; use of the rail system is limited because most imports
are either consumed in the Bangkok area or redistributed from there.  Direct
transfer of cargo from ship to rail is infrequent. Cargo landed on the Klong
Toi wharves is usually brought into covered warehouses or to open storage
spaces and later removed by road. A small amount of cargo for Laos is taken
to the Laos transport shed from the berths for transshipment to Laos.
3.08      The port and the Chao Phraya river have good access to the inland
waterway system. Much agricultural produce is brought by country craft and
shipped for export. Similarly, import cargo is discharged overside into
lighters or small cargo boats. This mode of transport is relatively important.
3.09      Road access to Klong Toi and other wharves is poor.  The long-term
aspects of urban transport are of particular importance to port development.
With the centers of trade and commerce progressively moving toward the out-
skirts of the city, port traffic will have to travel increasingly through
the entire city mainly by truck. The main connecting road to Klong Toi is
being improved and widened and construction of a second road has just
started; the increased traffic handled at Klong Toi should not therefore
cause congestion above tolerable limits. During negotiations Government
agreement was obtained to the proper maintenance of roads outside PAT's
jurisdiction necessary for the efficient operation of the port facilities
and also to the ccmpletion of an additional access road to the port by not
later than December 31, 1973.
3.10      However, Bangkok's urban transport problem remains of serious con-
cern to the Government which created an interninisterial committee in July
1969 to study it. At the Governmentts request, a Bank mission on urban
transport visited Thailand in November 1969 and recommended that a comprehen-
sive urban transport study be undertaken (possibly with UNMDP financing).

D. Operations
3.11      Use of cargo-handling equipment is not satisfactory due to oversupply
and inefficient use. Semi-portal cranes are recorded as working an average oif
only six hours per day each but, in fact, they are rarely used as ship's gear
is preferred; forklift trucks work eight hours each per day, but they are
often idle because drivers are unavailable (para. 3.12); mobile crane opera-
tional hours are also low at five hours per day; tractors and trucks are some-
what better, at seven and thirteen hours respectively. Apart from the cranes,
other vehicles combined carry about J  tons of cargo per hour. Vehicle uti-
lization is low, as indicated by the figures for September 1969 below:
Type of Vehicle   No.        Number Utilized    % of Utilization
Forklift Trucks    215            166                   77

As 332 vehicles out of the total 404 are less than four years old (most are
only one or two years old), considerable improvement should be possible.
Better supervision and control is necessary and this is likely to be achieved
with the introduction of a two-shift, and later a limited three-shift systeya,
for all categories of personnel.
Labor
3.12      The wharf labor force of about 800 men works an eight-hour  day shift.
About 40% renains in the port throughout the night, one half working, the
other half resting alternately. All night hours earn overtime pay and
are followed by a 24-hour off-duty period.  This is a long standing arrange-
ment. The inefficiency of this system was pointed out by NEDECO in a 1965
report, by an ECAFE team in 1965 and by a Government Port Adviser in 1968.
Each of these studies advocated radical changes in the organization of port
labor. It is considered that introduction of a two-shift system could
increase labor productivity by 25-30%. In Singapore where wharf labor worlPd
a similar extended one-shift system, introduction of a two-shift system in
1964 improved gang productivity by 28%: a limited third-shift system was
introduced in 1967.  The present system at Bangkok is costly to the economy
and should be capable of being improved. During negotiations PAT agreed to
employ management consultants acceptable to the Banrk, to study the feasibili ',
of adapting PAT's present cargo-handling methods to a multiple shift system.
PAT further agreed to take the necessary steps to implement the consultants'
recommendations in consultation with the Bank not later than January 1, 1972.
3.13      Ship labor is obtained through private stevedoring companies anad
the shipowners' agents consider that the present level of competition results
in satisfactory cargo-handling at reasonable cost.
3. 4     Relations between employers and enployees in the port are generpl-j
good. There are no labor unions in Thailendd.



Dredging
3.15      Due to inefficient dredging operations and poor dredger mainte-
nance by PAT's Marine Department, the bar channel has not been maintained
to proper depths, width and alignment. Until a few years ago, dredging
was done by the existing port dredgers under a contract and the channel
was maintained to designed dimensions. Dredging output over the bar
channel decreased steadily since dredging reverted to a departmental
responsibility. It is essential that dredging operations be more effec-
tively carried out with the existing dredgers by adopting modern techniques
and increasing the dredgers' operational availability by improved maintenance.
PAT agreed during negotiations to employ a qualified and experienced dredg-
ing expert for this purpose under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank.
E. Future Development
3.16      Both long and short-term goals should be considered when planning
future port development. In the long term, the entrance channel to the
Bangkok port is a serious limitation to port growth, as it can only accommo-
date ships of 8.5 m maximum draft (10,000 to 12,000 tons) and vessels cannot
pass each other. It takes about four hours to negotiate the channel to the
Klong Toi wharves and, depending on the tide, waiting periods can be sub-
stantial. The number and size of ships calling at Bangkok is therefore
limited. In view of the excessive investment as well as maintenance costs
involved no appreciable improvement of depths in the channel is practical.
As the country's economy grows, a new port with access to deeper water wil
be required on the Gulf of Thailand to obtain the beneZits of using larger
ships. However, such a port would not replace but supplement Bangkok, which
is expected to continue as the country's main port and commercial center for
at least another two decades. Medium-sized ships will continue in service
for many years and it will take time for the pattern of trade to shift to
a port such as Sattahip which is presently used only for military traffic
or a new port at Laem Krabang which is now being studied. In the short
term, an immediate need to increase port capacity at Bangkok exists, as
shown by the economic analysis in Chapter 4.
3.17      The Government, in November 1968, appointed NEDECO to study
long term port development requirements in Thailand. In an interim
report of May 1969, NEDECO compared the following three alternatives:
(a) all future expansion and construction of berths
to be at Bangkok;
(b) extension of berths at Bangkok in combination
with ccnstruction of a new deep-water port at
Laem Krabang; and
(c) extension of berths at Bangkok in combination
with the existing deep-water port at Sattahip.



- 9 -
3.18      NEDECO's economic analysis indicates the need for serious consider-
ation of the development of a second deep-water port in Thailand, and favors
Laem Krabang over Sattahip. This choice seems to undervalue the potential
of the existing facilities at Sattahip and underestimates the total invest-
ment required for development at Laem Krabang. In addition, the traffic
growth projected by NEDECO appears too optimistic and the level of port
congestion resulting from each alternative is based on over-simplified
assumptions. The analysis leading to NEDECO's choice should therefore be
reviewed. During negotiations the Government agreed to consult with the
Bank before proceeding with any further major port development and to review
all reports prepared by consultants on the location and construction of port
facilities in consultation with the Bank.

4. ECoNoCmc EVALUATION
A. Introduction
4.01     Expansion of Bangkok port is urgent. Surcharges from 10% to 15%
were imposed by the maritime conference in 1967 because of congestion at
the port. These surcharges (Table 1) cost Thailand almost $4 million during
the six peak months of 1967. Various short-term measures were taken to
ease congestion: more use was made of private facilities, more cargo was
handled in the stream, more handling equipment was purchased and quay
maintenance was deferred. By early 1968, congestion was reduced and the
surcharges had gradually been removed.
4.02     The measures taken had added no actual physical capacitv
and, although most military traffic is now handled away from Bangkok, the
total traffic has reached the 1967 level. The traffic growth expected,
or even a change in shipst arrival patterns, could easily recreate the
1967 congestion levels. The ever-present threat of congestion and of
surcharges remains and port expansion is urgently required to reduce
congestion and cargo-handling costs to reasonable limits.
B. Traffic
4.03     In 1969- , approximately 1,900 general cargo vessels called at
Bangkok. Of the 2.6 million tons of general import cargo, largely high-
value machinery and equipment, 2,260,000 tons were handled at the Klong
Toi wharves. About 150,000 tons were diverted to private wharves and
190,000 tons were unloaded at midstream anchorages because of congestion.
Import traffic growth at Bangkok port is shown in Chart 1. To remove
the distortion in traffic growth patterns caused by the buildup of U.S.
military activities in Southeast Asia in 1965, a growth trend was
arrived at, based on imports from 1951 to 1965. Statistical analysis
indicates that over the 1951-1965 period, import tonnages grew steadily
at about 6% per annum.
4.04     After a rapid increase in 1965 and 1966, import traffic tonnage
remained almost constant from 1967 to 1969. In view of the scaling down
of U.S. military activity in Southeast Asia and Thailand's increasing
trade deficit and resulting balance of payments problem, the present
import trade slowdown is expected to last until 1973, with traffic ex-
pected to grow at only about 2.5% per annum. After 1973, traffic is
assumed to attain its pre-1965 growth rate of 6%. W4hile these forecast
growth rates are based on past and present trends, they are tentative.
For the economic evaluation, an analysis was carried out utilizing traffic
growth rates ranging between 1% and 5% for the slowdown period which, it was
assumed, may end as early as 1971 or as late as 1975. After the levelling
off, a growth rate ranging between 5% and 8% was used. The probability of
various import traffic patterns within this range is given in Annex 3.
l/Unless otherwise stated, years used in the economic evaluation and in the
related annexes, tables and charts are fiscal years (Oct. 1 - Sept. 30).



- 11 -
4.05    Transit traffic to Laos, which amounted to 52,000 tons in 1969, is
of minor importance and has been assumed to continue growing at its past
trend of 8% per annum, to a maximum of 80,000 tons.
4.06      Exports from Bangkok amounted to five million tons in 1969.  The
bllk of this cargo consisted of rice and tapioca, exported ex-lighter in the
stream, and maize, exported from silos. Because most exports are well adaptei
to lighterage operations their bulk will probably continue to be handled in
the stream or from privately-owned silos. The export cargo loaded at the
Klong Toi wharves, for the most part livestock, wood and general cargo,
amounted to only 33,000 tons. However, in view of the effort to diversify
exports, the volume to be handled at Klong Toi will probably increase rapidly.
For this evaluation, exports have been assumed to grow at a yearly rate of l!.
No attempt has been made to refine this estimate because of its low sensitivi:Jy#
C. Methodology
4.07      Although the urgency of expanding Bangkok port or the necessity no;
diverting traffic is clear, the size, timing and choice among expansion alter-
natives is less straightforward. This evaluation considered four alternati.v3t
I  - A minimum investment which would provide additional
lighterage to meet traffic growth.
II  - A project which would provide two deep-water berths
and two lighterage berths.
III  - A project which would provide four deep-water berths
and two lighterage berths.
IV  - A project which would provide six deep-water berths
and two lighterage berths.
A choice among these alternatives requires an accurate evaluation of the con-
gestion costs associated with  each of them.  At Bangkok, evaluation of this
cost was complicated by the possibility of traffic diversion from the deep-
water berths at Klong Toi to the midstream lighterage facilities and/or
private wharves. This complication necessitated the use of a simulation
model. The model used is similar to that developed for the East African Port
Project appraisal (Report PTR 8a, June 9, 1969).
4,o8      The analysis was further complicated by the uncertainty of some of
the elements of the problem, such as the growth rate of imports mentioned above
and the proposed two-shift system for labor. The time required to introduce
the shift system, as well as the impact it will have on labor productivity,
is difficult to determine. These uncertainties will greatly affect port
capacity.
4.09      There are a number of sources of uncertainty on other parameters
(kAiex 3). The most important is the possibility that the military port of
Sattahip, now used by the U.S. military, will be turned over to the Tha.



- 12 -
Government and possibly transferred to commercial use. This possibility has
been ruled out in the immediate future since the U.S. is still using the
port and a Thai Cabinet decision provides that, should the port be released,
it would be transferred to the Thai military and not be available for com-
mercial use. This decision, however, may be reviewed within the Govern-
ment. Should congestion increase again at Bangkok, the military would
certainly be under pressure to transfer Sattahip to commercial use since
military usage cannot justify the need for a port of this size. Should
the transfer to commercial use occur, traffic patterns would be considerably
changed and a sizeable amount of traff_.c would be diverted to Sattahip.
1.10       In view of these uncertainties, the economic evaluation has
been made within a probability framework. In practice, the cost/benefit
probability analysis and the port operations have been carried out
simultaneously in a combined simulation. The model is described in some
detail in Annex 4.
D. Economic Analysis
4.11       The traffic projections discussed in paras. 4.03-4.05 qpply to
the port of Bangkok as a whole. The amount of import traffic which will
actually use Klong Toi wharves is a function of port investments, improve-
ment in port operations, and the availability of Sattahip port. The
simulation takes these factors into account and the results show the traffic
which will utilize Klong Toi wharves under varying circumstances (Table 2).
4.12       Briefly, the model selects random values for each of the varia-
bles which have been assigned a probability distribution, then proceeds
with a detailed analysis of port events and operations, such as ship
arrivals, ship assignment to berths, and cargo-handling. The resulting
data, such as ship-waiting time or tonnage handled, are consolidated on a
yearly basis and the cost of each year of port operation is computed.
This cost includes ship time cost and cargo-handling cost as well as the
port investment. In cases where the port of Sattahip has been used, the
cost of transporting the cargo to Bangkok is included. Each year from
1.973 through 1980, the simulation is repeated for each one of the four
investment alternatives.
4.13       The output of the model for each simulation is therefore four
streams of total yearly costs, one for each alternative. On the basis
of these streams of undiscounted yearly costs, it is possible, given
an opportunity cost of capital which is also selected randomly, to
compute a cumulative present cost up to any given year. Table 3 gives
the average values of the yearly undiscounted costs obtained in the 75
simulations carried out and Table 4 gives the average value of the corres-
ponding cumulative present cost up to any given year. The stream of net
benefits corresponding to each of the project alternatives have been
expressed as the difference between the cost stream of the minimum in-
vestment alternative, and the cost stream of the project alternative under
consideration.



- 13 -
4 -14    As noted earlier, the simulation horizon in the economic analysis
has been limited to 1980. After 1980 the benefits resulting from the
project have been assumed to remain constant. There are at least to
reasons for doing this.  ti) By 1980, new investconta mill be required
to accommodate the additional traffic.  Because the simulation does not
include these investments or the savings to be derived from them (not
yet fully analyzed), the "with" and "withouttt costs to the econoVy would
then be unrealistically high. The benefits resulting from such an exercise
would be inaccurate and, in addition, would not reflect the actual economic
justification of the project. (ii) By 1980, the bar channel may well
become a bottleneck in further port expansion at Bangkok. Thus, there is
the possibility that after this date, any additional traffic will be
diverted to a second port.
4.15     The cost/benefit analysis considers fully the possibility of
Sattahip's availability as a function of the level of port congestion.
The final result is a weighted combination of cases in which the port
becomes available and cases in which it does not. Clearly, the probability
of the port's availability varies with the alternative tested. In the
case of two berths, congestion rises rapidly and the probability assigned
to a transfer to coimnercial use by 1980 is about 70%. In the case of
six berths, congestion remains low and the probability of a transfer by
1980 is found to be less than 15% (Table 5).
E. Project Size and Timing
14.16    In carrying out a comparison between alternatives, the total
costs to the economy (investment cost and handling cost and ship time in
port cost) of each alternative were used rather than computing rates of
return on incremental investment costs.
4.17     Tab'e 4 indicates that over the coming 25 years, the expected
present value of the costs to the economy of Alternative III is about $15
million lower than Alternative II. Chart 2 indicates that in the center
part of the range of possible outcomes, the four-berth alternative (III)
considerably reduces the probability that a given total present value cost
will be exceeded. In addition, the two deep-water berth alternative (II)
yields a fairly large probability that total port costs will reach a level
greatly exceeding the expected value. The four-berth alternative (III)
therefore, is preferable to the two-berth alternative (II).
4.18     Table 4 and Chart 2 also indicate that over the next 25-year
period, six berths (IV) would cost less than four berths (III). However,
proceeding immediately with the construction of six deep-water berths would
be premature.   As Table 3 shows, the expected additional investment of
$5.9 million necessary to go from four to six berths would yield an expected
first year saving of only US$0.37 million or about 6% of the investment
cost. Since the opportunity cost of capital is assumed to be about 12%,
these US$5.9 million invested elsewhere in the Thai economy would yiold about



- 14 -
US$0.70 million return. In effect, it appears that given the present level
of information, the two additional berths would not be justified, on the
average, before 1977. The savings resulting from this two-year postpone-
ment would more than offset the additional cost incurred in project con-
struction in two phases and considerably reduce its uncertainty.
4.19       Using the same argument, the US$5.5 million expected additional
investment required to go from two to four deep-water berths yields an
expected first year saving of US$0.61 millicn, which for an cppo;tunity cost
of capital of 12g is about equivalent to what the US$5.5 million would yield
if invested elsewhere in the economy. It is therefore justified to proceed
immediately with construction of four deep-wxater berths (Alternative III).
4.20       Construction of four deep-water and two lighterage berths
(Alternative III) therefore appears to be the optimum investment size at
this time and forms the basis of the proposed project.  This alternative
has a high rate of return averaging about 20%. As Chart 3 shows, the
rate of return varies within a wide range but there is an 80% probability
that it will remain between 14% and 28%.
F. Conclusion
4.21       Construction of four deep-water berths and two lighterage berths
is found to be the best port investment to solve Thailand's immediate port
expansion requirements, yielding a rate of return of about 20% over 20 years.
Further expansion may, however, be required in the late seventies.
4.22       An additional conclusion of the cost/benefit analysis is the
rapid payback period of the project. Table 6 shows that, on the average
(which in this particular case is the same as the best estimate), for an
opportunity cost of capital between 10% and 14%, according to the probability
distribution of Annex 3, the investment cost would be paid back in eight
years, i.e., in 1981. Even under the extreme assumption that the investment
is not used after 1981, it would therefore still, on the average, be
economically justified. This constitutes a further justification for
limiting the simulation to 1980, and, more important, confirms that the
project is acceptable as a short-term investment (para 3.16). The economic
justification is therefore quite independent of the possibility of a
second deep-water port being made available or constructed since, by the
time this port is ready for use (say in 1979), the project would, on the
average, be almost fully paid back (Table 4).

5. THO PROJECT
A. Description (Map 3)
5.01      As a result of the preceeding evaluation, the project should con-
sist of four deep-water and two lighterage berths to be located downstream of
the existing Klong Toi wharves. The deep-water berths would each be about
18 m long with a depth alongside of 8.5 m; the lighterage berths would each
be about 100 m long with a depth alongside of 3 m. The berths would be
equipped with two transit sheds and ancillary facilities. The project also
includes (i) consultants, services for detailed engineering and supervision
of construction; (ii) expert assistance for dredging operations and cost
accounting; and (iii) the services of management consultants for the improve-
ment of cargo-handling operations. The project is part of PAT's five-year
development program (l970-1975).
B. Cost Estimate and Financing
5.02      The total estimated cost of the project is 0 436.8 million (US$21
million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$12.5 million
equivalent. A summary of the estimate follows and details are given in

is about 60% of the total estimated cost. PAT will provide local currency
co3ts of the project.



- 16 -
5.03      In addition to expenditures on the proposed project, PAT plans an
expenditure of I 479 million on  Capital works such as offices, staff quarters,
sheds, extension and improvement of port roads, cargo-handling equipment and
harbor craft as part of its five-year (1970-1975) development program. PAT
will meet these expenditures from its own resources.
C. Procurement
5.04      Tender documents for engineering work have been prepared and bids
will shortly be invited from prequalified bidders. Contracts for construc-
tion and supply will be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. PAT will be responsible for
execution of the project.
D. Disbursement
5.05      Construction is expected to start by October 1970, the beginning of
PAT's fiscal year, and the project should be comapleted by December 1973.
However, two deep-water berths and two lighterage berths should be ready for
use by January-February 1973. Disbursements will be made on the basis of
actual payments made to contractors, consultants and experts. Assuming loan
effectiveness at the end of August 1970, estimated expenditures are:

No retroactive financing will be necessary.  Any surplus funds available on
completion of the project will be cancelled.
h, Engineering Consultants' Services and Assistance by Experts
5.o6      During negotiations PAT agreed to retain engineering consultants
acceptable to the Bank for detailed project engineering and work supervision
during construction.
5.07      The services of a dredging expert are required to help PAT apply
modern dredging techniques. The expert will also make recommendations for
an improved system of dredger maintenance in order to keep the equipment in
an efficient state of repair (para. 3.15).



- 17 -
5.o8      An accounting expert is required to assist PAT's Accounts Depart-
ment in improving its costing system, introducing adequate budgetary control
and revising the tariff structure and rates so as to base them reasonably on
the cost of services rendered (para. 3.04).
5.09      Management consultants are required to study the feasibility of
adopting a multi-shift labor system so as to improve efficiency and pro-
ductivity of cargo-handling and related port operations.
F. Construction Schedule
5.10      NEDECO has recommended extension of the Klong Toi wharves in three
stages of two deep-water berths each so that the facilities can be used as
soon as they are constructed. The tender documents were prepared accordingly.
Completion of the first two stages of the work, which forms the project, is
expected some three years from the date of commencement.
G. Other Investments
5.11      In addition to the investment programs described in paras. 5.02 aind
5.03 PAT's development program over the next five years includes further
capital expenditures amounting to over X 264 million for items such as re-
aligment of the bar channel, construction of a further two berths at Klong
Toi and the procurement of a floating crane and a dredger. These items are
premature and not presently justified. During negotiations assurances were
obtained from PAT that no expenditure wiUl be incurred on such large capital
works, or procurement, without Bank agreement.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Rates and Charges
6.01      PAT's rates (Annex 5) have remained virtually unaltered during the
past 10 years.  Compared with the port of Singapore, these rates are generallY
high, particularly as basic labor rates of pay are lower in Thailand. Vir-
tually all exports leave Bangkok via private wharvesg or river anchorages. 'io
choice is given for imports as, with few exceptions, unloading at PAT's
wharves is mandatory.
6.02      There is no statutory requirement as to adequacy of the rates and
charges. PAT is empowered to fix rates provided they are between the maxi-
mum and minimum determined by the Council of Ministers. The Council's
directive, now in force, permits variance of up to 25% from the existing
level.
6.03      Because of PATts inadequate costing system (para. 3.04) some rateF
are unrealistic. During negotiations PAT gave an undertaking that its tariff
structure and rates would be revised to be reasonably based on costs.
B. E arnings
6.04      Details of revenue and expenses for fiscal 1965 to 1969 inclusive
are shown in Table 8. Although traffic remained static during the last
three years of this period, expenses increased and revenue declined. A 15%
pay rise in 1968 for wharf labor and substantial increases in personnel
raised labor costs. Additional transit sheds and open storage areas were
constructed and mechanical equipment purchased; consequently depreciation
and operating costs rose. This improvement of port facilities increased
the speed of cargo handling and reduced overtime and certain revenues
decreased because of the shorter time spent by vessels alongside wharves.
6.05      PAT's operating revenues for fiscal 1969 totalled % 248 million
and operating expenses including depreciation were $ 165 million, giving
a net operating revenue of $ 83 million and an operating ratio of 67% which
is satisfactory. Interest expense was negligible at 0 0.8 million. Total
debt service amounting to 0 6.8 million was covered 18 times. The return
of net operating revenue to net fixed assets in use was high at 18.5%.
6.o6      Financial forecasts of earnings are based upon traffic projections
contained in Table 2 and on PAT's current rates and charges. Detailed forc-
casts to 1975 are given in Table 8 (Revenue and Expense Accounts), Table 9
(Cash Flow) and Table 10 (Pro Forma Balance Sheets). The bases and assump-
tions used in the financial projections are given in Annex 6. Operational

6.07      Between fiscal 1969 and 1975 operating revenues and expenses are
expected to increase by about 46% and 62% respectively, the steeper rise of
the latter being largely due to anticipated increases in wages; also the
heavy capital investment program will cause depreciation expense to rise by
84%. Consequently, although net operating revenue is expected to increase
slightly each year from 82.7 million in 1969 to 0 93.9 million in 1975 the
operating ratio will increase from 67% to 74% and the rate of return on net
fixed assets decrease to about 7.6%. A great deal will depend upon the
results of introducing two and limited three-shift working on the wharves.
To handle the increased cargo up to 1975 and adequately man the increases
in shifts, some labor recruitment will be necessary. This, coupled with
increases in rates of pay during the period is expected to raise labor
costs by 43/a. The increased shift, however, together with improved methods
and supervision of working, should raise labor productivity by some 30% and
this benefit has been taken into account in estimating the extent of increases
in the labor force. If present working methods, low mobile equipment utiliza-
tion and labor productivity levels continue, by 1975 the cost of wharfinger
operations per ton of cargo could be expected to rise by over 40% whereas
the rise should not exceed 19% if the improvements suggested in paras. 3.11
and 3.12 are carried out. It is also important that a sound costin7g system
be installed as soon as possible to provide adequate control over costs and
a reliable basis for the continuing review of port rates (para. 3.04).

C. Finances
6.08      The current financial position of PAT is sound (Tables 9 and 10).
At September 30, 1969, fixed assets, after providing for adequate depre-ia-
tion, totalled 0 663 million and cash in hand, at banks and with the Govern-
ment amounted to 0 304 million. Long-term debts were low at 0 30.3 million
of which $ 10.1 million is outstanding from two previous IERD loans. The
remainder is Development Loan Fund finance. The debt/equity ratio was 3/9?.
Fixed Assets values are reasonab3y realistic.
6.o9      During the fiscal period 1970 to 1975, interest and debt service
coverage will be ample. The debt/equity ratios are good, the highest being
18/82 in 1973 and 1974 thereafter improving to 16/84 in 1975 when repayment
of the proposed loan comaences.  A sumnary of PAT's pro forma balance sheets
during the period is given below:

6.11      During this period the total cash available is not expected to fall
below 0 106 million, which is adequate.
6.12      The PAT Act, 1951, as amended, provides the Thai Government con-
siderable latitude in determining the extent to which PAT surplus funds are to
be paid over to the Thai Treasury. Current practice is for PAT to transfer tc
the Government 25% of its annual net revenue, after allowing for loan interest;
assuming this continues during the period 1970 to 1975 such payments will range
between 0 24.9 million and g 18.7 million annually. PAT's annual capital
expenditure and its power to borrow money are subject to Council of Mirnisters'
approval. Annual operating budgets are submitted for the Council's inforzniaion
only.  Should PAT's revenue be insufficient to meet operating expenses, depre-
ciation and bonus, and should PAT be unable to obtain funds from other sowrces,
the deficiency shall be met by the State.  Contingency and expansion reserve
requirements are however, expressly excluded from this State commitmeiit in tha
Act.



- 22 -
6.13      During negotiations PAT undertook to achieve a financial rate of
return on net fixed assets in use equal to not less than 8% p.a. and not to
incur long-term debt unless net cash revenue is and will remain at least
1 3/4 times the maximum debt service requirements.
6.14      It was also agreed during negotiations that PAT will continue to
maintain adequate insurance cover on its assets for such risks and amounts as
are consistent with good commercial practice.

7. RECOMEfDATTONS
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
The Ooven2ment agreed
(a) to appoint at least one person with experience in a
commercial management capacity to PAT's Board (para. 3.03);
(b) to maintain the access roads to the port and to constn-uct
an additional access road not later than December 31, 1973
(para. 3.09);
(c) to consult with the Bank before undertaking further major
port development and to review all consultants' reports
on the location and construction of port facilities in
ccnsultation with the Bank (para. 3.18);
PAT Agreed
(d) to appoint an accounting expert (paras. 3.04 and 5.08);
management consultants (paras. 3.12 and 5.09); and a
dredging expert (paras. 3.15 and 5.07);
(e) to retain consultants for engineering and supervision
of ccnstruction (para. 5.06);
(f) not to incur capital expenditure on large capital
works or procurement without Bank agreement (para. 5.11);
(g) to establish new rates and charges based upon costs
(para. 6.03); and
(h) to achieve an adequate financial rate of return and
to limit debt service comnitments.(para. 6.13).
7.02      The proposed project cnstitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
Loan of US$12.5 million equivalent to PAT for a period of 20 years,
including a four-year grace period.

Bangkok Port Facilities
Bangkok port facilities consist of 92 wharves, landing places,
and finger piers, extending over a considerable distance along the river.
In addition, there are 33 midstream anchorages and mooring buoys at
different locations in the river (Mlap 2).
The most important facilities are the Klong Toi wharves, com-
prising ten berths of a total length of 1,660 m and related water areas
in front of these wharves are under the control of and operated by PAT.
The limits of the port are from Memorial Bridge to the pilot
vessel at the entrance of the Bangkok bar, a distance of 66 km.
During recent years PAT has considerably increased its cargo
storage capacity and improved roads inside and leading to the port area.
The present covered and open storage areas are:
Open Storage Areas               91,900 m2
Nine      Transit sheds                     37,300 m2
Three     Back-up transit sheds             47,400 m2
One       Three-story warehouse              7,400 m2
Ten       Single-story warehouse            12,700 m 2
One       In-transit warehouse               4,000 m2
One       Military warehouse                 4,000 m2
One       Dangerous cargo shed                 800 m2
Total             205,500 m2
This provides 66 m  of shed and open storage per linear meter of wharf-
age which is considered more than adequate for present traffic.
The roads within the port area are in good condition and are
spacious enough to provide good traffic access in the future.

varying from 1.5 tons to 23 tons, four survey boats, two water and oil
barges, three mud barges, four hopper-suction dredgers, one clarmhell
dredger, one bucket dredger and seven river launches.
Two floating cranes, each of 125 tons lifting capacity, owned
by private companies are available in Bangkok.
There are 526 lighters with cargo carrying capacity ranging
from 20 to 370 tons, owned and operated by 58 private companies in
Bangkok.
There are four dry docks in Bangkok, two cwned by the Bangkok
Dock Company. One is capable of accommodating ships up to 110 m long
and the other, ships of up to 100 m. The other two, owned by the Bang
Thai Company are capable of accommodating ships up to 50 m and 38 m in
length, respectively.

APPRAISAL OF TT-URD BATTGKOK PORT PROJECT
Simulation Model
1.        The simulation model comprises two parts: the port simulation proper
and the cost analysis. The former simulates the berthing of ships and their
unloading at nlong Toi wharves as well as imports at private wharves or in
the stream. It indicates ship waiting time, berthing time and place. These
indications are then fed into the cost analysis part of the model. The simu-
lation is repeated for the first 8 years of the project life and for the four
alternatives studied. In the following, "simulation'? will mean a complete
set of simulations for the eight years and the four project alternatives.
This simulation is repeated many times to yield an estimate of probability
distribution of the internal rate of return, payback period and present value
cost of the project. Following are details on the model, the data and the
operation of the modele
The Model
2.        The port simulation proper is divided into three steps.  The genera-
tion of ship arrivals, the assignments of ships to a berthing place, and the
loading and unloading of ships.
3.        The generation of ship arrivals is at random according to a pattern
of arrivals derived from a statistical analysis of the port's data. The ship
arrival calendar is generated yearly; the same arrivals are used for all four
alternatives. The ships are then assigned tonnages, again at random, according
to observed distributions. Because of the low volume of exports, no distinc-
tion has been made between imports and exports. The total tonnages handled
annually are determined at random according to the probability distribution
of the growth rate described in Annex 3. Finally the ships' draft is selected
also according to a probability distribution function of the total yearly
tonnage and the total number of ships.
4.        The next step consists of looking for an empty berth.  If there is
no berth at Knong Toi, the model is programmed to look for a private berth
compatible with the ship's size or, if none is available, for a mooring point
where the ship could be discharged by lighter. If there is no berth or moor-
ing point available, the ship must take its turn on a waiting list, which may
or may not have other ships already waiting. The next event may be either a
new ship arrival or a ship departure. In the case of a ship departure, a
berth (or lighterage point) becomes available and, in due course, is ready to
receive a new ship from the waiting list. In the cases where Sattahip is
available, ships are preassigned to either Bangkok or Sattahip. In addition
in this case, when waiting time at Bangkok exceeds a maximum admissable
level, ships are diverted to Sat'ahip.



AINNEX 4
Page 2
5.        Ship unloading is a function only of berth characteristics (sur-
prisingly, port statistics show no correlation between weather and unloading
rates). Each berth and lighterage point is assigned a certain productivity
of labor for loading and unloading, representing the number of tons of cargo
that a gang can handle in one hour.  Multiplied by the average number of
gangs working simultaneously on a ship, labor productivity gives the handling
rate or the average number of tons of cargo which can be loaded or unloaded
in one hour. Given the cargo tonnage to be unloaded, the handling rate leads
to the time necessary to unload each ship and, therefore, the time at which
the ship will be able to depart.
6.        A critical element of the above computation is labor productivity.
It is assumed that introducing a shift system at the Nlong Toi wharves would
result in improved productivity within a few years. At the beginning of each
simulation we therefore drew a random figure for productivity increase and
one for the number of years required to reach this productivity increase
according to the distribution of Annex 3. We then make a linear extrapola-
tion of the value of productivity during the transitory period corresponding
to the introduction of the shift system.
7.        Another critical element is whether or not Sattahip will be released
for commercial use. This will depend mainly on the congestion level at
Bangkok. At the end of each year, average ship waiting time at Bangkok is
computed and the release of Sattahip during the following year is determined
on a random basis according to a probability which is a function of current
average waiting time. Once Sattahip has been released it remains available
from then on. The release date of the port varies with average waiting time
and therefore, with the alternative under consideration. If Sattahip is
released, the model evaluates the percentage of the traffic it can absorb.
Since the port is simple this is done in an approximative manner by assuming
an acceptable berth occupancy factor corresponding to the number of berths
at the port. Finally, in order to avoid infinite waiting time in the event
the port is not expanded, it is assumed that, if berth occupancy of the
facilities existing at Bangkok exceeds 95%, and lighterage berth occupancy
exceeds 75%, and, if relevant, berth occupancy at Sattahip exceeds 65%,d
sufficient additional lighterage facilities would be provided to insure that
the above berth occupancy is not exceeded. These berth occupancy factors
have been derived by trial and error in such a manner as to keep waiting time
within reasonable limits.
8.        The costing part of the model is simple.  First, all the costs to
which a probability distribution is attached are selected randomly (Annex 3).
The investment costs are introduced in the cost streams in the appropriate
investment year. Total cargo-handling cost is then camputed, for each year,
on the basis of cargo tonnage handled at each location (a by-product of the
ship assignment explained in paragraph 4). Ship waiting-time cost is also
computed and introduced in the cost streams. Since the time the ship spends
in the berth is a function of the berthing place, the corresponding ship cost
is also computed and introduced in the cost streams. Finally, in the event
Sattahip becomes available, the cost of transporting cargo to Bangkok is
also taken into consideration.



ANNEX h
Page 3
Outputs
9.        The outputs of each simulation are therefore a stream of costs for
each project alternative. Each of these sets of cost streams is the result
of a particular hypothesis as to the release of Sattahip, a particular invest-
ment cost, a particular traffic growth pattern, a particular ship day cost,
and a particular cargo-handling cost; the present value computation is done
using a particular opportunity cost capital. Finally, the pattern of arrival
and the ship load distribution is a particular one for each year of the
simulation. In addition, the model provides other information, in particular
on ship waiting time, which is useful in following port behavior under any
particular sets of circumstances.
10.       The consolidated output of each simulation yields the probability
distribution of each of the decision variables. The means of some of these
variables are given in Table 2 through Table 6. The standard error as well
as full probability distribution of each one of them is not given in this
report but is also available.
Basic Data
11.       Most of the basic data used in the simulation has been derived
from analysis of detailed port statistics. The principal elements of the
simulation, the pattern of arrivals and the tonnages carried by each ship,
have been analyzed by classic statistical analysis using the chi-square test,
It was found statistically acceptable to assume that arrivals were following
a Poisson distribution and that both tonnages followed a third order Erlang
distributionY17 These hypotheses have, therefore, been adopted throughout
the simulation, The distribution of maximum ship draft was found norrmial
with a mean closely related to the total number of ships and the total tonnage
handled.
12,       The hypothesis concerning gang productivity and the gang application
factor were derived by analyzing detailed port records of ship movements and
labor deployment during 1969. The time between a ship's departure and the
beginning of work on the next ship has been set at two hours, in accordance
with information provided by the port authority. The number of ships serviced
in any year which, under normal circumstances would be assumed at random
about constant, has been kept growing at half the rate of the tonnage growth
to account for the draft limitation in the bar channel. Traffic growth has
been determined according to the forecast in Chapter 4 which is based partly
on statistical analysis of the historical traffic trend.

Operation of the MTodel
13.       The first step in operating the model was its adjustment.. 1967 and
1968 data were used for this purpose and the model was calibrated to agree
with the historical results. The major element of comparison was ship waiting
time which, because of its high sensitivity, constitutes an excellent check
point; another element was the ratio between the total tonnage handled at
the Klong Toi berths, the private berths and that handled by lighterage.
This calibration is somewhat complicated because, with the same data and the
same probability distribution of arrival and ship loads, the total yearly
waiting time produced by the simulation varied over a very wide range; this
reflects different patterns of arrivals and ship loads within the distribution.
In practice, the expected waiting time obtained at the end of the calibration
was somewhat lower than that observed in 1967 and 1968 but well within the
range of what can be expected. Since most data was derived from port stati-
stics, the calibration involved slight variations in labor productivity,
the gang application factor at private wharves and in the stream and limita-
tion of the use of private wharves.
14.       Once the model was calibrated it was used for the simulation proper.
As a compromise between computer time requirements and the need to obtain
statistically meaningful results, the analysis was carried out on a sample
consisting of 75 simulations. This should be sufficient to insure reasonable
accuracy if the expected costs and an acceptable accuracy of the standard
deviation. It is too small a sample to insure good accuracy on the entire
probability distributions of Charts 2 and 3.  However, the accuracy of Chart
3 is sufficient to support our conclusions and should the curves of Chart 2
vary with a larger sample they would all vary in the same direction and,
as our conclusions are based on the distance between them, they would not be
affected.
15.       In order to limit the amount of computer time, the simulation was
run only for five months each year. As a result, the waiting time statistics
for each year correspond to about 31 years of simulation.

2.   That the following major items, currently included in PAT's capital
expenditure program, will not be undertaken during fiscal years 1970 to 1975:

a)  Realignment of Bar Channel                 99.0
b)  Floating Crane                             4 .0
c)  Dredger                                   10.0
3.   That no  expenditure will occur before September 30, 1975 on the construction
of berths for PAT other than the four deep water and two lighterage berths
provided for in the project.
4.  That PAT will continue to appropriate to the Government of Thailand 25% of
its revenue surplus after payment of loan interest.
5. That interest will be earned on cash surpluses at 5% per annum.
6.   That a Bank loan will be made to PAT of US$12.5 million equivalent at 7%
per annum for a period of 20 years including four years' grace.
7.   That introducing two and limited three-shift working and improving super-
vision and operational methods on the wharves will raise labor productivity by
30% between fiscal 1970 and 1975 and this benefit has been taken into account
in estimating the extent of increases in the labor force.
8.   Provision has been made for a possible 10% wage and salary increase for
clerical and administrative staff during 1970 and a further general increase
of 10% to all PAT employees in 1974.
S. Financial forecasts of earnings are based upon PAT's current rates and
charges and it is assumed that during fiscal 1970 to 1975 any rate adjustments
consequent upon a review and relation to costs will not reduce the overall
level of the rate structure.
