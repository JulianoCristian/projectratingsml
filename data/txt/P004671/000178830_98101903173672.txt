REPORT AND RECOTSF1ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
PORT AUTHORITY OF THAILAND (PAT) 1,1TH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE KINGDOH OF THAILAND
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in various currencies equivalent to $12.5 million to the Port Authority
of Thailand, to be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The Bank has made two loans for port development.   The first,
37-TH in 1950, was for 4h.4 million and has been fully repaid; the second,
151-TH in 1956, was for $3.4 million and will be fully repaid by August 15,
1971. Both projects were carried out satisfactorily.
3.       The Port Authority of Thailand (PAT) which would be the borrower
of the proposed loan, was established as an autonomous organization in
1951 as a condition of the first port loan, to administer the port of
Bangkok at Klong Toi on the Chao Phraya River.
4.       Negotiations were held in ,ashington from June 22 to 26.
The Government was represented by H.E. Sunthorn Hongladarorn, the Ambassa-
dor of Thu.;land in Washington and Dr. Sirilak Chandrangsu, Under Secretary
of State for Communications; PAT was represented by Captain Lapo Israngkura,
Deputy Director (Operations).
5.       The proposed loan would be the twenty-second loan in Thailand
and woruld incrc-l.se the total amount lent to $370.9 million net of can-

6.        Disbursement of Loan No. l71-TH (Vocational Education Pro-
ject) was delayed by slowness in appointing consultants under bilateral
aid, but good progress is being made. Construction of the Sirikit (Phasom)
Dam (Loan No. 51h-TH) was somewhat delayed because of unfavorable geologi-
cal conditions at site, and the need to redesign somes features of the
project. Satisfactory progress, however, is now being made. Otherwise,
the implementation of Bank-financed projects is progressing satisfactorily.
7.        A project to expand and improve the facilities of Kasetsart
(Agricultiral) University has recently been prepared for Bank appraisal,
and is expected to be ready for consideration by the Executive Directors
before the end of FY 1971. A proposed second loan to the Industrial
Finance Corporation of Thailand will be submitted for Executive Directors,
consideration in the early months of FY 1972.
8.        No IDA credits have been made to Thailand.  IFC has invested
$193,000 in shares of the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand and
in 1969 made a loan of $18 million to, and an equity investment of $4.1
million in, the Siam Cement Group of companies.

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Third Bangkok Port
Project Thailand" (PTR-46) dated July 13, 1970, is attached.
11.       The port of Bangkok is the largest of Thailandts 22 ports,
and except for crude oil, handles 95% of the country's imports and
80% of its exports.  Crude oil is imported at Sriracha, about 100 mn
southeast of Bangkok. Military cargo, mostly in container form, is
imported at Sattahip about 170 km southeast of Bangkok. The Port
Authority of Thailand is entrusted with the administration of the port
of Bangkok at Klong Toi, and is responsible for dredging and maintain-
ing the navigation channel from Bangkok to the Gulf of Thailand. PAT
is an autonomous Government organization responsible to the Ministries
of Finance and Communications, and its capital budget is subject to
the approval of the Cabinet. It is managed by a Board of Commissioners
and a full time director. The Government has agreed to appoint a
Commissioner from the commercial sector to the Board. PAT is well able
to carry out the project, and has agreed to retain cosmultants to assist
it in areas where such help would be useful.
12.       Between 1951 and 1965, import tonnages at Klong Toi grew at
an annual rate of about 6% per year. Between 1965 and 1967, there was
a rapid increase in tonnage handled, but it has since remained almost
constant. It is projected that traffic will grow at about 2.5% per
year until 1973, and then attain its pre-1965 growth rate of about 6%.
The port of Bangkok also handles imports to Laos, which amounted to
52,000 tons in 1969, and which are expected to increase at an annual
rate of 8%.
13.       Exports from Bangkok consisting mostly of rice and other
agricultural products, amounted to five million tons in 1969, handled
by lighters in the rivers or from silos. Export cargo loaded from the
port wharves amounted to only 33,000 tons and consisted mostly of live-
stock, wood and general cargo. It has been assumed that exports will
increase at an annual rate of 15% for some time to come.
14.       The expansion of Bangkok is urgently required. Because of
congestion at the port, the shipping lines serving the port imposed
surcharges in 1967 which cost Thailand almost $h million in the six
peak months of 1967 alone. Various short-term measures were taken to
reduce congestion, and by 1968, the surcharges had gradually been
removed. None of the measures taken, however, added any physical
capacity to the port. At present traffic has again reached the 1967
level even though military traffic has been diverted to the port of
Sattahip on the Gulf of Thailand.



15.       During the Thai fiscal year ending September 30, 1969, about
1,900 general cargo vessels called ati Bangkok and discharged some
2,260,000 tons of cargo, most of which was handled at the Klong Toi
wharves.  However, because of congestion some 150,000 tons were diverted
to private wharves on the Chao Phraya River and another 190,000 tons
were unloaded at midstream anchorages, into lighters.
16.       The proposed project forms part of PAT's development program
for 1970-1975, and consists of the construction of four deep-water berths
and two lighterage berths, two transit sheds and ancillary works; tech-
nical assistance of experts in dredging and in accounting; and consult-
ants' services for engineering and supervision during construction and
for a review of PAT's cargo handling methods. The total estinated cost
of the project is about Z21 million, of which the proposed loan of $12.5
million would cover the foreign exchange component, estimated at 60% of
total costs. In addition to the proposed project, PAT plans expenditures
totalling about X23 million on such items as the improvement of roads
within the port, extension of sheds, the purchase of cargo handling equip-
ment and harbor craft, offices and staff quarters.
17.       Construction of four deep-water berths and two lighterage
berths, with ancillary facilities, will solve Thailand's immediate port
expansion requirements. PAT had originally requested financing for a
project comlprising six deep-water berths and related facilities. The
Bank's appraisal revealed that at this stage construction of four
deep-water berths was the most economical alternative. PAT has agreed
to employ management consultants to undertake a study of cargo handling
methods with a view to increasing the productivity of wharf labor. Better
cargo handling methods are likely to result in an increasein-productivity
which would achieve about the same benefit as having two additional deep-
water berths, wzithout incurring the cost of their construction at this
time. Further expansion may, however, be required in the late 1970's,
cpending upon the growth of traffic at Klong Toi and on port development
schemes elsewhere in Thailand now under consideration by the Government.
18.       Being a river port, Klong Toi is dependent on the maintenance
of an unobstructed channel in the Chao Phraya River for access to the
Gulf of Thailand. Heavy monsoon rains cause siltation in the river, and
constant dredging is required to maintain a navigable channel. PAT has
agreed to employ a dredging expert to assist it in improving dredging
operations.
19.       PAT also agreed to employ an accounting expert to assist it
in improving accounting procedures, with particular reference to improv-
ing its cost accounting system. An effective cost accounting system will
enable PAT to levy charges in line with the cost of the services it
provides.
20.       PAT's financial position is sound, and its debt/equity ratio
is satisfactory. PAT, which is authorized to set rates within ranges
determined by the Council of Ilinisters, has agreed to take such action
as may be necessary to maintain a rate of return of not less than 8% on
the net value of fixed assets in operation. For purposes of debt control,



- 6 -
PAT agreed that it would not incur any debt unless its net cash revenue
for a given 12-month period was at least one and three quarters times the
maximum debt service requirement in any succeeding fiscal year. At present,
PAT has no other requests for loans pending, and its debt/equity ratio
will be 18/82 in 1973 and 197h, thereafter improving to 16/84 when repay-
ments of the proposed loan begin. In practice, the proposed debt control
measures would cause PAT no difficulty in borrowing additional funds
within reasonable limits.
21.       Contracts for construction and supply will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guide-
lines.
22.       The project is expected to yield an internal rate of return
of about 20%.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIJENTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Port Autho-
rity of Thailand, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom
of Thailand and the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in
Article 3, Section )! (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
2h.       The draft Loan Agreement and the draft Guarantee Agreement
follow the general pattern of recent agreements for port projects.
PART V - THE ECONOIIY
25.       A report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Thailand" (EAP-la) was distributed to the Executive Directors on February
12, 1969, and a Basic Data sheet is attached as an Annex. A Bank econo-
mic mission visited Thailand in February, 1970, and its report will be
distributed to the Executive Directors about August 15, 1970.
26.       During the 1960's the country experienced a high rate of
economic growth; substantial increases in export prices and a high level
of U.S. expenditures in Thailand, especially after 1965, stimulated rapid
development. A dynamic private sector, aided by a rapid growth of foreign
private investment, contributed to economic growth. The year 1969 marked
the beginning of a transition phase as for the first time U.S. expendi-
tures began to decline and export prices fell. During the years of ample
foreign exchange receipts, imports were allowed to grow rapidly and this
growth continued in 1969. As a consequence, foreign exchange reserves
declined by about $50 million, or about 6 percent, in 1969 after a conti-
nual increase ever since 1958.  As of December 31, 1969, they still
amounted to some $87 million, equivalent to 72 months imports.



- 7 -
27.       The rapid growth of the Thai economy, combined with liberal access
to foreign exchange provided the basis for monetary stability in recent
years. Price increases were modest and credit could expand with relatively
little restriction. Substantial deficits in the government budget could
be financed in part by an expansion of the money supply without endanger-
ing economic stability. The emergence of a balance of payments problem
in 1969 has reduced the scope for expansionary financing in the public
sector, because of its undesirable effects on import demand. Substantial
further increases in government expenditures can, therefore, only be justi-
fied if they are matched by increased public sector revenues.
28.       The Government of Thailand recognizes the need to act on a wide
front in order to cope with the problems it now faces. Measures to
increase government revenues have been introduced effective July 1, 1970.
Substantial increases in import duties and other indirect taxes on im-
ported consumer goods of a non-essential nature will not only improve
the budgetary position but also curb import demand. For the coming years,
the Government recognizes the need to give the highest priority to the
promotion of exports and specific measures are now being prepared to in-
crease the country's foreign exchange earnings. These measures will
include the promotion of the production of exportable goods and services;
fiscal and price supports to producers of exportables, improvement of
marketing, transport and storage facilities for these commodities, and
revisions in the system of tax rebates to expor Brs. The impact of these
measures will probably not be felt forsome time;  if in the immediate
future further reductions of import demand are required, the Government
is resolved to take restraining measures of an indirect nature and to resort
to quantitative controls only in exceptional circumstances.
29.       The current Second Five-Year Plan wrill come to an end in September
1971. The Government is now drafting the Third Five-Year Plan (1971-1976).
A change in development strategy is contemplated, which would shift the
emphasis from the construction of new irrigation works to intensification
of agriculture, especially in areas where irrigation facilities have been
constructed in past years. The Government recognizes that this will have
an impact on investment programs in several other sectors, especially
power, transport and industry. At the same time the new investment program
will concentrate on promotion of exports and of industries which depend
less heavily on imported raw materials than has been the case in recent
years. Effective implementation of the new development strategy requires
the preparation of projects of a different kind than have been prepared and
implemented in the past. Pre-investment studies must be initiated in
order to generate such projects in sufficient quantity in time before the new
Plan begins to be implemented.
30.       In view of the favorable conditions under which the economy of
Thailand has operated during the past years, the Government has not been
under much pressure to deal promptly and effectively with economic problems
and to adopt and implement appropriate policies. In fact, the coordination
of activities among the many different departments in the public sector
has been far from adequate, and will require substantial improvement if the
new Plan strategy is to be implemented effectively. I have drawn the
Government's attention to this problem and understand that it is now in
the process of creating coordinating machinery which in due course may
be expected to improve its capacity to adopt and implement the policies



- 8 -
demanded by the more difficult situation in which Thailand now finds
itself.
31.       The main finding of the recent economic mission, with which the
Government of Thailand concurs, is that substantial balance of payments
problems will remain during the next few years. M4easures to promote
exports, and to curb import demand, cannot be expected to avoid further
substantial foreign exchange losses in the early years, in particular if
U.S. expenditures in Thailand should decrease further.. It is therefore
expected that Thailand will require gross capital inflows in the public
sector during the Third Plan period amounting to about $500 million, com-
pared to an actual inflow of about $300 million during the current Five-
Year Plan. A meeting of the Consultative Group for Thailand will be
convened in September 1970 to discuss Thailand's requirements of external
assistance. At this stage the emphasis will be on the overall magnitude
of the financial requirements and on the immediate and more specific needs
for technical assistance and pre-investment studies. The initiation of
these program studies is expected to lead to the formulation of a sufficent-
ly large list of identified projects for submission to the Consultative
Group meeting in 1971, around the starting date of the Third Five-Year
Plan.
32.       The sound financial position and economic stability of the
country provide substantial creditworthiness. Present debt service lia-
bilities are modest at h percent of exports for public debt and 15 percent
when private debt is taken into account. The creditworthiness position
will remain sound even wsith the subs tantial new external borrowing
projected for the 1971-1975 period.
PART VI - COMPLIAWCE lITH ARTICLES OF AGREE1ENT
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed lan complies with the require-
ments of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECO14204DATION
34.       I recomnmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
