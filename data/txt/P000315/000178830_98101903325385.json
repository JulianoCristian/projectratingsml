The Douala sub-project provides for expansion of\n            production facilities, and additional reservoirs and\n            distribution lines. At Yaounde the project would include the\n            construction of an earth dam creating a reservoir of 5\n            million cubic meters capacity, a new treatment plant and\n            pumping station and a transmission main to carry the water\n            to the city, as well as additional storage and distribution\n            facilities.
