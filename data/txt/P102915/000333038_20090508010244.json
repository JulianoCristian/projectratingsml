risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) embedding the policy reforms, including the\n            prior actions, in the government's reform agenda as\n            articulated in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (I-PRSP), the RRSP encouraged strong ownership from the\n            operation's onset. As seen, this strong level of\n            ownership was a key contributor to the successful\n            implementation of the RRSP; 2) in post-conflict countries\n            such as Liberia with limited capacity, it is particularly\n            important to select a focused number of prior actions that\n            are deemed essential to supporting the government's\n            broader reform program. Such selectivity will not only\n            reduce the transactions costs on a government that is\n            already burdened by multiple management demands, but it will\n            also increase the likelihood that such focused actions are\n            both likely to be enacted and to move the reform program\n            forward. Similarly, the anticipated results of the operation\n            were defined realistically and taking into account the\n            government's implementation capacity; and 3) the\n            effectiveness of Bank supported policy and institutional\n            reform operations can be enhanced by its complementarities\n            with other Bank financed operation and the efforts of other\n            active donors in the reform areas."}, "docdt": "2009-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
