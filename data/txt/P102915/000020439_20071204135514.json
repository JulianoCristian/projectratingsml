   Reengagement and Reform Support Program (RRSP) Grant to the\n            Republic of Liberia. This RRSP supports the full\n            normalization of relations between Liberia and the World\n            Bank and the Government's efforts to establish a\n            rigorous fiscal underpinning for the Liberian economy that\n            will permit accelerated recovery and growth in the context\n            of a multi-donor reengagement process. The proceeds of the\n            grant will be disbursed (i) to support cash flow needs in\n            the period immediately after Liberia has cleared its arrears\n            to IBRD and IDA, and (ii) to meet immediate budgeted fiscal\n            needs including future debt service obligations. The grant\n            would assist the Republic of Liberia in its economic and\n            social recovery underpinned by the government's Interim\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy. This one-tranche operation would\n            support government-owned reforms to improve the\n            country's fiduciary environment and strengthen public\n            institutions. It is an integral part of the Bank's\n            Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Liberia for the period 2007-2008."}, "docdt": "2007-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
