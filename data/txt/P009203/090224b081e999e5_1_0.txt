AGREEMENT, dated                    , 1983, between SOCIALIST
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAIA (hereinafter called the Guarantor)
and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (here-
inafter called the Bank).
WHEREAS (A) the Bank has received a letter dated May 25,
1983 from the Guarantor describing a program of actions, objec-
tives and policies designed to achieve a structural adjustment of
the Guarantor's economy, declaring the Guarantor's commitment to
the execution of that program, and requesting assistance from the
Bank in the financing of essential imports to be made during the
execution of such program;
(B) on the basis, inter alia, of the foregoing, the Bank
has decided in support of such program to provide assistance to
Udruzena Beogradska Banka (hereinafter called the Borrower) by
making to the Borrower a loan in various currencies equivalent to
two hundred seventy-five million dollars ($275,000,000), on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement of even date
herewith between the Bank and the Borrower, but on condition that
the Guarantor agree to guarantee the obligations of the Borrower
in respect of such loan as hereinafter provided; and
WHEREAS the Guarantor, in consideration of the Bank's enter-
ing into the Loan Agreement with the Borrower, has agreed so to
guarantee such obligations of the Borrower;
NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
General Conditions; Definitions
Section 1.01. The parties to this Agreement accept all the
provisions of the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and
Guarantee Agreements of the Bank dated October 27, 1980, with the
same force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein,
subject, however, to the modification thereof set forth in
Section 1.01 of the Loan Agreement (said General Conditions
Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements being hereinafter
called the General Conditions).


﻿- 2-
Section 1.02. Wherever used in this Agreement, unless the
context otherwise requires, the several terms defined in the
General Conditions and in Section 1.02 of the Loan Agreement have
the respective meanings therein set forth.
ARTICLE II
<                           Guarantee
Section 2.01. Without limitation or restriction upon any of
its other obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, the
Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor
and not as surety merely, the due and punctual payment of the
principal of, and interest and other charges on, the Loan, and
the premium, if any, on the prepayment of the Loan, all as set
forth in the Loan Agreement.
ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, specific security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority
over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of
foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of
such member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any
public assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any
external debt, which will or might result in a priority for the
benefit of the creditor of such external debt in the allocation,
realization or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall,
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto, and at no cost
to the Bank, equally and ratably secure the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the Guarantor, in
creating or permitting the creation of such lien, shall make
express provision to that effect; provided, however, that, if for
any constitutional or other legal reason such provision cannot be
made with respect to any lien created on assets of any of its
political or administrative subdivisions, the Guarantor shall
promptly and at no cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on
other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.


﻿- 3 -
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property or
as security for the payment of debt incurred for the purpose of
financing the purchase of such property; and (ii) any lien
arising in the ordinary course of banking transactions and
securing a debt maturing not more than one year after its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of the Guarantor, of any political or administrative sub-
division thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by. or
operating for the account or benefit of, the Guarantor or any
such subdivision, including gold and foreign exchange assets held
by any institution performing the functions of a central bank or
exchange stabilization fund, or similar functions, for the
Guarantor.
Section 3.02. The Guarantor covenants that it will not take,
or cause or permit to be taken, any action which would prevent or
interfere with the performance by the Borrower of its obligations
contained in the Loan Agreement and that, within the limits of
its constitutional powers, it will take or cause to be taken all
reasonable action necessary or appropriate to enable the Borrower
to perform its obligations under the Loan Agreement.
Section 3.03. The Guarantor shall from time to time furnish
to the Bank information as shall have been determined in agree-
ment between the Guarantor and the Bank on the progress achieved
in carrying out the program for structural adjustment referred to
in the Preamble to this Agreement and on the basis of said infor-
mation, the Guarantor and the Bank shall, from time to time, at
the request of either party, exchange views on the progress
achieved I.n carrying out said program and the measures specified
in the Schedule to this Agreement. During each such exchange of
views, the Guarantor shall furnish to the Bank such additional
information as the Bank shall reasonably request.
