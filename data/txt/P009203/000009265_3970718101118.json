support the\n            implementation of the Government's comprehensive\n            structural adjustment program. The principal aim of the\n            program is to place the country's balance of payments\n            with the convertible currency area on a sounder footing and\n            to improve the efficiency of investment selection and\n            resource allocation in the economy. To achieve these\n            objectives, the Government plans to take action in the areas\n            of investment planning and resource allocation, interest\n            rate policy, foreign exchange allocation, export promotion\n            and export incentives. Specific action will also be taken in\n            the regulatory framework for price control, price\n            adjustments in the energy and transportation sectors and the\n            financial accountability of enterprises. The foreign\n            exchange provided by the loan would be used to finance\n            essential imports of raw materials, intermediate goods,\n            spare parts and imported components for turn-key industrial\n            projects, civil works, ships and capital goods exports."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
