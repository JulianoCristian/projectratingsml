                         To develop and demonstrate the systematic diagnosis of climate-related problems and the design of cost-effective adaptation measures, while continuing the
                         integration of climate risk awareness and responsiveness into economic and operational planning.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation progress has improved significantly over the past year with visible on-the-ground impact on coastal protection and freshwater supply and sustainability.
                         Shoreline protection and water works will be completed only in the first quarter of 2011, requiring an extension of the closing date to June 30 2011 to fully achieve the project
                         objectives.

                         awareness of climate risks, improving policies and procedures for water resource management and coastal management, and strengthening the government's capacity for climate
