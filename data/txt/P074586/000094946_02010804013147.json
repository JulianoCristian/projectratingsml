Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)\n            and its larger constituent republic, the Republic of Serbia,\n            in the implementation of a structural reform agenda with the\n            main objective of enhancing medium-term fiscal\n            sustainability as a basis for sustained growth and poverty\n            reduction. The reform program to be supported by the\n            operation works to achieve these objectives through\n            implementating specific reforms in the areas of: 1) public\n            expenditure management; 2) the energy sector; and 3) social\n            protection and labor; and 4) the health care sector. The SCA\n            works to solidify the stabilization and reform progress made\n            thus far in FRY and Serbia, and provide a basis for building\n            a more comprehensive program. By targeting the sources of\n            macroeconomic imbalance, the SAC will enhance the\n            effectiveness the World Bank portfolio and other\n            donors' programs. The credit will also send an\n            important signal to donors and private investors and\n            creditors, and thereby help stimulate much needed official\n            support and private investments. Given the importance of\n            developments in FRY to the overall prospects for Southeast\n            Europe, this credit for stabilization and recovery in FRY\n            will also have important effects to the region as a whole."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
