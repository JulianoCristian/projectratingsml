     Project will consolidate the gains and address the\n            weaknesses of the first On-Farm Water Management (OFWM)\n            Project and similar components under other projects.\n            Project objectives will be to:  a) reduce irrigation water\n            losses at the farm level; b) increase agricultural\n            production through more efficient use of water; and c)\n            increase farmer participation in Water Users Associations in\n            order to improve management of water and non-water farm\n            inputs and ensure adequate maintenance of civil works.  It\n            will also aim to; d) improve the capability of the\n            provincial governments to plan and execute expanding OFWM\n            programs; and e) strengthen the water management expertise\n            of the provincial Agricultural Extension Services as well as\n            their coordination and cooperation with the OFWM\n            Directorates.  The three-year project will include:  a)\n            equipment, materials, and skilled labor for renovation of\n            about 2500 watercourses, precision land levelling,\n            demonstration plots, construction of water tanks, and\n            limited office space and staff housing.  It will, moreover,\n            provide; b) technical assistance; c) training; and d)\n            supervision and administration."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
