The\n            project achieved its primary objects, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and the performance of the Bank was\n            satisfactory while the Borrower's was less than\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, amendment of the DCA to open four provincial\n            Special Accounts in the early stage of the project\n            facilitated the flow of funds and expedited implementation.\n            Second, application of more rigid criteria for both\n            selection of watercourses to be renovated and sections to be\n            lined is needed in order to avoid renovation. Third, greater\n            attention should be paid to WUAs to ensure that they can\n            function as intended. Fourth, use of expatriate consultants\n            should be limited to specializations for which expertise is\n            not readily available locally. Fifth, greater attention must\n            be paid to establishing an effective M & E system.\n            Finally, the Borrower should proceed with caution in\n            implementing the third OFWM project and not underestimate\n            the experience gained from the current project."}, "docdt": "1993-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
