                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global development objective of the Montreal Protocol is to assist the Government of Jordan through a combination of policy support, institutional
                         capacity building and technical and financial assistance to the industry to meet its obligation under the Montreal Protocol to completely phase-out the import of
                         ODS by January 2010 with the interim steps of freeze of import at 1996 level by 2000, 50% reduction by 2005, and 85% reduction by 2007. For halons, freeze only
                         starts by 2002, but the milestones set in the foregoing applies. The overall objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in phasing out the use of ODS
                         within its territory through, inter alia: (a) the introduction of appropriate policy measures; (b) the institutional strengthening of responsible governmental
                         entities; and (c) the implementation of specific cost-effective priority investments to reduce consumption of ozone depleting substances in the manufacturing
                         and servicing sectors. The Project will allow Jordan to develop local institutional capacity to manage a global programs similar to Montreal Protocol, develop
                         and implement supporting policies and regulations to achieve the overall objectives and to develop investment activities to assist the industry in converting to
                         non-ODS technologies consistent with World Bank requirements and policies and guidelines of the Multilateral Fund for the implementation of the MP.

                         The ODS II Project was extended at the end of December 2010 by one year and is, hence scheduled to close December 31, 2011. The extension will permit the chiller replacement
                         subproject to complete and will ensure continuity in the NOU through the ISP funding while a new ODS III Grant Agreement is prepared in 2011. The work plan prepared for the
                         extensions request will be utilized as a planning tool for implementing all remaining activities in 2011. Jordan’s Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP) was renewed in December
                         2010 for the ninth time at US$147,333 by the MLF Executive Committee (ExCom). The National Ozone Phase-out Plan (NOPP) project is physically and financially completed as of
