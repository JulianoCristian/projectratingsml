                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global development objective of the Montreal Protocol is to assist the Government of Jordan through a combination of policy support, institutional capacity
                         building and technical and financial assistance to the industry to meet its obligation under the Montreal Protocol to completely phase-out the import of ODS by January
                         2010 with the interim steps of freeze of import at 1996 level by 2000, 50% reduction by 2005, and 85% reduction by 2007. For halons, freeze only starts by 2002, but the
                         milestones set in the foregoing applies. The overall objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in phasing out the use of ODS within its territory through, inter
                         alia: (a) the introduction of appropriate policy measures; (b) the institutional strengthening of responsible governmental entities; and (c) the implementation of specific
                         cost-effective priority investments to reduce consumption of ozone depleting substances in the manufacturing and servicing sectors. The Project will allow Jordan to
                         develop local institutional capacity to manage a global programs similar to Montreal Protocol, develop and implement supporting policies and regulations to achieve the
                         overall objectives and to develop investment activities to assist the industry in converting to non-ODS technologies consistent with World Bank requirements and
                         policies and guidelines of the Multilateral Fund for the implementation of the MP.
