                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project comprises three similar sub-projects in the cities of Dong Hoi, Quy Nhon and Nha Trang. In general, the project continues to make significant progress towards meeting
                         its Development Objectives. Phase 1 has been successfully completed in Dong Hoi and nearly completed in Quy Nhon and Nha Trang. As a result the benefits of reduced flooding in
                         selected areas of each city are being realized as are the benefits of improved sanitations in schools in all three cities. Particularly in Dong Hoi, the impacts of the drainage works are

                         impressive with additional benefits accruing from a focused effort to green and beautify the cities with transformational impacts. However, the implementation of the project is uneven
                         with continued delays in Quy Nhon and Nha Trang resulting in about 30% project completion against about 60% of the elapsed implementation period. In addition, there are
                         increasing risks that the project may not be completed on-time unless highest efforts are made in all three cities to improve implementation in the areas of: construction supervision
                         and management; timely and transparent conclusion of on-going bidding processes; timely and transparent site clearance; and ensuring the timely availability of counterpart funding
                         which is primarily required to ensure adequate compensation for project affected households.
