Terms and Conditions of Use of Secure Identification Devices
in connection with Use of Electronic Means
to Process Applications
and Supporting Documentation
January 20, 2010
The World Bank (Bank)' will provide secure identification devices (Tokens) to permit the
Borrower2 to deliver applications for withdrawal and applications for special commitments under
the Agreement(s) and supporting documentation (such applications and supporting
documentation together referred to in these Terms and Conditions of Use as Applications) to the
Bank electronically, on the terms and conditions of use specified herein.
A.    Identification of Users.
1.    The Borrower will be required to identify in a completed Authorized Signatory Letter
(ASL) duly delivered to and received by the Bank each person who will be authorized to
deliver Applications. The Bank will provide Tokens to each person identified in the ASL
(Signatory), as provided below. The Borrower shall also immediately notify the Bank if
a Signatory is no longer authorized by the Borrower to act as a Signatory.
2.    Each Signatory must register as a user on the Bank's Client Connection (CC) website
(https://clientconnection.worldbank.org ) prior to delivery of Tokens. Registration on CC
will require that the Signatory establish a CC password (CC Password). The Signatory
shall not reveal his/her CC Password to anyone or store or record the CC Password in
written or other form. Upon registration as a CC user, the Signatory will be assigned a
unique identifying account name.
B.    Distribution, Initialization and Return of Tokens.
1.    The Bank will physically deliver a Token to each Signatory in a manner to be determined
by and satisfactory to the Bank.
2.    At the time of delivery of a Token to a Signatory, the Signatory will receive a copy of
these Terms and Conditions of Use for purposes of initializing the Token.
3.    The Bank will verify that the Token, Temporary Password and Terms and Conditions of
Use have been duly delivered to and received by the CC User.
4.    Promptly upon receipt of the Token and Terms and Conditions of Use, the Signatory will
access CC using his/her account name and CC Password and register his/her Token and
'"Bank" includes IBRD and IDA.
2 "Borrower" includes the borrower of an IBRD loan, IDA credit, or Project Preparation Facility advance and the
recipient of a grant.


﻿set a personal identification number (PIN) to be used in connection with the use of his/her
Token, after which the Token will be initialized for use by the Signatory exclusively for
purposes of delivering Applications. Upon initialization of the Token, the Signatory will
be a "Token User". The Bank will maintain in its database a user account (Account) for
each Token User for purposes of managing the Token of the Token User. Neither the
Borrower nor the Token User will have any access to the Account.
5.    Prior to first use of the Token by the Token User for delivering Applications, the
Borrower shall ensure that the Token User has received training materials provided by
the Bank in use of the Token.
6.    Tokens shall be promptly returned to the Bank upon request of the Bank.
C.    Management of Tokens.
1 .   Tokens will remain the property of the Bank.
2.    Use of the Token is strictly limited to use in the delivery of Applications by the Token
User in the manner prescribed by the Bank in the Agreement(s) and these Terms and
Conditions. Any other use of the Token is prohibited.
3.    The Bank assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any misuse of the Token
by the Token User, other representatives of the Borrower, or third parties.
4.    The Borrower undertakes to ensure, and represents and warrants to the Bank (such
representation and warranty being expressly relied upon by the Bank in delivery of a
Token to each Token User) that each Token User is provided, understands and will abide
by, these Terms and Conditions of Use, including without limitation the following:
Security
4.1.  The Token User shall not reveal his/her PIN to anyone or store or record the PIN
in written or other form.
4.2.  The Token User shall not allow anyone else to utilize a Token to deliver an
Application to the Bank.
4.3.  The Token User shall always logout from CC when not using the system. Failure
to logout properly can create a route into the system that is unprotected.
4.4.  If the Token User believes a third party has learned his/her PIN or has lost his/her
Token he/she shall immediately notify clientconnection@worldbank.org.


﻿4.5.  The Borrower shall immediately notify the Bank at
clientconnection@worldbank.org of any lost, stolen or compromised Tokens, and take
other reasonable steps to ensure such Tokens are disabled immediately.
Care of Tokens
4.6.  Tokens contain delicate and sophisticated instrumentation and therefore should be
handled with due care, and should not be immersed in liquids, exposed to extreme
temperatures, crushed or bent. Also, Tokens should be kept more than five (5) cm from
devices that generate electromagnetic radiation (EMR), such as mobile phones, phone-
enabled PDAs, smart phones and other similar devices. Tokens should be carried and
stored separate from any EMR device. At close range (less than 5 cm), these devices can
output high levels of EMR that can interfere with the proper operation of electronic
equipment, including the Token.
4.7   Without derogating from these Terms and Conditions of Use, other
technical instructions on the proper use and care Tokens are available at
http://www.rsa.com.
5.    Replacement
5.1.  Lost, damaged, compromised (in terms of 4.5, above) or destroyed Tokens will be
replaced at the expense of the Borrower.
5.2.  The Bank reserves the right, in its sole discretion, not to replace any Token in the
case of misuse, or not to reactivate a Token User's Account
6.    Reservation of Right to disable Token
6.1.  The Borrower shall reserve the right to revoke the authorization of a Token User
to use a Token for any reason.
6.2.  The Bank reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to temporarily or permanently
disable a Token, de-activate a Token User's Account or both.
