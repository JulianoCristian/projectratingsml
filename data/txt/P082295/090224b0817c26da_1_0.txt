                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In recent months the project continues to make significant progress towards meeting its Development Objectives. With Phase 1 successfully completed, the Project benefits have
                         been beginning to realized i.e. lakes/canals/drains rehabilitated, flooding and SW pollution significantly reduced, resettlement sites completed and schools sanitation satisfactorily
                         operated. Respective key project indicators have been achieved i.e. the number of people benefiting from flooding reduction, solid waste collection and schools sanitation. Such
                         results are encouraging given focused efforts to green and beautify the cities with transformational impacts. However, the implementation of Phase 2 in Quy Nhon and Nha Trang has
                         been slower than planned. Given the effective measures and specific actions taken by the central/local government and the Bank, very encouraging results have been achieved,
                         particularly in Dong Hoi and Quy Nhon. It is expected that these two (2) sub-projects will be completed by the closing date of Nove. 30, 2014. Concerning the third city Nha Trang,
                         highest priority is to complete the remaining site clearance activities.
