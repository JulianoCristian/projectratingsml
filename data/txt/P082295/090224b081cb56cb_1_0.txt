                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well towards achieving its Development Objectives. Since the last mission, the project continues to make very good progress in Dong Hoi and Quy Nhon,
                         and encouraging results in Nha Trang. All of Phase 1 and part of Phase 2 investments were put into operation, which brought the Project benefits to about 700,000 citizens in the
                         three cities. City environment, flooding have been improved through lakes/canals/drains rehabilitated (about 40,000 people benefiting from reduced incidence and severity of
                         flooding), and solid waste management (about 697,944 people whose solid waste collected). Resettlement sites completed to accommodate the Project Affected Households (PAHs),
                         public and schools sanitation satisfactorily operated which improved the sanitation facilities at public areas (beach, markets) and for 26,800 pupils at schools. All accumulative project
                         indicators up to December 2012 either exceeded or met the targets, these indicators will be continued to monitor by the next mission. Given the effective measures and specific
                         actions taken by the central/local government and the Bank, very encouraging results have been achieved, particularly in Dong Hoi and Quy Nhon. It is expected that these two (2)
                         sub-projects will be completed by the closing date of November 30, 2014. Challenges are remaining in Nha Trang, which requires continuous implementation support from WB task
                         team and provincial leadership.
