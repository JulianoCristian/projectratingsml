These measures during\n            construction include the following: To alleviate noise,\n            odor, litter, and dust, control noise levels in residential\n            areas; apply dust suppression measures; avoid overloading of\n            trucks; absorb and collect spills, sludge, oils and\n            lubricants from equipment; sprinkle water in streets; keep\n            streets clear of mud, dirt, spillage, and waste; and\n            immediately remove materials and liquids causing offensive\n            odors. To reduce impacts from waste, collect solid household\n            and commercial wastes, and dredged or excavated material and\n            transport them to approved landfill; contaminated wastes\n            shall be transported separately to an approved site; store\n            no waste on site for more than 24 hours; and avoid\n            discharging water to land or public areas. Landowners will\n            be compensated for any damage, and contractor will not sever\n            or interfere with utility services. Regarding health and\n            safety, provide workers with protective clothing and masks,\n            safety equipment and tools, and clean water for washing; and\n            maintain safe public access through sites for residents.\n            Transport routes, vehicles and loads will be distributed so\n            as to avoid damaging roads and bridges; and avoid use of\n            tracked vehicles on paved roads. Schedule work to avoid\n            night and weekend hours. During operation of the drainage\n            and sewerage systems, maintain regular visual inspections of\n            road conditions, new drainage systems, solid waste\n            collection, public toilets, and solid waste transfer\n            stations for problems needing repair; follow operational and\n            safety standards; transport dredged material in covered\n            vehicles to disposal site; replant trees on embankments of\n            the open drainage canal to strengthen these structures,\n            reduce air pollution, and enhance the local landscape.\n            Chlorinate untreated effluents to reduce pathogens, screen\n            outlets to remove solids, and increase water quality monitoring."}, "docdt": "2011-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
