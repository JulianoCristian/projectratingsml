F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives
The original project development objective (PDO) was ‘To improve the environmental sanitation in the
project cities in a sustainable manner and thereby enhancing the quality of life for city residents’.

Revised Project Development Objectives
During the additional finance processing in March 2011, the project was partially restructured to cover the
price escalation as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis and there were a few changes in the scope of
investments under each component. However, the original PDO was not revised during project
implementation.

Global Environment Objectives
The original Global Environmental Objective (GEO) was ‘To pilot and promote the replication of a new,
more efficient wastewater treatment technology, which would contribute to improving in an integrated
manner the health and habitat conditions of globally significant marine and coastal ecosystems along the
coastline of Vietnam’.

Revised Global Environment Objectives
The original GEO remained unchanged during project implementation.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background

1.      The proportion of people living in urban areas in Vietnam by the time of appraisal was one
of the lowest in East Asia, comprising around 23 percent of the total population, or 19 million
people. However, Vietnam is one of the countries with the fastest rate of urbanization in the East
Asia and Pacific region, with the urban share of the population expected to grow to 50 percent by
2025. Rapid urban growth is largely due to urban expansion and rural-urban migration as cities
play a more important role in economic growth. This contributed to challenges in service delivery
and infrastructure in the cities, in general, and specifically, for liquid and solid wastes and drainage.

2.       The government’s sanitation sector strategy was developed in the mid-1990s with the
assistance of development partners, including the World Bank. The strategy diagnosed major
challenges for improving service delivery in urban areas: under-investment in sanitation works,
low coverage and lack of wastewater treatment facilities, excessive subsidies for sanitation
recurring costs, and an ineffective administrative structure. In response, the sector strategy sought
to (a) rehabilitate existing networks and facilities; (b) develop policies and institutions to promote
a more market-oriented system; (c) develop, through public education, better awareness on the
importance of more effective sanitation services; and (iv) gradually phase out subsides and replace
them with user charges. The strategy included measures to decentralize septage and solid waste
collection to the local level, commercialize public utilities, and encourage more cost recovery for
the service providers (Urban Environmental Companies [URENCOs] and/or Water Supply and
Drainage Companies [WSDCs]).

Sector Background

3.      At the time of appraisal, urban wastewater and storm waters were mostly discharged
without treatment through combined systems to nearby watercourses. Due to lack of maintenance,
flooding was common in urban centers and large sections of these combined networks, constructed
decades ago, needed rehabilitation. For sanitation, the majority of households (HHs) were
investing in septic tanks or latrines, depending on the location, and there were a limited number of
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the country, all of them in the major cities.

4.      At the time of appraisal, the country was producing around 15 million tons of solid waste
per year. Solid waste was disposed of mainly to uncontrolled open dumping sites, with few sanitary
landfills. Solid waste collection was estimated as serving some 70 percent of the urban population.
Revenues from solid waste management (SWM) user fees covered on average only 58 percent of
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, requiring government to subsidize environmental and
water companies.

5.     Urban drainage master plans did not pay adequate attention to flood control, allowing
uncontrolled development to encroach on the natural routes required for effective discharge and
storage of floodwater.


                                                   1
Rationale for Bank Assistance

6.      The Bank had been financing similar projects in the past, for example, the Three Cities
Sanitation Project (P051553) covering Da Nang, Hai Phong, and Quang Ninh. As the urban
sanitation sector was in its infancy, the Bank was well positioned to bring regional and
international best practices into project design and thus further develop or consolidate the urban
environmental policy agenda technically (sewerage, wastewater treatment, and SWM); financially
(cost recovery charges); and institutionally (efficient and effective service providers).

7.     The International Development Association (IDA) has also mobilized resources to further
advance the sanitation agenda in Vietnam. The Global Environment Fund (GEF) had agreed to
support the demonstration of a new, and appropriate, treatment technology in Quy Nhon while a
Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) cofinancing grant was to build the
capacity of service providers or other relevant agencies and raise public awareness of the project.

8.     The project was in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at the time of appraisal.
The last CAS, which links to the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy of the
government of Vietnam (GoV), was completed in September 2002. The CAS described the Bank’s
support for each objective and the project supported the following parts of the CAS:

      •   Enhancing environmental sustainability (Subtheme 2.6) through improved sewerage,
          drainage, and solid waste services
      •   Public administration reform (Subtheme 3.3) through improved institutional arrangements
          and increased financial sustainability of service providers
      •   Reducing deficiencies in basic urban services (key sectoral issue) through provision of
          access to sanitation services

9.     Moreover, the CAS Progress Report (February 19, 2004) identified the need for increased
investment in infrastructure to help attain the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and growth.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.   The PDO was to improve the environmental sanitation in the project cities in a sustainable
manner and thereby enhancing the quality of life for city residents.

11.       These were the key indicators identified to measure progress toward achieving the PDO:

      •   Number of people benefiting from reduced incidence and severity of flooding
      •   Number of people whose solid waste will be collected
      •   Number of people gaining access to improved sanitation
      •   Proportion of wastewater service providers’ costs, including loan repayments, recovered
          from user fees
      •   Proportion of solid waste providers’ costs, including loan repayments, recovered from user
          fees




                                                  2
1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and key indicators

12.     The original GEO was to pilot and promote the replication of a new, more efficient
wastewater treatment technology, which would contribute to improving in an integrated manner
the health and habitat conditions of globally significant marine and coastal ecosystems along the
coastline of Vietnam. The outcome indicators for the GEO include (a) quantity of suspended solids
removed by the treatment process; (b) quantity of nutrient (N and P) removed by the treatment
process; and (c) number of HHs connected to the chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT)
plant.

1.4 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

13.     Though the original PDO was not revised during project implementation, during the
Additional Financing (AF) processing in 2011, some of the result indicators were updated, some
targets were added, and additional important core indicators were identified and included.

1.5 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

14.    The original GEOs remained unchanged during project implementation.

1.6 Components (US$ at appraisal, US$ actual)

15.     Component 1: Flood Control, Drainage, and Wastewater Collection (US$91.147
million, US$118.905 million). This component was intended to improve the collection of sewage
by building new sewers and interceptors, rehabilitating existing sewers, and transporting the
wastes to new treatment plants. Drainage would be provided by rehabilitating existing drains,
constructing new drains where regular flooding occurs, and enhancing the capacity of flood
retention ponds. Existing combined sewer system were to be used to the greatest extent possible
in the central urban core areas with high population densities. Interceptor sewers would be
constructed to pick up flows that currently discharge at a number of locations along the seafront
or into rivers.

16.     Component 2: Wastewater Treatment Plants (US$39.062 million, US$42.744 million).
New WWTPs would be built during Phase 2 of the project to meet Vietnamese national effluent
standards. In Nha Trang, two plants would be constructed, one to serve the urban core and a second
to serve the southern residential area. In Quy Nhon, two WWTPs would serve the old city area and
a third would serve the southwestern area some 15 km from the city core. In Dong Hoi, a single
new treatment plant serving the city would be constructed and the existing plant at the city hospital
would be rehabilitated.

17.     Component 3: Solid Waste Management (SWM) (US$27.642 million, US$18.355
million). The collection of solid wastes would be improved and waste would be transported to new
or existing sanitary landfills for final disposal. In Nha Trang, a new sanitary landfill would be
constructed at Luong Hoa and the existing Ru Ri dump would be safely closed. In Quy Nhon, the
existing landfill at Long My would be rehabilitated and expanded. In Dong Hoi, a sanitary landfill
was under development with bilateral funding and the project would provide additional equipment
or functionality as determined during implementation.



                                                 3
18.     SWM collection equipment would be financed for all cities and transfer stations/collection
points were planned for Nha Trang and Quy Nhon. The amount and phasing of the SWM
equipment would follow demand over the project life and would take account of possible public-
private partnership activities. In Dong Hoi, the facilities for safe disposal of medical waste would
be constructed. These would be operated by the Urban Works Company (UWC) under contract
with the hospital.

19.    Component 4: Resettlement (US$16.074 million, US$22.778 million). Construction of
services (roads and utilities) to new housing plots for relocation of project affected people (PAP)
in Quy Nhon and Nha Trang.

20.      Component 5: Household Revolving Fund and School Sanitation Program (US$2.24
million, US$2.634 million). Revolving funds would be established in each city to provide small
loans for construction of HH sanitation facilities. The funds would be managed by the Women’s
Union according to the procedures set out in the household revolving fund manual. Eligibility
criteria and loan terms and conditions were designed to ensure that low-income HHs were able to
access and pay back the loans.

21.    Water supply and sanitation facilities would be built at city schools in response to demand
from those schools. Demand assessment and proposed investment for different types of schools
would follow the design standards set by the Ministry of Education (MoE).

22.     Component 6: Capacity Building and Project Implementation (US$27.372 million,
US$24.605 million). Support to Project Management Units (PMUs) in project implementation,
including (a) overall project management support; (b) preparation of Phase 2 feasibility studies,
detailed engineering designs, and bid documents; (c) construction management supervision for
Phases 1 and 2; (d) independent safeguards monitoring; and (e) financial auditing. Equipment to
support the PMUs would also be financed.

23.      Capacity building for the service providers and city departments, including (a) an
institutional study to establish long-term structure and staffing for service providers; (b) purchase,
installation and commissioning of financial management (FM), management information, and
billing/collection software for the service providers and training in its use; (c) joint development,
with other city departments, of procedures and plans to support operation and management of new
or rehabilitated project facilities; (d) technical and managerial training to the service providers,
including in O&M of the facilities and in financial planning; (e) workshops and study tours; and
(f) miscellaneous other capacity-building activities.

24.    Capacity building for design and implementation of a Healthy City Partnership (HCP),
including (a) development of the framework for design and implementation of the HCP; (b)
implementation of the HCP, including training and public awareness, small investments in goods
and works, and small grants; and (c) preparation and delivery of public awareness campaigns to
support sanitation behavior change and explain benefits from the project and its costs.

25.     The GEF had three components: (a) constructing and operating CEPT plants; (b) raising
public awareness and replicating project achievements; and (c) monitoring and evaluation (M&E).




                                                  4
1.7 Main Beneficiaries

26.     The project was designed to benefit the population of (a) Nha Trang, located in the south
and the capital of Khanh Hoa Province with a total population of 350,000 in 2002; (b) Quy Nhon,
located in the south-central region of Vietnam and the capital city of Binh Dinh Province with a
total population of 252,000 in 2003; and (c) Dong Hoi in the north and the capital of Quang Binh
Province with a total population of 98,000 in 2003.

1.8 Revised Components

27.    The components of the project remained the same.

1.9 Other significant changes

28.      The unusually high inflation in the construction sector in Vietnam during 2007–2008 led
to increased costs of key construction inputs such as cement and labor. This combined with
underestimated costs (due to the counterparts use of national construction cost norms that were
lower than the market reference) at appraisal and subsequent technical design changes not
anticipated at the time of project appraisal led to a financing gap, requiring an AF. During the
processing of the AF, some adjustments were made, including revision of the scope of investments
in all three subprojects: (a) WWTP of the Dong Hoi hospital was cancelled; (b) solid waste transfer
stations/collection points in Quy Nhon and Nha Trang were not included; (c) the capacity of the
WWTPs and landfill in Quy Nhon have been reduced; and (d) the drainage and sewer collection
and WWTP in the northern catchment of Nha Trang was removed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Soundness of Background Analysis and Strategic Context

29.      The background analysis addressed the conditions in Vietnam and international experience
at the time of appraisal and incorporated lessons learned. These included the need to enhance
technical and managerial capacity of service providers and inclusion of extensive capacity building
to the service providers to meet these new demands. The analysis also took into account the strong
link between financial sustainability and user fees, recognizing that benefits from sanitation
infrastructure significantly increase when beneficiaries are exposed to Information, Education, and
Communication (IEC) programs on HH sanitation practices. This analysis was sound and project
interventions were planned to addresses these issues through (a) public awareness campaigns about
system benefits; (b) financing of tertiary lines close to the houses; and (c) applying wastewater
fees to all HHs with water connections, thus reducing disincentives to connect to the system once
it is available.

30.    Decisions to adopt decentralized project implementation at a city level, inclusion of
capacity building for the PMUs as part of the PHRD-funded preparation activity, and careful
preparation of bidding documents showed prudent attention to lessons learned from previous Bank




                                                5
projects. The financial analysis correctly demonstrated the need for tariffs to increase gradually to
cover O&M costs.

2.1.2 Adequacy of Project Design

31.     Choice of appropriate wastewater treatment technology. Based on the options and
feasibilities studies prepared for each subproject, appropriate technology was selected in
accordance with the cities’ specific needs. Dong Hoi had chosen a lagoon and aeration pond instead
of a more complex technology. This has the capacity to be upgraded at a later stage either to a
complex system or to add more lagoons in line with the expected growth in the city. An oxidation
ditch process was applied in Quy Nhon and Nha Trang, appropriate to the available land in these
cities.

32.    The project recognized the challenges associated with the sudden introduction of cost
recovery and introduced an appropriate gradual approach for this. Phasing of implementation into
two parts was another strategic design choice.

33.     The project design also included the use of the GEF grant to pilot and promote the
replication of a new and more efficient wastewater treatment technology in Quy Nhon. This grant,
together with the project resources, helped the construction of a 14,000 m3/day flow capacity
CEPT at Nhon Binh.

34.     Though the project is likely to have a number of intangible benefits (cleanliness, city
beautification, improved esthetics, and others), the outcome indicators which quantified the
number of people benefiting from reduced incidence of flooding, regular collection and disposal
of solid waste, access to improved sanitation, and access to a revolving fund to improve HH
sanitation were appropriate. They adequately capture the improvements in environmental
sanitation that were the focus of the project.

2.1.3 Project Preparation and Implementation Time Frame

35.      The project was divided into two phases: Phase 1 was planned to implement about 30
percent of the total investments, with the detailed design and bidding documents available before
the Board approval date. Phase 2 was planned to include design and implementation of the
remaining 70 percent of the project which covered more technically complex components for the
sanitary landfills and WWTPs, as well as for the land compensation and hand over of sites.
Maximum efforts were provided by both participating cities and the Bank task team for successful
delivery of Phase 2 by the original closing date of November 30, 2014. Though different activities
in the three project cities could be done in parallel, for a project that undertook both comprehensive
capacity building and complex contracts, an implementation period from November 2006
(appraisal) to November 2014 (closing) seems an appropriate time frame.

2.1.4 Adequacy of Government Commitment

36.    The Government demonstrated commitment to the project through the timely provision of
counterpart funds, the establishment of capable PMUs, and willingness to issue legislation to take
forward the cost recovery agenda. The early preparation of prefeasibility studies for each city and


                                                  6
approval by the prime minister’s office were strong signals right from the beginning of ownership
of the project by the national and provincial authorities. The three participating provinces took a
decisive lead on tariff reform by issuing provincial decisions for increase of wastewater and solid
waste tariffs. All the bidding documents and bid evaluation reports (subject to prior Bank review)
were reviewed and approved by the Bank in a timely manner.

2.1.5 Assessment of Risks

37.     The most substantial risk was the local government’s failure to implement agreed tariff
increases in a timely manner. Consumers’ possible refusal to pay for services was an associated
risk. The risks were mitigated by relating charges to affordability, phasing increase in tariffs over
time, and raising community awareness about the benefits of improved sanitation. The second risk
identified was the possibility that the procurement process, with its complicated approval
procedures, could delay project implementation. To mitigate this risk, the project adopted a
number of methods, including smaller and simpler contract packages, raising the problem of delays
in regular implementation review missions, intensive procurement supervision at the early stages
of the project, and organizing a series of procurement trainings. Overall, the risk assessment and
mitigation measures defined at appraisal proved adequate.

2.2 Implementation

38.    After a slow start on Phase 1 activities, project implementation quickly picked up
momentum in all the three cities. The Phase 2 design was carried out after the Board approval date
and it required a longer preparation stage than initially planned. The participating provinces
performed active project management functions throughout the implementation, with the PMU
making significant efforts to designate necessary resources for component execution. All the major
physical components were completed by the original project closing date of November 30, 2014.

39.     High inflation in 2007 and 2008 in Vietnam and the global financial crisis of 2008 resulted
in significant price increase of construction materials (mainly steel, cement, and labor) in Vietnam.
The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Vietnamese dong was 15,969 at the time of
appraisal (2006), but by October 2014, the rate had fallen to 21,245. As indicated above under
para.1.9, underestimation of costs in the design stage was also a challenge during project
implementation. To address fund shortage, the project received an AF in the order of SDR 42.5
million (US$65.3 million equivalent).

40.    The project scope was also reduced with some investments taken out of the project. These
included WWTPs; part of the drainage system and primary, secondary, and tertiary sewerage
systems; solid waste transfer stations; WWTP capacity; flood protection and drainage works; and
school toilets. Different scenarios were carefully considered in making these changes and the
measures taken were rational and appropriate for the situation.

41.    In general, the social safeguards issues were monitored and addressed in a satisfactory
manner. Independent resettlement monitoring reports have been prepared for all three project cities
as specified in the approved Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The project received complaints in
2014 from 11 HHs in Quy Nhon City related to their compensation and resettlement prior to project
closure. Based on the last report submitted by the Quy Nhon subproject at the end of March 2015,


                                                 7
the compensation plan was endorsed by the Binh Dinh Provincial People’s Committee (PPC) and
the approved budget has been transferred to the state treasury accounts for the mentioned HHs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

42.     M&E design. The design of the M&E system and the outcome indicators reflected the
results from each of the project components and were a reasonable choice. Each PMU, supported
by a technical assistance consultant, compiled data and monitored the performance of its
subproject. The M&E aspect of the project at the time of design is rated as Satisfactory.

43.     M&E implementation. The PMUs in each city were responsible for monitoring the key
performance indicators and collecting data related to each of the intermediate PDO indicators.
Data collection activities were carried out on a contractual basis by provincial authorities and local
departments. In Dong Hoi and Nha Trang, a computerized Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) system was installed both for the WWTPs and the landfill sites, which
allows streaming of live data feeds to the control room. The system provides actual readings on
temperature, pressure levels, effluent quality, functionality of pumps, and air blowers. This system
allows automatic ‘on and off’ function for different devices and can work in conjunction with
mobile phones. In Nha Trang, the WWTP also has an automatic inlet and outlet sampling device,
which allows taking and reading samples on a daily basis without physically going to the outlets
and inlets. The M&E aspect of the project during implementation is rated as Satisfactory.

44.     M&E utilization. The aspects of the M&E system that were most useful to project
management were the outcome indicators. Data collected on the number of beneficiaries provided
a useful gauge of the project coverage, tariff revision, and cost recovery roadmap. Comprehensive
social safeguards data that were collected regularly include information on land acquisition,
resettlement, and compensation. The computerized SCADA system allows the service providers
to have a 24/7 monitoring of the plant, early detection of problems, and quick rectification. The
system also allows automatic recording and filtering of data, which is very useful for management
decisions on plant operation. However, progress information was not updated regularly and the
performance of M&E during utilization is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Environmental Safeguards Aspects

45.     The project was classified as Environmental Category A. Accordingly, an Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) was completed for the major works (WWTPs and landfill sites) before
commencement of the work. The overall impacts of the project are positive during the operation
phase with long-term environmental benefits to the project provinces for cleaner and more
beautiful cities. The canals, rivers, and beaches became cleaner when the wastewater was collected
and treated before being discharged into the environment. Living conditions of local communities
have improved and the number of locations being flooded during the rainy season has reduced.

46.     The environmental and social impacts observed during the construction phase include
increased levels of dust, noise, and vibrations around the construction areas; traffic disruptions;
disturbance to daily domestic and business activities of roadside HHs; and safety risks to local
communities from deep excavations, electrical wires, materials and fuel storage, and temporary


                                                  8
disposal of excavated materials along the road. To address these impacts, the project applied a
systematic environmental management system to manage construction impacts. Independent
consultants were engaged to build the environmental management capacity of the PMUs and carry
out periodical environmental monitoring. Generally, construction impacts were under control,
safety risks during the construction phase were minimized, and there was no recorded fatality at
construction sites. The environmental safeguards aspect of the project is rated as Satisfactory.

2.4.2 Social Safeguards Aspects

47.     The project has substantially improved living and environmental conditions of the project
cities and their people. However, in anticipation of adverse impacts that the project might have
related to the need for land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, OP 4.12 - Involuntary
Resettlement has been triggered.

48.     A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared following local laws and policies
of the Bank (OP 4.12). Ten RAPs for all three cities, including for activities funded by the GEF,
have been prepared in accordance with the RPF. The RAPs included a detailed impact inventory,
a socioeconomic survey, and an extensive consultation process with the affected population as
well as with relevant government agencies.

49.     At the project design stage, efforts were made to minimize adverse social impacts through
design modifications, including realignment and reduction of the scale of proposed civil works.
Agricultural land in the buffer zone areas was available for the people to continue agricultural
activities to minimize impact on their livelihood and income sources. The project acquired around
189.4 ha of land in all three cities, with 1,247 affected HHs, of which 223 HHs had to be resettled.
A total of VND 233 billion (about US$11.1 million) was paid to the affected people and VND 3
billion (about US$0.14 million) transferred to the state treasury accounts for 11 HHs in Quy Nhon
City.

50.     The actual number of resettled HHs (223) was decreased by about 10 percent compared
with the original 245, as described in the approved RAPs. A total of 259 land plots in five different
resettlement sites have been provided to HHs to be relocated, among which, one site in Quy Nhon
City was built by the project. It is to be noted that although one resettlement site in Nha Trang was
also developed by the project to satisfy the requests of the affected people to be relocated in the
vicinity, the city allocated existing available sites to them.

51.     In general, the project RPF and RAPs were implemented satisfactorily and the project
resettlement policy objectives have been met. According to the independent resettlement
monitoring consultant reports, all the surveyed relocated PAP have been able to restore or improve
the lost assets and livelihood. The general rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

2.4.3. Financial Management Aspects

52.     The FM reviews during regular supervision missions identified that an adequate FM system
was in place that could provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information that
Bank loan proceeds were being used for the intended purposes. The project FM rating was rated
as either Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory since late 2007. The reviews also recognized the
adequacy of FM staffing, accounting and internal control systems, maintenance of supporting


                                                 9
documents in the project, and implementation of auditor recommendations for annual audit.
Quarterly financial reports of acceptable quality have been submitted on time. Annual audited
financial reports have been submitted on time to the Bank, with mostly unqualified audit opinions
in all the three cities. The project accounting systems were observed to be in order and payments
were well regulated. Verification and payment for contracts were timely and accurate, consistent
with the provisions of the Vietnamese government and the Bank. The FM arrangement of the
revolving fund was satisfactorily maintained throughout project implementation.

53.     Besides FM supervision missions, integrated FM found that procurement reviews were also
regularly performed to confirm the adequacy of the project contract management arrangements. It
was concluded that adequate financial arrangements are in place at the PMU to properly manage
and control consultant contracts throughout the contract cycle, from planning and procurement to
contract execution.

54.     Regarding the fund flow arrangement, this was a fully decentralized project where each
city has its own responsibilities in managing project funds. This mechanism has proved to be
efficient since the project fund was allocated promptly. The capacity of all three cities has been
improved during project implementation. A total project fund of about US$229.5 million from
both IDA credits, the GEF grant, the PHRD trust fund, and counterpart fund was disbursed by
March 31, 2015.

2.4.4 Procurement Aspects

55.     The overall procurement performance under the project is assessed to be Satisfactory. The
procurement actions agreed with the PMUs based on the findings of the Procurement Capacity
Assessment have been largely implemented. For both the original credit and the AF, an 18-month
procurement plan was prepared at appraisal. The detailed procurement plans were also prepared
for each procurement package. In general, the procurement performance was found to be consistent
with the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines and the Legal Agreements. There were some delays in
procurement primarily due to the lack of efficiency and effectiveness in the procurement
management of a few complex packages and in dealing with price fluctuations. The Bank provided
support to accelerate the process, including further technical training on procurement to the PMUs
and joint development of the bidding documents. All the packages were then successfully awarded
and implemented. Complaints have been raised during the bidding processes of different packages
but they have also been dealt successfully to the satisfaction of the Bank and there has been no
mis-procurement while implementing the project. The PMUs were staffed with qualified
procurement staff who were familiar with the Bank’s procurement procedures. The bidding
processes for civil works were considered to be effective, resulting in savings compared to the pre-
bid cost estimates.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

56.     The O&M of the facilities constructed or rehabilitated under the project is crucial. The
various steps taken by the national government and provincial authorities, both during appraisal
and implementation of the project, are expected to contribute to the long-term use of the physical
structure and sustainability of the operation. More details are provided below.




                                                10
57.     Promulgation of clearer environmental decrees. In recent years, two decrees issued by
two different ministries have caused confusion and appeared to include some overlap: Decree
67/2003 issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, jointly with the Ministry
of Finance (MoF) and Decree 88/2007, issued by the Ministry of Construction (MoC). Both of
these have been replaced by revised decrees, Decrees 25/2013 and 80/2014, respectively, removing
some of the ambiguity. Decree 80/2014 allows a city to charge for a service that it provides. Decree
25/2013 is effectively a penalty for causing environmental pollution and its strategic objective is
to reduce pollution. The environmental fee or penalty is based on a measure of the mass of
pollutants discharged into the environment. The decrees encourage and allow the revenue collected
through penalty and user fee to be used by the cities to cover O&M and operational costs.

58.       Contingency provisions. The WWTPs were designed and implemented with the necessary
contingency provisions, such as backup generators, and future expansion needs. The systems are
also designed and implemented to accommodate the heavy runoff that Vietnam faces during the
rainy season. The plants were implemented with a provision to receive and treat septage that can
be collected using vacuum tracks. This has two advantages, allowing the plant to receive and treat
wastewater and sewage from the sewer lines and septic tanks. Emptying of the existing septic tanks
is still required on a regular basis.

59.     Considerations for follow-up operation. The three participating provinces have proposed
a combined new project of about US$119 million, pending an official request from the Ministry of
Planning and Investment (MPI). Anticipating a positive response, the cities have started their
planning process. In parallel, the cities have also started to explore new areas of income. This
includes treatment of waste for fertilizer in Dong Hoi City, an initial project proposal on waste
reuse for submission to the Gates Foundation, and others.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Relevance of objectives: High

60.     The project objectives were relevant at the time of the project design. The project was
aligned with the CAS at the time and continues to be highly relevant with the objectives of the
current Country Partnership Strategy. The objectives of the project also continue to be relevant to
the development plans of the three cities. Improving the urban environment was a central focus of
the government’s strategy, and the pressures on the urban environment that created the original
demand for the project have only increased.

Relevance of design and implementation: Substantial

61.     The project core components (that cover basic urban services) are directly targeted and the
activities identified under each component have high relevance to the PDOs and to the sector
policy in Vietnam that is, improving the urban environment. The PDOs were well stated, clearly
set to measure, and directly related to the final outcomes. The causal link between funding and
outcomes is rational and convincing, and potential exogenous factors were identified and factored




                                                11
in. Implementation arrangements were relevant as they reflected the government’s strategy of
decentralization, which was a priority.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

62.   PDO. “To improve the environmental sanitation in the project cities in a sustainable
manner and thereby enhancing the quality of life for city residents.”

Improve the environmental sanitation in the project cities: Substantial.

63.    All of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 investments were put into operation, which brought
benefits to more than 821,056 citizens in the three cities. City environment and flooding
improved due to the rehabilitated lakes, canals, and drains (about 456,247 people benefiting from
reduced incidence and severity of flooding), and solid waste management improved (about
821,056 people benefiting from solid waste collection). The effluent quality at all four waste water
treatment plants meet the national standards. Public and school sanitation operated satisfactorily,
which improved the sanitation facilities in public areas (beach, riversides, and markets) and for
66,516 pupils in schools.

64.     All planned investments as per the restructured scope were completed and most of
the intermediate indicators were fully achieved by project closing (November 30, 3014). New
sewers and interceptors were constructed and existing sewers were rehabilitated transporting waste
water efficiently to the four new treatment plants in the three cities. Sanitary landfills were built
and extended in all three cities and solid waste collection strengthened. Drains were constructed
and rehabilitated and capacity of flood retention ponds enhanced. See further Annex 2 for a
detailed list of all project outputs. Two intermediate results related to connections to the piped
waste water network and the BOD removal amounts were only partially achieved as the underlying
assumptions proved unrealistic. The rate of connection was initially slow but has been picking
up during the later years of project implementation based on intensified outreach and
communication campaigns.

65.     Revolving fund contributed to the improved access to sanitation. The HH revolving
fund allowed about 8,236 HHs to install toilets or get connected to the tertiary sewer lines,
benefiting more than 37,062 people. Women in Vietnam have experience regarding revolving
funds under the Vietnam Social Policy Bank through the facilitation of the Women’s Union. This
project has taken a step further in empowering participants to make an informed decision among
competing demands. Understanding the impact of sanitation on health, family well-being, and
productivity (and the impact on poverty) in general and making a strategic decision to invest a
small amount to provide a toilet or connect a house to a nearby tertiary sewer line is the impact of
the IEC used under the project. This clearly shows the project contribution to the women’s decision
making in the participating HHs. It also strengthened further the identification, appraisal,
implementation, and monitoring capacity of the local Women’s Unions.

66.     Full cost recovery of wastewater O&M is achieved in a sustainable manner:
Substantial. The tariff schedule recommended during appraisal was designed to achieve gradual
and full cost recovery at project closing while ensuring affordability. All three cities have been
seriously pursuing the increased tariff roadmap strategies to provide sufficient revenue to the



                                                 12
service provider to operate the system and finance depreciation of short-lived assets such as
vehicles and equipment and any loan interest charges. While the actual tariff set for wastewater
during 2008–2013 was less than the tariff recommended during appraisal, it was sufficient to fully
cover O&M costs in all the three cities as early as 2008 and sustain the tariff through 2014,
covering more than twice the O&M costs (221.5 percent in Dong Hoi, 222 percent in Nha Trang,
and 106.84 percent in Quy Nhon). This performance could be explained by increased service
coverage, improved technical and managerial capacity of service providers, and effective demand
management through enhanced awareness of beneficiaries.

 Box 1. Tariff increases.                              67. Full recovery of solid waste
 Despite the sensitivity of issues related with cost   provider costs from users fees in two out
 recovery, provincial and city authorities have        of three cities. The actual tariff
 taken consistent measures in the right direction.     recommended for solid waste during
                                                       appraisal for Nha Trang and Dong Hoi was

     increased progressively since 2008 and was providers and city and provincial
     VND 21,007 per HH per month in 2014. The departments; to ensure the long-term
     respective PPCs have also agreed to provide effectiveness of the project investments;
     financial resources to mitigate the short-term and to the community groups and
     financial constraint that service providers nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to
     might face.                                        support project implementation and
                                                        maximize benefits from the project
investments. The capacity-building component addressed critical elements through the PHRD
grant with the co-financing of this grant for the service providers and city departments to ensure
long-term sustainability of the project investments, including (a) institutional study to establish
long-term structure and staffing for service providers; (b) assistance in installation and
commissioning of FM, information monitoring, and billing/collection software for the service
providers and training in its use; (c) joint development of procedures and plans to support O&M
of new or rehabilitated project facilities; (d) technical and managerial training to the service
providers; (e) organization of relevant training, workshops, and study tours; and (f) miscellaneous
other capacity-building activities. The PHRD grant was further extended to build the capacity of


                                                 13
the city and provincial departments to ensure long-term effectiveness of the project investments
and to the community groups and NGOs to support project implementation and maximize benefits
from the project investments. The PMUs have equally benefited from the grant.

69.    Capacity building for design and implementation of an HCP includes (a) development of
the framework for design and implementation of the HCP; (b) implementation of the HCP,
including training and public awareness, small investments in goods and works, and small grants;
and (c) preparation and delivery of public awareness campaigns to support sanitation behavior
change, benefits from the project, and its costs.

70.     The project resulted in important health, environmental, and aesthetic benefits
thereby enhancing the quality of life for city residents. There are substantial economic benefits
arising from the project for service quality, wastewater collection and treatment, and improved
sanitation, resulting in important health, environmental, and aesthetic benefits. Economic activities
related to the East Sea off the three coastal cities, such as tourism and fisheries, are dependent on
water quality and will also be enhanced with the reduction of untreated wastewater effluent
discharges to the ocean. All the physical project outputs have been important in facilitating
environmentally sustainable growth in the project cities. Reduction in the discharge of untreated
wastewater and improved solid waste collection and disposal have improved the urban
environment and living conditions in the cities, reduced the risks to health due to groundwater
contamination, and helped preserve the viability of fishery resources. It was recorded that the
annual economic growth of the participating cities has significantly increased about 12–14 percent
in recent years.

71.      Contribution to property value appreciation. In the three project cities, the rehabilitated
channels, flood drainage systems, sewer intercepts, dredged waterways, and constructed
embankments are greatly contributing to appreciation of property values and improved quality of
life for residents. In the participating cities, the impact from the rehabilitated lakes, channel, river,
and drains is very visible. Apart from the sprouting of small businesses (coffee houses, restaurants,
convenience stores, and others), residents whose backyards faced the lake and the river earlier
have started to convert their backyard into a front yard to face the beautiful scenery. The positive
changes that the project has introduced have been duly recognized by the national governement.
For example, Dong Hoi City has been upgraded from a Class III city to Class II, as approved by
the Prime Minister on July 8, 2014.

72.     GEO. “To pilot and promote the replication of a new, more efficient wastewater
treatment technology, which would contribute to improving in an integrated manner the
health and habitat conditions of globally significant marine and coastal ecosystems along the
coastline of Vietnam.” Substantial

73.     The GEF grant, together with financing from the project, enabled successful completion of
the Nhon Binh WWTP (14,000 m3/day capacity) in Quy Nhon City. This plant benefited about
60,000 people. The plant was connected to a sewerage system financed under the project. The
plant was formally handed over to the service provider in October 2014. The actual average flow
to the plant is 13,000 m3/day, influent BOD5 quality is in the range of 60–100 mg/l, and the effluent
BOD5 is less than 20 mg/l, meeting the standards of QCVN 14/2008 and TCVN 7222/2002. The
results of recent monitoring undertaken on influent and effluent at the WWTP shows that the


                                                   14
effluent is of high quality and meets the objective of improving the health and habitat conditions
of the East Sea. The achievement of the GEO is rated as Substantial.

3.3 Efficiency

74.     The financial and economic analysis of the project was updated at completion based on the
actual financial and economic data. Overall, the efficiency is rated as Substantial.

3.3.1 Financial Analysis

75.     Fiscal impact. As indicated earlier, the high inflation rate in Vietnam 1 and the global
financial crisis during the life of the project affected the project financing and increased the level
of counterpart funding. The total resources spent from all sources at project closing was US$229.5
million, of which US$35.36 million (15 percent of total project expenditure) was covered by
counterpart funding. However, the fiscal burden to the cities due to the increased counterpart
funding did not exceed the manageable limit, accounting for 14.24 percent of the expenditure in
Nha Trang, 4 percent in Quy Nhon, and 9 percent in Dong Hoi.

76.     Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR). The actual FIRR for wastewater, updated
based on data at project closing, is significantly higher than the discount rate (10–12 percent) and
varies among cities, ranging from 25.5 percent for Quy Nhon to 43.7 percent for Nha Trang.
Though slightly lower than the return estimated at appraisal, the FIRR for solid waste is also higher
than the discount rate, 21.6 percent for Dong Hoi and 19.5 percent for Nha Trang. Though the
solid waste in Quy Nhon shows a negative FIRR (-0.7 percent), the economic benefit has justified
the project. This is mainly explained by the small proportion (30 percent) of O&M costs covered
from revenue collected from tariff.

3.3.2 Economic Analysis

77.     The project is expected to have various economic benefits, including reduced flood damage,
improved health, increased tourism, creation of new business opportunities, appreciation of land
values, and savings in drainage maintenance. However, the only benefits considered in the analysis
are from reduced flood damage, increase in tourism income, septage and drainage cost savings,
and health expenditure savings. Other benefits are excluded due to data limitations and lack of
bases for making reasonable assumptions. The actual overall Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) at project closing was estimated at 29.3 percent compared with 18.5 percent at project
appraisal.

78.     The benefits mainly arise from economic growth through reduced flood damage (67
percent of total annual benefits at the ICR stage compared to 60 percent at the project appraisal
stage) and health benefits (21 percent at the ICR stage compared to 10 percent at appraisal). The
benefit from tourism decreased from 18 percent at the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) stage



1
  The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Vietnamese dong was 15,969 at the time of appraisal (2006), but by
October 2014, the rate had fallen to 21,245.



                                                        15
to 5 percent at the ICR stage due to the conservative estimate as a result of lack of quantitative
evidence on the contribution of sanitation to tourism growth.

79.     The actual FIRR and EIRR of the project in both wastewater and solid waste are
significantly higher than the opportunity cost of capital, implying that the project is still financially
and economically viable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     The project’s development objectives and design were highly relevant and the achievement
of the PDO/GEO outcomes were substantial with very good efficiency. However, there were some
minor shortcomings - the costs at appraisal were underestimated (due to the use of national
construction cost norms that were lower than market reference) which led to a significant increase
in implementation costs. Also, two of the intermediate indicator targets were overestimated and
only achieved partially. Overall outcome achievement is thus rated as “Moderately Satisfactory”.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

81.     The water, wastewater, and solid waste components have directly provided local temporary
job opportunities in the three cities during construction and over 150 permanent jobs on the
WWTPs, conveyance cisterns, and SWM. Reduction in the discharge of untreated wastewater and
improved solid waste collection and disposal have improved the urban environment and living
conditions in the cities, reduced the risks to health due to groundwater contamination, and helped
preserve the viability of fishery resources. As a facilitator of sustainable economic development,
the project will have continuing beneficial poverty alleviation and social impacts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

82.     The Vietnamese government is devolving responsibility and accountability from the
central government to the provinces and cities. The experience of the PPC, the PMUs, and service
providers through the implementation of this project and experience in Bank procurement, FM,
and safeguards procedures has enormously helped to have a clear institutional roadmap. To this
end, the project was able to support the strengthening of the URENCOs with a comprehensive
program to produce accounting systems, an O&M manual, a regulatory framework for private
sector participation, environmental monitoring, and HR training.

83.      The project has stimulated discussion and played a catalytic role for authorities to look into
the legal framework. The promulgation of Decree 25/2013 and Decree 80/2014 was the right action
at the right time. These important legal frameworks will help strengthen the institutional setup of
environmental sanitation in Vietnam, with clear mandates, source of revenue, and the right
instrument for enforcement.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

84.    The project has created numerous intangible benefits that were not anticipated during the
design of the project. Among many, the ones worth mentioning are listed.

85.    Shelter and refuge for fishing boats during cyclone and heavy storm. Vietnam has a
long sea shoreline and annual storms and occasional cyclones cause heavy damage. The primary
victims in such situations are fishing boats, which are the main source of livelihood for many
people. Since most of the storm sanctuaries were filled with weeds and silt that denied the fishing
boats access to safe havens to avoid the first direct hits, the dredging of these access routes and
removal of the weeds and silt in the Dong Hoi subproject proved highly beneficial.

86.      Education learning centers (ELCs). The construction of the WWTPs has made it easy to
make research and training facilities available in all three cities. Three ELCs within the WWTP’s
area were established to support research and serve as education centers. The newly built plants
are well organized, with state-of-the-art technology for collecting, organizing, and disseminating
relevant data. In Dong Hoi and Nha Trang, different delegations and groups have visited the ELCs.
In recent months, it was reported that some teams of overseas and Vietnamese students used the
facility for partial fulfillment of the requirements for their studies.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

87.     A review workshop on the draft ICR was conducted that brought together more than 30
participants, including representatives from the MoF, MoC, the PPCs, City People’s Committees
(CPCs), and PMUs from the three subproject cities; representatives from the design and
construction supervision consultants; and the World Bank team. The three project cities presented
project details, including cumulative achievements, areas of physical implementation, financial
performance, procurement and safeguards, and challenges and lessons.

88.    Participants, particularly the PMUs from the three cities, shared presentations with pictures
to demonstrate the positive environmental contribution of the project to their cities. Canals, rivers,
and beaches have become cleaner when the wastewater has been collected and treated before being
discharged into the environment. Living conditions of local communities have improved and the
number of locations being flooded during the rainy season has reduced.

89.    The Bank team shared the draft rating on various aspects of the project and reminded the
gathering that this will be finalized after the review by the Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG). Participants expressed their general satisfaction and endorsement of the current rating.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Moderate

90.     The main risk to the development outcome relates to the ability to operate and maintain the
infrastructure. In the coming years, for proper services, O&M costs are estimated to increase but
would still be recoverable according to the approved city roadmaps. This risk is assessed as
Moderate given the measures taken to strengthen the PMUs and the service providers and the
progress toward cost recovery. The results of recent monitoring undertaken on influent and effluent


                                                 17
at the WWTPs of the three cities shows that the effluent is of high quality and meets the objective
of improving the health and habitat conditions of the East Sea. This led to the conclusion that there
are no risks to the global environmental outcomes.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     The project was designed appropriately for the conditions at the design stage and
incorporated lessons learned from the previous operation in the wastewater and solid waste
subsector. The PDO and the intermediate indicators were properly designed and reflect that
sufficient attention was paid to designing practical M&E systems. The project design attempted to
simplify procurement procedures. The design of the project correctly anticipated the associated
risks in dealing with cost recovery and put in place a pragmatic step-by-step approach to the risk.
However, the survey exercise and cost projection was somehow underestimated and thus led to a
significant increase of implementation costs. The performance of the Bank to ensure quality at
entry is thus rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

92.     The project supervision team carried out regular implementation support missions twice a
year. For some urgent and important issues, a number of intensive follow-up missions were also
conducted. The project benefited from a high level of continuity within the IDA team and co-
financiers throughout preparation and supervision. The task team leader (TTL) for the project was
also a TTL for the predecessor IDA project (Three Cities Sanitation Project - P051553) and as
most team members were based in Vietnam, it was possible to carry out supervision continuously,
on an as-needed basis rather than intermittently. The task team consistently raised areas of concern,
such as cost recovery and delays in procurement and site compensation. However progress data
was not updated regularly, leading to a rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

93.     The task team focused much of its attention on the implementation of the civil works, RAPs,
proper functioning of the revolving fund, and raising of awareness on hygiene and sanitation issues
among the community at large and women and students in particular. This attention no doubt
contributed to the generally satisfactory delivery of the engineering outputs with good
workmanship, commissioning of all WWTPs and solid waste sites, and construction of 72 latrine
blocks with hand washing facility to schools and others by the original closing date. The team’s
oversight and participation in strengthening of the PMUs and service providers was critical and
contributed to the improved managerial and technical capacity of the entities.

                                                 18
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94.     By the time the project was presented to the Board, all prefeasibility studies were approved
by the prime minister’s office and review and approval of detail designs was fully delegated to the
provincial authorities. However, the use of national construction cost norms that are lower than
market reference led to underestimation of the project cost, which, coupled with high inflation and
the global financial crisis, created a financing gap. Though this was addressed by processing an
AF, the Government’s performance during the project preparation was rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.     The implementation arrangement as discussed in this ICR was largely decentralized to
project cities, with oversight and facilitation from the center. As this was the first project to be
decentralized at the city level, the start-up activities were slow. The measures taken to strengthen
the PMUs and the service providers and the progress toward cost recovery vary from city to city.
The Government provided good support in many areas, including the provision of counterpart
funds. In the first stage of the project, the Government was not able to adequately respond to the
Bank’s concern about procurement. However, following enhanced implementation support and
training from the Bank, the PMUs remained proactive and effectively used consultant inputs. The
low turnover of the implementing agency staff in the course of project implementation helped
maintain institutional memory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.     The performance of the Government in the initial approval of prefeasibility studies,
delegation of detail design clearance to the provincial authorities, meeting counterpart funds, and
putting in place clearer legislation are all positive steps for the success of the project. The
introduction of gradual cost recovery measures are also steps in the right direction. The Women’s
Union’s role in managing the revolving fund component and the participatory manner in which
that component was designed and implemented are good examples of the client’s commitment to
the project.

6. Lessons Learned

97.     WWTP technology selection. In the past, the decision makers’ lack of clear understanding
on appropriate technical options and the limited land available for the WWTPs resulted in the use
of more expensive and technically complex facilities. WWTPs which emphasize low power
consumption, resource recovery from sludge, or reuse of treated wastewater were not given high
priority. This project has from the initial stage exposed the decision makers to the available options
by organizing visits to neighboring countries (Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand). The result of
this exercise is the decision taken by the Dong Hoi CPC to opt for lagoons with the option to


                                                 19
upgrade the system later to an oxidation pond and a full-fledged WWTP or to add more lagoons
to treat more waste in the future. The decision taken by the other two cities on the choice of
technology also clearly reflects the results of this approach and their due consideration for the
availability of land for the chosen technology.

98.     HH connections. For public sewerage systems, HH connections are essential components
to ensure that most of the organic loading is conveyed to the treatment facility and sufficient flow
is maintained for the system to function properly. Connection to the HH was an issue in the past
because tertiary lines were not extended close to the HHs, thereby imposing heavy financial burden
on HHs if they attempted to connect. The project’s extension of the secondary sewer lines to
tertiary lines make it much easier for HHs to connect. This helped a lot in increasing the number
of houses connected. However, there are still houses that are not connected because their septic
tanks are in the backyard and any attempt to connect requires excavation in the middle of the living
room of the houses. City authorities need to enhance their sensitization and promotion activities
using the available IEC tools but also need to think of other incentive mechanisms to encourage
the remaining HHs to connect.

99.     Adaptability to context, timely design review, and enhanced contract management.
As referred to in this ICR, the project required an AF to meet financing gaps that arise as a result
of the global financial crisis and the cost underestimation due to the use of the national construction
cost norms at appraisal that were less than the market costs. The initial price contingency factored
in (5 percent) at appraisal was not sufficient to meet such gaps. These and associated challenges
were the reasons for the project’s low disbursement rate in the initial years of implementation.
Realizing this, the borrower and the Bank team took proactive measures that reversed the
disbursement trend around the last quarter of 2011. The measures included review of designs and
costs, revising the implementation schedule, strengthening of contract administration, and others.
The need to adapt and timely respond to emerging context is what this project renders as as a
lesson. This was the result of strong contract management that allowed complex engineering
structures to be completed to the required quality, tested, and commissioned on time and within
the allowable variation orders.

100. Financial commitment and cost recovery. One of the important lessons from this project
is the role that cost recovery has in insuring the financial health of such an operation.
Understanding cost recovery as key for financial sustainability, the project has set a target and
made it a condition for each city to raise the tariff to a level that will allow the city to cover O&M
costs. In Nha Trang, the conditions have been fully met for wastewater and SWM services but for
Dong Hoi and Quy Nhon, the conditions have only been partially met. As indicated in the PAD,
this is an understandable challenge as in some cases the increase means more than double and
triple the tariffs in a short span of time. Though provincial PPCs have injected resources for service
providers to run smoothly during the transition period, having a clear roadmap, as is the case in
Dong Hoi (from VND 365 per m3 in 2007 to VND 3,111 per m3 in 2017), will help the cities set a
clear and measurable target. The recently issued revised Decrees 80/2014 and 25/2013 clearly state
the cost recovery principle, but provincial and city authorities should continue their commitment
and not slip back.

101. Public awareness and behavior change. The project has raised the profile of public
awareness, the benefits of which were otherwise forgotten. Whereas it is important for the local


                                                  20
authorities to have the necessary tools to charge customers for sanitation services, it is equally
important that the customers themselves be aware of the benefits and be willing to pay for those
services. This helps in enhancing participation by communities, makes investment planning more
participatory, and minimizes the top-down approach. The result of such an approach is better
understanding of the community regarding the environment and public health benefits of a well-
designed and operated wastewater system. The outcome is a willingness to pay to achieve cost
recovery and encouragement to connect to the wastewater system. However, public awareness,
particularly related to public health, should not be a one-time activity but has to be continuous. As
there is a danger of missing critical messages and slipping back and since there are still HHs that
are not connected, the aggressive IEC campaign at the beginning of the project has to continue
with the same momentum. New messages, such as proper sorting of waste at the HH level, need
to be introduced in the IEC packages.

102. Compensation and resettlement process. All coastal cities in Vietnam had weak soil
formation and hence, construction methods are critical to minimize the damages to existing
structures located near deep excavation sites. Damages could be reduced if the scope of land
acquisition at the start of work is determined taking into account the soil foundation factor. Related
to this, as the land management system in Vietnam is still weak, identification of land ownership
and land use history should be more accurate to avoid ongoing complaints from the affected people.
Avoiding changes to compensation policy during resettlement implementation is also critical in
minimizing complaints, and there is a need for timely redress of grievances in close dialogue with
the PAP to make the compensation and resettlement process a success.

103. Promoting efficient institutional and regulatory arrangements at the local level. To
improve the effectiveness of service delivery, the current relationship of the PMUs in each city
with the service providers needs to be changed in line with the provisions of Decrees 80/2014 and
25/2013. The relationship with the service providers has to be replaced with a clear management
contract for O&M of the wastewater systems. Regulations by the local authorities regarding
wastewater should include standard designs for the construction of septic tanks, mandatory
desludging, and step-by-step measures to encourage HHs to connect. The complementary co-
financing PHRD grant to implementation agencies, relevant service providers, city and provincial
departments, community groups, NGOs, and other relevant agencies has proved to be a support at
the right time and at the right place. Lessons can be drawn from this on the importance of preceding
capacity building to investments and the positive impact this will have on the long-term use of
project benefits.

104. Programmatic or city-by-city approach. Vietnam has quite a number of medium-sized
cities that are growing fast and looking for an intervention on environmental sanitation. The
rational question to raise here would be whether a programmatic approach for this situation would
fit better rather than the traditional single investment lending for each city. Urban environmental
sanitation intervention is highly contextual and varies widely from city to city (characteristic of
waste, differences in urban economy, land, sources of waste, and others). Both approaches have
their own pros and cons and opening up wider consultation and debate will help arrive at a more
informed and sustainable instrument.

105. Potential for self-standing women’s development operation. One of the successful
components under this project is Component 5 (HH revolving fund and school sanitation program).


                                                 21
It has benefited 8,236 HHs with 37,062 people (at an average 4.5 people per HH), the loan return
rate is 100 percent, and the efficiency and ownership of both the Women’s Unions and the
beneficiaries is quite exemplary. A small financial injection (US$200 per HH at a service charge
of 0.5 percent per month in two years) has brought transformational change to the HHs and the
community at large. The Women’s Union has been following clearly set objective criteria that are
poverty focused, to select the first round of beneficiaries and has a long waiting list. The Women’s
Union has similar experience under the Vietnam Social Policy Bank. Currently, a quick review of
the Bank dashboard for Vietnam shows that the portfolio does not include an operation solely
geared toward women. Projects and programs under the Bank’s portfolio might have elements here
and there that include gender dimensions. The experience under Component 5 of this project
clearly shows that there is great potential for this kind of operation. The Women’s Unions have
sufficient experience, an extensive network at the grassroots level, and there is a demonstrated
demand. It will be helpful for both the government and the Bank to further explore this.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       This annex provides an update of the financial and economic analysis at the completion of
the project based on the actual performance of the project activities and assumptions, especially
tariff roadmaps, and other finance-related commitments consistently following the methodology
and models developed during project appraisal.

Financial Analysis

Financing Arrangement and Fiscal Impact

2.      The counterpart funds have been properly allocated for the project, as in table 3.1. As
envisaged during appraisal, the counterpart fund in Dong Hoi that accounted for 7–18 percent of
the city’s annual expenditure has received significant support from the central government. In the
other cities of Nha Trang and Quy Nhon, the average annual counterpart fund required about VND
21–23 billion or about 4 percent of the current total annual city capital expenditure. Except in Dong
Hoi, during peak implementation periods, counterpart funds did not exceed a manageable level of
9 percent of the city’s capital expenditure budget.

Wastewater and Solid Waste Cost Recovery and Tariff

3.      It was assumed in the PAD that wastewater and solid water tariffs, in line with government
policy, were recovered through O&M costs, deprecation of short-lived assets such as vehicles and
equipment, and any loan interest charges, by the end of the project. It was also assumed that tariffs
have been gradually increased from 2007 to 2014 to allow the service providers to achieve the
required levels of cost recovery so that subsidies to the WSDCs and URENCOs can be eliminated
before project implementation completion in 2014. The cost recovery schedules for the service

providers have been agreed with local governments and their implementation is a project covenant.
In practice, the implementation of the project covenant on tariff roadmap is as in these tables.

4.       All three cities have been seriously pursuing the increased tariff roadmap strategies to
recover O&M costs and gradually recover capital investment. The data show that wastewater
tariffs in all three cities have been recovered well through O&M costs although actual tariffs have
been lower than recommended by the PAD for 2007–2014. In the coming years, for proper services,
O&M costs are estimated to be increased but still recoverable with the approved city roadmaps.
Solid waste charges, on the other hand, which have been set close to the rates in the PAD have
enabled the URENCOs in Nha Trang and Dong Hoi in recovering their O&M costs in 2013.
However, the solid waste recovery rate of Quy Nhon is only 30 percent despite its higher charges
as calculated at appraisal.

Affordability Analysis

5.     Besides the recovery target, the tariff and charge roadmaps need to ensure affordability of
the poor in the project cities as well. Updated analyses show that the combined costs of water
supply, wastewater, and solid waste charges in 2013 account for 3.1–3.4 percent of the monthly
income of poor HHs in the three cities, which still remain around the affordability level of 5 percent
of HH income.

Financial Internal Rates of Return

6.      The updated FIRR for each subproject is summarized below. The FIRRs of 25.5–43.7
percent (wastewater) and 19.5–21.6 percent (solid waste) are slightly higher compared to the PAD
due to adjustments and changes during project implementation. The rates are higher than the
weighted average cost of capital of 10–12 percent. It is to be noted that the updated financial
analysis for purchase of VND 18 billion equipment for the URENCO Quy Nhon results in an FIRR
of -0.7 percent. This arises from the fact that solid waste charge revenues in Quy Nhon have not
been sufficient to recover O&M costs as specified in the above section on recovery analysis.

Economic Analysis

7.      At the appraisal phase, the economic analysis of the project was based both on cost-benefit
analysis (CBA) and least-cost analysis (LCA) because of the uncertainties with CBA, particularly
the difficulties in accurately quantifying some of the environmental benefits and local economic
development benefits. LCA was therefore conducted throughout component selection and
preliminary design to ensure that the selected investments are the most economical interventions.
At the ICR stage, an updated CBA was carried out to reflect project design changes—cost as well
as assumptions.

8.       The benefits of the project as listed in the PAD include (a) reduced flood damage; (b) health
benefits; (c) savings in installation and emptying of septic tanks; (d) savings in drainage
maintenance; (e) increased tourism due to an improved environment for tourists and potential
investors; (f) improved financial positions of the WSDC and URENCO as tariffs are increased,
resulting in better management in the provision of services, which will eventually eliminate
subsidies from the provincial governments; (g) enhancement of the development potential of the
cities, especially the areas along canals and previously flooded areas; (h) creation of new business
opportunities such as restaurants, retail stores, and other entertainment activities; and (i) land value
appreciation in the area, the extent of which will largely depend on the new economic activities
that will be created arising from the proposed investments. The following five benefits were
quantified in the PAD and repeated consistently in the updated analysis for compatible results:

   (a) Reduced flood damages. Damages due to floods include direct and indirect damages.
       Direct damages result when houses, buildings, and other structures; HH goods; shop
       merchandise; roads; and vehicles are affected by floodwater. Indirect damages are the
       consequential losses, including loss of trade, loss of income for employers and employees,
       restrictions on traveling, costs of evacuation and reinstatement, and costs of cleaning-up
       operations. Flood control and drainage improvement projects primarily stabilize land and
       infrastructure, which otherwise are at risk of destruction and loss from floods. Benefits
       have been measured as the avoided costs of damaged structures and the additional
       maintenance costs that would have been incurred on inundated major roads. Although, in
       principle, the costs of delays in economic activities and disruption to traffic should be
       included among the benefits, these costs are difficult to estimate and therefore were not
       accounted for. To produce the flood damages savings, the analysis relied on updated data
       on loss due to floods in Vietnam, in general, and in project cities, in particular.

   (b) Health benefits. An improved hygienic environment will directly benefit the populace of
       each of the cities. It is anticipated that the construction of new WWTPs will improve the
       quality of receiving waters by reducing the pollution load to rivers, beaches, and seashores.
       Drainage improvement will also significantly reduce stagnant water, thereby reducing the
       breeding grounds of mosquitoes and other disease-bearing insect vectors. Construction of
       new sewers will decrease the amount of wastewater discharged into open drainage channels,
       thereby reducing the risk of water-related health problems. The solid waste subprojects will
       promote safe and hygienic disposal of solid waste, reduce blockages of sewers and drains,
       and reduce airborne particulate concentration arising from burning garbage and windblown
       dust. Also, garbage piles will be reduced and hence improve the environmental condition
       of the cities. All these are expected to translate into a reduction in risks of diseases and


                                                  31
       illnesses associated with an unhygienic environment as well as water-related diseases such
       as diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, and typhoid. Health benefits were measured from expected
       savings in medical care and loss in income due to illness and death. The benefit was
       calculated based on the findings of surveys and research by the World Health Organization
       (WHO) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on the impact of floods on public health
       and the updated data on HH incomes in project cities in 2014.

   (c) Savings in installation and desludging of septic tanks. All new construction in the
       participating cities are required to have a septic tank to avoid direct discharge of wastewater
       into the drainage system. For old urban areas in all cities, as the drainage system is partially
       separate from the sewer system (the combined sewer system includes interceptor sewers to
       split and transmit wastewater to the WWTP), it is necessary to maintain most septic tanks
       for preliminary treatment of black water before the tanks are connected to the city's sewer
       network. Disconnection of septic tanks is a major issue for most HHs as the entire house
       plumbing has to be reconstructed. Septic tank disconnection is a major and difficult issue
       which has to be carefully addressed and implemented in the future. Costs for installation
       and desludging of septic tanks in 2014 in the project cities have been updated.

   (d) Savings in drainage maintenance. The drainage operating costs are expected to be
       reduced with the improvement of the SWM system due to a reduction in the need to clean
       waste from open drains. The analysis has been updated using the current unit costs for
       drainage maintenance at the 2014 price and the cost of the drainage network built and/or
       rehabilitated by the project in each of cities.

   (e) Increase in tourism income. Tourism is an emerging industry in the participating cities.
       The project will play an important role in accelerating the development of tourism in these
       cities. For the analysis, the benefits are measured by the increase in tourist arrivals due to
       an improved environment for the tourists and an increase in expenditures per tourist
       primarily because of the longer duration of visits. In the PAD, an annual growth rate of 5
       percent in tourist arrivals for the participating cities was assumed in the ‘without’ project
       case. Implementation of the project is assumed to increase the growth rate to 5.5 percent.
       In the updated analysis, statistics on tourist arrivals, revenue, and expenditure in each of
       the three cities from 2007 to 2014 were used.

9.     The whole project brings in an annual benefit of VND 1,658 billion and benefit
composition is similar to that in the PAD. The benefits mainly arise from economic growth through
reduced flood damage (67 percent of total annual benefits at ICR compared to 60 percent at PAD)
and health benefits (21 percent at ICR compared to 10 percent at PAD). The benefit from tourism
decreases from 18 percent at PAD to 5 percent at ICR as a conservative assumption has been made
because of lack of quantitative evidence on contribution of sanitation to tourism growth.

10.     Summary of the CBA. The project has an EIRR of 29.5 percent, which is higher than the
12 percent discount rate that was assumed. The updated analysis confirms the robustness of the
project in its contribution to economic growth in the participating cities. Further benefits that could
not be readily quantified include the financial sustainability of the service providers, enhancement
of the development potential of the cities in general, creation of new economic opportunities, and
land value appreciation in the area.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

An ICR stakeholder workshop was carried out on April 15, 2015, at the World Bank office in
Hanoi. The minutes of the meeting are given below.

Introduction and Background

1.      A World Bank team led by Mr. Le Duy Hung (Senior Infrastructure Specialist, Task Team
Leader) and including Mr. Tesfaye Bekalu (Senior Water and Sanitation Specialist, ICR Lead
Author) and Ms. Phung Thi Tuyet (Program Assistant), visited Vietnam on the final mission for
the Vietnam Coastal Cities Environmental Sanitation Project (CCESP) (P082295) during April
13–21, 2015. The objectives of the mission were are to (a) share the draft ICR and confirm the
consistency of the project indicators and cost tables; (b) conduct an ICR review workshop on April
15, 2015, for representatives of the line ministries and participating provinces to discuss the project
findings, assessment, and relevant ratings; and (c) discuss the views and recommendations of the
line ministries on the project design and implementation.

2.      The workshop was well attended, with more than 30 participants and included
representatives from the MoF, MoC, MPI, PPC, CPC, PMUs from the three subproject cities,
representatives from the design and construction supervision consultants, the Bank team (the list
of participants is attached in this annex).

3.      The workshop commenced with a round of participant introductions and opening remarks
by Mr. Son Duy Nguyen (Senior Operations Officer, EACVF) representing the World Bank
Vietnam country office. This was followed by the Bank team sharing the ICR key findings,
including evaluations and ratings. The PMU members shared the respective presentations from the
three subproject cities on the lessons learned and their comments on the draft ICR. All the three
PMUs presented an excellent, detailed project end summary that includes cumulative
achievements, areas of physical implementation, financial performance, procurement and
safeguards, and challenges and lessons learned from the project.

4.      The ICR mission early findings of project achievements, major challenges, and lessons
learned are consistent with the government presentations and the issues raised during the
discussion. The workshop saw active participation from the line ministries, subproject cities, and
relevant consultants. It was very important to exchange ideas and factor in lessons in the design of
future projects. The following section highlights the major areas of observation as shared by the
participants.

5.       Positive contribution to the cities. The participants, particularly the PMUs from the three
cities, shared presentations with pictures to demonstrate the positive environmental contribution
of the project to their cities. Canals, rivers, and beaches have become cleaner when the wastewater
has been collected and treated before being discharged into the environment. Living conditions of
local communities have improved and the number of locations being flooded during the rainy
season has reduced.

6.    Rating. The Bank team shared the draft rating on various aspects of the project and
reminded the gathering that this will be finalized after the review by the Bank’s IEG. Participants



                                                  37
expressed their general satisfaction and endorsement of the current rating. Some participants
expressed their reservation on the Moderately Satisfactory rating of the Bank’s performance, with
a view that this rating is based more on the borrower performance and external factors than the
Bank’s performance. The meeting noted that this rating is to be left for management and IEG
decision.

7.      Procurement. Participants expressed their satisfaction with the Bank’s procurement
guidelines and procedures in ensuring value for money regarding public resources, efficiency, and
accountability. However, participants noted the difference between the procurement guidelines
and the GoV practices. It was agreed that it will be beneficial if the GoV practices are aligned more
to the Bank’s procurement guidelines and procedures to ensure benefits. Both the MoF and the
Bank team have made a note to look into areas that need refinement and contribute to the
procurement reform discussion in Vietnam at appropriate and relevant forums.

8.      Inflation and its effects. The participants narrated the effects of inflation that Vietnam
experienced during 2007–2008, particularly on the cost of some basic construction items such as
cement, steel, and labor. The subproject cities also shared information about the adjustments that
they have made in response to inflation and confirmed that the inflation does not have an impact
on the outcomes of the project.

9.       Technical. There were several interrelated technical issues such as (a) undertaking
topographical surveys and geological investigations before the commencement of works contracts;
(b) expediting issuance of construction permits; (c) continuously involving design consultants in
project implementation; and (d) closely monitoring the influent quality from the combined sewer.
Specific reference was made to the observations on CEPT technology and the quality of the
effluent coming from the trickling filter. The representative from the MoC has taken note of these
technical issues and acknowledged that these are important observations that need to be considered
in designing and implementing similar operations in the future.

10.     Social safeguards and compensation. The example of delayed social safeguards action
and the compensation issue in Quy Nhon was discussed at length and it was agreed that there is a
need to address these kinds of social safeguards issues as early as possible. The meeting learned
that based on the 2011 estimate, a compensation package has been deposited at the province’s
treasurer and both the PPC and CPC are following up closely.

11.      Follow-up operation. The follow-up operation was also discussed. The meeting learned
that all the three subproject cities have prepared a follow-up intervention with a cumulative scope
of about US$119 million. The MPI acknowledged that the request is with the ministry and shortly
an internal discussion as well as a discussion with the Bank on the various instruments will be
conducted.

12.     Contents of the ICR and the way forward. Participants raised concerns that the ICR
presentation missed some major factors affecting implementation; strategic approaches adopted
and their evaluation; and the performance, weaknesses, and recommendations. However, it was
stated that what has been shared in this workshop is an abridged PowerPoint presentation, and the
team assured that the main ICR has more details and responds to the concerns raised. However,
the Bank team also took on the task to double-check and review the ICR again to address the


                                                 38
comments and inputs from the meeting and update the ICR. The Bank team promised to share the
final version with all the implementing agencies.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's Project Completion Report and/or Comments on Draft
ICR

1.      Project objectives, changes, and quality at entry. The original objective of the CCESP,
as defined in the PAD; Report No 34507-VN, dated June 21, 2006, was to improve environmental
sanitation in project cities in a sustainable manner and thereby enhance residents’ quality of life.
The project was divided into three subprojects for each of the three project cities: Nha Trang, Dong
Hoi, and Quy Nhon. The GEO of the GEF grant to Quy Nhon was to improve the health and habitat
conditions of the East Sea, which is seen as a globally significant marine and coastal ecosystem
along the coastline of Vietnam.

2.      Although there have been some changes in project content and the detailed design of some
components during implementation, there has been no change in the overall project objectives
during implementation. There were some minor changes in the subprojects, for example, deletion
of two planned WWTPs (in Nha Trang and Quy Nhon) as well as the transfer of responsibility for
the construction of a small hospital WWTP in Dong Hoi. The extent of the primary, secondary,
and tertiary sewerage networks was reduced in the project cities.

3.       With regard to the project’s quality at entry, preparation of the physical investments at
appraisal has proved generally satisfactory. The feasibility studies and engineering design for each
project component (as well as for the overall project) proved to be appropriate. Most of the
technical designs employed advanced yet commercially available technologies that proved to be
fit for the purpose. The procurement plan, as appraised, proved to be executable. However, some
of the appraised cost estimates were too low and had insufficient contingency. This was
exacerbated by the severe inflation arising during 2008–2012 which caused major increases in
construction cost throughout Vietnam.

4.       Project components, outputs, and outcomes. The project has six components: flood
control, drainage, and wastewater collection; WWTPs; SWM; resettlement; HH revolving fund
and school sanitation program; and capacity building and project implementation. The project was
implemented in two phases. The following table summarizes the actual project costs in the three
cities in U.S. dollars.

5.      Lessons learned. The CCESP has been largely successful and achieved most of its original
objectives in all three project cities, especially with respect to the physical interventions. The entire
implementation process has been a valuable experience for all the agencies involved, and
considerable capacity building of the PMU and service providers has been achieved that will help
them with future projects. Specific lessons learned in the three subproject cities are as follows:



                                                        40
   •   The consulting services provided for the project have varied in quality.
   •   There is a need for the PMU and agencies to act promptly to caution and, if necessary,
       terminate poorly performing consultants. It may be necessary to apply financial sanctions
       to determine the responsibilities of consultants for contract management.
   •   It is necessary to come to an agreement with consultants on work procedures and applied
       forms at the beginning of the project to facilitate quality and quantity management and
       accelerate disbursement.
   •   The PMU/Construction Management Consultants (CMCs)/contractors need to mobilize
       quickly and start work promptly to reduce the effects of inflation and escalation costs. If
       there are land access problems, contracts should not be signed.
   •   The CMC, PMU, and contractors need to act promptly in terminating poorly performing
       subcontractors.
   •   A comprehensive design review of detailed design drawings is required at the start of the
       CMC contract. There were too many variations in some cities because of poor design.
   •   Contractors need to focus more on site safety and the health and safety of workers at work
       sites. This requires more proactive involvement of the CMC staff and the client.
   •   Improved procedures are required in some cities to get construction certificates from the
       Department of Construction and Department of Transport before digging a road.
   •   There is a need for improved knowledge of and compliance with conditions of contract
       requirements by clients and contractors, for example, termination of poorly performing
       contractors/subcontractors. This might be addressed by additional training during project
       execution by the Bank or donor agency.
   •   Design consultants need to identify and show utilities on drawings and the CMC staff need
       to facilitate this. A lot of delays and obstruction to construction are caused by finding
       unmarked utilities in the road.
   •   Site clearance and compensation should be assigned to the employer to directly perform
       the work with maximum support from the local authorities, and the resettlement site should
       be constructed based on the affected HHs’ requirements.
   •   Project physical and financial contingencies at appraisal were insufficient. Contingencies
       should also be reflected in the International Competitive Bidding and National Competitive
       Bidding documents.
   •   During engineering design, comprehensive geotechnical and geological investigations are
       required to anticipate difficult foundation conditions. This will help reduce unnecessary
       and preventable variations during construction and avoid construction delays. Geotechnical
       investigations may need to be separately budgeted and contracted.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The draft ICR was shared with the two co-financiers (the GEF and the Japan PHRD).

The GEF, through a mail communication from Jiang Ru (Senior Environmental specialist,
GENDR) on March 10, 2015, expressed its agreement with the GEO rating. Jiang has advised the
need to double-check some baseline figures for consistency, and the team has addressed this in the
updated version of the ICR.

The PHRD, through a mail communication from Helena Y. Nkole (Senior Operations Officer,
DEPTF) on March 24, 2015, expressed its concern on the manner in which the outcome of the
PHRD grant is portrayed in the ICR and advised a revision of sections of the ICR to reflect the
extent to which the PHRD grant contributed to the development outcomes of the project.

The team accepted this comment and updated the ICR to reflect the PHRD’s contribution. These
sections were revised to the extent of including separate paragraphs: Component 6 (Page 3–4);
description of the main beneficiaries (Page 5); assessment of outcomes (Page 12); lessons learned
(Page 19–21); annex 2 (Page 24); and annex 10. A revised version of the ICR has been shared with
the PHRD for a final check.

Annex 10. PHRD Grant TF056325 - Summary of Activities under the Grant

1.      With the primary objective of (a) sustaining improvements to public health, particularly
for poor residents and (b) increasing growth and economic development, the purpose of the PHRD
grant was to reduce incidence of flooding, reverse environmental degradation, and strengthen the
capacity of the URENCOs in all three project cities. The grant is part of a wider cooperation within
the urban sector that is being organized through the national Urban Forum and the Official
Development Assistance Partnership, which operates in Ho Chi Minh City, where Japan Bank for
International Cooperation, the Bank, and the ADB are all supporting environmental sanitation
projects.

2.      With a scope of US$4.6 million, the grant agreement was approved on February 9, 2006
and signed on March 19, 2007. The grant is complementary to the project and therefore tied 100
percent to the progress of the main project. The project has an eight-year implementation period
and the use of the PHRD grant falls mainly in the mid to later years. The designed activities funded
by the PHRD grant have been integrated in the overall implementation of the umbrella project.

3.      Though the co-financing of the main project, CCESP, the PHRD grant has assisted the
recipient in carrying out a program to build institutional capacity of the implementation agencies,
relevant service providers, and other relevant agencies. With the participating cities providing
maximum efforts, good performance has been recorded not only for civil works contracts (financed
by IDA credits and the counterpart fund) but also for the capacity-building activities (funded by
IDA credits, the PHRD grant, and the counterpart fund). Encouraging achievements have been
realized on the consulting contracts funded by the PHRD grant for strengthening the capacity of
the PMUs, service providers, and relevant line departments. These results are assessed as
Moderately Satisfactory.

4.      By the reporting date, all relevant contracts were substantially completed. The overall
disbursement is about 85 percent. The key achievements under capacity building of service
providers include a comprehensive capacity-building program to strengthen the overall capacity
of the service providers, initially comprising six tasks to cover (a) corporate management and
development; (b) institutional and organizational aspects; (c) technical areas of asset management;
(d) costs of operations and FM; (e) customer relations; and (f) human resource management. Later,
three tasks were added covering technical assistance for O&M of the landfill and leachate
treatment plant and the WWTP and pumping stations, with support to the asset owners by
providing service contracts, performance indicators, and monitoring processes.

5.      In Nha Trang, a total of 75 courses comprising 100 training days had over 1,000
participants attending. In Quy Nhon, the similar figures were 40 courses, 87 training days, and 740
participants. Capacity building for related city departments and the service provider has been
provided. Moreover, the IEC programs prepared as part of the capacity-building package for NGOs
and community groups have been successfully carried out in the project cities. The PMU staff have
received regular training on procurement, contract management, and project management.
Relevant consultants have been mobilized to provide necessary assistance.




                                                47
Annex 11. GEF Grant TF094335 - Summary of Activities under the Grant

1.      The prime purpose of the GEF grant was to improve the health and habitat conditions of
the East Sea, which is seen as a globally significant marine and coastal ecosystem along the
coastline of Vietnam. In 2009, an amount of US$5 million was made available through the GEF
grant to Quy Nhon, which together with counterpart funding of US$2.67 million provided an
additional US$6.67 million for the following components:

   •   Component 1: Construction of the CEPT plant with secondary treatment provided by
       trickling filters.
   •   Component 2: Public communication and replication strategy. This component makes
       reference only to those activities of communication and replication that will be developed
       for the CEPT plant implementation and operation.
   •   Component 3: Project management, monitoring, and evaluation. This component will
       finance only those monitoring activities that are directly related to measure and evaluate
       the GEF project outcomes.

2.     The capacity of the plant was originally intended to be 7,000 m3/day and intended to serve
about 60,000 people. The plant was to be connected to a sewerage system financed under the IDA
CCESP. The capacity was increased to 14,000 m3/day following detailed design and after
discussions with the Bank.

3.      The GEF-Vietnam Coastal Cities Project was the fifth project to be financed under the fund.
It builds on the IDA CCESP, which contributes to improve environmental sanitation and enhance
the quality of life for residents in the project cities. The GEF project is designed to pilot and
promote the replication of a new and more efficient wastewater treatment technology, which would
contribute to improving the health and habitat conditions of globally significant marine and coastal
ecosystems along the coastline of Vietnam and, through global oceanic circulation, other areas of
the Pacific Ocean.

4.    Till October 23, 2014, disbursement of the GEF grant was US$3.982 million against
US$4.5 million allocation for the CEPT WWTP construction and US$0.041 million against
US$0.5 million allocation for capacity building.

5.      The 14,000 m3/day Nhon Binh WWTP, partially funded by the GEF grant, was formally
handed over to the service provider on October 1, 2014. It has made a largely smooth and trouble-
free transition to normal operations with both the treatment capacity and effluent quality achieving
design requirements. Flow to the plant is 13,000 m3/day, influent BOD5 quality is in the range of
60–100 mg/l, and the effluent BOD5 is less than 20 mg/l, meeting QCVN 14/2008 and TCVN
7222/2002.
