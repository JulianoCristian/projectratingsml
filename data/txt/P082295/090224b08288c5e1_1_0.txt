                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last supervision mission in May 2014, very good progress has been recorded in all the three cities, especially in Nha Trang with substantial completion by the end of Sep.
                         Dong Hoi and Quy Nhon have been mostly completed in July. The entire project will be delivered by the closing date. The sub-projects are on track in terms of meeting its PDO.
                         The Project benefits are visible: i) lakes/canals upgraded, streets/beaches much cleaner and beautiful; ii) flooding and WW/SWM pollution significantly reduced; (iii) public toilets and
                         school sanitation well used; and iv) generally increased capacity of the PMU/service providers/line authorities. Some indicators have been realized.
                         Given excellent efforts provided by the participating sub-projects in the recent months, the project will be completed on time, with the allocated budget and reasonable quality.
