-                   For WCI, WC2 and WC5, a shower fee is 5,000 VND
                    Fee collection, operation and maintenance will require one operator per shift for a total
                    of two operators for each public toilet (one/shift/day)
          The management and operation of public toilets are implemented under 2 tenns:
                - Assign directly for URENCO to manage and operate
-               - Sign contracts with private companies through bidding
          Based on the reality, the user fees for public toilets can be changed, adjusted appropriately in
          the future depending on the management and operation agencies.

      Old Long My landfill has been operated since June 2001. This area locates in the valley which
      is surrounded by Hon Cha mountain, Hon Ach mountain on three sides. This landfill is
      adjacent to Thanh Long commune, Phuoc My hamlet. There is a spring flowing through the
      valley from North-East to South-West. The East, North and North-West of the landfill are the
      hills of Hon Cha mountain and Hon Ach mountain with the slope of 30-70°. Layout plan of
      the old landfill cells is presented in Figure 2-4.

      Cell al
      In 2001, cell al of 1. 19ha firstly received all wastes from Quy Nhon city. However, due to
      lacking of financial budget, this cell had not been designed and operated properly with
      reference to Circular 0112001/TTLT-BXD-BKHCNMT. It was closed in 2003 after receiving
      204.000m3 which is equivalent to 145.700 tons2 . Average height of solid waste layer is 3.5m.
      total height of the cell a1 is about 17m.


-      Cell a2 and cell a3
      Cells a2 and a3 (total area of 3.61 ha) both have a bottom liner and a liner on the sideslopes of
      the surrounding berms, up to a height of approximately 3 m (the southern part of Cell a2 does
      not have any liner yet). The average height of solid waste contained in Cell a3 is 10 m; in Cell
      a2 the height is 4m. These cells also have a leachate collection system, but there is no leachate

         The old cells will be operating until the beginning of the operation of new cell C3. Expected
         time for closure of the old landfill cells is the end of20I2. Up to then, the cell a2 and cell a3
         continues to receive domestic waste from Quy Nhon city and adjacent areas. After closing,
         the cells aI, a2, a3 are used as ground for the cell C 1.
         The closing procedure of old Long My landfill cells will be as following:
              • 	 Reinforce, compact the existing disposal cells aI, a2, and a3.
                                                                                   4
              • 	 Cover the surface of cells aI, a2, and a3 with a 60-cm clay layer and 50-cm surface
                  soil for planting grasses
              • . Let these cells settle until the closure of disposal cell C3 (expected to be 4-5 years).

-	            • Close the disposal cell C3, install the landfill gas collection wells for the disposal cell
                  C3 and the existing cell C 1.

         The composting system is currently operated at a capacity of approximately 40 tons/day and
         expected to reach 80 tons/day in 2012. As a result, existing cells aI, a2, and a3 would be
         operated until the end of 2012. Then waste would be disposed of in cell C3 (expected to be
         constructed at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011). The disposal cell C3 would be full
         at the beginning of second quarter of 2017 and transferred to the disposal cell Cl. The
         disposal cell C 1 would be full in the third quarter of 2020 and transferred to cell C2. At the
         end of 2020, the disposal cell C2 would have used 137,247 m 3 •

       2.5.4.4 The construction process of landfill cells
       The construction priority orders for solid waste disposal cells are C3, CI and C2, respectively.
       The detailed construction sequence is described as follows:
       Construction ofCell C3
              Construct the rainwater drainage system for Cell C3.
              Construct the water drainage ditches outside the disposal cell (the left side of Cell C3)
              Grading and compaction to the tightness as required
              Install liner layers and leachate collection pipelines
              Operate the disposal cell C3 (expected since 2013) and stop the operation of the
              existing cells a2 and a3
       Construction ofCell Cl
               Reinforce, compact the existing cells aI, a2, and a3.
               Cover the surface of cells with a 60-cm clay layer and surface soil for planting grasses
               Let the cells settle until the closure of disposal cell C3 (expected to be 4-5 years)
               Close the disposal cell C3, install the landfill gas collection wells for the disposal cell
               C3 and the existing cells aI, a2, and a3.
               Grading for the disposal cells according to the designed elevation.
               Remove the grass layer and install landfill gas collection wells of the existing disposal
               cells
               Install the HDPE layer, leachate collection, and rainwater drainage systems for Cell CI
               Operate the disposal cell C I (expected to last 3 - 4 years)
               Close the disposal cell Cl and install the landfill gas collection wells for Cell Cl
       Construction ofCell C2
               Construct the rainwater drainage ditches outside the landfill (east ofthe disposal cell C2)
               Grading of disposal cell C2 according to the designed elevation
               Install the liner layer and the leachate collection system for the disposal cell C2
               Operate the disposal cell C2
               Close Cell C2 and install the landfill gas collection wells system

       2.5.4.5 Operation of the Isnd£1ll
       All collected solid waste is landfilled, except for the portion of domestic waste used for
       composting. Solid waste will be spread into thin layers on the surface of disposal cells and
       compacted to the minimum realistic volume (density of 0.8 tonlm3) and covered after the
       working day by a layer of HDPE 0.5mm or canvas. This cover sheet will be removed the
       following working day prior to receiving new waste. When the waste layer reaches a height of
       2m, it will be covered by a soil layer of approximately O.2m thick, then compacted to 0.13m.
       Compaction of solid waste is achieved by multi-function bulldozers and trucks running many
       times over a waste layer.
....   The disposal area of phase IIA includes 3 disposal cells C 1, C2, and C3. Each disposal cell will be
       divided into disposal sub-cell, separated by small berms. Solid waste is transported and disposed
       into each sub-cell with a thickness of 2 m. When a sub-cell reaches the final height, it will be
       closed or covered, and solid waste will be transferred to another sub-celL

           ii.          Side slope liner

      The proposed side slope for the dikes for the peripheral landfill cells is 1:2. As a result, the
      rate of water infiltration will be reduced compared to the horizontal base. The liner will be
      constructed as follows:
                 Remove the existing top organic soil layer. Set the material aside and use it for the
                 final closure of the landfill for planting.
                 Utilize existing clay layer (based on existing geology of landfill area); 

                 Compact a layer of clay to a minimum thickness of 60 cm or GCL, to meet the 

                 infiltration coefficient ofK = 0.9. 

                 Install a 1.5mm thick HOPE liner using the spinal reinforced type
                 Provide bags of soil placed on the HOPE layer for protection and stability.

      2.5.4.7 Soil berm to separate landtiH cells

            (.       Landfill perimeter soil berm
      One large soil berm extending around three sides of the landfill site will be constructed. The
      top of the berm which is located on the east side of the landfill will meet the mountain slope
      near the natural ground elevation. The top of the berm located on the west side of landfill will
      extend to an elevation of the natural ground which varies from 21 m to 30 m higher than the
      natural ground level.
      Perimeter soil berm dimensions are as follows:
          o 	 Top surface width: 10m;
"""
          o 	 Side slope: 1:2;
          o 	 Construct with native soil with the sides with contact with the solid waste and lined as
              described as above .
            •:.      Berms to separate landfill cells located to the north side ofsite.
      These berms will be constructed with dimensions as follows:

      2.5.4.8 LandnH gas emission and treatment
      In general, organic substances in solid waste are divided into 2 types: organic waste that needs
      less time to decompose (2-5 years) and organic substances that have low decomposition
      ability (need more time to digest). In normal conditions, the decomposition rate of a new
      landfill can reach the maximwn rate in 2 years and reduce continuously within 25 years. Gas
      generated from the decomposition of waste has the following characteristics:
      Table 2-11 Composition ofgas generated from landfill
                                   Composition                               (%)

      In order to reduce the pollution caused by landfill gas, it needs to be collected and treated. The
      landfill gas collection option selected is as follows:

              i.       Gas collection system

      Landfill gas will be collected by vertical pipes with a diameter of 460 900 rnrn. Vertical
      wells with perforated pipe diameters from 100 to 250rnrn will be used to collect gas. The
      distance between 2 vertical wells is calculated using the formula D = 2 x r x Cos30o (r is the
      effective distance = 25m). Over 80% of the height of a vertical gas collection well will be
-     inside the waste. 113 of the pipe will be perforated and surrounded with a pebble layer with
      diameters larger than the hole diameter of the gas collection pipes.
      With the new cells, gas collection wells will be installed after the 2-3 layers and continue until
      reach the final layer. However, for the cell C 1, solid waste will be disposed on the top of the
      old cells, LFG in these old cells must be collected to ensure the stability of the above layers.
      These cells could be considered to be equivalent to 2-3 layers of solid waste. Wells are drilled
      into the waste using a drill rig capable of achieving a bore hole diameter of 460-90Ornrn in
-'    diameter. Well depths normally are extended to three-fourths of the waste thickness6 .


-     The LFG collection system is presented in Appendix 2-5.

              ii.      Landfill gas treatment


-     Depending on the flow and the quality, landfill gas can be used to provide fuel for incinerators,
      electric generator stations or can be combusted by the direct burning method. If landfill gas is
      used as a fuel replacement for incinerators, it must be preliminarily treated to reduce the
      moisture and remove other impurities. An air compressor is installed after the filtration
      separator equipment to maintain the pressure necessary for the flare as well as to create a
      suitable vacuwn for the landfill gas collection system. Fire shutoff equipment should be

-     installed on the pipeline into the flare to prevent fire migration from the flare to the pipeline.

       Landfill gas treatment for the incinerator requires high technical requirements, inappropriate
       with the existing scale and condition of Long My Landfill. Therefore, it should be researched
       and considered at a period in the future when the operation of the landfill and medical waste
       incinerator has been set up and stable. In the initial phase, the landfill gas will be treated by
       the direct burning method. Each collection well will be installed with a flare that can make an
       automatic spark to burn the landfill gas from the collection wells.

       2.5.4.9 Leachate collection system

       The main leachate collection pipe is D400 HDPE which conveys leachate from the landfill
       cells to the Leachate Management Area.
       The branch leachate collection pipes have diameters ranging from 100·20Omm and are
       perforated for their entire length. The diameter of the perforations range from 10 to 2Omm. At
       this size and number, the perforations will occupy 10-15% of the perimeter surface area of pipe.
       The leachate collection system will be installed in the filter stone layer in the bottom liner.
       The slope ofthe landfill bottom is above 1%.

                           i. Leachate flow calculation

        The Hydraulic Evaluation of Landfill Perfonnance (HELP) Model was utilized to estimate the
        leachate flows during the operation of the landfill. HELP Model projects that the average
        annual leachate generation will be approximately 24m3Iha.day. This equates to an annual
        average of less than 200 m3/day for each cell (approximately 7 ha).
        Table 2-12 shows the average annual leachate flows.

                           ii. Leachate Management System

        The onsite leachate pretreatment will include lime addition, four sedimentation basins, and a
        large storage pond, which will provide removal of heavy metals and other toxic materials
        before the leachate is pumped to the Wastewater Treatment 2A. The storage pond has
        capacity for more than 10 days of storage during the wet season, assuming that 200 m3/day
        are pumped. These assumptions are conservative and allow for buffer capacity during large
        stonn events.

-       The addition of lime, introduced to the leachate flow as it enters the sedimentation basins, will
        be used to adjust the pH and reduce the concentration of metals, COD, and color prior to


-       pumping to the WWTP. It is expected that the amount of lime required will be approximately
        2.5 giL, equating to approximately 10 bags per day (500 kglday). Lime dosage rates are
        dependent on both the flow and quality of leachate, and therefore will be determined during
        operation. Lime sludge will be removed from the sedimentation basins with a mobile sludge
.....   pump or tanker truck during dry months .

        First, bar screens and a grit chamber are used to remove large solid materials. After that,
        wastewater flows into the biological treatment process - an oxidation ditch. The oxidation
        ditch works on the principle of mechanical aerating equipment (rotors) which are arranged
        around the perimeter length of the oval tank to create both aerobic zones (zones with
        dissolved oxygen) and anoxic zones (zones without dissolved oxygen). The aerobic zones

-       oxidize the carbon and nitrogren in the wastewater. The anoxic zones allow anaerobic bacteria
        to convert the oxidized nitrogen (NOx) into N z which is released as a harmless gas into the
        atmosphere. Wastewater will be retained in the activate sludge system for 18 hours. The
        process of nitrification and denitrification in the oxidation ditch can reach as high as 80%
        removal efficiencies. The oxidation ditch process has the advantages of a easily settled sludge,
        relatively stable operation with high efficiency of BOD and nutrient removal, and it has
        average complexity for operation and maintenance. The proposed oxidation ditch tank has
        design depth of 1.80m and the flow velocity in the ditch of 0.24-0.37rnfs.
        After biological treatment, the mixed liquor, which includes the treated wastewater and the
        microbial mass, will flow into the secondary sedimentation tanks to separate the sludge from
        the treated wastewater by gravity. The majority of the sludge collected in the clarifier will be
        returned to maintain the activated biomass. After the primary and secondary treatment
,....
        processes, the treated wastewater will be disinfected using sodium hypochlorite, NaOel, and
        discharged to Ha Thanh river.

                         i. Final cover
,-   The cap on the top of the landfill cell serves three functions. First, it will prevent rainfall from
     penetrating into the landfill cell and thereby reduce leachate. Second, it will contain the

-    landfill gas from escaping directly to the atmosphere. And third, it will provide soil to support
     the growth of vegetation to stabilize the soil.
      The structure of final cover from the top to the bottom is presented as following:
             A top soil layer approximately 50 cm where shrubs, grasses and shallow-rooted trees
             can be planted to stabilize the topsoil and prevent erosion.

-            A geotextile material to prevent migration of fmes between the soil layer and sand or
             gravel layer;


-            A 30-cm sand or gravel layer over the entire surface of the landfill cell that will
             fimction to drain water and vent gas.

       2.5.5 Incinerator

-      In order to treat the medical solid waste volume projected from 2015 and 2020, at the levels
       of 870 kg/day and 960 kg/day, respectively, it is necessary to buy a new incinerator with the


-      capacity of 200 kglhr. This incinerator will be continuously operated, with DO fuel usage at
       an average of 0.4 - 0.5 l/kg. The primary chamber temperature is 600 - 850°C). The
       secondary chamber temperature is 1050 1200 °C. The incinerator will have an exhaust gas

-      treatment system complying with the environmental standard QCVN 02:2008. Ash residue
       from the waste incinerator will be disposed of in a separate disposal cell for medical solid
       waste at Long My landfill. The incinerator locates at the east end of the landfill.

..     A typical medical waste incinerator is shown in Figure 2-17 below. This special incinerator
       has a wet combustion gas filter to remove pollutants from exhaust gas before discharging into
       the atmosphere.

       Nhon Hoi sand mine with over I,OOO,OOOm3 saved for the sanitation project (as stated in the
       EIA report Component 1, 2 and 5 Phase 2) is so adundant that the requirement for this
       landfill will not exceed its capacity. Similarly, Suoi Trau is a vacant land which has a great
       capacity that can support the project. The impacts on these material mines are insignificant.
       A clay source with the permeable coefficient K ::; 10-7 cm/s must be explored by the
.­     Contractor prior to the construction. If clay supply is scarce, the GCL can be considered as an
       alternative for the 60cm clay layer in the bottom liner.

     CHAPTER 3. NATURAL AND SOCIO·ECONOMIC
       BASELINE CONDITIONS

     The baseline conditions of the natural environment and socio-economic environment of Quy
     Nhon city are presented clearly in the previous EIA for Component 1,2 and 5. Therefore, this
     report will not repeat the baseline of the city but will focus mainly on the construction sites of
     Component 3, especially on Long My landfill.

     3.1 NATURAL CONDITIONS
     3.1.1 Geographical location, topography and geology

     3.1.1.1 GeographicaJJocatiolJ

     The city of Quy Nhon is located at the south end of Binh Dinh Province at co-ordinates:
     13°46' northern latitude and 119°14' eastern longitude. The north borders on Tuy Phuoc
     district and Phu Cat district, the south borders on the Song Cau district of Phu Yen province,
     the east borders the sea and the west borders on Tuy Phuoc district. The city is located 1,060
     km from Ha Noi to the north and 640 km from Ho Chi Minh City to the South.
-
..   3.1.1.2 Topography


-    Three sides of the landfill are surrounded with mountains, therefore the landfill height will be
     decided when the highest contour of landfill meets the surrounding mountain slope contour.
     The total height of waste is approximately 25 m. The landfill area will be surrounded by

-
..
     benns and ditches to prevent stonnwater from the mountain to enter the landfill.
     The design will take advantage of natural topography to reduce excavation and back-filling
     efforts. Furthennore, natural high slope of the landfill7 will be very advantageous for
-
..   construction of leachate collection system to achieve the slope> 1%.

     3.1.1.3 GeoJolCr

..   Geological conditions


-    Geological conditions at Long My landfill

-    According to the geotechnical survey of the area, the soil strata of landfill is as follows:
           •    From the ground surface to a depth of 2m: sand with pebbles, macadam;
           •    From 24m depth: compact sand with large stones;

-          •    > 4 - 6m: granite stone or compact clay with large stones;

-    Based on the geographical conditions mentioned above, solid waste will be disposed on the
     natural ground surface.

        North, East and West of the landfill are mountains that reduce the impacts of odor from the
        landfill. However, from April to June, the East and South-East wind blows towards residential
        areas in Phuoc My ward. This must be taken into account in the design of new landfill.

    The levels of educational achievement and literacy among surveyed household heads are
    summarized in the following: (i) most of household heads (about 97%) have secondary and
    high school education and (ii) none of them is illiterate.

    3.2.1.4 Health-care services

    Long My landfill area
    No households pays attention to health-care service when 76.4% households concerned at this
    service only when they get sick and go to hospital and 20% said they never go for periodic
    examination. In the project area, annual health examination seems unfamiliar as the survey
    data shows that only 3.6 % households said that they go to doctors every 6 months.

    3.2.1.5 Economy

    Long My landfill area
    Long My industrial park of 11 Oha was established on April 2003. There are 6 companies in
    the park. The existence of the park promoted local economics by increasing land value,
    services and jobs. However, the pressure on the environment is also high.
    According to the survey results (June, 2010), main incomes of households focus on such
    careers as agricultural production (making up 80%), free labor, seasonal labor or working at
    the industrial zone (about 12.7%) and for small business and service (making up 7.3%).
    Hence, their occupation structure in the project area is almost the same.
    According to the survey results, household average income in the project area is about VND
    2.7 million per household per months, or about VND 715.000 per person per month. There is
    only one poor household (Vo Luc, Zone 5, Thanh Long village, Phuoc My commune) and 01
    "policy" households (Nguyen Thi Thao, Zone 5, Thanh Long village, Phuoc My commune).
    The households whose income under VND 1.5 million per household per month are about 9.1
    %, those of VND 1.5 to 2 million are 38.2%, of VND 2-3million are 25%, of VND 3-5
    million are 23.6% and of over VND 5 million per household per month is 3.6%.

    3.2.2 Infrastructure
    At this moment, there are some factories operating at Long My Industrial Park, located at the
    south of Long My landfill. The roadway connecting Phuoc My hamlet to National Highway
    lA has been upgraded. Dieu Tri railway station, one among biggest station in the middle of
    Vietnam, is 10km far from the project area. This distance is doubled from the area to Quy
    Nhon habour.

    3.2.3 Power
    At the present, Binh Dinh Province and Quy Nhon City are being supplied with electric power
    from the national electric grids, 220KV and 11 OKV. In addition, Quy Nhon has Nhon Trach
    diesel electric power generation plant with an installed capacity of 27.78MW and an available
    capacity of 18.72MW. This plant provides standby service.


-   At Phu Tai, there is an electric power station 220111 OKV-1 x 125MVA; electricity supplied for
    this station is the Pleiku Phu Tai 220KV grid, AC0300 conducting wire with the length of
    140km~ the 11 OKV grid of this station is connected to the Vinh Son Hydroelectric Plant.

      3.2.4 Water supply
                                                                             3
      There are 13 well pump stations along Ha Thanh River with 125+200m /h each well. The
      depth of each well ranges from 18.5m to 25m. Total volume of water supplied from the wells
      is 28,500 m3/day. The water quality meets the applicable standards (TCXD 233:1999) as
      stated in Decision No. 136 and No. 137/GP-BTNMT dated on 22nd January, 2008. Water from
      the pumping stations follows pipes 0500, 0400 and goes along the National Highway ID to
      the high pressure pumping station at the base of Ba Hoa Mountain with the capacity of a
      storage tank of 3,000m .
      The quality of groundwater at 13 wells are summarised as following:
                 pH range: 6.50-6.78, no color, no smell, normal taste
                 cr:::: 11.40-34.80 mgtl, mineral M:::: 0.04-0.11 mg/l
                 Fe2+   0.10-0.47 mgtl, Fe3+   0.00-0.03 mgtl
                 The concentration of N-N02' and N-N~+ is small and do not exceed the
                 requirements for drinking water.
      The distribution network contains approximately 435,000m pipes of various types with
      diameters 0400 + 05Ornrn. At the present time, the system is providing water for all the
      internal city wards of Quy Nhon City and Dieu Tri town of Tuy Phuoc district. The total
      number of customers using tap water is over 43,000 households.
      The relative distance from the landfill to the pump wells is presented in Figure 3-1. The
      distance from Long My landfill to the nearest pump well is about IOkm.

       3.2.5 Drainage and wastewater treatment

       3.2.5.1 Drainage system

       The existing drainage system of Quy Nhon City is a combined system for both municipal
       sewerage and storm water drainage. By the nature of this system, it is a gravity drainage
       system for storm water, with only incidental wastewater received from unregulated sources.
       The drainage system of the City has been founded since the French colony and the old regime,
       expanded and rehabilitated step-by-step in accordance with the urban development. However,
       most of the drains and sewers have been constructed since 1990s. In general, the drains and
       sewers have been constructed to convey storm water and waste water to the nearest receiving
       bodies (rivers, lakes or sea) without enough evaluation of the capability and capacity of the
       receiving sources (especially lakes) as well as without division in terms of catchment areas, so the
       system does not have a common planning and capability ofthe system and, therefore, it is limited.
       The city area can be divided into 03 zones with reference to the basin area:
               Center city area,
               Western city area (Bui Thi Xuan and Tran Quang Dieu Wards), and
               Phuong Mai peninsula area.
       The center city owns a combined system whereas western area of the city and Phuong Mai
       peninsula do not have a clear drainage system. Storm water and wastewater collected through
       the secondary and tertiary networks, then to the primary network and finally to the regulating
       lakes or the receiving waters. The main receiving waters are Ha Thanh river, Thi Nai lagoon,
       Dong Da lake, Phu Hoa lake, and Quy Nhon bay.
       Since the drainage and sewerage system operates by gravity and without a standard outlet, the
       drainage effectiveness in the low areas of the City center is dependent upon tidal levels.
       The first phase of the Project invested in the center city areas in order to resolve some key
       flooding areas and strengthen the capacity of wastewater collection.

-
-
       3.2.5.2 Flooding

       Local flooding occurs frequently during the rainy season (from September to November) with

-      high peak flows due to storm water runoff from the mOlmtains to the City. Based on the recent
       results oftidal level analysis ofQuy Nhon Hydrometeorology Station, the tidal level in the studied

.. 	   areas varied is not great, from 1,Om to 1.5m. In the rainy season (September, October and
       November), when the rainfall is high, the tidal level increased with the range of OJ-0.7m. In
       general, the tidal impact on the drainage system is not significant because the tidal level is about
       1.Om while most terrain ofthe city is higher than 2.0m, except the zones in the north ofthe city.

       3.2.5.3 Housebold connection


-      According to 	 the socio-economic surveys carried out by VIWASE, there are 95.6% of
       households with toilets, in which toilets with septic tanks occupy 76.5%, semi-septic tanks
       17.4%; the rest are flushing toilets, two-apartment toilets. Different from water supply, the ratio
       of households connected to the city network remains very low, only 2303%; the remaining let
       their waste water absorb into ground or overflow on the ground surface. 6000 suspending
-
..     points for household connection in the city has been approved by the government and will be
       constructed in this phase of the Project.

            3.2.5.4 Collection and treatment 01domestic wastewater
            In Quy Nhon city, a common way utilized by people is to allow the wastewater to infiltrate into
            the ground, instead of connecting the wastewater to the public drainage system. This is possible,
            given the highly percolating nature of the soiL Only 23.3% of households in the city center have
            septic tanks connected to the drainage system although the ratio of households having toilets is
            95.6%. People also do this to avoid paying for the sewerage connection fee. This infiltration is
            acceptable in rural areas or garden houses where the population density is low. However, it has
            direct negative impact on the environment in high density urban area Soil and underground
            water supplies are seriously polluted when wastewater infiltrates into the ground.
            At this moment, three WWTPs have been approved to give appropriate treatment for domestic
            wastewater of the whole city.

            3.2.5.5 Collection and treatment 01bospital wastewater
            Theoretically, the wastewater generated from public works such as hospitals, hotels and
            public buildings must be treated separately before being discharged to the drainage system.
            However, in reality, most public works have no or limited wastewater treatment prior to
            discharge to the drainage system. The reason offered for this lack of wastewater treatment is
            that the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost is too high and that this expense should be
            supported by state budget. Another reason given is that the wastewater discharge standards
            are not being strictly enforced.
            According to the data of real survey and investigation, Quy Nhon city has 06 large hospitals.
            The existing situation of the wastewater collection and treatment system is as in Table 3~5.

         It can be seen that until 2012, all hospitals have their own WWTP. Therefore, the technical
             consultants propose that hospital wastewater should be treated to meet QCVN 24:2008 before
             discharging to the combined drainage system.

     estimated collection rate of 95%. In the remaining four islands and peninsulas, the collection rate
     is estimated to be approximately 60%. For the whole city, the collection rate is estimated about
     85%. As reported in the "Master Plan on Urban and Industrial Zone Solid Waste Management in
     Binh Dinh Province to 2020", the average generation rate of domestic solid waste was 178
     tons/day (2008). This accounts for approximately 58% oftotal amount ofBinh Dinh Province.

    Environmental Impact Assessment: Component 3 Solid Waste Management 


    Domestic solid waste in the city is collected daily and transported to 64 temporary transfer points.
    Solid waste from markets is collected by each Market Management Unit and moved to temporary
    transfer points. Then, solid waste will be transferred to Long My Landfill which is about 20km
    towards southwest of the city center. Solid waste is usually transported to the landfill in the early
    morning (3:00-5:00) or late afternoon (15:00-17:00). URENCO uses many different types of
    vehicles to transport solid waste such as push-carts and pedi-carts, open trucks, compactor trucks,
    vacuum tankers.
    At this moment, Quy Nhon city does not have any waste transfer station. In the FS, the transfer
    station is not recommended because of high cost of fuel and labour.

    Conclusion

    The capacity of collection of solid waste of URENCO could be seen both weak and
    insufficient. Old-fashioned collection trucks result in higher O&M costs and occupational
    diseases. Lacking of human and equipment capacity, solid waste is disposed illegally which in
    turn attracts insects and causes unsanitary conditions.

    3.2.6.3 Solid waste treatment

    All domestic solid waste collected by URENCO is disposed in the Long My Landfill which was
    open in June 2001. Solid waste is not yet separated at the source in Quy Nhon. Therefore, when
    it arrives at the landfill, domestic solid waste is dumped on a classification belt. As the materials
    move along the classification belt, they are classified manually by workers standing on both
    sides of the belt. Any solid waste that can be recycled, such as nylon, paper, plastic, metal is
    separated and the organic fraction is taken to the composting area to be fermented. The
    remaining material, that was neither recycled nor composted, is taken to the landfill for
    disposal. The existing MSW processing facility and the existing classification belt is shown
    below in Figure 3-2.

-   Figure 3-2 Existing MSW Processing Facility
    Even at the landfill, a part of the solid waste can still be recovered and recycled by scavengers.
    The residual solid waste is buried in the landfill by bulldozers which do not effectively compact

-   the solid waste at this moment. As a result, solid waste density is not compacted and the landfill
    is not utilized to it full potentiaL
    The composting facilities are located in an open area. Unfortunately, the area does not have a
-   liner which permits the leachate percolate into the groundwater. Septage is added to the
    compost to balance the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous contents for organic decomposition.
    Landflll Cell No. 1 is currently closed. This landfill cell has neither a liner nor a leachate collection
    system. At the present, it is full and has been covered by a layer of soil. Cells No.2 and No.3 both

    have a liner in the bottom and up the walls to a height of about 3m. These cells have leachate
    collection systems, but they do not cmrently have a leachate treatment system.

    3.2.6.4 Medical solid waste

    Medical waste is not officially collected and treated. Its collection and treatment is
    spontaneous and relies on the capacity of the hospital. Currently, medical solid waste
    materials from hospitals and other health care institutions are classified at the source and
    divided into the following two types:
           Domestic medical solid waste from usual acitivities of medical staff and patients.
           Infectious medical solid waste including used dressings, bandages, intravenous fluids,
           tubes, filters, needles... These materials can also include toxicants, radioactive
           substances and other hazardous medical products.
    The collection and transportation of medical solid waste follows medical solid waste
    management rules and regulations. Hazardous medical waste is separated, collected and
    transported in separate specialized vehicles. The normal, domestic solid waste from the
    medical institutions is collected and transported with the urban domestic solid waste.
    Currently, there are two treatment methods for medical hazardous waste:
           The Tuberculosis Hospital uses an incinerator. The residual ash from the incinerator
           contains approximately 10% of the initial quantity which is transported to Long My
           Landfill and buried together with the non-hazardous solid waste.
           Other healthcare institutions that do not have an incinerator will haul their medical
           waste to the landfill or bury them at the abandoned sites.
    The incinerator at the Tuberculosis Hospital has been in operation since November 2001 and
    operates two shifts per day. The hospital provided the following information regarding the
    incinerator:
            Manufacturer and model number: HOV AL MZ4
            The incinerator operates in batches of 200 kg to 250 kg (8 hourslbatch)
            Auxiliary fuel is diesel
            Total power (for both control and cooling): 0.25 KWIh
            Water for cooling: 25 llh
            Maximum temperature: I 100°C; normal operating temperature: 900°C
            Labor: 2 workers (working in shift, 1 shift = 8 hours)
            Incinerator maintained every 3 months
-   During a preliminary research of the incinerator manufacturer, it is noted this manufacturer
    has experienced difficulties in meeting air pollution regulations in the Philippines. Another
    potential problem for the extended operation of the incinerator is the location. It is in a
    relatively congested area and at a low elevation. The hospital staff has been experiencing
    difficulties in the operation of the incinerator.

-   3.2.6.5 Industrial solid waste


-   Currently, the solid waste collection in the industrial zones of Quy Nhon is not being actively
    managed. Because of the lack of management, there are no statistics available on the quantity
    of industrial solid waste generated in the city. The regulations requiring separation of solid

        Coastal Cities Environmental Sanitation Project - Quy Nhon city Sub-project 

        Environmental Impact Assessment: Component 3 - Solid Waste Management 


        waste are not yet implemented. Collection and transportation of industrial waste is the
        responsibility of each of the individual manufacturers. After removing materials that can be
        recycled, solid waste is taken to the temporary storage site until it can be transported off.
        Industrial waste is handled according to the tenns of contracts between the industry and
        URENCO where it is taken to Long My landfill.
        The estimated collection rate is approximately 3.7% of the generation rate, according to the
        report of Binh Dinh Provincial PMU of Industrial Zones. The primary reason for the low
        collection rate is most likely the disagreement on the price between URENCO and its client.

        3.2.6.6 Septsge

        Septage collected daily from the households will be treated at the WWTP. Septage contains
        high concentrations of solids, grease, BOD and nutrients. Metals are also present in septage,
        depending on the use of household chemicals and leaching of metal from household piping
        and joints. Septage collected from households and wasted sludge from secondary treatment
        will be stabilized in the anaerobic settling ponds at WWTPs for two to four years.

        3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
        In May 2010, the environmental consultant signed a contract with Binh Dinh EPA to monitor
        the environmental quality at the project site. The data monitored regularly by Binh Dinh
        DONRE is used for reference.

         Except NH3 and CH3SH, most of odorous gases do not satisfy the requirements of
         QCVN06:2008. In addition, CH3SH concentration is very close to the limited concentration
         and the concentration of hydro sulfur is 2-3 times higher than required in the standard. At the
         site, in the dry season, the smell generated from the landfill causes a nuisance to local
         residents and their daily activities. In the rainy season, it is much better.

         3.3.2 Water environment

         3.3.2.1 Groundwater

         One representative groundwater sample is taken from the well of a local resident in Thanh
         Long hamlet. It is about 400m far away from the landfilL As we can see from the Table 3-9,
         groundwater at the area is polluted by most of the basic parameters. It is organic and micro­
         organism contaminated. However, in the survey of RAP and EIA consultants (May, 2010),
         about 96.4% households are now using well water for their daily use; one household uses
         water from their neighbor and 01 uses piped water without water meters. In the radius of
         300m from the landfill, 100% of groundwater wells are polluted, odorous and could not be
         used. Due to polluted ground water in the area, local people have been provided 03 water
         tanks for their daily demands. The residents have to come and take water by their own tools.
         In the distance of 300-1 OOOm, 50% of wells are contaminated but most of local residents have
         no other choice rather than contaminated water wells. In the in-depth interviews, children are
         suffered from dermatological diseases such as scabies and itch when using this source of
         water for bathing.

        3.3.2.2 Surface water

        The time of site investigation and monitoring is in the dry season. At this moment, the spring
        flowing through the landfill is dried and could not be monitored. The sample to trace the
        pollution from the landfill to the village is taken in the middle of Dong Ong Cay, Thanh Long
        village. In Table 3-10, the water is polluted in tenns of organic contents and nutrients. The
        concentration of BODs and COD is about 5 times higher than permitted levels in the standard
        (column Bl). Unfortunately, total nitrogen is 21 times higher than pennitted level.

     The results suggest that for the leachate in Long My landfill, the key concern is the high
     concentration of BOD, COD, TSS and Ammonia-N. For the chemicals and heavy metals, the
     concentrations are either very low or undetectable. These conclusions are consistent with the
     sources of solid wastes in Long My Landfill which are mainly from residential areas given
     there is little industry in Quy Nhon City.

       CHAPTER 4.ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS

       This chapter will analyse the proposed alternatives with reference to environmental aspects.

       4.1 DISPOSAL OF DOMESTIC SOLID WASTE
       Solid waste from Quy Nhon and Tuy Phuoc will be taken to the Long My Landfill for
       processing and disposal. There are two basic alternatives that can be considered. These basic
       alternatives are summarized as follows:

                                                       waste stream
                                                    3. Utilize the organic portion in the compost system for
                                                       agricultural uses.
                                                    4. Reduce the volume of residuals in the landfill by

-      For long-term benefits, Alternative 2 is recommended.

       4.2 CAPACITY OF LONG MY LANDFILL
....   The capacity of Long My landfill depends on the level of composting, recycling of materials
       and compaction of the landfill. Four alternatives are considered.

       4.2.1 Without composting and material recycle

       This evaluation is based on achieving an average compaction density of 600 kg/m3 for in
       place solid waste in the landfill. Existing Cells a1, a2, and a3 would be operated until the end
       of2012. Waste would then be sent to cell C3 (expected to construct in the beginning of fourth
       quarter of2011). C3 would be full in the third quarter of2016 and transferred to the disposal
       cell C 1. It is expected that C 1 would be full in the second quarter of 20 19, and waste would be
       transferred to Cell C2. At the end of 2020, the disposal cell C2 would have a remaining
                                         3
       storage capacity of 31 0,325 m , corresponding to approximately 34% of initial capacity.

       4.2.2 With composting and material recycle

-      If composting production and recycling are implemented and expanded to the full capacity in
       2012 (at present, the capacity is only about 40 tons/day), the life expectancy of the landfill can

     be extended remarkably. Existing cells aI, a2, and a3 would be operated until the end of2012,
     then waste would be transferred to cell C3 (expected to be constructed at the beginning of the
     fourth quarter of 2011). The disposal cell C3 would be full in the second quarter of 2018 and
     transferred to the disposal cell C 1. At the end of 2020, the disposal cell C 1 would have a
     remaining storage capacity of 358,758 m 3, corresponding with 40.2% initial capacity.
     Therefore, the disposal cell C2 would not be operated yet.

     4.2.3 With compostjng, material recycle and waste compaction in the landfill
     If the solid waste strategy above, which includes full capacity composting and recycling of
                                                                                                              3
     metals and plastics, is further enhanced by increasing the in-place compactor from 600 kglm
     to 800 kglm3, the life of the landfill can be increased even more. Existing cells aI, a2, and a3
     would be operated until the end of 2012, then transferred to cell C3 (expected to be
     constructed at the beginning of the fourth quarter of2011). The disposal cell C3 would be full
     in the fourth quarter of 2019 and waste would be transferred to the disposal cell Cl. At the
                                                                                                    3
     end of 2020, the disposal cell C 1 would have the remaining storage capacity as 722,070 m ,
     corresponding with 81 % initial capacity; thus, the disposal cell C2 would be not operated yet.

     4.2.4 With existing compostjng and material recycle facility
     According to this scenario, existing cells aI, a2, and a3 would be operated until the end of
     2012. Then waste would be disposed of in cell C3 (expected to be constructed at the
     beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011). The disposal cell C3 would be full at the beginning
     of second quarter of 2017 and transferred to the disposal cell C 1. The disposal cell C 1 would
     be full in the third quarter of 2020 and transferred to cell C2. At the end of2020, the disposal
     cell C2 would have used 137,247 m 3 (corresponding with 15% capacity).

     4.2.5 Conclusion
     Scenario 1 is unlikely to happen whereas Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 require a substantial
     investment on raising public awareness and improvement in compo sting process which is not
     included in the scope of this project. Therefore, the technical consultant selected Scenario 4
     for calculation, taken into account the capacity of landfill staff, available composting process
     and facilities.

    Conclusion
    Alternative 1 and Alternative 3 are similar except that Alternative 1 offers a larger margin of
    safety. The additional protection is provided by the 30 cm layer of soil covering and
    cushioning the HDPE liner. Alternative 1 is more expensive than Alternative 3 as a result of
    the cushion soil layer to protect the HDPE liner.
    Alternative 2 uses a synthetic material liner as a substitute for the 60-cm compacted clay
    layer. The liner is a relatively thin geosynthetic fabric with bentonite clay. This will provide
    protection equivalent to 60-cm compacted clay. At present, this type of synthetic bentonite
    clay has been used in the Landfill in Nha Trang and other locations nationwide.
    Based on the above discussions, the Consultant Team recommends to use Alternative 1
    because it provides a protective cushion layer for the HDPE liner layer, concurrently having
    the effect of increased protection for the landfill. In the case of scare clay supply source for
    Long My Landfill, Alternative 2 can be selected as an equivalent option.

     4.5 GAS COLLECTION SYSTEM
     Three conventional methods to extract the gas from the landfill are summarized as follows:
     Table 4-4 Alternatives of~as collection system
              Alternative 1                          Alternative 2                       Alternative 3

                                                                                       vertical pipelines
     Landfill gas will be collected      Landfill gas will be collected        Landfill gas will be collected by
     using a series of parallel pipes    with vertical wells consisting of     a parallel, horizontal pipe
     installed in gravel filled,         perforated pipelines with             system installed in a 400mm
     horizontal trenches.                diameters of DN = 460 + 900           horizontal gravel layer under
     The gas collection pipelines will   mm.                                   closure cap of the landfill cell.
     have diameters from 100 to          The gas will be collected in          The gas pipes have diameters
     250mm.                              pipes with a diameter of 150­         from 100 to 250mm and
     The dimension of pipe trenches      200mm.                                installed approximately 50 to
     will be from 500 to 900mm.                                                60m center to center.
     Alternative 2 is recommended for the gas collection system for the following reasons:
            Vertical well collection pipes are less affected by ground subsidence as the solid
            decomposes over time.
 I          The vertical well system is able to collect the majority of the landfill gas.
            Vertical wells are simple to install and maintain and they are accessible at the surface.

     4.6 GAS TREATMENT SYSTEM
.­   Depending on the flow and the quality, landfill gas can be used to provide fuel for
     incinerators, electric generator stations or can be combusted by the direct burning method.

-    The use of landfill gas as fuel will be considered in the future when the operation of the
     landfill and incinerator has been stable. In the initial phase, the landfill gas will be treated by
     the direct burning method. Each collection well will be installed with a flare that can make an
     automatic spark to burn the landfill gas from the collection wells.

        Wastewater after lime sludge sedimentation is pumped to Stripping tower to remove N-NH3.
        After passing through Stripping tower, wastewater is taken to the decalcification tank to
        remove Ca2+ before going into the biological treatment phase.
        Wastewater from the decalcification tank is lead into selector chamber of C-Tech biological
        tank. The C-Tech tank implements 4 reaction phases in 1 tank including: water charging, air
        blowing, sedimentation and drainage in that tank. At this tank, pollutants in wastewater are
        treated by agents of aerobic micro-organism (activated sludge).
        Wastewater after being treated biologically will be pumped to the physio-chemical treatment
        tank to remove suspended sediments and decolorize, then lead to the two-step Fenton reaction
        ponds to continue treating color and substance without any biological decomposition ability.
        After water reaction is pumped to the clarifier with additional chemicals to precipitate
        insoluble pollutants. Finally, water is filtered and disinfected before discharge to the eco­
        polishing pond. The above process is presently being used at the Binh Duong Leachate
        treatment.
        Option 2 - Physical-Biological Leachate Treatment
        As wet weather is expected to result in a large peak to average leachate flow variation, a lined,
        earthen lagoon is proposed to store wet weather leachate flows in excess of the estimated
        average daily flow. Equalized raw leachate would be conveyed to a series of lined, earthen
        lagoons that are provided with floating HDPE covers. The anaerobic lagoons would be un­
        heated, relying on the black HDPE covers to add heat. A pumped recirculation system would
        be provided, which recirculates lagoon effluent to the head of each lagoon to improve overall
        perfonnance. Anaerobic treatment is used to reduce the organic pollutant loading to the SBR
        activated sludge treatment process .

             Aerobic SBR

        After the anaerobic lagoons, leachate will enter stripping tower to remove ammonia. After
        passing through the stripping towers, the leachate will be conveyed to two SBR activated
        sludge treatment reactors. The SBR would also be provided with an effluent equalization tank

-       and SBR effluent pumps to convey flow to the next unit process. After SBR, metals removal
        will be accomplished by pH adjustment, rapid mixing, flocculation, sedimentation tank and
        neutralization. This effluent will enter a filtration unit and a disinfection unit.

      Option 5- Onsite Leachate Treatment Plant with Of/-site Discharge
      The leachate will be treated to a Class B2 standard and the treated effluent will be discharged
      to downstream of the water supply source area. The treated effluent quality will meet the
      Standard QCVN 25:2009 COLUMN B2. Leachate collected in the landfill cells is conveyed
      to the leachate storage pond. Then leachate is screened and pumped to the pH adjustment
      tank. At the Nitrogen treatment cluster, pH will be raised to 11 - 12. Then water is pumped to


-     the top of the Stripping tower, and air is blown up by a centrifugal blower. Lime sludge and
      heavy metals are separated at the lime sludge sedimentation tank and pumped to the lime sludge
      storage tank, then transported periodically by truck to the sanitary landfilL
       Leachate after being treated for heavy metals, Nitrogen and suspended solids flows to the
       Selector buffer tank. Concurrently, at this tank, nutrients are added to the leachate together
       with return biological sludge from the secondary sedimentation tank to provide optimum
       conditions before flowing to the biological treatment ponds (Aeration tanks). Treated leachate
       then flows to the secondary sedimentation tank. Then, leachate flows to the physical-chemical
-      treatment ponds for the next treatment. At the disinfection tank the treated leachate is mixed
       with disinfectant chemical NaCIO. Treated leachate after passing through the disinfection
       tank meets the effluent standard for discharge to the environment.

-    4.7.3 Conclusion

-    Option 3, conveying the pre-treated leachate through forcemain to the nearby wastewater
     treatment plant, is selected by thorough discussion between WB representatives, Binh Dinh
     PPC representatives, PMU and consultants8 , It is the most sensible option based on the
     following reasons: (i) lowest costs for both capital investment and O&M; (ii) least skill needs
     for O&M; (iii) least needs for on-site treatment and least site nuisance; (iv) the newly built
     wastewater treatment plant (either the WWTP 2A or WWTP IB) has the capacity to

..   accommodate the pre-treated leachate; (v) easy for URENCO to manage the leachate in a
     sustainable manner,

        CHAPTER 5.ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
                  ASSESSMENT

        This chapter will be divided into five sections due to the magnificient difference in tenns of scale
        and complexity between the project sub-components:
                1.   Construction and operation ofURENCO depot
                2.   Construction and operation of six public toilets
                3.   Operation and closure of old Long My landfill cells
                4.   Construction, operation and closure ofnew Long My landfill cells
                5.   Operation ofmedical waste incinerator
        Because of the repitition in assessment of environmental impacts in the construction phase of
        these sub-components, detail calculations of the impacts, for example (1) noise of construction
        machines and vehicles, (2) dust generation from excavation and leveling, (3) air emission from
        construction works and transportation of materials, (4) domestic wastewater loadings from
        workers, will be presented together in Appendix 5-1, Appendix 5-2, Appendix 5-3 and Appendix 5­
        4, respectively. The report only uses the calculated results for assessment.
        Similarly, in order to assess the environmental impacts of the landfill operation, some models
        have been applied. Results of the models will be shown in the report whereas the calculations are

        The construction activities ofURENCO depot are limited in its boundary. There is no demand
        for site clearance, relocation and resettlement.

        5.1.1 Construction phase
-       The impacts in the construction phase of URENCO depot are mostly insignificant because it
        has small construction works (Table 2-2) and the depot is isolated from surrounding
        bUildings. The main impacts are appraised in Table 5-1.

        5.2 PUBLIC TOILETS
        There are six proposed public toilets, in which five of the proposed locations for the WCI,
        WC2, WC3, WC4 and WC5 currently are on public land. WC6 was proposed to be located on
        residential land, but it is already cleared by Quy Nhon PC.

        5.2.1 Construction pbase
        Public toilets are constructed separately in different locations in Quy Nhon city. The area for
        each toilet is about 72-86 m2 • The construction work is small; however, the impacts on
 IiI    landscape and disturbance to tourists and pedestrians need to be considered because they locate
        at the crowded areas such as commercial center, tourist attraction places and bus station.

    5.3 	 OPERATION AND TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OLD LANDFILL
          CELLS
    Up 	to now, only cell al has been closed while cells a2, a3 are operating. The volume of
                           l5
    currently buried waste is estimated about 456,700m3 • Until 2013 when the new cell C3 goes
    into operation, forecasted volume of buried waste 16 will be:
                V2013     = Vcurrent + V20 11 + V2012 = 456,700 + 185,518 + 135,658 = 777,876 m 3
    When the cell C3 operates, all old cells aI, a2 and a3 will be closed temporarily.

    5.3.1 Operation of old landfill cells

    This section will not deal with all impacts from the operation of old landfill cells because it is
    not so different with the current situation, it only discusses highlighted issues.

    In the past, local people of Thanh Long village often claimed the landfill managers. However,
    in the recent years, it has been much better. Odors are controlled by daily spraying of
    deodorized chemicals with the dosage of 1.5Uday (390m3 of waste per day)17. Although odors
    are significantly reduced, it is still a nuisance to local people, especially at night-time when
    RCV s come to the landfill for disposal.
    Furthermore, dust generated from movements of bull dozers and vehicles affect directly to
    landfill workers, scavengers and officers.

           2. Landfill gas management
    There is no landfill gas management at this moment. LFG emitted freely to the environment.
    Calculation of landfill gas emitted into the environment and its impacts are included in
    Section 5.4.3.1. The impact is significant and long-term.
    5.3.1.2 Leacbate generation, collection and management

    Untreated leachate'S could be estimated about 75m3/day. It contains both new and old
    leachate. As landfill age increased, COD in leachate decreased and increase of ammonia
    nitrogen concentration resulting from the hydrolysis and fermentation of nitrogen containing
    fractions of biodegradable refuse substrates.
    At this moment, there is no solution for treating leachate coming from the closed and unlined
                                                                cell al. The intervention could only
                                                                be done just for the cell a2 and a3
                                                                which have bottom liner to prevent
                                                                the infiltration of leachate to
                                                                underneath soil and groundwater.

                                                                           in Quy Nhon are in the dry season

                                                                           limited, the leachate not collected
                                                                           will be accumulated in the cells. This
                                                                           is a high risk to the environment,
                                                                           especially under heavy rainfall. At
                                                                           this picture below, we could see the
                                                                           leakage from cell a3 coming out
                                                                           after a heavy rain.
    Figure 5-1 Leachate generation from the cell a3 after heavy rain
    This will significantly affect groundwater and surface water quality.

           1. Groundwater
    Within the distance of 500m from the old landfill cells, well waters are polluted and could not
    be used for drinking. Furthermore, most of local residents reported on dermatological diseases
    and gastro-intestinal infection. Unfortunately, no record data on groundwater strata and its
    level makes it is impossible to stimulate groundwater quality. In short, the pollution
    dispersion in groundwater is spreading unpredictably. The environmental impacts are assessed
    significant with high risk.

                    2. Surface water management
             At this moment, after burying 2m of waste, a 0.3m-thick layer of soil is used for covering.
             However, the type of soil currently used for cover is appropriate while it has a great porousity
             that water easily goes through I 9. Especially, in the heavy rainfall, the risk of overflowing to
             adjacent area is high. In the past, the stonn in 2008 washed leachate from the landfill into
             Thanh Long village.
             The environmental impacts are assessed significant with high risk.

-	                  3. Conclusion
             The operation 	of these cells contain highly adverse impacts to the environment. However,
'   .... 	   with the operation of LTP in 2013, the old collection system will be connected to the LTP
             through the designed manhole. The impacts are expected to reduce significantly.

             5.3.1.3 Scavengers

             There are about 20-40 scavengers collecting waste in the landfill. Most of them are poor local
             residents while some people from other areas come here to collect reusable or recyable items.
             About two thirds ofthem are women in the reproductive age (Figure 5-3). Children also appear in
             the scavenging group.



-            The risk to their health is extremely high because of manual handling and lack of protective
             clothing/equipment, resulting in direct contact with waste . Risks from manual handling of mixed
             waste may come from direct contact with broken glass, human/animal fecal matter, paper that
             may have become saturated with toxic materials, containers with residues of chemicals, pesticides
             or solvents, and needles and bandages from hospitals. Inhalation ofbioaerosols, and of smoke and
             fumes produced by open burning of waste, can cause health problems.


-            Although there are insufficient data on the long-term effect of exposure to air-borne bacteria as
             well as infectious or toxic materials present in solid waste, studies have shown that respiratory and
             dennatological problems, eye infections and low life expectancy are common20 . In the in-depth

    diseases and intestinal diseases. There are two ofthem died because of cancers recently. I,




    Figure 5-3 Scavengers (a) and cow-feeding by rubbish (b)
    Another dangerous impacts could come from the cows grazing rubbish at the landfill. About a
    hundred of cows present at the landfill and are fed by rubbish. They grow faster but their life
    expectancy becomes shorter. They died 3-4 months earlier than cows feeded by grass. There is no
    clear evidence of health impacts from eating these cows, however, some diseases could be
    assigned to the transmission from the cows to people such as typhoid and foot-and-mouth disease.
    Therefore, its impact is significant, long-term. Therefore, the project must take these scavengers
    into account in the design of new landfill.

    5.3.1.4 Vectors

    As well as feeding on the solid wastes, the vectors such as rats, flies, mosquitors and
    cockroaches find in the garbage a favorable environment for reproduction and it becomes a
    breeding ground for the transmission of diseases, from a simple diarrhea to severe cases of
    typhoid or other more serious illnesses. This impact is assessed significant and long-term.


-   5.3.2 Temporary closure of old landfill cells
    It is expected that the old cells can accept further 213,000m3 of waste at waste density of
    700kg/m3 until the late 2012. The procedure of temporary closure of the old landfill cells
    follows these steps:
               Reinforce, compact the existing cells aI, a2, and a3. 

               Cover the surface of cells with a 60-cm clay layer and 30-cm of surface soil. It is 

               recommended to use geomembrane instead, in the case of scarcity of clay. The time 

               from temporary closure of old landfill cells to re-use it for ground of Cell C1 is 

               estimated 4-5 years. 

               Let the cells settle until the closure of disposal cell C3 (expected to be 4-5 years) 

    From the time of closure of the old landfill cells, new leachate treatment facilities will go into
    operation, Presented here are main impacts of temporary closure of old landfill cells.

       5.4 	 CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND CLOSURE OF NEW LONG
             MY LANDFILL CELLS
       The expansion of Long My landfill will reduce the pressure on overloaded old site. The
       project will improve the performance of waste collection, transporting and treatment;
       therefore, it will reduce the impacts of widespread solid waste disposal in urban areas.
       However, the current Long My landfill is being objected because of its pollution. As a result,
       the expansion of Long My landfill has raised concerns about the ability to increase its
       pollution to surrounding areas.

       5.4.1 Pre-construction phase
       In the pre-construction phase, impacts are mainly from site selection and land acquisition.

       5.4.1.1 Site selection for Long My landflll

       The scale of the landfill is determined in the Circular o11200 lITTLT-BXD-BKHCNMT.
       Based on its capacity, Long My landfill is classified as a "large" landfill. The site selection for
       the landfill must be evaluated based on multidisciplinary criteria which are related to the level
       of urbanization, construction and operation indicators, and hydrogeological, environmental
       and social factors.

        The appropriation of the location of Long My landfill is assessed as "good". The most
        concern of the location is the existence of the stream in the site, the distance to residential
        areas and its influence on the water supply source for Quy Nhon city. These issues must be
        resolved reasonably.

        5.4.1.2 Land acquisition

        The core zone: Long My Landfill is expanded from the existing one (about 5.54 ha for landfill
        and 6.6 ha for compo sting area) to 61.61ha, of which area used for Quy Nhon sub-project are
        19.76 ha (landfill No 1,2,3 and auxiliary works). Among the land to be taken, landfill cell No.1
        has been cleared by URENCO, thus Quy Nhon subproject will only be responsible for the cells
1111t   No.2&3 with area of about 7.6ha.

-       The buffer zone: the buffer areas are (i) remarkably forest land with Eucalyptus, Acacia that is
        no need for compensation and (ii) some residential quarters living scattered around the
        existing Long My area. In 2010, due to unsanitary conditions of the existing landfill, Binh

-       Dinh PPC decided to relocate 102 households living in the buffer zone of the landfill to new
        resettlement site in the Decision 3283/QD-CTUBND and Decision 2928/uBND-TC
        (Appendix 5-5).
        The pipeline: the pipeline will be installed along the existing road used for industrial factories.
        There is no requirement for clearance and resettlement.
        There is no requirement for house clearance in the scope of this project. In addition, the
        landfIll does not affect any cultural property.

    5.4.2 Construction phase
    The construction of the landfill is different from any construction because the construction of
    a new landfill cell will start just before the closure of an old cell. Therefore, the calculation for
    pollution loadings will be separated for each cell. Some sources of impacts such as failure of
    excavations, embankments or drainage facilities could have a significant effect on the landfill,
    while unsatisfactory road construction may cause only slight inconveniences.

      5.4.3 Operation phase
      The operation phase of landfill cells contain many comprehensive issues which are interconnected
      to each other. The assessment of operation phase will be presented as following:
          1. Impacts on air quality
          2. Impacts on water quality
          3. Impacts on soil quality
          4. Waste
          5. Health and social impacts
          6. Risk assessment oflandfill operation
-	    The project tries to address the environmental impacts and integrates mitigation measures into the
      design to reduce their effect as much as possible. Therefore, the assessment of the landfill must

-     take these efforts into account.

      5.4.3.1 Impacts on air quality

      Potential key air quality impacts during the operational phase of the landfill may arise as a
      result of the following causes:

          •   Landfill gas generation and disposal
-         •   Odour emissions from the waste handling and degradation processes, leachate pre­
              treatment facilities. The generation and release of odorous compounds from waste
              materials during transport, handling and disposal operations are inevitable and
-         •
              unavoidable consequences of these types of operation.

       5.4.3.2 Impacts OD surface water quality

             1. Stonnwater run-off from the mountain
       Source of impacts
       The proposed landfill at Long My is located in an area that is surrounded by mountains on
       three sides. As a result, it will be exposed to stonn water runoff from the mountain slopes.
       With the peak discharge of 12.71 m3/s from IS-year stonn39 in 24-hour continuously40, about
       1,098,300 m3 of stonn-water run-off will be discharged to the downstream area. There is no
       discharge limits established for stonnwater from the landfill either in Vietnam or in other
       countries such as America41 . This impact is long-tenn, significant.
       Mitigated impacts
       A system of large soil benn around three sides of the landfill site of 10m width and 21-30m
       height will be constructed to prevent stonnwater from entering to the landfill. In addition, the
       technical consultant constructs open ditch surrounding three sides of the land fill area to
       intercept the runoff and prevent it from entering the landfill cells with dimensions as
       following: B x H x L = l.sm x l.sm x 80m (west side of the landfill) and B x H x L = 2.0m x
       105m x S20m (east side of the landfill) and R.C pipe DIS00 x L=22Om (in the middle of the
       landfill). Diverted stonnwater run-off from the mountain will be discharged to the existing
       stream in the buffer zone.
       Residual impacts
       Although it could be considered "non-contaminated stonnwater", it could cause flooding in the
       downstream area This impact is assessed significant.

             2. Stonnwater run-on in landfill area
       Source of impacts
       Total run-on in the landfill is designed based on totallandfilling area (19.7ha) in Appendix 5-8.
       It is about 2.3m3Is.
       Mitigated impacts
       Inside the landfill, in the operation phase, each cell will be divided into sub-cells which is
       separated by small dikes of 2m height in order to prevent the widespread pollution of stonn­
       water run-on from landfilling area
       Except the active sub-cell, stonnwater in other sub-cells could be considered as "clean" run-off
       and collected into the drainage system. In the active sub-cell, stonn-water could be

        contaminated by running through open surface and is considered as leachate. It will be collected
        by the leachate collection system. This long-term impact is assessed medium.
        Residual impacts
        If the operation process of waste disposal is not strictly followed, non-contaminated stormwater
        could become contaminated storm-water which causes negative impacts on the downstream
        areas. This impact is significant, long-term, mitigable.

            3. Leachate generation. collection and recirculation
        Source of impacts
        Leachate generation rate will be about 200m3/day. It has high concentration of BOD (1,500
        mg/l), COD (2,500mg/I), TSS (4,000mg/l) and Ammonia-N (200mg/l) whereas concentration
        of heavy metals is low or undetectable (Section 3.3.4).
        Raw leachate has high BOD, COD and ammoniacal nitrogen which are harmful contaminants.
        Discharge of raw leachate into the receiving streams/rivers would affect the surface water
        quality and the aquatic system.
        Mitigated impacts
        Some measures and facilities are provided in the landfill to control surface water and
        groundwater entering the landfill and hence the leachate production will be reduced to minimal
        level. This section assesses the effectiveness of the proposed leachate management system and
<   ,
        the potential water quality impacts due to the handling and pre-treatment ofleachate.

,""     Bottom Lining System
        The bottom lining system of the landfill is presented in Figure 2-7. The leachate collection
        layer will comprise a layer of 250mm crushed stone (10-20 mm size) of sufficient physical
        strength to withstand the likely loadings from the overlying waste.

        Side Slope Lining System
        At the side slope areas, the leachate collection layer would comprise a geosynthetic drainage
        layer. Leachate collected at the geosynthetic drainage layer will flow down by gravity to the
        bottom lining system where leachate will be collected by the pipework.

-       Leachate collection system
        The leachate collection layer will have a hydraulic conductivity of at least 1x I 0-4 m S·I, and a
        minimum gradient (vertical to horizontal) of I %. The leachate collection layer will be placed
        on the bottom liner with care, using a hydraulic excavator, to ensure that no damage is caused
        to the bottom liner. Pipework will be jointed by butt-fusion welding to prevent leakage.
        Access points will be maintained to enable jetting of the pipework to maintain its flow
        characteristics throughout the life of the landfill.
        Drainage pipe work will be installed within the leachate collection layer. The pipework will be
        manufactured from HDPE (Dmain pipe 400mm, Dbranch = 200mm) to minimise clogging and
        allow for inspection and cleaning and will be perforated with holes (D=1O-20mm).
        The leachate drainage pipework will be designed such that the maximum head of leachate
        does not exceed I m. In order to control the leachate head below this level, the maximum
        spacing of the collection pipes is about 50m.
        Leachate recirculation


        Infra- Thang Long Co.                                                                           82
       Coastal Cities Environmental Sanitation Project Quy Nhon city Sub-project
       Environmental Impact Assessment: Component 3 -Solid Waste Management

       Some of the leachate collected in the storage tank will be recirculated to landfill by HDPE
       pipeline of D160. The benefits of leachate recirculation are reduction of organic content in
       leachate and increase in recovery of landfill gas and waste stabilization rate. In addition,
       recirculation reduces the pH of leachate and also reduces release of heavy metals.
       Residual impacts
       The environmental risks due to leachate leakage, under the unpredictable situation such as
       degradation of the cap or bottom liners, are low.
       The leachate level may increase due to ill-designed leachate head which may cause seepage of
       leachate through the side slopes and contamination of surface water.
       Shallow groundwater could penetrate to the cell, however, if the bottom lining system is
       properly installed, this type of risk is low. These impacts are significant and long-term.

             4. Other sources of wastewater in landfill
       Source of impacts
       From the landfill area, there are some other possible sources of wastewater from washing
       vehicles, the composting facility, air pollutant treatment in the medical waste incinerator and
       domestic wastewater from the staff.

...    Mitigated impacts
•• 	   These types of wastewater generated with low flowrate will be transported to the leachate pre­
       treatment system. There is no significant impact generated from this source of wastewater.

-             5. Leachate treatment and discharge in WWTP 2A
       After pre-treatment in Long My landfill, leachate will be pumped to WWTP 2A for further
       treatment. As stated in Section 2.5.4.10 Leachate Treatment System, WWTP 2A previously
       designed for domestic wastewater treatment by oxidation ditches. There are two most
       concerns related to the co-treatment between domestic wastewater and leachate:
                  Influence of leachate on influent of WWTP 2A; and 

                  Quality ofHa Thanh river due to the discharge ofWWTP 2A. 

       The first concern will be addressed further in Section 5.4.3. 7 Risk Assessment of Landfill
       Operation. This section only deals with the operation of WWTP 2A and its impacts on Ha
       Thanh river quality.

       uses QUAL2K model which based on Streeter-Phelps formulations to simulate the dispersion
       of pollutants in the river for the following reasons:

                  The model is simple to trace the dispersion of BOD, Coliform and DO which are basic 

                  parameters of wastewater. 

                  The only reactions of interest are BOD exertion and transfer of oxygen from air to 

                  water across air-water interface 

                  The model could calculate many discharge points and parameters with wide range of 

                  applications. 

                  It is recommended by MONRE in Guidance for ELA of Municipal Solidwaste Landfill 

                  (MONRE, 2009). 


       Based on the design, there are two discharge points in Ha Thanh river from two wastewater
       treatment plants. The operational parameters are summarised as in Table 5-12.

".     WWTP 1B follows the effluent standard for Secondary treatment of concentrated domestic
       WWTP is TCVN 7222:2002. Despite the effluent standard for Secondary treatment of
       concentrated domestic WWTP is TCVN 7222:2002, WWTP 2A will treat leachate together
       with domestic wastewater. and QCVN 24:2009 (column B) should be applied. The standard
       applied for Ha Thanh river from the discharge point of WWTP2A towards Thi Nai lagoon is
       QCVN 08:2008 (column Bl)44.

         Modeling of surface water quality
         Scenarios
         The EIA will assess two cases:
             1. 	 Leachate affects the WWTP2A performance and it has to discharge all untreated
                  wastewater into Ha Thanh river.
             2. 	 WWTP 2A works effectively and meets discharge standards;


         Objectives

         The goals of modeling Ha Thanh river water quality are:

             1. 	 Determine the distance from the discharge point to the location that the river meet
                  QCVN08: 2008 (BI): BODs = I5mg'l, DO = 4 mg'l and total Coliform = 7500MPN/iOOml
            2. 	 Determination of water quality in estuaries adjacent to the Thi Nai Lagoon, a distance
                 of2.5km from the location of the plant discharge WWTP lB.
            3. 	 Determine the recovery zone to meet the baseline data of Ha Thanh river: BODs               =
                 13.3 mg/l, DO = 4.6 mg/L and total Coliform = 4.8xl03 (MPNIlOOml)


         Since then, the report will propose appropriate mitigation measures.

         Assumptions
.... 	       1. Model:
                      Applying Streeter-Phelps model to calculate the concentration of BOD, DO, and


-
                      total Coliform, and forecasting the impacts on Ha Thanh river's quality.
                      Treated water will be mixed completely with river water at the discharge point.
                      There are two scenarios: high tide and low tide; 



-                     The model will be simulated at the worst case when all plants operate in the dry season;



            2. 	 Effects of topology and hydrology:
                    It is assumed that the diversity of topology will not affect the pollutant dispersion, the
                      flow is considered as straight line from WWTP2A discharge point to Thi Nai lagoon;
                      Effects of small rivers and Phu Hoa lake to Ha Thanh river's water quality are
-                     insignificant;
                      The flow is even, that means velocity, flowrate and depth ofthe river keep constant;

         Location of discharge points of WWTPs to Ha Thanh River is simplified as follows:

,.'    Conclusion

       For normal operations (WWTP complying with Standard discharge limits), modeling results
       predicted that the cumulative impact has a minor localized effect upon water quality in the
       river system. For all pollutants, there is no detectable difference in pollutant concentrations
       between presence and absence of leachate into WWTP. However, DO does not meet
       QCVN08:2008 (column BI) from the distance of 750m downstream.


. ,
       Abnormal operations: Modelling results indicate that failure of WWTP 2A would result in the
       sudden degradation in local river water quality (in respect of DO, BOD, and coliform), and
       commensurate impacts to aquatic life, if the abnormal discharge were sustained. Proper
       operation of the WWTP according to design is hence crucial to ensure minimal impacts to
       river water quality. In low tide, Coliform in the river is much higher than permitted level in
       QCVN 08:2008 (column Bl) and DO does not meet the standard from the distance of 750m
       downstream.

       5.4.3.3 Impacts on groundwater quality

       Source of impacts
       The groundwater quality is currently impacted by infiltrated leachate of unlined cells.
       Unfortunately, no historical record in groundwater flow regime in this region makes it
       impossible to predict the pollutant dispersion. The mitigation measures for this issue will be
       discussed in Chapter 6. Present here only impacts of new landfill cells on groundwater quality.
       Mitigated impacts
       The landfill is designed and constructed as a containment facility incorporating a multi-layer
       composite liner system covering the entire land formation of the landfill site where waste will
       be deposited. This will not only prevent infiltration of groundwater into the waste and hence

minimising leachate generation, and also prevent off-site migration of leachate and
                                                                            7
contamination of the groundwater. With the permeability coefficient of 10- Cm/S, it will take
about 19 years for leachate to come through O.6m of clay layer at the bottom liner. To reach to
groundwater level, it takes additional 2 years. In the case of GCL is used instead, it is
expected to be longer.
Residual impacts
The possibility of sub-surface off-site migration of leachate into groundwater due to potential
pin holes and defected seams in the liner still presents. Therefore, the impact is assessed as
significant, long-term but low probability.

5.4.3.4 Impacts on soil quality

Although many mitigation measures have been taken into design such as bottom layers, side
slope liners, migration of landfill gas into the adjacent soil becomes possible in the case that
pin holes or defected seams occur. As a consequence the air in the soil is substituted by
landfill emissions which kill off existing vegetation. In addition, a certain pollution of the
water in the soil can take place by the dissoluticn organic compounds of the gas.
Soil erosion will be a similar concern during the operation of the landfill as construction
activities will continue throughout the operational phase. In addition, whilst landfilling is
ongoing in one phase, the subsequent phase will likely be under construction.
Additional soil erosion source during the operation phase will be erosion of exposed
intermediate cover in filled or partially filled cells. Completely filled landfill cells will be
turfed to reduce soil erosion rates.
These impacts are significant, long-term and must be mitigated.

5.4.3.5 Waste

Waste generated during the operational phase of the pre-treatment facility at Long My landfill
and WWTP 2A is mainly composed of:
    sludge from the pre-treatment and WWTP 2A;
    chemical waste;
    domestic solid waste

            1. Sludge

    Pre-treatment ofleachate at Long My landfill
    Sludge generated from preliminary treatment of leachate comes from sedimentation tanks and
    storage ponds. Lime sludge, SS and heavy metals will be removed from the sedimentation
    basins and lagoons with a mobile sludge pump or tanker truck during dry months.
    The addition of lime, introduced to the leachate flow as it enters the sedimentation basins, will
    be used to adjust the pH and reduce the concentration of metals, COD, and color prior to
    pumping to the WWTP. It is expected that the amount of lime required will be approximately
    2.5 gIL, equal to 10 bags per day (500 kg/day).
    For metals removal, the lime dose of 2.5 g/L is sufficient to provide the best effectiveness of
                                                                          46
    lime precipitation not only for metals removal but also for the colour . All the analysed metals
    respect the following limiting values < 15 mg/L, with Cr6+ <0.1 mg/L, Cd <0.2 mg/L, Pb <1
    mg/L' Hg <0.05 mgIL. It is assumed that the removal efficiency of heavy metals and SS is
    about 50%; and lime is mixed completely to raise pH.
    The generation rate of sludge in Long My landfill is estimated in Table 5-16.

           2. Chemical Waste
    The operation work will involve the use of mechanical machinery. Similar to the construction
    activities, the chemical waste likely to be generated during the operation and restoration ofthe
    landfill may include:
           Used paint, engine oils, hydraulic fluids and waste fuel;
           Spent mineral oils/cleaning fluids from mechanical machinery; and
           Spent solvents/solutions from equipment cleaning activities.
    The amount of chemical waste (mainly lubricant) that will arise from the operation and
    restoration activities will vary on monthly basis depending on the maintenance schedule. It is
    anticipated that the quantity of chemical waste to be generated during the operation phase will
    be small (on average less than lOOLf month).

           3. Domestic solid waste

-   General refuse will arise from the operation staff and administrative activities. General refuse
    may consist of food waste, plastics, aluminium can and waste paper. With a general refuse
    generation rate of 0.50 kg per person per day, the amount of general refuse to be generated
    will be about 12 kg per day. This will be disposed at Long My landfill. No impact could be
    considered.
    5.4.3.6 Health aDd social impact

           1. Social impacts
    The local community was consulted regarding the possible impacts of the proposed landfill.
               89% of interviewed people48 expressed their concerns that whether the upgraded
               landfill can reduce odors, flies and surface water and groundwater pollution or not.
               About 215 households with relative large distances to landfills still use well water for
               drinking. But, according the result of consultation, over 50% of wells were
               contaminated, which is affecting seriously the villager's health daily. Most of them
               suggested that the authority should provide them with safe drinking water and the

            odors from the landfill must be prevented by a suitable technical measures and
            community sanitation activities.
            Odor at the village emits from the landfill and also from the dried stream across the
            village and cow-rasing actitvities. Unexpected smell is unavoidable both within and
            outside the buffer zone because of wind direction.

    Although the scope of in-depth interviews did not include all residents in the area, but the
    result could be representative. However, through interviews with local people, main concerns
    are jobs and sources of water supply for daily life, the odor problem stands for second.
    It is expected that groundwater pollution will be low for new cells.

       2. Health impacts
    The anticipated health impacts are classified into the following categories:

     the road with the average of about 45 turns per day (equivalent to 8 working years). It could
     cause traffic accidents to people living along the haulage route and people driving on the
     road. This impact is assessed medium, long-term.

     5.4.3.7 Risk assessment of landfill operation

          1. Risk assessment of landfill gas
     Landfill gas is hazardous for three key reasons. First, landfill gas becomes explosive when it
     escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen. The lower explosive limit is 5% methane
     and the upper explosive limit is 15% methane. Second, the methane contained within biogas
     is 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Therefore, uncontained
     landfill gas which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the effects of
     global warming. And third, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contained in landfill gas
     contribute to the fonnation of photochemical smog.
     On the basis of the source, pathways and targets identified in Appendix 5-12, a source­
     pathway-target analysis has been undertaken and is presented in Table 5-20 according to the
     assessment framework. Different combination of source, pathway and target result in a range
     of overall potential hazards.

       The source-pathway-target analysis shows that landfill gas risk posed by the Long My landfill
       is medium to high both the construction and operation phases. Implementation of the landfill
--     gas control measures, and restoration works undertaken will also significantly reduce the

-
     potential for off-site migration of landfill gas to the adjacent areas.

               Landfill gas hazards
       All contractors participating in the works and operational staff should be aware that potential of
       CIL and CO2 present in the soil and all works should be undertaken on the basis of an "assumed
       presence of landfill gas". In addition the following properties of landfill gas should be noted.
           Methane is odourless and colourless, although in landfill gas it is typically associated with
           numerous highly odoriferous compounds which give some warning of its presence. However,
           the absence of odour should not be taken to mean that there is no methane. Methane levels can
           only be reliably confirmed by using appropriately calibrated portable methane detectors.
           Methane is also an asphyxiant and could be explosive in combination with oxygen of
           proper ratio.
           Carbon dioxide, the other major component of landfill gas is an asphyxiating gas and causes
           adverse health effects at relatively low concentrations. The long-tenn Occupational Exposure
           Limit (OEL) is 0.5% (v/v). Like methane, it is odourless and colourless and its presence (or
           absence) can only be confirmed by using appropriately calibrated portable detectors.
           Gas density. Methane is lighter than air whereas carbon dioxide is heavier than air. Typical
           mixtures of landfill gas are likely to have a density close to or equal to that of air. However,

       Infra-Thang Long Co.                                                                                     94

           site conditions may result in a ratio of methane to carbon dioxide which may make the gas
           mixture lighter or heavier than air. As a result, landfill gas may accwnulate in either the base
           or top of any voids or confmed spaces.

               Greenhouse gas effects
     Source of impacts
     Landfill is among the big sources of greenhouse gases, with the representatives CI-4 and C02.
     According to the result of LANDGem model, total volume of COl and CH4 generated from
     the landfill are 2.53xl0 8m 3 and 2.53xl0 8m 3, respectively. They are the two main components
     causing the greenhouse effect. However, the effect of atmospheric CI-4 is 21 times higher
     than CO2 ; and with the presence of aerosols, this percentage increased to 33 times (NASA
     research, Science Journal, No. 11, 2009).

-    Residual impacts
     However, with the atmospheric volume of of 15.18xl08 m 3 GHG (equivalent to C02), this is a

'-   great source of GHG emission.

            2. Risk assessment of fire and exploitation

-	   Uncontrolled landfill could cause fire hazards due to improper management of methane gas
     from generation, collection and flaring. Methane is a flammable gas and will burn when
     mixed with air between approximately 5 and 15% (v/v). If a mixture of methane and air with
     a composition between these two values is ignited in a confined space, the resulting
     combustion may give rise to an explosion. Due to high generation rate of LFG in the landfill,
     the risk is assessed to be high.

     Fires at landfills can be classified into 4 categories, corresponding to the level of alert:
             Levell: Small fires occurring on the landfill property, but not actually involving
             landfilled waste, compost or stockpiled recyclables.
             Level 2: Small waste fires that can be contained by on-site resources within 24 hours
             and fully extinguished within 48 hours. Level 2 fires will typically involve less than
             200 m3 of burning material.
             Level 3: Medium size waste fires or large fires at compost facilities that can be
             contained in less than one week and that can be fully extinguished in less than two
             weeks. Typically, 200 to 5,000 m3 of waste is involved.
             Level 4: Large or Deep Seated Landfill Fires that require more than 2 weeks to contain
             typically involving more than 5,000 m 3 of burning waste.

         3. Risk assessment of leachate discharge into WWTP 2A
     The most concerned issue when discharging leachate into domestic wastewater is heavy
     metals. Therefore, in order to assess the risk of heavy metals to influent of WWTP2A, it is
     assumed that performance of heavy metal removal in preliminary treatment process in Long
     My landfill is 0%. Table 3-21 shows the concentration of heavy metals in influent ofWWTP
     2A when mixed with leachate (at the dilution ratio of leachate:domestic wastewater;::: 1:23).

     The increase of heavy metals in domestic wastewater could be seen insignificant. At high
     concentration, heavy metals will inhibit the activity of micro-organisms, but at low
     concentrations, they will be necessary for micro-organism development.
     Furthermore, the addition of lime in the preliminary treatment of leachate will increase
     significantly the removal efficiency of heavy metals. Therefore, the impact of heavy metals in
     leachate to the influent of WWTP 2A is insignificant.

         4. Risk of leakage of wastewater transmission pipeline
     Pre-treated leachate will be conveyed from the landfill to WWTP2A by a HDPE pipeline of
     8.22km. This poses a risk of leakage of wastewater into soil. Although it has a low flow-rate


-
           3
     200m /day and transmission route is used mainly for industrial purposes, a lengthy pipeline
     could be damaged by digging activities or transportation activities. It could pollute soil and

-    groundwater quality. The risk is assessed medium to high.

5.4.4 Closure and post-closure phase

5.4.4.1 Impacts on air quality

        •      Air pollution
Upon completion of final filling and capping, the closure phase will commence and is
estimated to last for up to 20 years. The LFG flare and leachate management system will
continue to operate during the aftercare phase.
Together with the final capping system, the permanent LFG extraction system will prevent
fugitive emission of LFG from the restored landfill. The LFG abstracted will be flared. Under
a high combustion temperature (850°C) at the flare, the odorous VOCs in the LFG will be
oxidised and destroyed. Conversely, the total LFG generated from the restored landfill will
                                              I
increase (maximum yield of about 3,000m3 hr- ) •

         •

From the Year 2020 when the landfill cells are full, they will be restored. URENCO will be
responsible for the landfill restoration for a period of 20 years. The restoration of the landfill
will involve limited construction works and is expected to have insignificant noise impact
compared with the construction and operation of the landfill.

5.4.4.2 Impacts on surface water quality

Source of impacts
During this period, leachate will continue to be generated. The established leachate control
measures and treatment will continue to operate throughout the aftercare period.
Mitigated impacts
In the previous sections, it has been mentioned that the components of the leachate management
system will prevent leachate from seeping from the side slopes to the surface drainage channels
and off-site migration from the side slope containment systems. In addition, proper site
maintenance will be undertaken during the aftercare period to ensure that the capping system,
leachate collection system and treatment system will be performed to comply with the design
requirements. Surface water, groundwater and effiuent quality monitoring will also be
undertaken during the aftercare period in accordance to the monitoring plan.
With the presence of the muti-Iayer capping and bottom liner systems, proper site
maintenance and regular monitoring, the probability of the leachate leakage from the capping
system and containment system is expected to be very low.
Residual impacts
Nevertheless, the water quality impacts of potential leakage of leachate have been assessed.
The surface breakout could happen under unfavourable conditions such as heavy rainfall, soil
erosion and uneven settlement. Furthermore, an inappropriate operational procedure could
result in leachate head excess over 1 m and leachate will come out. This type of impact is
assessed medium to significant.

    5.4.4.3 Impacts on groundwater quality

    Source of impacts
    Potential risks to groundwater quality will be associated with leakage of leachate from the
    landfill site through the bottom and side slope lining systems.
    Mitigated impacts
    The leachate leakage to the groundwater will be prevented by effective leachate management
    as well as full implementation of a monitoring programme. Routine monitoring of the
    groundwater quality is recommended to detect any leachate leakage and if it is the case,
    appropriate and adequate remedial measures should be implemented.
    Residual impacts
    Similarly to the operation phase, it takes about 20 years for infiltrated leachate to reach to the
    groundwater.

    5.4.4.4 Settlement rate

    Settlement in the landfill results in several problems, such as crack formations in the cover
    and liner system, damage to the liquid and gas collection and drainage system. Therefore,
    accurate prediction of landfill settlement is the key issue in the design and construction of
    landfills and also an integral part towards final closure of a site and its ultimate usage.
    However, settlement prediction in landfills is complex and less understood compared to
    settlement in coarse or fine grained soils primarily due to the complex biodegradation process
    and refuse inhomogeneity. After 14 years of closure, all of the cells reach to a constant
    settlement rate 2.32m, 2.58m, 2.70m for Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3, respectively51. Expected
    final height of the landfill will be 22.42m.

    5.4.4.5 Soil erosion and landslide

    Soil erosion will be a similar concern with the operation phase of the landfill. Insufficient
    drainage control features together with sparsely planted area leads to erosion and off-site
    discharge of sediments. Erosion control for above grade top dome surfaces and external
    embankment side slopes that drain directly to the site perimeter stormwater management
    system will significantly reduce the risk of soil erosion.
    The risk oflandslide in this area is expected low due to its stable geographical characteristics.
    5.4.4.6 Use options of the landfill

    In the closure phase, the landfill will be used for landscaping only. It is not permitted for
    public access, therefore, the impact is not significant.

         waste. This section will discuss about negative impacts of the incinerator on the environment.

         5.5.1 Gaseous Emissions from the Incinerator
         Medical waste incinerators can emit significant quantities of pollutants to the atmosphere.
         These pollutants include: (1) particulate matter (PM), (2) metals, (3) acid gases, (4) oxides of
         nitrogen (NOx), (5) carbon monoxide (CO), (6) organics, and (7) various other materials
         present in medical wastes, such as pathogens, cytotoxins, and radioactive diagnostic materials.
         The environmental impacts of these pollutants are presented in Appendix 5-14.
         In this project, the package for incinerator follows BOT procedure. Therefore, there is no
         information for the EIA consultant to assess the impacts of the emission of the incinerator.
         The operators will sign the contract with PMU to ensure that the incinerator will meet the
         applicable standard QCVN02:2009. It is the premises for the EIA consultant to check as if it
         can meet the standards for ambient air quality.
                                                                                       3
         The flow-rate of air emission from the incinerator is about O.33m /s (Appendix 5-15).

 .    With an integrated air pollution control sytem in the incinerator, the concentration of air
      pollutants are within the permitted value of QCVN OS:2008. Therefore, the impact is
      insignificant.

.'.   Fuel requirements for the incinerator per hour:
                   O.S L/kg of waste x 200 kg ofwastelhour = 100 kg/hour = 800 kg/day = 1000 Llday
       This is a significant operational issue that makes the incinerator operation unsustainable.
       The generation rate of air emission is about 48.1 m3 per kg of diesel.

             5.5.3 Ash
             Ash is generated as a by-product of the process of waste burning. About 10% of ash is fly-ash
             which is collected in the integrated air treatment system, 90% remaining is residues. The
             generation rate of ash is about 10.03% (w/w) of medical waste which is equivalent to
             20kg/day. Residues are composed of inert materials, glass, 2-10% Carbon and heavy metals.
             The concentration of heavy metals of residues could be referenced to the research
             "Assessment of performance of medical incinerators in the South of Vietnam".

             From the table, heavy metals in residues have high toxicity. If it is not collected and treated
             properly, it is a great source of soil contamination and water contamination. Heavy metals
             could dissolve and create complex substances in the soil. In the rain, these substances could
             be dispersed in a wide area. Heavy metals do not only affect the quality of the environment,
             they also accumulate in the food web and poison human beings and animals. Therefore, this
             impact is long-term and significant.

             5.5.4 Wastewater

-            Air pollutants from the incinerator will be collected and treated by the air pollution treatment
             system which is incorporated in the incinerator. This treatment system includes cooling,
             settling, filter bags and air scrubber. The air scrubber uses Ca(0H)2 solution for absorption of
             air pollutants such as C02, S02, N02 and other acid gases. The performance of this air
             scrubber could be 95%. After this, clean air is emitted to the environment. The Ca(0H)2
             solution is recirculated for about one week. After one week, it will be discharged to the
             leachate pre-treatment facilities with the flowrate of 5m3 per week. The main compositions
             are SS and dissolved solids generated from reactions between acid gases and Ca(OH)2.

     The wastewater will be collected into sedimentation ponds and will not discharged directly to
     the environment, therefore, its impacts is insignificant.

     5.5.5 Working safety
     The major risk of infection to an operator is from puncture wounds caused by contaminated
     objects such as surgical instruments, needles, and broken glass. Most, if not all, hospitals are
     using special rigid, secure containers to prevent injury from infected sharp objects.

     5.5.6 Impacts of handling of medical waste in the site
     Medical waste has several sources. Naming them brings to light the potential environmental
     impact. Sources include sharps, which are needles, scalpels and other pointed instruments.
     Laboratory cultures from diagnostics, blood and blood products, and pathological waste are
     further sources. Chemicals used in x-rays represents another environmental risk. The concern
     with these medical wastes is the introduction of diseases such as HIV-AIDS into the
     environment. Immediate contact poses the greatest threat.
     Akter et. al., (1998) reported that, there were several incidents of injury due to exposure to
     medical wastes. Sharps, which include syringes and needles, have the highest disease
     transmission potential amongst all categories of medical waste.
     Infectious hospital waste represents only a small part of total medical waste; yet, because of
     ethical questions and infection risks, it is a focal point of public interest. Infectious waste
     contains different kind of pathogens or organisms that is potential for infection or disease if it
     is not properly disposed.

       5.6 CONCLUSION
       Whereas construction and operation of URENCO depot and public toilets are quite simple, the
       construction and operation of the landfill contain many complex issues. The operation of landfill
       will attract more attention from the public and public media A failure in landfill construction and
       operation results in significant impacts in many environmental media which in turn will cause
       great pressure on landfill operation unit. Therefore, mitigation measures for landfill must be paid
       careful attention.

         CHAPTER 6.MITIGATION MEASURES

         The mitigation measures must be designed to minimize environmental impacts with the
         following principles:

                  They must minimize disruptions to daily life and movement demand of local people; 

                  The proposed measures must be feasible in tenus of economic, environment and social; 

                  They must comply with standards and technical regulations; 

                  They must use environmental-friendly equipments and construction methods; 

                  There is regular monitoring regime; 


         All works will be done in accordance with appropriate standards, and construction methods
         defined in the tender documents/contracts. These conditions required the contractor to apply
         measures to minimize environmental impact are proposed in the EIA. Compliance will be
         tracked and monitored by WB, DONRE, PMU and ISMC.

         6.1 URENCO DEPOT AND PUBLIC TOILETS
         The environmental impacts of construction and operation phases of URENCO depot and
         public toilets are very similar. Therefore, it will be presented together. Here the EIA
         consultant applies Environmental Code of Practice for general environmental impacts. Details
         of ECOP will be referenced to Appendix 6-1.

-
        The most important part of a landfill closure and restoration plan, where surface water,
          groundwater, soil and air protection measures are in place, is to construct the low permeability
          cover, or cap over the waste where final elevation are reached.
          The following procedures are typically proposed to close and restore a landfill:
             •                   Cover all waste. All waste must be sufficiently covered and any
                  unstable areas of the landfill should be well marked with barriers;
             •                    Permit sufficient time for settling of any recently deposited wastes.
                  Although the rate of settling varies, most settlement will occur within the first few
                  years of landfilling. Accordingly, sufficient time must be allowed for the area to settle.
              •                   Apply final cover.
              •                   Grade fmal slopes to around 5% (1 in 20). Factors that influence the
-
                final are climate, vegetation, and soil characteristics. In areas with high rainfall such as

            Long My landfill, it is necessary to use extensive erosion and drainage control for slopes
            above 5%.
         •	              Prepare the contour map of the closed landfill.
         •	                    Install a permanent system of surface drainage channels on the
              landfill. Since settlement will continue for several years thereafter, these drainage
              structures must be designed to be flexible so as to accommodate differential settlement
              within the landfill.
         •	                Check sediment and erosion control and modify according to any
              change in slopes. After maximum settlement has occurred, the area should be re­
            graded to provide proper drainage. Depressions and cracks should be filled using on­
            site or imported material. Bulldozers and/or graders area normally used for spreading
            and grading.
         •	                 Disassemble temporary structures and waste receiving areas not
            required for the after-use of the site.
         •	                    Seed the final cover with the appropriate mixture of grasses.
            Climate and final site use are major factors in determining the type of grass and
            vegetation to be used.
         •	                 Outline a timetable to ensure that the following features are inspected
            at appropriate regular intervals.
         •	                    Use the closed landfill for landscaping.
         •	                    Regurlaly monitoring the environment for 15 years.

        6.3.3.3 Settlement and erosion

        Erosion and settlement control for above grade top dome surfaces and external embankment
        side slopes that drain directly to the site perimeter stormwater management system, have
        received intermediate cover and either reached their permitted configuration or will remain
        inactive for longer than 180 days should be managed using a system of non structural and
        structural erosion and sediment controls to meet rule requirements for the intermediate cover
        phase of landfill construction.
        Erosion and Sediment Control Management Practices are presented as following:


-               Side Slope Controls: Use of benches, terraces, berms or swales to decrease down
                slope velocities of runoff that could cause erosion.
                Seeding and Sodding: Establishment of vegetation on the top dome surfaces and the
                external embankment side slopes remains the preferred surface protection practice for
                control of erosion.
                The area should be re-graded, taking into account further expected settlement. After
                maximum resettlement has occurred, the area should be re-graded to provide proper
                drainage.
                Depressions and cracks should be fIlled using on-site or imported material. Bulldozers
                andJor graders are normally used for spreading and grading.

        6.3.3.4 Use of closed landfiH

        In the closure phase, the landfill will be used for landscaping only. These following mitigation
        measures would be done to reduce impacts of the landfill on landscape and visual effects.

             6.4.1 Gaseous Emissions from the Incinerator
             With an integrated air pollution control system in the incinerator, the concentration of air
             pollutants are within the permitted value of QCVN 05:2008. However, a range of operation
             and control measures should be taken to ensure the effectiveness of the incinerator.

           Exhaust                                      emergency exhaust is provided in the design, its
                             I                          location and method of operation must be specified.

             6.4.2 Fuel requirement

             Fuel requirement for the incinerator is about 1000 L/day. This is a significant operational
             issue that makes the incinerator operation unsustainable. It is suggested to use LFG instead.
             At this moment, the LFG extraction and collection system has been designed. In the future,
             when LFG generation is stabilised, LFG should be connected to the incinerator. If it is done,
             two advantages could be accounted: (I) reduction of fuel consumption; (2) reduction of LFG,
             a large source of GHG emission.

6.4.3 Ash
Fly ash from the incinerator's energy recovery and/or pollution control system shall be handled
separately from the burning zone's bottom ash. Fly ash must be tested for leachate toxicity.
The incinerator operation shall be controlled such that the organic content of the bottom ash
shall be minimized to the greatest degree possible. The organic content of ash sent for disposal
shall be periodically detennined through sampling and analysis at a frequency of at least four
times per year. Ash will be buried in the landfill together with sludge.

6.4.4 Wastewater
The wastewater must be collected into sedimentation ponds by the collection pipeline and will
not be discharged directly to the environment.

6.4.5 Handling of medical waste
Nonetheless, to prevent possible injury which could result in infection, safety rules which
should be followed include:
         Minimize the handling of medical waste;
         Ban the storage of medical waste on site;

         Keep medical bag wastes in a secure location prior to incineration;

         Never open these bags to inspect the contents;

          Follow procedures which maintain the integrity of the medical bag waste;
          Wear thick gloves when handling the bag waste;

         Wear hard-soled shoes when handling waste and working in the area around the
         incinerator;

          Wear safety glasses.


6.S SAFETY
6.5.1 Safety methods for landfill operation
Safety methods for landfill operation have been incorporated in these previous sections. Here
are other safety methods:
          Start landfilling on high ground and work toward low ground.
          First fill on the windward side of the site.

         Spread each load of waste and thoroughly compact it using a heavy, wheel-type
         landfill compactor, if available.

          Never deposit wastes against the advancing wall of the excavation.

         Once a load of soil has been picked up by an earth-moving machine, do not put it
         down until it is in its final resting place in the landfill.

    Coastal Cities Environmental Sanitation Project - Quy Nhon city Sub-project
    Environmental Impact Assessment: Component 3 - Solid Waste Management

             Keep the active area as small as possible and fill upward to final grade as directly as 

             possible. 

             Use the proper equipment and use it well within its capabilities. 

             Build interior haul roads high and drain them well. 

             Put interior haul roads on top of completed areas. 

             Keep intermediate waste slopes three horizontal to one vertical. 

             Keep surface and groundwater away from waste. 

             Keep trucks and equipment off all inactive areas. 


    6.5.2 Safety methods for incinerator operation

    6.5.2.1 Equipment safety procedures

    General safety procedures to prevent injury when working around the incinerator and air
    pollution control equipment include:
             Containers of flammable liquids/ explosives should never be fed into the incinerator;
             Always be cautious when opening the charging door. Wearing safety glasses, the
             operator should stand behind the door, open the door several centimeters and pause,
             and then open it fully;
             Never open clean-out port when the incinerator operates;
             Never enter the chambers without first turning off all power sources;
             Observe caution around all moving belts, hydraulic cyclinders, and doors;
             Be cautious when removing the ash;
             Wear proper personal safety equipment when operating the incinerator;


-
             Avoid direct contact with the hot surfaces of the incinerator chamber, heat recovery
             equipment, ductwork and stack;


-            The scrubber liquor from wet scrubbers likely to be caustic. Avoid contact with the
             liquid and wear eye protection near and around the scrubber;

    6.5.2.2 Fire safety

    Fire safety is particularly important when working around incinerators due to the nature of the
    high temperature combustion process. The areas in which the operator should exercise caution
    include: waste storage, waste charging to the incinerator, and ash removal.


-            Waste should be stored away from the incinerator and ash storage areas. 

             Charging waste into the incinerator has a particularly high fire hazard. When 

             charging manually, the operaior should exercise extreme caution. A fire safety

-            feature that should be included on manually loaded incinerators is an interlock

              system that shuts off the primary chamber burner(s) when the charging door is
              opened. 

              Safety equipment including gloves, hard-soled rubber shoes, and safety glasses must 

              be wore in handling of ash. Water quenching should occur only after removing the 

              ash from the incinerator to prevent damage to the incinerator refractory .

CHAPTER 7. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND
  MONITORING PLAN

7.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAM
Environmental monitoring program will be implemented in three stages of the project:
construction stage; operation stage and closure/post-closure stage (only with the landfill).
        During the construction, the environmental monitoring will be carried out by ISMC
        every 6 months. Periodical monitoring report will be submitted to PMU and WB and
        a copy will be sent to DONRE.
        In operation and closure phases, the environmental monitoring mission will be
        carried out by URENCO and reported to relevant local authorities (Binh Dinh
        DONRE).
        In the post-closure phase, the environmental monitoring program will be continued
        for 15 years.
Samling program and plan for the landfill are shown in Table 7-1 and Figure 7-1.

.
    This organisational structure is problematic. At first, the task of each unit is not clear. This
    leads to the ambiguity and overlapping between these units. For example, will the operational
    issues be dealt by Management and Operation Unit (M&O) or Technical and Sales Unit
    (T&8)? Will vehicles be a separate unit or will it belong to M&O or T&S? Second, the human
    resource is limited, both in terms of quality and quantity. It is partly because of financial
    shortage. The plant must cut off its staff.

    At this moment, because the work load of the landfill is relatively small, this organisational
    structure still goes welL However, in the future, with the expansion of the landfill and
    facilities such as L TP and incinerators, the structure and the staff's quality must be enhanced.
    This must be done before and during the operation of the landfill.

    Based on the information available, EIA consultant suggests improvement of each units and its

-
    human requirements and training needs. This suggestion must be consulted with URENCO. The
    minimum level of staffing will vary depending on the quantity of waste received and the
    standard of disposal operation achieved, but it is estimated about 60-70 people.

        7.3 TRAINING
        The training is carried for both two phases - construction phase and operation phase.

        7.3.1 Construction phase
        The training for environmental monitoring will be executed with different groups, based on
        the ditTerent requirements:
                Contractors: monitor the implementation of mitigation measures and write the
                monitoring reports.
                StatIworking on safety and sanitary hygiene ofCMC: understand EMP
                Plant managers: understand the environmental impacts of the construction activities
                and supervise the construction and installation process.

                       activities

        7.3.2 Operation phase
        It is necessary to ensure that the training and knowledge acquired by landfill operators and

-
      statT afford them the necessary skills. The operator has to organize the function of a landfill in
        such a way that:
                 Sufficient competent staff exists anytime; 

                 The required supervision and control of the activities with regard to waste 

                 management is guaranteed; 

                 Accidents are prevented and possible consequences are limited. 

        If staff are not trained or given clear, written job descriptions then it is not swprising that they show
        little interest or competence in operating an organised and well run waste disposal operation.
        Responsibility of each group is presented as following:
                 Landfill site managers:

        CONCLUSION, RECOMMENDATION AND
        COMMITMENT

        Conclusion

        Component 3 includes the construction of URENCO depot, new public toilets, closure of
        existing unsanitary landfill and construction of new landfill. This is one of the components
        that will contribute to the improvement of the city environmental sanitation and create urban
        landscape to meet the development needs although it can not avoid the negative impacts
        during the construction and operation.
        The construction works for URENCO depot are relatively small. Therefore, its negative
        impacts to the environment are mostly insignificant, especially when it is isolated with
        residential areas.
        Similarly, the work load for public toilets is not so high. However, as the toilets are
        constructed in the crowded areas or tourist attraction sites, the negative impacts on landscape
        must be considered properly.
        The most concern of the Component 3 is related to Long My landfill. The closure of existing
        landfill could raise the worries on groundwater pollution and risks of settlement. It is really
        hard to postpone the process of groundwater pollution because the old landfill did not have a
,­      bottom liner. Therefore, a regular monitoring program of groundwater quality must be
        established to predict the visible impacts to local residents. If local groundwater wells are
        proved to be polluted from the landfill and risky to its users, these wells must be closed and
-
      these households must have alternative water supply.
        The installation of the incinerator in the landfill will improve the management performance of
        hospital waste. If it is properly operated, the incinerator will not make significant impacts on
        the environment.
        Although the existence of upgraded Long My landfill will surely improve the city
        environment significantly, its construction, operation and closure will have important impacts
        on the environment, both in short term and in long term. In the construction phase, the huge

-
      amount of excavated materials will contribute to high concentration of dust and air pollutants
        in the air environment. In the operation phase, LFG and leachate control is the key issues.
        Again, the EMP must be followed strictly to avoid any harmful impacts to local people and

-
      the environment. Finally, although the closure of the landfill does not make any revenue for
        the city, it requires careful management.

     Recommendations

     It is recommended for the provincial authorities to help the project done quickly.

     It is recommended for the environmental management agencies to monitor the construction
     phase in order to ensure the specifications and monitoring of environmental parameters after
     the project goes into operation.

     It is recommended that clean water will be supplied for local people USIng polluted
     groundwater by the old landfilL

     It is recommended for related departments that they cooperate closely in the preparation and
     construction of the project to ensure the progress and quality of construction.

     It is recommended to determine the exploitation mines for construction materials with
     references to lower cost of transportation, lower environmental and social impacts in
     transportation.

               5.3.(1)            Emission factor

    Concentrations of air pollutants such as S02, NOx, CO, VOC and dust will increase
    proportionally to the quantity of excavated materials and transporting distance, as well as
    covering measures of trucks. Concentrations of dust and other pollutants in the air
    environment increase along then transporting roads, especially in the dry season. Main
    composition of the dust is sand with the size larger than 10 microns, These heavy particles are
    easily settled and affect directly to workers and local residents. However, it could not be
    dispersed far.

        5.4.(1)         Emission factor

Major pollutants in wastewater are suspended solids, organic compounds, nutrients and
pathogens. The water supply rate for a worker is 120Llday. Thus, the wastewater rate is about
80% of supplied water (96L1personlday).
According to statistical calculations for the developing countries of the World Health
Organization, the coefficients of pollution are presented here.

    landGEM IS based on a firs1.{)f(jer deromposIIion rate equation for quanlifYlIlg emlSSIOI'lS from the doc~ of landfiled waste in rwnidpal
    sohd waste (MSW} landfills. The software provides a relatlWly simpie approach to estimating landfill gas emlSslOI'lS. Model defaults are based on
    empirical data from US landfills. Field test data can also be used in place of model defaults when available. Further guidance on EPA test
    meIhods, Clean Air Act (CAA) regulations, and oIher gUIdance regl'I"ding landfill gas emissions aM control toctTtology requiIlIments can be
    found at hl1p/lwww.epa govlttnatw01llandfillJlandilpg.hlml.

    landGEM is considered a screening tool - the better the input data, the better the estimates. Often, there are limitalians with the available date
    regarding waste quantity and composition, vanalian in design and operating practices over time, I!Ild changes ocCUlTing over lime that impact
    the emissions potential. Changes to landfil openiItion, such as operating ooder wet conditions throiJ!j11eadl8le recirrulalian or other liquid
    additions, will result In generating more gas at a faster ratB. OefaUils for estimating emissions for this type of operation am being developed to
    Indude in LandGEM along WIth defaults for conventiallandfills (no IeachatB rx liquid additions) for dev~ emISSion inventones aM
    determining eM applicability Refer to the Web site Identified above for fut1..Ire updates.

           APPENDIX 5.(8)                TOTAL      RUN-OFF           IN    LONG         MY

        5.8.(1)           Rational method of rainfall intensity

Flow rate of the storm water is determined as following the rational method based on the
rainfall:
                  Q    C*I*A (lis)
o 	 Where:
    • 	 Q: design flow rate of storm water (l/s)
    • 	 A: catchment area (ha)
    • 	 C: runoff coefficient
    • 	 I: rainfall intensity according to the frequency of the expected storms and
        concentration time of rain water (l/s/ha).
The time of concentration is equal to the time for rainfall to flow through the calculated
catchments. This can also be stated as the condition equal to time until storm water reaches
the first collection interceptor plus the time for the storm water to travel through the storm

This EIA report uses the model developed by Park and Lee (1997) to predict the settlement
rate of Long My landfill
                                      St = Hox ED x {l- exp (- kt)}
where, Set) is the settlement (m) at time t, Ho is the initial height of waste (m), ED is the total
expected strain, k is the first order kinetic constant (llday) and t (day) is the time since the
start of decay.

            5.11.(2)      Coefficient

The ED and k value are taken from India which has quite similar climate conditions to Vietnam:

          APPENDIX 5.(12)              RISK ASSESSMENT OF LFG

        5.12.(1)        Theory

The risk due to landfill gas may be evaluated based upon the following three criteria:

       Source - the rate and concentration of gas generation by the landfill; 

       Pathway - the nature of and length of potential pathways through which landfill gas 

       can migrate and leachate flow, such as geological strata, utility services; and 

       Target - the level of vulnerability of various elements of the development to LFG. 


Each of these criteria is further described in the sub-sections below.

           (i) Source

The classification of the Source is determined as follows:

       Major: (l) filled landfill site at which there is little or no control to prevent migration
       of gas or at which the efficacy of the gas control measures has not been assessed; or
       (2) Any landfill site at which monitoring has demonstrated that there is significant
       migration of gas beyond the site boundary.
        Medium: (1) Landfill site at which some form of gas control has been installed (eg
       lined site or one where vents or barriers have been retrospectively installed) but where
       there are only limited monitoring data to demonstrate its efficacy to prevent migration
       of gas; or (2) Landfill site where comprehensive monitoring has demonstrated that
       there is no migration of gas beyond the landfill boundary but where the control of gas
       relies solely on an active gas extraction system or any other single control system
       which is vulnerable to failure.
       Minor: (1) Landfill sites at which gas controls have been installed and proven to be
       effective by comprehensive monitoring which has demonstrated that there is no
       migration of gas beyond the landfill boundary (or any specific control measures) and
       at which control of gas does not rely solely on an active gas extraction system or any
       other single control measure which is vulnerable to failure; or (2) Old landfill sites
       where the maximum concentration of methane within the waste, as measured at
       several locations across the landfill and on at least four occasions over a period of at
       least 6 months, is less than 5% (v/v).

           (ii) Pathway

Generally, three types of pathway are considered for the transmission of landfill gas:

       Man-made pathways, eg utility connections, stormwater channels, etc,
       Natural pathways such as rock jointing planes, fissures and other naturally occurring
       phenomena which may promote or give rise to the transmission of gas over distances;
       A combination of the previous two categories. An example of the latter may be, for
       instance, where a specific geological feature promotes gas transmission but which
       stops short of directly linking the landfill and target. A man made connection,
       however may also co-exist near the edge of the geological feature, which in

Infra- Thang Long Co.                                                           Appendix - 75
    Coastal Cities Environmental Sanitation Project - Quy Nhon city Sub-project 

    Environmental Impact Assessment: Component 3 Solid Waste Management 



           combination with the former, may act to link the two sites. In this instance, careful
           assessment of the likelihood of the mechanism acting to link the two pathways needs
           to be undertaken before assigning an appropriate pathway classification.

!                            • rock or less than 100m for man-made conduits

    In classifying the pathway, however, adjustment to the above general guidelines will often be
    required to take account of other factors which will affect the extent of gas migration
    including the following:

           a broad assessment of the specific permeability of the soil; 

           spacing, tightness and direction of the fissures/joints; 

           topography; 

           depth and thickness of the medium through which the gas may migrate (which may be 

           affected by groundwater level); 

           the nature of the strata over the potential pathway; 

           the number of different media involved; and 

           depth to groundwater table and groundwater flow patterns. 


                  (iii) Target

    Different levels of vulnerability or sensitivity of potential targets for landfill gas have been
    classified as follows:

    Classification o/tlre .~ensitivit)' o/potelltial targets
    High Sensitivity             Buildings and structures with ground level or below ground
                                     rooms/voids or into which services enter directly from the ground and
                                     to which members of the general public have-unrestricted access or
                                     which contain sources of ignition
                         i

                                 -   This would include any developments where there is a possibility of
                                     additional structures being erected directly on the ground on an ad
                                     hoc basis and thereby without due regard to the potential risks.
    Medium                       -   Other buildings, structures or service voids where there is access only
    Sensitivity                      by authorised, well trained personnel, such as the staff of utility
                                     companies, who have been briefed on the potential hazards relating to
                                     landfill gas and the specific safety procedures to be followed.

                                 -   Deep excavations.
    Low Sensitivity              -   Buildings/structures which are less prone to gas ingress by virtue of
                                     their design (such as those with a raised floor slab).

                                 -   Shallow excavations.

          The above examples of different categories within each criterion are to be used as a general
          guide only and specific aspects of a development may render it more or less sensitive than

          to one of the three indicated categories.

                    5.12.(2)          Assessment of Risk Criteria

          The potential implications associated with the various qualitative risk categories are
          summarised in the next table. It should be noted that the different levels of risk determine the
          likely extent of the protection measures required to ensure the safety of a development, but
          with the possible exception of the very high risk category. development is not precluded for
          any of the assessed levels of risk.

          5.12.(3)         Results in Long My landfill

Result of the assessment of potential risk of Long My landfill is presented in following sections.
      a. The Source
The source     Long My landfill
Long My Landfill is a "large" landfill, the facility must be acknowledged as a significant
potential source of landfill gas. The generation rate of landfill gas is calculated based on the
linear model LandGEM version 3.02 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
(2005). The key parameters are methane, CO2 and NMOCs (non-methane organic
compounds). It is assumed that the duration for complete decomposition is 80 years.
LFG control in Long My landfill
Long My landfill will be designed to incorporate measures to contain, collect, and treatiutilise
landfill gas. These measures include a composite liner systems, active landfill gas extraction and
landfill gas treatment system. These measures can control sub-surface off-site migration oflandfill
gas.
A comprehensive environmental monitoring programme will be implemented during the
construction, operation, restoration and aftercare of the landfill to monitor landfill gas
generated within the landfill and at the perimeter boreholes around the landfill. The landfill
contractor is required to control the migration of landfill gas such that the concentration of
methane and carbon dioxide at the perimeter boreholes shall not exceed 1% and 1.5% (v/v)S,
respectively. The operation contractor will be required to continue the control and monitoring
of landfill gas following closure of the landfill for a period of 20 years.
Taking into account the multiple landfill gas control measures to be installed and stringent
contract requirements for controlling off-site landfill gas migration, it would be reasonably
conservative to classify the landfill as a "medium" source.
      b. The Pathways
The potential pathways through which landfill gas may enter the landfill and the areas adjacent
to the landfill are threefold; namely:
      through transmission along natural pathways such as fissures or joints in rock;
      man-made pathways such as through permeable backfill in utilities trenches; or 

      a combination of both.

The likely potential for each mode of transmission are clearly dependent on the geological
and hydrogeological conditions, which are discussed below.
Geology and Hydrogeology
It is considered that this permeable layer between the Long My landfill and the adjacent
residential areas must be conservatively considered as conducive to landfill gas migration.
Utilities
It is known that no man-made underground utilities in the project area. Therefore, the potential
pathways for sub-surface migration of landfill gas from the landfill to the adjacent residential
areas are considered to comprise only natural features and reclamation fill. At present, no direct
anthropogenic migration pathways (man-made underground utilities) have been identified as
connecting the landfill to the adjacent existing and future development. Taking into account the
distance between the landfill and the adjacent residential area, and the presence of possible
migration pathways, the pathway should be classified as according to the distance between the
development and the landfill: 1DO-250m as long/indirect.
    c. The Targets
Landfill gas related impacts may occur in areas at or below ground, at the landfill and the
adjacent residential areas.
Target 1 - Operation ofthe landfill (Tipping Face)
Waste tipping will be in the open air which will not involve working at confined spaces and by
definition, the landfill is also a source of landfill gas, thus any migration of landfill gas to the
landfill will either be dispersed and diluted upon contact with the atmosphere or be captured in
the landfill gas collection system. However, it is also noted that drivers/operators of waste
collection vehicles will have access to the waste tipping face for disposal of waste and they may
not have knowledge on landfill gas hazards. In view of the above, this target is thus classified
as "medium sensitivity".
Target 2    Operation ofthe landfill
Underground confined spaces (such as manhole and utility pits) and ground level offices and
pump rooms with underground utility connections are places where landfill gas can potentially
accumulate and may have sources of ignition (e.g. electrical or other equipment). Restricted
access to the manhole, utility pits and pump rooms by authorised and well trained personnel is
expected. These rooms/voids are thus considered to have "medium" sensitivity.
Ground level offices and some ground level rooms are generally of unrestricted staff access or
public access accompanied by site staff These rooms/voids are thus considered to have "high"
sensitivity. Nevertheless, the landfill will be operated by an experienced landfill contractor who
is fully aware of the potential landfill gas hazards and with their staff well trained on the
potential hazards relating to landfill gas and the specific safety procedures. All ground floor
rooms of the buildings on-site will be equipped with a gas detection and alann system. This
target is classified as "medium to high sensitivity".
Target 3 - Acfjacent residential areas
The potential hazards posed by landfill gas migration and the need for protection measures for
developments close to landfill sites are outlined in Chapter 6.
    carry out a landfill gas hazard assessment to evaluate the degree of risk associated with the
    proposed development;

   design suitable precautionary/protection measures to render the proposed development as
   safe as reasonably practicable;
   ensure that the precautionary/protection measures will be implemented and constructed in
   accordance with the design; and
   establish a maintenance and monitoring programme for ensunng the continued
   performance of the implemented protection measures,
With consideration of these above requirements, this target is classified as "low sensitivity",
   d, Source-Pathway-Target Analysis
On the basis of the source, pathways and targets identified above, a source-pathway-target
analysis has been undertaken and is presented here according to the assessment
framework. Different combination of source, pathway and target result in a range of overall
potential hazards,

               APPENDIX 5.(13) GASEOUS                              EMISSION                 FROM
                 INCINERATORS


     Medical waste incinerators can emit significant quantities of pollutants to the atmosphere.
     These pollutants include: (1) particulate matter (PM), (2) metals, (3) acid gases, (4) oxides of
     nitrogen (NOx), (5) carbon monoxide (CO), (6) organics, and (7) various other materials
     present in medical wastes, such as pathogens, cytotoxins, and radioactive diagnostic materials.

     Particulate matter is emitted as a result of incomplete combustion of organics (i. e., soot) and
     by the entrainment of noncombustible ash due to the turbulent movement of combustion
     gases. Particulate matter may exit as a solid or an aerosol, and may contain heavy metals,
     acids, and/or trace organics.

     The type and amount of trace metals in the flue gas are directly related to the metals contained
     in the waste. Metal emissions are affected by the level of PM control and the flue gas
     temperature. Most metals (except mercury) exhibit fine-particle enrichment and are removed
     by maximizing small particle collection. Mercury, due to its high vapor pressure, does not
     show significant particle enrichment, and removal is not a function of small particle collection
     in gas streams at temperatures greater than 150°C (300°F).

     Acid gas concentrations of hydrogen chloride (HCI) and sulfur dioxide (S02) in MWI flue
     gases are directly related to the chlorine and sulfur content of the waste. Most of the chlorine,
     which is chemically bound within the waste in the form of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other
     chlorinated compounds, will be converted to HC!. Sulfur is also chemically bound within the
     materials making up medical waste and is oxidized during combustion to form S02.

     Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) represent a mixture of mainly nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen
     dioxide (NOz). They are formed during combustion by: (1) oxidation of nitrogen chemically
     bound in the waste, and (2) reaction between molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the
     combustion air. The formation of NOx is dependent on the quantity of fuel-bound nitrogen
     compounds, flame temperature, and air/fuel ratio.

     Carbon monoxide is a product of incomplete combustion. Its presence can be related to
     insufficient oxygen, combustion (residence) time, temperature, and turbulence (fueVair
     mixing) in the combustion zone.

     Failure to achieve complete combustion of organic materials evolved from the waste can


-
   result in emissions of a variety of organic compounds. The products of incomplete
     combustion (PICs) range from low molecular weight hydrocarbon (e. g., methane or ethane)
     to high molecular weight compounds (e. g., polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and

-
   dibenzofurans [CDD/CDF]). In general, combustion conditions required for control of CO (i.

emissions of most organics.

Emissions of CDDs/CDFs from MWls may occur as either a vapor or as a fine particulate.
