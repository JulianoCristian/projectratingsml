                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well towards achieving its Development Objectives. All of Phase 1 and part of Phase 2 investments were put into operation, which brought the Project
                         benefits to about 700,000 citizens in the three cities. City environment, flooding have been improved through lakes/canals/drains rehabilitated (about 40,000 people benefiting from
                         reduced incidence and severity of flooding), and solid waste management (about 697,944 people having solid waste collected). Resettlement sites completed to accommodate the
                         Project Affected Households (PAHs), public and schools sanitation satisfactorily operated which improved the sanitation facilities at public areas (beach, markets) and for 26,800
                         pupils at schools. All accumulative project indicators up to November 2013 either exceeded or met the targets, these indicators will be continued to monitor by the next mission. Given
                         the effective measures and specific actions taken by the central/local government and the Bank, very encouraging results have been achieved, particularly in Dong Hoi and Quy
                         Nhon. It is expected that these two (2) sub-projects will be completed by the closing date of November 30, 2014. Challenges are remaining in Nha Trang, which requires continuous
                         implementation support from WB task team and provincial leadership.
