Credit\n            (PRSC) Project pursues the Government's reform efforts,\n            and seeks to enhance the Government's ability to manage\n            Azerbaijan's natural resources efficiently, and\n            stimulate balanced economic growth, and job creation,\n            fundamental to poverty reduction. To this end, the proposed\n            PRSC will support selected areas of the Government's\n            reform agenda, as outlined in the PRSP, and closely aligned\n            with the Country assistance strategy (CAS) objectives, as\n            follows: 1) In order to manage the oil boom, adequate\n            policies will be pursued, namely, to avoid the Dutch\n            disease, and to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the\n            public resource use. 2) To prod a sustainable non-oil\n            growth, and job generation, the project will improve the\n            environment for increased non-oil trade, private sector\n            development and investment, and, improve financial\n            intermediation, while enhancing corporate governance, and\n            financial discipline in the financial and corporate sectors.\n            3) To improve social services and infrastructure the project\n            will support improvements in utility services, by developing\n            tariff policies, a modern regulatory framework, and, enforce\n            payment discipline. Moreover, it will improve\n            telecommunications, and transport services through\n            restructuring activities, improving as well competitiveness\n            aspects. The quality of basic and secondary education will\n            be improved, as will access to, and quality of primary\n            healthcare services, to include improved financing and\n            allocation of resources in the health sector. Finally,\n            effective pension and social protection programs, will be\n            established. Notwithstanding, several risks exist,\n            political, economic, and social, but most importantly, the\n            volatility of energy prices, or unexpected delays in the\n            operation of the Baku-Tbilisi-Cheyhan (BTC) pipeline and\n            Shah Deniz gas projects, could seriously affect resource\n            flows and public finances, and, delay implementation of\n            poverty reducing measures. However, the PRSC support to\n            prudent fiscal policy, and the formulation of a long-term\n            oil revenue management strategy, and medium-term budget\n            planning, will mitigate these risks."}, "docdt": "2005-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
