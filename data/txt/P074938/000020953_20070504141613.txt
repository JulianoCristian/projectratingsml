This Implementation Completion and Results report is being undertaken as part of the
Bank's internal requirement for evaluation of competed programmatic development
policy loans. Usually, these reports are undertaken after the full series of loans is
completed, and the accompanying reform programs have been implemented. In the case
Azerbaijan's PRSC, the ICR is being prepared about halfway through the reform
program which is currently under implementation, because Azerbaijan has decided that it
will not be necessary to borrow for additional PRSCs, given the absence of financing
needs. Still, Azerbaijan's reform program is being implemented with the support of the
Country Partnership Strategy for FY07-FY10. Accordingly, this ICR reviews the PRSC
operation through 2005, and assesses the progress being made towards the achievement
of the medium term program objectives. The ICR proposes that additional reviews of the
PRSC's contributions to the medium term reform program is conducted alongside the
interim and final completion reviews of the Country Partnership Strategy.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., Program Document/ISR,
not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale
for Bank assistance)

1.      The PRSC was part of the World Bank's continuous structural reform dialogue
with Azerbaijan which dates to the early years of adjustment in the latter half of the
1990s. The period prior to appraisal, which was initiated in May 2004, was marked by
macroeconomic stability and progress in structural reforms. During 2000-2004, the
economy grew at an average annual rate of about 12 percent, in contrast to the dramatic
output drop the country experienced in the early part of the 1990s (accumulated to 60
percent), after independence. Between 2000 and 2004, output in agriculture and industry
doubled, while output in key service sectors (e.g., transport, communications, and the
social sectors) more than tripled. Foreign direct investment (FDI), which primarily
supported the oil sector but had a trickle-down effect on the rest of the economy, was a
large contributor to the economic expansion. FDI flows peaked at 32 percent of GDP in
2003; they supported the oil sector with deep water wells and construction of the Baku-
Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.        Overall, during the 2000-2004 period, Azerbaijan
succeeded in maintaining macroeconomic stability despite the high FDI inflows by
relying on generally sound fiscal and monetary polices, and in achieving low fiscal
deficits (2.8 percent of GDP per annum), low inflation (2.6 percent per annum), and high
non-oil growth (13.0 percent per annum).

2.      Azerbaijan's structural reform program was supported by the second Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC-II) in the period 2000-2003, a two-tranche operation. The first
tranche was disbursed in March 2002 (upon effectiveness), and the second tranche was
disbursed successfully in May 2003. While the preparation of the operation was lengthy,
the operation closed successfully in December 2003. The SAC-II aimed to enhance the
Government's ability to manage the country's forthcoming natural resource boom
efficiently, and to stimulate balanced economic growth, job creation and poverty
reduction. In particular, the SAC-II (i) improved transparency in public finances, and the


                                              1

strategic priority setting of public expenditure to accelerate poverty reduction and
economic growth; (ii) enhanced conditions for private enterprise and foreign investment,
especially in the non-oil part of the economy; and (iii) supported reforms in the utility
sector to improve access to reliable electricity, heating, and clean water for the population.
At the strategic level, the SAC-II achieved three important outcomes for Azerbaijan's
future: (i) it led to the establishment of the governance framework of the Oil Fund and
helped secure more than US$13 billion in FDI for the oil and gas sector; (ii) it led to the
amendment of the Budget Systems Law beyond the credit's conditionality, integrating
Oil Fund spending into the Consolidated Budget; and (iii) it set in motion the preparation
of the country's poverty reduction strategy.

3.      In 2003, the Government, in collaboration with civil society, prepared a poverty
reduction strategy entitled the State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic
Development (SPPRED, Report No. 25593-AZ). The SPPRED aimed at maintaining
economic stability, improving infrastructure, increasing access to basic social services,
and increasing the income-generating opportunities for the poor. The first SPPRED
progress report and its joint Bank/Fund assessment was presented to the Board in
September 2004, and the second one in August 2005. In 2003, Azerbaijan also saw a
defining political development which, among other things, had an impact on the
preparation of the next adjustment operation (PRSC). The prolonged illness and death of
President Heydar Aliyev late in the year; both had a temporary dampening impact on the
pace of reform in the country. By November 2003, Ilham Aliyev had been elected
President and Presidential Decrees had been issued in November 2003 and in April 2004,
aiming to assure continuity in the reform program.          Nevertheless, the transition in
leadership had an understandable effect on the pace of reforms. While the appraisal of
the PRSC was initiated in May 2004, it was completed in February 2005.

4.      Rationale for Bank Assistance. At the request of the Government, the IDA
prepared an SDR 13.1 million (US$20 million equivalent) Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC) as the first operation in a three-year reform program to assist Azerbaijan
in implementing the SPPRED (the country's PRSP).               The Operations Committee
reviewed the PRSC and raised the issue of the appropriateness of adjustment lending to
resource rich countries, including Azerbaijan. The Committee concluded that in the case
of Azerbaijan adjustment operations in general (or combined with TA operations) were
important instruments for supporting reforms and encouraging growth in the non-oil
sector. While the lending amounts were relatively small, the operations themselves were
thought to contribute to creating a forum for continuous policy dialogue on key issues
and had proved effective in Azerbaijan (as in the case of the SAC-II) in advancing the
reform agenda. Beyond the financial support, the role of the Bank was considered critical
in reducing the non-income dimensions of poverty by improving the quality of education
and health services, as well as supporting access to basic infrastructure, clean water and
sanitation.

5.      The PRSC, discussed by the Board in May 2005, was the first of two single
tranche adjustment operations planned for the FY03-05 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS, Report No. 2579-AZ, dated April 29, 2003). The first PRSC comprised the base
case scenario and was planned for FY05. The second PRSC ­which did not materialize
owing to lack of financing need­ defined the high case scenario of the FY03-05 CAS.


                                              2

The PRSC operations were designed to successively support core structural reforms
included in SPPRED. They followed on the reforms supported by the SAC-II and were
accompanied by the second Institution Building Technical Assistance project (IBTA-II).
The PRSC supported reforms, being a continuation of the reforms initiated by the SAC-II,
were seen as an umbrella for supporting other Bank operations in Azerbaijan.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.     The objective of the three-year PRSC program was to support the Government's
SPPRED.      The program aimed to enhance the Government's ability to manage the
country's natural resource boom efficiently, and to stimulate balanced economic growth
and job creation, which were fundamental to poverty reduction.

7.     The key indicators for the PDO are broad and are included in strategic goals 1 and
2 of the policy matrix. They include the growth of the non-oil economy, non-oil trade,
indebtedness, inflation, institutional milestones in the efficiency and effectiveness of
public resource use, and measures of development for the institutional development of
the private sector. (Individual statistics are included in the Results Framework Matrix of
the ICR.)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

8.     The PRSC objectives and components remained unchanged throughout the
operation's implementation. However, the Government has decided that it would not
need to borrow for additional budgetary support after 2006 given dramatic increases in
oil prices in the current year, and the projected high prices in the medium term. The
PRSC lending program was therefore suspended. However, the PRSC policy reform
program continues to be supported by the new Country Partnership Strategy (presented to
the Board, December 7, 2006), under a variety of analytical, technical assistance, and
investment lending tasks (see Section 7.4, below). Given that the present ICR is being
drafted as the ongoing medium term policy reform program continues to develop, it
focuses on the actions taken prior to the Board presentation of the first operation and the
subsequent progress in the reform agenda. The report assesses the likelihood that the
medium term program objectives could be reached within a reasonable time frame.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

9.     The components of the PRSC program covered the following policy areas
consistent with the overall development objectives described above:

     1.  Managing the oil boom, with the objective of maintaining macroeconomic stability,
         avoiding "Dutch Disease" and facilitating non-oil growth, employment and pro-poor
         expenditures.

     2.  Generating jobs and sustainable non-oil growth, with the objectives of improving the
         business environment and the access to financial services, building SME support
         infrastructure, and stimulating agriculture.




                                                3

      3.  Improving access to services and infrastructure, with the objective of reversing the
          decline in social services, social assistance, and infrastructure.

      4.  Realizing the oil and gas potential, with the objective of addressing issues of
          transparency in the use of oil resources. This component complemented actions under
          component 1.

      5.  Implementing the SPPRED, with the objectives of supporting institutional capacity
          building to monitor SPPRED outcomes, and ensuring that the sustainability of the
          reforms remains in the forefront.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

10.     The policy areas under the PRSC were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

11.     No significant changes were made to the operation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

12.     The PRSC was the first operation in a three series program.                 The planned
disbursement date was May 31, 2005, but actual disbursement took place on January 13,
2006 given the lack of financing needs until late 2005, as a result of the unexpectedly
high oil prices during that year. Declaration of effectiveness, which requires immediate
disbursal, was timed to need financing needs.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

13.     The first PRSC was not restructured, nor was it ever at risk. There were also no
major changes in its design. However, the second and third PRSCs were cancelled. The
MoF and MED provided an effective oversight and coordinated activities of the other
implementing agencies. Other major factors that contributed to the successful
implementation of the PRSC included the following:

  · Ownership and commitment of the Government to the reform agenda. The
      Government had committed itself to a comprehensive program through a balanced
      approach to economic reform as outlined in the SPPRED. The SPPRED presented
      a credible poverty reduction strategy consistent with the multi-dimensional nature
      of poverty reduction in Azerbaijan and the need for developing the non-oil sector.
      The Government initiated the preparation and implementation of this reform agenda
      with the strong backing of the President and Parliament (see Section 8.1 for details).

  · Soundness of the background analysis was a major contributing factor in the
      identification and implementation of policy measures under the PRSC program.
      Key inputs for the preparation of this operation were provided through a variety of
      economic and sector analytical work. The Bank completed the Integrated Non-Oil
      Trade and Investment Strategy (INOTIS) in November 2003, the Public
      Expenditure Review in December 2002, the Poverty Assessment in June 2003, the
      Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in July 2003, and the Country
      Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in September 2003. The PRSC also
      benefited from a PSIA on the impact of increases in electricity tariffs on the poor,
      completed in December 2004, and a comprehensive Energy Sector Report for
      Azerbaijan, completed in February 2005. Significant analytical work also
      continued through the implementation of the program and helped shape the course
      of the reform program. At the level of project lending, operations such as the
      Second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC-II, completed in June 2003), and the
      Second Institution Building and Technical Assistance (IBTA-II) also contributed to
      the design and implementation of the PRSC, as did several sectoral investment
      projects (see Section 7.3).



                                                 5

  · Intensity of the policy dialogue and focus of the policy measures. A high level
     policy dialogue has been maintained during the preparation and implementation of
     the operation. The purpose of the dialogue was to maintain encouragement,
     cohesion and focus in the sectoral discussions of the entire policy matrix. The
     policy measures under each component also benefited from extensive consultation
     with the other donors and feedback from civil society organizations.

  · Relevance of risks identified. The President's Report adequately recognized the
     risks relevant to the operation. These risks comprised: (i) the risk that non-
     reformers could delay key program elements; (ii) the financial management risk
     (the risk of spending pressures from high oil revenues); (iii) an implementation risk
     (lack of coordination of sectoral ministries of the Government's agenda); (iv) a
     resource flow risk (risk of delays in oil production); and (v) a political and security
     risk (stemming from the need to share resources quickly). Unforeseen were the
     high oil prices of 2005 and 2006, as well as the delays in program implementation
     that were associated with the gradual process of consolidation of power by the
     country's new President.

  · Cancellation of PRSCs II and III, and operation under CPS. With the
     cancellation of the second and third PRSCs, the Policy matrix was adjusted slightly
     to fit the format of a Results matrix for the CPS. As discusses in section 2.4 below,
     the team adjusted its mode of operation, from focusing on conditionality, to
     focusing on advising the Government through investment operations and through
     AAA tasks.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

14.    Monitoring and evaluation design arrangements were sound and helped to
moderately strengthen the existing system and the capacity for implementation. The
PRSC Policy Matrix and the Letter of Development Policy were the main reference
documents for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the operation and the
country's structural reform program. The Policy Matrix defined the three-year outcomes
of the operation and identified indicators for monitoring progress toward the development
objectives.

15.    The monitoring and evaluation of the PRSC Policy Matrix components was
carried out in several ways:

  · The IMF monitored the implementation of macroeconomic policy measures on a
     regular basis and through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The
     Bank also used other relevant macro data to monitor and evaluate macroeconomic
     developments, resource allocation and use.

  · The monitoring and evaluation of the operations of the Oil Fund was done through
     its annual audited accounts.

  · Monitoring the implementation of the Budget Systems Law and the efforts to
     improve the public expenditures management process was undertaken through
     advisory work with both the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Ministry of


                                              6

     Economic Development (MED) on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
     (MTEF) and the Public Investment Program (PIP). A related area was Treasury
     modernization, which was monitored through the IBTA-II

  · Monitoring and evaluating fiduciary responsibilities and progress in building the
     relevant capacities were carried out through the IBTA-II and other technical
     assistance (TA) (e.g., E-procurement).

  · Sectoral reforms were monitored through regular Bank operations in Azerbaijan
     that had policy links to the PRSC program (e.g., Education Reform APL; Health
     Reform LIL; Pension and Social Assistance Project; and Financial Sector
     Assistance Program). Separate studies, and an expenditure tracking survey were
     also carried out to evaluate the trend and efficiency of health and education
     expenditures.

  · Monitoring of the progress to be achieved toward the overall goals of poverty
     reduction and the MDG targets was carried out through the Household Budget
     Survey at the national level. A new Household Survey was carried out in 2004,
     during project preparation, establishing a new poverty benchmark which provided
     more reliable poverty figures and helped to identify a more realistic set of poverty
     indicators. Further evaluation of annual poverty trends was also carried out through
     a programmatic poverty assessment in 2006.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

16.    Despite the lack of financing need, the Government of Azerbaijan has indicated
its desire for and commitment to implementing the medium term reform program
supported by the PRSC (Letter of Development Policy [LDP] of April 1, 2005) in the
new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (ref. Letter from the Prime Minister to the
Country Director, dated February 13, 2006). The CPS supports continued implementation
of the PRSC policy agenda through a host of complementary investment and capacity
building TA projects (see Table 7 of the CPS), as well as programmatic TA and AAA
tasks (see Table 6 of the CPS). The CPS will monitor the implementation of the reform
agenda with a list of key progress indicators linked to the CPIA (see Table 8 of the CPS)
and a results matrix (see Annex 1 of the CPS) which specifies in good detail the intended
outcomes and implementation milestones for the CPS, in much the same way as the
PRSC Policy Matrix.       However, the conduct of policy dialogue under the CPS is
qualitatively different that the policy dialogue under the PRSC. While under the PRSC
policy dialogue was driven by conditionality, under the CPS, self-standing policy
dialogue is undertaken with a two pronged approach: policy changes are embedded in the
investment/TA projects, and in non-lending activities such as workshops, AAA. Both
require the Bank to "prove every day" that it can provide top quality and timely know-
how, and neither for the two approaches provide the "closure" that a fulfilled condition
could bring policy-based lending. However reform ownership is expected to be even
stronger under the CPS.

17.    The CPS will follow up on four broad policy areas, as is discussed below. The
policy support under each area mirrors the policy measures envisaged under the planned
second and third PRSC operations (albeit with some adjustments in the timing, making



                                             7

up for the originally ambitious nature of the operation). The policy areas have been
agreed following extensive consultations with the Government.

  1.    Improving the Quality and Transparency of Public Sector Governance.
        Continued macroeconomic stability will remain the top priority in this area. Since
        the IMF-supported PRGF came to its conclusion in 2005, the Bank has become
        more actively involved in monitoring and supporting the macroeconomic
        management policies of the Government in the medium term. Indicators on
        macroeconomic developments are monitored quarterly.

  2.    Supporting the Sustainable Growth of the Non-oil Economy. There is now
        expanded access to financial services, and further reduction in the barriers to
        doing business in Azerbaijan. The next phase of the operation following PRSC1
        would support: the development of rural infrastructure and services, an improved
        transit corridor and transit policy, improved coverage of the water supply system,
        improved reliability of the electricity and gas supply, and improved financial
        viability of the utility services.

  3.    Improving the Quality of and Access to Social Services. In this area the follow-
        up operations would aim at: improving the quality and coverage of healthcare
        services, modernizing the education system, expanding the efficiency and
        coverage of the social protection system, and improving living conditions and
        economic opportunities for internally displaced people.

  4.    Improving Environmental Management. The follow-up operations would
        support the clean-up of oil spills, as well as the better management of natural
        resources within the context of rural development and the conservation of
        ecosystems.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

        Relevance of Objectives

18.     The PRSC program was prepared at a time when the country had established its
credibility for sound macroeconomic management, was anticipating the advent of high oil
revenues and had prepared the first line of institutional defenses for foreign currency
inflows (the Oil Fund and the Budget Systems Law) under the SAC-II. The next policy
objectives, which the PRSC program identified and addressed were: (i) managing the oil
boom; (ii) Generating jobs and sustainable non-oil growth; (iii) improving access to
services and infrastructure; (iv) improving Realizing the oil and gas potential , and (v)
implementing the SPPRED.




                                                8

        Relevance of Design and Implementation

19.     The PRSC design was sound for the following reasons:

    ·     It supported the poverty reduction strategy: The PRSC included a broad range
          of policy measures dealing with key structural problems which were of high
          priority and critical to the success of the SPPRED (e.g., improving social and
          infrastructure services).
    ·     It was closely related to the CAS: The PRSC operation (and the dialogue
          surrounding it) was the pivotal forum around which the policy context for the
          CAS's investment operations was determined.
    ·     Its scope was comprehensive: It covered most of the important reform areas of
          the SPPRED, thus providing maximum support to reform initiatives.
    ·     It provided additional sound features: Other positive aspects of the design
          included strong ownership, prior analytical work, a rich policy dialogue, and the
          identification of risks and their mitigation (see Section 7.2).

20.     The PRSC design was optimistic on the timing of the reforms, for the first
operation and for subsequent operations. While the first operation took almost a year
longer to appraise than originally expected (completed April 2005 compared to a planned
date of July 2004), in good part because political consensus had to be built in a new
political environment following the illness and passing of Heydar Aliyev, the second year
reforms were exceptionally heavy and their timing was unrealistic given the actual reform
achievements in April 2005. Some examples of reforms that took longer than anticipated
in the Policy Matrix are as follows: (i) the MTEF process was not implemented to its full
potential, mainly because of weak institutional capacities at the central government level;
(ii) the separation of commercial and regulatory functions of state-owned entities in the
transportation sub-sector has been delayed; and (iii) auditing capabilities in the Chamber
of Accounts are still generally weak.

21.     The scope of the operation was broad. The operation aimed to be at the same
time both strategic and opportune: on the one hand, substantial structural reforms
remained to be achieved at the time of preparation, and still do, and, on the other hand,
the advent of new oil was expected to allow only a very small window of opportunity.
The three-year PRSC program did have a large number of conditions (a combined 134
conditions, triggers, and benchmarks for the three PRSCs, including 38 conditions for the
first PRSC, of which 13 were core). In retrospect, experience with the implementation of
the new CPS (that is based on the PRSC) suggests that the Government remains
committed to the broad reform program (as discussed below), and thus it may not have
been necessary to secure it in the broad PRSC matrix. It may have been more appropriate
from the beginning (see discussion in Section 8.2) to have spaced out the reforms over a
five-year period, instead of a three-year period, and to be more specific regarding some
critical reforms, such as macro and budgeting, and the business environment (especially
entry and exit).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)



                                                 9

22.     The Government reform program supported by the PRSC, and its components, are
discussed in detail in the Program Document (No.31978-AZ). Drawing on that document,
the major accomplishments under each of the first year PRSC components, and the extent
to which they contributed to the expected output/outcomes, are discussed below.

        Strategic Goal 1. Managing the Oil Boom

23.     The Government's medium term program aims to: (i) avoid Dutch Disease and
(ii) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public resources. The implementation of
these policy objectives (goals) is expected to allow the Government to achieve the
following outcomes (results) by the end of the three-year PRSC program period: (i)
maintain macro stability with low levels of inflation; (ii) continue to manage the oil
revenues in a transparent and efficient manner; (iii) formulate the budget based on a
medium term public expenditure framework and a PIP, through a more participatory
process and through the adoption of program budgeting; (iv) increase transparency and
accountability in the management of public resources by achieving greater transparency
in financial reporting, accounting, and auditing; and (v) show improvement in the impact
of expenditures on the welfare of the population, especially in health care and education.

Progress under the First PRSC toward Expected Program Output/Outcomes.

24.     Azerbaijan was successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability in 2004 and
2005, a key element of the economic environment conducive to growth and poverty
reduction. To a large extent, that has been due to the policy dialogue during the
preparation of the PRSC. The country's institutional architecture for managing profits
from oil through the Oil Fund, with the assistance of the Budget Systems Law established
under SAC-II, was largely successful. The country has also successfully handled large-
scale FDI which flowed into the oil sector (oil FDI at the unprecedented level of US$4.0-
4.6 billion in 2003-06 were equivalent to between around 20 and 50 percent of GDP). At
the same time, with the increase in oil-related revenues in 2004 (including taxes from oil
accruing directly to the budget, not the Oil Fund), public spending on the part of state-
owned enterprises and the Government rose. Given the effectively pegged exchange rate,
money supply growth accelerated causing double digit inflation in 2004. However,
concerted actions of the National Bank of Azerbaijan and Government in early 2005,
including introducing more flexibility to the exchange rate, brought down the inflation
rate back into a single digit (5.4 percent) by end-2005. The economic growth in 2004 and
2005 was strong: overall GDP and non-oil GDP growth rates averaged 18.3 percent and
11.0 percent, respectively, for the two-year period. The non-oil growth was broad-based
(as discussed in the next section). The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated
in 2003 and 2004, and appreciated in 2005. Overall in 2005, it had not appreciated
relative to 2002, and had appreciated 14 percent relative to 2003 (according to NBA
estimates). The Manat has appreciated less than other currencies in the region since 2000.
Azerbaijan's non-oil trade grew at 24 percent a year in both 2004 and 2005, and is
expected to have grown at 40 percent in 2006; non oil merchandise exports grew at 50
percent in 2005, and had grown at about 30 percent a year in the third quarter of 2006
(year in year). External debt has remained very low. Azerbaijan's performance under the
IMF program (PRGF) ended satisfactorily in May 2005. The country successfully ended

the 2004-2005 period with a 20.6 percentage point reduction in the poverty rate, which is
representative of the gains made in urban and in rural regions (see Table 3).

25.     In the medium term, the prospects for macroeconomic stability and poverty
reduction are good, although the Government needs to recognize increasing risks. In
2006, the Government effectively initiated an aggressive medium term effort to repair
and rebuild dilapidated infrastructure that is proving a hindrance to non-oil growth and to
poverty reduction, financed by rising oil profits to the Oil Fund, and oil-related taxes to
budget. Consolidated government expenditures increased by 81 percent in nominal terms
in 2006 compared to 2005; increases in 2007 and beyond are expected to be significant,
although less pronounced. The priority in the 2006 budget, as it was in the budgets of the
previous two years, has been investments in the energy sector and in human development
(absorbing about 50 percent and 25 percent of investments respectively). The priorities
are reasonable, given the comparatively low levels of services. However, the rapid pace
of the increase in public spending has been responsible for the inflationary pressures
building up by late 2006 and in early 2007. The concern is that these pressures may
cause much higher rates of inflation in the medium term, because of lags in the effects of
monetary policy and because inflationary expectations will be built into the economic
agents' decisions. To date, partially owing to de-dollarization (due to the issuance of the
New Manat and the greater confidence in the currency), high rates of inflation have been
avoided. The ability of Azerbaijan to control inflation in the short term will depend on
the pace of the oil-financed public spending and the rate of nominal exchange rate
appreciation which the Government will choose to maintain. The expenditure incidents in
2004 and in 2006 raise questions as to the effectiveness of existing budgetary institutions



                                                 11

to monitor economic developments and to pace public spending increases in a manner
consistent with the absorptive capacity of the economy. The country's ability to
ameliorate Dutch Disease also depends on the quality and type of public expenditures and
the pace of the entire structural reform program: should public expenditures (and
structural reform policies) succeed in raising productivity, to overcome the inevitable
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate that comes from increases in aggregated
demand which manifest themselves in resource rich economies, then Dutch Disease will
be avoided or its impact mitigated.


26.    The results of Azerbaijan's growth on poverty reduction have been impressive.
Poverty dropped at unprecedented rates (see Table 2) from 2002 (the earliest comparable
measures) to 2005. Results from the programmatic poverty assessment suggest that
poverty dropped by 16 percentage points between 2003 and 2005.

27.    Oil revenue management has been transparent and efficient. Azerbaijan has
been managing its oil wealth largely in line with the Long Term Oil Revenue
Management Strategy (LTORMS), which states that the oil wealth will be managed to
assure constant real spending from oil resources, although, during the early years,
spending may be higher in order to establish the foundations for future growth (the
LTORMS does not contain discrete expenditure targets). The Government's higher
spending levels in the 2005 and 2006 budgets reflect the higher spending indicated in the
LTORMS, although, again, the magnitude of the 2006 spending increases may not have
been anticipated under the LTORMS. Azerbaijan's Oil Fund has been managed in a
highly transparent manner and has received international recognition. The Oil Fund
published quarterly reports on the internet (www.oilfund.az), and its annual financial
statements have been audited by a reputable international auditor for 2003 (as part of the
PRSC conditionality), and also of 2004 and 2005. Azerbaijan is also a leading proponent
of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), being the only country that
has already published four EITI reports. The report "Eye on EITI" published by the
NGOs Publish What You Pay and the Revenue Watch Institute showed that, out of the 21
countries endorsing EITI, Azerbaijan is one of only two countries that have taken the
most essential EITI steps and have published fully audited and reconciled EITI reports.
In Oslo, in October 2006, Azerbaijan became a board member of the multi-stakeholder
board established to manage EITI at the international level and to oversee the future
operation of EITI. The country's membership on the IAB Board of EITI bodes well for
the future sustainability of sound Oil Fund management in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan could




                                            12

next move to establish similar quality in the transparency into the resource flows of
SOCAR.

28.    Improvements in budget management have been too slow, compared to the
accelerated pace of public spending. On the budget management side, the Government
made steady progress in 2004 and 2005: in 2004 it included the Oil Fund expenditures as
part of the consolidated budget for 2004; in 2005, it submitted an indicative MTEF for
the 2005 budget and prepared the PIP for 2005-2007 as part of the PRSC conditionality,
and also approved the Long Term Strategy for the Management of Oil and Gas Revenues.
The Government also adopted a new budget classification system within the framework
of GFS Manual and trained the Ministry of Finance staff in the budget formulation and
execution. Government also adopted new regulations for the implementation of the
Budget Systems Law in 2005.          In subsequent years (2006 and 2007 budgets) the
consolidated budget has been maintained, as has preparation a nominal MTEF, and a PIP,
although the PIP lagged in timeliness. In 2006, Ministry of Economic Development took
significant steps in restructuring the Ministry and adding a position of Deputy Minister
for Macroeconomic Policy, and in strengthening the Ministry's Center for Economic
Research. The new structure is aimed at strengthening capacity in macroeconomic
management. Notwithstanding these important institutional changes, further steps are
needed to improve the preparation of the MTEF, including preparation of the macro
framework at the Government level (involving the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Economic Development, the Oil Fund, and the National Bank on an advisory basis) --
these have lagged thus far. In 2005, the Government prepared an early draft of the
Budget Process Manual, and a draft Public Investment Manual was prepared in 2006; but
the manuals need to be finalized during 2007, in preparation for the 2008 budget cycle
and to include more advanced steps in program budgeting.

29.    The Government has made moderate progress in financial management. Since
the financial accountability framework required substantial strengthening to ensure
transparency and improved governance, the Government embarked on a program to
strengthen the auditing capacities in the Chamber of Accounts. It also adopted a legal
framework for the introduction of public sector accounting based on international public
sector accounting standards (IPSAS). Despite the recent advances, however, progress has
been slower than anticipated in increasing the scope of activities of the Chamber.
Procurement practices also need to be strengthened, despite the progess made with e-
procurement to date. In the area of budget management, line ministries do not as yet
participate fully in the MTEF process. Problems also remain with respect to reporting and
expenditure control, which requires developing a strong internal audit function with the
enforcement of implementation. Experience in other countries has shown that these
reforms usually take time to implement. In Azerbaijan, there is a greater urgency than in
most countries, as natural resource flows are expected to increase in the immediate future.
Nevertheless, reforming institutions and training human resources cannot be easily
leapfrogged. The impact of public spending on the welfare of the population is generally
considered to be positive, although, at this stage, it is mostly due to the pro-cyclical
nature of public spending, which is responsible for some of the jobs created, and to the
targeted social assistance scheme, rather than to expenditures on health and education,
where reform dialogue is picking up in early 2007. It must be noted, however, that



                                            13

within the education sector, the Government's free text book policy is considered
successful in that textbooks have reached schools in all parts of the country.

           Strategic Goal 2. Generating Jobs and Sustainable Non-oil Growth

30.     To foster non-oil sector growth and job opportunities, the Government with the
support of the PRSC focused on: (i) improving the environment for increased non-oil
trade, private sector development and investment; and (ii) improving financial
intermediation and enhanced governance in the financial and corporate sectors. It was
anticipated that with the implementation of these polices the Government could achieve
the following outcomes by the end of the three-year PRSC program period: (i) rapid and
broad-based economic growth with employment generation; (ii) more developed non-oil
exports based on WTO compliant legislation; (iii) increased competition in the banking
sector and increased access to credit and financial services; (iv) improvement in the
quality of audited financial statements from the corporate and financial sectors; and (v)
lessening reliance on collateral-based lending.

        Progress under the First PRSC on Expected Program Output/Outcomes.

31.     Azerbaijan's non-oil sector has been showing robust growth while employment
has been increasing, despite the upward adjustment of wages from the low historical
base. Real non-oil sector growth averaged 12.5 percent a year during 2002-2006; in 2005
and 2006, the rate of growth of the non-oil sector excluding oil-related transportation
(which has become important only since 2006), was approximately 8 percent for each
year. Non-oil merchandise exports relative to non-oil GDP increased from 6.0 percent in
2002 to 10.2 percent in 2006, while non-oil merchandise imports increased from 34.6
percent of non-oil GDP to 38.2 percent in the same time period. According to official
statistics, between October 2003 and April 2006, 381,000 new jobs were created in the
formal sector, and net employment is estimated to have increased by more than 100,000
during the period. The main non-oil growth areas for 2003-2006 are presented in Table
3: the service sectors and construction show the largest growth rates, while agricultural
growth shows the lowest in 2006. Agriculture employed 40 percent of the population in
2003; while employment in the sector has been growing, its share of total employment
fell to 39 percent in 2005. At the same time, the economy-wide minimum wage rose by
almost 40 percent between 2003 and 2006, while the average nominal wage grew by
about 80 percent from 2003; by end 2006, the minimum wage stood at about
US$40/month while the average wage stood at about US$162/month.               Azerbaijan's
wages are higher than some of its neighbors, but lower than Ukraine, Kazakhstan and
Russia. Azerbaijan's real effective exchange rate (REER) has also appreciated less since
2003 than in Kazakhstan Georgia, Ukraine and Russia.             In all, the prospects for
Azerbaijan's non-oil sector remain strong, although caution needs to be exercised in two
areas: (i) a very close eye needs to be kept on productivity in the short to medium term,
so that it offsets the erosion to competitiveness that may stem from the appreciation of
the real effective exchange rate; and (ii) domestic markets will have to open up (ref. the
business environment discussion), so the boost to aggregate demand originating in the oil
sector and in oil-financed public expenditures gradually is substituted by the non-oil
economy.

             small before the opening of the BTC in 2006. Non-oil GDP growth, excluding oil
             related transportation services is estimated at
             about 8 percent in 2006
             Source: Statcom.

32.    Azerbaijan's progress in the institutional aspects of the business environment
has been moderate, but the actual conditions on the ground may well have deteriorated.
The country's ability to develop the non-oil economy is contingent on creating a fair
business environment for the private sector.                 The Government drafted a unified
Investment Law and a Competition Code to encourage investment and to protect
businesses against unfair competition; both laws are being presented to Milli Majlis in the
Spring 2007 session. Notwithstanding the drafting of these laws, and the passage of a
State Program against Corruption, the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
Survey (BEEPS) for 2005 found that 14 out of 21 survey indictors had deteriorated
relative to 2002, and 7 of those indicators related to anti-competitive practices, licensing,
corruption, customs and trade regulation, and taxation had deteriorated significantly. In
the Doing Business Survey 2006, Azerbaijan's ranking improved by one point overall
relative to 2005; within Easter Europe and Central Asia, it scores better in 15 measures
and worse in 6. The survey does shows that the country's administrative procedures for
licenses and permits, customs and trade regulations, and tax administration to be worse
than the region ­these are important constraints that Azerbaijan needs to address if it is to
diversify the non-oil economy, and increase capacity, and productivity, through greater
competition. Both surveys suggest that there are substantial obstacles to the business
environment, that could well hinder the development of the non-oil economy and prevent
Azerbaijan from reaping well-deserved gains from the current infrastructure build-up.

33.    The Government is making a significant effort to join the WTO. On trade, the
Government has ensured that standards, policies, and practices are in line with WTO
mandates. It has increased access to regional markets and the EU, implemented bilateral
trade and transit agreements, and intensified dialogue on transit with neighboring
countries, including through the realization of a pilot scheme for container trains in transit.
The Government has prepared a draft transport and transit strategy, which is being
reviewed.    Six protocols have been prepared to amend the TRACECA Multilateral
Agreement, which governs transit cooperation among 12 countries in the region. These




                                                    15

modifications, which require consensus approval by all concerned countries, are expected
to be submitted for official comments by June 2007.

34.      Banks' solvency and the access to financial services have improved, according
to program objectives. Azerbaijan has made progress in the development of financial
infrastructure geared to create better payment conditions and to move away from the cash
economy, as well as to improve access to financial services outside of Baku. This has led
to financial deepening, as credit to non-oil GDP as increased gradually from 12 to 21
percent between 2003 and 2005. For 2006, the ratio reached 29 percent which raises
some concerns. The Government adopted a new Payment System Strategy, the Batch
Payment System was completed and a national Settlement and Clearing System for E-
payment instruments was completed by the NBA and sold to the Banking Association.
This process was matched by a significant increase in the quantity of ATM cash
machines, the number of which doubled between 2004 and 2006, reaching 1029 in the
first 10 months of 2006. Consequently, there was a significant increase in cards and card
payment transactions, as all pension payments are now made electronically, and the pubic
and private sectors are increasingly making salary payments electronically. Another new
element of the financial infrastructure is a credit risk register, the use of which has
resulted dramatic reduction of non-performing loans and better access to credit for the
SMEs and households. The next large financial infrastructure project is a creation of a
centralized portal for utility payments (APUS), which is expected to increase competition
in utility payment services as well as improve the collection rates. The feasibility study
has been completed and the system is expected to be operational by early 2008. In
addition, a new Banking Law and a new Law on the National Bank were enacted to
improve the legal framework for banking. Increased competition and improvements in
financial infrastructure resulted in reduced interest rate spreads: rates on deposits
increased by about 1.5-2.5 percentage points depending on the currency and maturity of
the deposit, while the interest rates on Manat loans increased by about 0.5 percentage
points between 2003 and end 2005, depending on the maturity. Nevertheless, the sector
remains concentrated. The market share of International bank of Azerbaijan (IBA, mixed
ownership) and Kapital Bank (KB, fully state owned), dropped to 54 percent by 2005
from about 60 percent in 2003. At the same time, the two banks' share in credit of the
banking system (excluding non-bank financial institutions) fell from 49 percent in 2003
to 46 percent in 2005. The Government's recent decision to double the KB capital by
selling additional shares in an auction to eligible investors is encouraging, and, pending
the success of the auction, is expected to increase competitive pressures. This could lead
to further improvements in the quality of banking services and cost reductions.

35.      The legislative framework for financial reporting, accounting, and auditing in
the public and private sectors is improving. The Implementation Decree for the new
Accounting Law was passed in February 2005; the Law covers International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and National Accounting Standards (NAS). The Cabinet of
Ministers (COM) has determined a list of 20 public interest entities (which includes the
largest state-owned enterprises) for accelerated implementation of IFRS before the
deadline prescribed in the Accounting Law (2004). To prepare themselves for the
implementation of the law, which --ambitiously-- requires that by January 1 2008, all
public interest entities need to have adopted IFRS, the country's largest state-owned
enterprises have commenced the training of their accounting personnel. The Government


                                             16

has also made significant progress with NAS. The Cabinet has issued a resolution with a
timetable for NAS implementation for commercial, budgetary and non-governmental
organizations. To date, the majority of the 15 standards for commercial organizations
due to be implemented by end-2006 have been drafted; the next step is discussion,
publication, and comment from the Advisory Council for Accounting. The remaining
standards for commercial organizations are expected to be completed and implemented
by end-2007. NAS for budgetary organizations and non-governmental organizations are
expected to be developed and implemented by end-2008 according to the Cabinet of
Ministers' resolution. The implementation of IFRS by the country's SOEs is a critical
step towards improving the governance and the financial viability of the utility and
transportation sectors, which pose the largest development bottlenecks for the non-oil
economy.

        Strategic Goal 3. Improving Social Services and Infrastructure

36.     At the time of appraisal, the quality of the service delivery of utilities was very
poor owing to low levels of investment, despite the Government subsidies to the sector,
which aimed compensate in part for low tariffs, non-payments and poor management of
the SOEs. The major issues with the utilities sector were restructuring problems and low
collection rates. Similarly, the telecommunications sector was operating at below its
potential. The delivery of social services to the most needy was also a major issue, as was
the poor quality and inefficient use of resources in the education sector. The health
situation was in no better shape, suffering from inadequate access, poor service provision,
and highly fragmented primary health care services. Overall, major reforms were needed
to improve the efficiency and delivery of social services, the targeting of benefits, and the
protection of the vulnerable.

37.     To begin addressing these issues, the PRSC supported the Government in: (i)
improving utility services; (ii) improving infrastructure services; and, (iii) improving
social services. It was anticipated that with the implementation of these polices the
Government could achieve the following outcomes by the end of the three-year PRSC
program period: (i) better utility services by economically viable companies regulated by
an independent regulatory agency and with targeted subsidies for the poor only; (ii)
transport and telecommunications sectors open to new and growing businesses; (iii)
improved access to general education, especially for the poor and the IDPs; (iv) increased
access to and improved quality of health care services, and improved health care
financing and allocation of resources in the health sector; (v) improved services to
pensioners and poor families receiving social assistance benefits, as a result of
computerized record keeping, payments and management information systems, as well as
modern techniques for assessing benefits eligibility (field visits, community monitoring,
etc.); and (vi) the targeting of about 50 percent of the social benefits to poorest segments
of the population.

        Progress under the First PRSC toward Expected Program Output/Outcomes.

38.     Good progress is taking place in the utilities sector. The Government's policy in
the medium term is to render the utilities financially viable, operating under the
framework of an independent regulator. To date, Azerbaijan has implemented significant



                                             17

increases in tariffs and has also made progress with institutional issues. On January 8,
2007, the Tariff Council increased the overall price of electricity by 212 percent, the price
of water by 100 percent, and the price of gas by 50 percent, although increases for
individual client categories vary. Over the duration of the PRSC program, gas prices have
cumulatively increased sixfold, water prices fourfold, and electricity prices threefold.
The most recent increases may possibly place the electricity and gas utilities within reach
of cost recovery, although similar claims cannot be made yet for the water utility as
billing norms were reduced and the utility's electricity bill was tripled.        Currently
financial viability of the utilities by 2010, an important goal of the Medium Term Tariff
Policy, seems to be within reach, although much will also depend on progress being made
in billing and collections. The Government has advised the utilities to introduce metering
to all customers. Azersu, the water utility, has increased metering and collections. At
the institutional level, the Government has moved ahead in introducing IFRS for utilities
and in strengthening the Tariff Council as the precursor to a future Utility Regulatory
Agency. It has also operationalized the Medium-Term Tariff Policy to reach full cost
recovery in the energy and water sectors by 2010. The phased Medium Term Tariff
Policy is indeed a critical framework document which recognizes the efficiency
challenges facing utilities and commits the Government to increases in tariffs but also to
the elimination of subsidies. The budgetary institutions and the state-owned enterprises
became current with their utility payments for the 2005 budget year. However, the
financial conditions in the utility sector remain weak; in nominal terms, energy subsidies
decreased by about 20 percent in 2005 and increased by about 40 percent in 2006 owing
to rising oil prices, while and are budgeted to drop significantly in 2007. According to
the Doing Business Survey 2005, the percentage of firms seeing electricity as a problem
declined from 30 percent in 2002 to 25 percent in 2005. Collections in the power sector
increased moderately from 54 percent in 2003 to 56.4 percent in 2005, but the collection
rates in both the water sector and the gas sector declined in 2005.       In July 2006, the
President issued instructions for collection rates to increase to 100 percent by end-
October 2006. Although this ambitious target has not been met, substantial progress had
been made by end-September 2006: gas reached 83.1 percent, from 40.9 percent in 2005;
and water reached 69.8 percent, compared to 32.7 percent for January 2006. In the future
Azerbaijan needs to monitor quality of services in utilities.

39.     The Government has also moved ahead in the telecommunication sector, while
reforms in the transport sector are taking longer. Early actions in telecommunications,
prior to the PRSC program, included the privatization of the Bakcell mobile phone
company in December 2003.            Under the PRSC program, the Government began
separating regulatory and commercial functions and established the National
Communications Regulatory Authority within the Ministry of Telecommunications. It
approved a new Telecommunications Law in June 2005, and the State Program (E-
Azerbaijan) on the development of information and communications technologies in the
Republic of Azerbaijan for the years 2005-2008 was approved by the President in
October 2005. In the transport sector, the Government started the separation of the
regulatory and commercial functions: it prepared a new regulatory framework for the air,
rail, and maritime sectors. In addition, plans were prepared for the national traffic safety
plan and the functional classification of the road network, as well as for a Pavement
Management System to prioritize road projects. The Government transferred the
regulatory functions that had been exercised by the Caspian Shipping Company to the


                                              18

new Maritime Administration under the Cabinet of Ministers. Also a Civil Aviation
Administration was recently (December 2006) established by Presidential decree.
However, similar structures for railways have not yet been created, although it is under
preparation. The implementation of the regulator structure in the maritime sector is in
question.

40.     Progress in education sector reforms is modest. In the education sector, the
PRSC supported programs that complemented reforms in the IDA Education APL. These
reforms covered critical areas such as quality improvement (through curriculum reform,
teacher development, and provision of textbooks and reading materials); efficiency and
financing    improvement     (through    budget   reforms,  rationalization,   and   school
improvement); equity and access to general education (through school grants in selected
less advantaged districts); and strengthening of management (through student assessment,
management information systems, planning, and monitoring capacity). The Bank and the
Government completed a study on education finance and expenditure (2004) and a public
expenditure tracking study (2006). The Government successfully implemented a new
textbook policy including the financing free-of-charge of core textbooks to all grades.
The Department for the Assessment of Pupils' Achievement was established to reform
curriculum, textbooks and educational management. The gross primary education
enrollment ratio (grades 1-4) increased from 98.6 percent in 2001 to 102.4 percent in
2003. The upper secondary enrollment rate rose from 43.2 percent in 2001 to 70.5
percent in 2003. Higher education enrolment increased from 13.4 percent in 2001 to 18
percent in 2005. Over 90 percent of children in grades 1- 5 were provided with free
textbooks in both 2003 and 2004. A critical reform that was partially implemented in
2005 and in 2006 was aimed at the financial independence of some pilot schools. The
2007 budget includes the introduction of a per capita funding formula for schools and the
full implementation of financial autonomy for pilot schools, although the modalities for
the latter have not been fully worked out and the implementation may therefore be
delayed.

41.     The health sector is actively planning a full-fledged reform. In the health sector,
the PRSC complemented the IDA Health Reform LIL project. The planned reforms
included improving access to and quality of primary health care services in selected
districts, and building up the capacity in the Ministry of Health to learn from the ongoing
process of PHC reforms and to design and carry out further reforms. Within the scope of
the Health Reform LIL project, the Government completed a Health Financing Study
which among other things concluded that the majority of the burden of meeting the costs
of health care falls on the Azeri citizens through out-of-pocket expenses. The
Government also issued a health policy and reform white paper with a set of diagnostics
and recommendations for the health sector. The number of patients at renovated rural
PHC facilities in the target districts rose by 65 percent. Important next step decisions for
the near term are the preparation of a map for new facilities and the determination of the
options of the financing packages.

42.     The Government has made progress in the area of social protection. The PRSC
program, together with the IDA Pension and Social Assistance Project, supported a range
of actions, which included modernizing the social insurance benefits administration,
strengthening the financial management of the State Social Protection Fund (SSPF), and


                                              19

moving the administration of all social insurance benefits from the enterprises to the
SSPF. In an effort to improve the living standards of the elderly, the minimum pension
was increased from AZN 25 per month to AZN 30 in April 2006; AZN 35 in October
2006; AZN 40 in January 2007 and AZN 50 in February 2007. Amendments to the Social
Insurance Law clarified the functions of the SSPF to maintain the unified collection of
social security contributions for social protection in a more transparent and efficient way.
The SSPF now regularly modifies the existing procedures and the transfer of the
administration of social insurance benefits from the enterprises to the SSPF was
completed in early 2006. The Pension Reform Concept note has been approved by the
President, and consequently a new Pension System Law was approved at the end 2005.
The Law significantly streamlined the pension system and introduced links between
benefits and contributions. The SSPF has almost completed modernization of its
administration, including introduction of computerized individual record system.

43.     The Government has made significant progress in social assistance. With
regards to social assistance, the Government has enacted a framework Law on Targeted
Social Assistance, has consolidated various benefits into a single targeted family poverty
benefit, has modernized the capacity of Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the
Population (MoLSPP) to administer social assistance benefits through an automated
management information system, has implemented a targeted family poverty cash benefit,
and has implemented an extensive public information campaign and provided sufficient
budget resources to cover the poverty gap. In June 2006, when the program of targeting
social assistance was launched, 30,000 households with more than 150,000 members
received assistance. By end-2006, 50,000 households with 250,000 individuals were
benefiting from the program. The Government estimated that in 2007 the number of
beneficiary households would increase to 170,000 (in relation to the utility tariffs
increase) and, accordingly, sufficient resources were budgeted.

        Strategic Goal 4. Realizing the Oil and Gas Potential

44.     The State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) manages all
national oil and gas production outside of the Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs),
while participating in PSAs as a shareholder. At the time of PRSC preparation, the
critical tasks for SOCAR were to implement the January 2003 Presidential Decree aimed
at strengthening its management (with improved accounting standards and the
introduction of management information systems), to separate core and non-core
functions, and to separate commercial and non-commercial functions. Other major issues
dealt with the pollution legacy dating back to the Soviet era. To address these issues, the
PRSC supported the Government in: (i) improving the financial and organizational
structure of SOCAR; and (ii) addressing environmental responsibilities. It was
anticipated that with the implementation of these polices the Government could achieve
the following outcomes by the end of the three-year PRSC program period: (i) a
commercialized SOCAR with financial transparency according to IFRS and ISA, a better
organizational structure concentrated on the core activities, and improved balance sheets;
(ii) the separation of non-core activities of SOCAR; and (iii) the beginning of the
environmental cleanup process, which would absorb labor made redundant by the
reorganization.

       Progress under the First PRSC toward Expected Program Output/Outcomes.

45.    SOCAR has made some progress in improving its financial and organizational
structure. Under the PRSC, SOCAR has made some progress toward the implementation
of the 2003 Presidential Decree, by hiring international advisers to implement the
company's restructuring and by initiating the move to IFRS.     SOCAR has also installed
a comprehensive, computerized Management Information System (MIS). Further actions
on the separation of core and non-core businesses have followed the December 22, 2005,
Presidential Decree, which established the Social Development and the Security
Departments of SOCAR, bringing together the like functions of the company's
subsidiaries. In September 2006, three more departments were established: Environment,
Gas Operations, and Information Technology and Communications. The creation of
these five departments (social, security, environment, gas, and IT) allows SOCAR's
remaining enterprises (Azneft, oil pipelines, Geophysics, two refineries, deep water
jacket factory, marketing, foreign investment) to focus on their core services. The next
steps for SOCAR are to transfer the assets and services of non-core areas (i.e. under
social department) to local specialized entities (i.e., all transmission lines already
transferred to Barmek; water, electricity, and gas transferred to Baku Executive Power)
and to implement IFRS by July 1, 2007 in five of the core enterprises. This suggests that
the three to four years originally foreseen for SOCAR's implementation of the 2003
Presidential Decree will need to be extended.

46.    Government has taken several steps to address environmental responsibilities,
although clean-up actions are pending. To address environmental concerns and to
minimize any eventual negative environmental impacts from the operations of the oil
industry, the Government prepared a draft National Oil Spill Response Plan which has to
be formally adopted. Moreover, a comprehensive detailed action plan for improving the
environmental situation in Azerbaijan (2006-2010) was decreed in September 2006. The
action plan details improvements mainly in the Absheron Peninsula (Baku Bay,
Bibiheybat area etc.) and some other parts of Azerbaijan. For each of these areas, the
action plan identifies the responsible implementing agencies and details the actions,
which cover cleaning up wastewater, improving the natural qualities of water and air,
reconstructing sanitation networks, and reclaiming polluted soil. Two other sets of
measures that are included in the plan relate to the improvement of legislation and the
addressing of general ecological problems. The action plan envisages adoption and/or
improvement of environmental norms and standards for the cleaning up of brown fields
based on the assessment of health risk. In addition, the Government prepared a
preliminary map of industrial contaminated sites and conducted an environmental audit
of SOCAR and adopted regulations for corporate compliance with environmental
standards. To further strengthen the push for the environmental clean-up, the President
appointed the Ministry of Environment as the lead agency responsible for monitoring of
the implementation of the Absheron Peninsula clean-up.

       Strategic Goal 5. Implementing SPPRED: Outcomes, Monitoring and
       Institutional Capacity Building

47.    At the time of the PRSC the overall monitoring framework for the SPPRED had
been put in place, but public access to information was limited. It was also recognized



                                            21

that the civil society needed a greater ability to organize and participate in the monitoring
of the SPPRED. Consequently, the program focused on: (i) strengthening the capacities
to improve performance monitoring; and (ii) strengthening oversight and participation.
It was anticipated that with the implementation of these polices the Government could
achieve the following outcomes by the end of the three-year PRSC period: (i) good
performance monitoring and evaluation systems for SPPRED objectives with feedback to
the policy and budget formulation process; and (ii) further strengthening of the civil
society and participatory processes.

        Progress under the First PRSC toward Expected Program Output/Outcomes.

48.     The SPPRED had contributed to developing a culture of consultation for public
polices. In order to strengthen the monitoring of the SPPRED, the Government has
strengthened the capacities of the SPPRED Secretariat (which falls under the Ministry of
Economic Development) to monitor outcomes, and annual reports have been produced.
At the same time, regular Household Budget Surveys were conducted and published, and
with substantial technical assistance from the World Bank (Programmatic Poverty
Assessment), high quality technical analysis has been conducted and published. Despite
the availability of capacity and indicators, the Government has made only moderate
progress in (i) integrating the SPPRED Secretariat into the annual budget process (as has
been difficult for many countries), and (ii) improving the links between indicators and the
budgetary process to create an effective feedback loop during the budgeting cycle.
However, in 2007 the Government took significant steps to strengthen the integration of
the SPPRED Secretariat and regional programs into the core functions of the Ministry of
Economic Development by restructuring the Ministry (in 2006) and creating a new
position of Deputy Minister whose main responsibilities include regional programs.
Drafting of the phase II SPPRED, for 2007-2015 has been competed, but issuance is
pending.

49.     Significant gains have been made in the registration of NGOs since 2005. The
Law on Legal Entities Registration and Registry was adopted to ensure the smooth
registration of NGOs and their participation in outcome monitoring.                To date,
approximately 1064 NGOs have been registered since the adoption of the Law.            Apart
from simplification of the internal procedures, the Ministry of Justice undertook some
important structural changes, uniting two departments of Notary and Registration into
one Unit and strengthened the staff of the new unit. With the active participation of
NGOs in monitoring oil revenues through EITI, as well as in monitoring the national
budget and other issues, civil participation in the monitoring of expenditures is likely to
increase.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.     Azerbaijan's performance under the program for 2005 was Satisfactory. The
present ICR maintains a broader perspective, and assesses the progress, though early
2007, being made towards the achievement of the medium term program objectives under



                                              22

the entire Medium Term Policy Matrix. Although PRSC II and PRSC II have no
financing rationale, the reform program remains largely intact and is being implemented
under the CPS covering FY07-FY10.                  Overall, the progress at this stage of
implementation of the reform program is found to be Moderately Satisfactory.

51.     The program comprises what is effectively the Government's governance strategy,
incorporating key components in public sector reform, and in the management of the
economy and the environment. The program is comprehensive, but is being executed in
an ad hoc manner, so that some components that would have been considered most
critical to the Government's development objectives (largely the same as the PDOs) such
as macroeconomic stability and the business environment, seem to be at risk or lagging
behind, while the remainder of the program is being implemented. The overall rating of
Moderately Satisfactory is based on the assessment provided in Sections 8.1 and 8.2, and
in view of the design, the relevance of objectives, and the achievement of development
objectives. The overall rating incorporates a satisfactory rating for the single year of the
first PRSC achievements and a moderately satisfactory rating on the progress towards
fulfillment of the program objectives over the medium term, which the ICR weighs
heavily.

52.     The most important achievements of the PRSC are that it has helped the
Government to continue developing an institutional infrastructure that will be critical for
Azerbaijan's non-oil economy in the medium term. The most important institutional
changes going forward are: (i) the passage of the Accounting Law, which is the linchpin
to improving governance in state-owned enterprises and accountability in the public
sector; (ii) the Medium Term Tariff Policy, which is an important framework document
for improving utilities in the next four years and, in so doing, improving the very poor
quality of utilities services; and finally, (iii) the Law on Targeted Social Assistance will
be an important social policy tool for increasing the efficiency of government transfers
and allowing the poor to cope with rising utilities tariffs and with other targeted social
assistance, and (iv) the payment systems strategy will be important in increasing access to
financial services throughout the country, and reducing the impact of middlemen. In
addition, the Government maintained macroeconomic balance for most of the PRSC
period, although inflation risks are accumulating. The PRSC's contribution to some of
the remaining components of program matrix (such as education, health, financial
services) were modest, and progress made is attributable to existing operations or AAA
tasks. In other components (such as the business environment) this report argues that
more might have been attempted.

53.     The PRSC operation generally achieved the expected outcomes identified in the
Program Document. In terms of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Azerbaijan
is on its way to meeting most of the MDG goals for poverty, education, health, water
supply, and sanitation. However, it will take some time before policies and institutional
requirements can be established in order to significantly accelerate progress towards the
MDG targets.

54.     In terms of the ratings for each objective, the following paragraphs summarize
and evaluate the major achievements under each component of the PRSC. Each strategic




                                               23

goal is rated separately, as are the major sub-goals that are distinctly identified in the
appraisal document and the policy matrix.

        Strategic Goal 1: Managing the Oil Boom

55.     Implementation of this strategic goal is rated as moderately satisfactory. The
rating for this objective rests on ratings for the two sub-goals: (i) moderately satisfactory
rating for maintaining macroeconomic stability and non-oil growth, and (ii) moderately
satisfactory rating progressing on public financial management. The policy actions taken
under this component were critical in maintaining macroeconomic stability through 2005.
However, the accelerated pace of public spending in 2006 has raised more recent
concerns for macroeconomic stability, the efficiency of public investments, and the
effectiveness of the budget process. The high public spending rates have the possibility
of substantially affecting the real effective exchange rate (and hence the competitiveness)
of Azerbaijan, and yielding low efficiency of investment, which could delay the desired
quick productivity gains that would allow the non-oil economy to continue its
diversification and robust growth. Oil revenue management has remained a bright spot.
Given the progress made to date, to achieve the remaining objectives of the PRSC
program (as envisaged under the planned PRSC2 and PRSC3 operations), on the macro
side, more needs to be done to monitor macroeconomic developments routinely,
especially in the absence of an active IMF program, to strengthen the implementation of
the Medium Term Expenditure Framework, and to strengthen the quality of public
investment; along with stronger institutions, Government may wish to deposit all oil-
related revenues into the Oil Fund, and to quantify the LTORMS. On the public financial
management side, the following are needed: improvements in the budget process, the
strengthening of public sector accountability and the audit functions, the introduction of
public internal financial controls, and the strengthening of the accounting and financial
management capacity. The ongoing dialogue with the Bank and other donors, as well as
E-procurement TA and the planned Corporate and Public Sector Accountability Project
(CAPSAP, FY07), would assist with these efforts, but substantial initiatives need to be
taken by the Government.

        Strategic Goal 2: Generating Jobs and Sustainable Non-Oil Growth

56.     The implementation of this strategic goal is rated as moderately satisfactory.
The rating for this objective rests on ratings for the two sub-goals: (i) moderately
unsatisfactory rating for improving Azerbaijan's business environment and for increasing
non-oil trade and (ii) a satisfactory rating for financial intermediation and financial
reporting. Within the first sub-goal, Azerbaijan's non-oil economy is continuing to grow,
at reasonable rates, and the country's non-oil trade is also increasing in a satisfactory
manner. Employment is also increasing. Despite the stress that diversification may be
subject to in the future (due to currency appreciation), the performance of the non-oil
sector under the program thus far is considered satisfactory. The business environment
part of the subcomponent, however, is rated as unsatisfactory, primarily because of the
poor performance in the existing surveys and poor progress in improving the environment.
In the future, the country's ability to meet its non-oil development objectives may rest on
reversing the trend in this component. Within the second sub-goal, on the financial sector,
Azerbaijan is largely on track to achieving the program objectives, and hence the rating is



                                              24

satisfactory; while the program objectives do not include addressing the monopolistic
position of IBA directly, the program objectives are being achieved as IBA's dominance
is being increasingly challenged by new private banks and by the availability of financial
infrastructure allowing smaller banks to compete. On financial reporting, Azerbaijan is
making good progress in the implementation of the Accounting Law, and the overall
program progress is rated as satisfactory, particularly given the initiatives that state-
owned enterprises, including SOCAR, are taking to meet the January 1, 2008 objectives
of the Law; the leadership of the Ministry of Finance in this area has been critical.
Interestingly, the two sub-components of this goal, the business environment and that
implementation of the Accounting Law, are critical for the success of the overall program,
and they are currently rated with divergent ratings.

        Strategic Goal 3: Improving Social Services and Infrastructure

57.     Implementation of this strategic goal is rated as satisfactory. The rating for this
objective rests on ratings for the three sub-goals: (i) satisfactory rating for utility services;
(ii) moderately satisfactory for improving infrastructure services; and (iii) satisfactory
rating for improving social services. For the first sub-goal, Azerbaijan has progressed in
implementing the utilities agenda, with the substantial increases in utilities rates, and the
efforts to strengthen the Tariff Council.        While the Government has chosen not
immediately embrace the single regulator model, the overall progress is considered
satisfactory. For the second sub-goal, Azerbaijan's progress on the telecommunications
sector can also be considered satisfactory, given the institutional progress made by the
MoITC and progress made with cellular operators. Conversely, on the transport sector,
the separation of commercial from regulatory functions in all sub sectors, has been
progressing much slower than anticipated under the program, and hence the
subcomponent is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. For the third sub-goal, on the social
sector side, the reforms in education and health sectors have been largely consistently
with the program objectives, and hence are considered satisfactory. The social assistance
reforms have been introduced in a timely manner, enabling not only the poor to benefit
from an improved support system, but also effectively allowing the utilities reforms to
proceed, by providing a source of compensation to the poor, for the higher rates that need
to be introduced; the sub component is rated as satisfactory.

        Strategic Goal 4: Realizing the Oil and Gas Potential

58.     Implementation of this strategic goal is rated as moderately satisfactory. The
rating for this objective rests on ratings for the two sub-goals: (i) moderately satisfactory
rating for improving the financial and organizational structure of SOCAR; and (ii)
moderately satisfactory rating for addressing environmental responsibilities. For the first
sub-goal, on the whole, SOCAR has improved its organization and financial structure,
and the component is rated moderately satisfactory because the operational structure of
SOCAR has started to be more transparent, separation of core and non-core services has
progressed, and adequate progress seems to be made in preparation of implementing
IFRS. However, concerns remain with SOCAR, since the separation of its commercial
and regulatory functions has not advanced. For the second sub-g, on the environment side,
progress is considered barely moderately satisfactory, because although substantial




                                              25

planning has taken place for the clean up of the environment, activities have not yet been
initiated.

         Strategic Goal 5: Implementing SPPRED: Outcomes, Monitoring and
         Institutional Capacity Building

59.      The implementation of this component is rated as moderately satisfactory. The
rating for this objective rests on the ratings for two sub-goals: (i) moderately satisfactory
rating for improved poverty and performance monitoring; and (ii) satisfactory
strengthening oversight and participation. For the first sub-goal, poverty monitoring
institutional arrangements were strengthened to collect, analyze, and disseminate timely
information to the Government and the public. However, particular attention needs to be
paid to performance monitoring in the public sector, particularly of the governance
agenda, which would need to be monitored on the basis of a shared framework in
partnership with multilateral and bilateral donors, and with civil society participation.
The monitoring framework would need to cover several areas, including the extractive
industries, public expenditure, the financial sector, and financial accountability, including
internal control, accounting and auditing. The Government needs to insure that the
monitoring framework informs and feeds into budget preparation in the annual budget
cycle. Porgr4ess in considered nevertheless moderately satisfactory. For the second sub-
goal, important progress has been made with the registration of NGOs and structural
reforms in this area in this area, in the Ministry of Justice. As such, the rating is
satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.      The 2004 Household Budget Survey (HBS) data suggest that the proportion of
poor declined from about 41 percent in 2002 to 27.5 percent in 2004, a decline of 33
percent. Extreme poverty declined from 25 percent of the population in 2002 to 13
percent in 2004. The number of people living in poverty declined from 3.3 million in
2002 to 2.2 million in 2004. Social transfers to the poorest 20 percent of the households
increased by over 35 percent in 2004 compared to their level in 2003. Pensions, which
are the main component of the Government's social program, increased by about 44
percent for the poorest segment during the 2002-2004 period. With inflation remaining
for the most part in the single digits, the real incomes of the large majority of the
population employed outside the energy sector, including teachers and health workers,
rose noticeably. Azerbaijan is on its way to meeting most of the MDGs, which have been
integrated into the SPPRED. The 2005 Millennium Progress Report ranks Azerbaijan as
one of the countries on the fast track for achieving the MDGs by 2015. The Report
considers Azerbaijan as having a better chance than most other CIS countries of meeting
MDG1. Azerbaijan's ranking for universal primary education (MDG2) is also better than
that if other CIS countries. The Report also ranks the prospects of Azerbaijan for
achieving the remaining MDGs by 2015, as being likely.




                                               26

61.     However, challenges remain in meeting the MDGs. The education system faces a
number of problems and is not yet equipped to meet the demands of a modern economy.
And a fundamental reform agenda needs to be addressed in the health care system. The
reforms to improve the targeting and administration of social assistance, which have
recently been initiated, Access to improved water supply, which has deteriorated in cities
outside Baku, needs to be increased. There are also statistical gaps that undermine the
measurement of progress, notably the absence of regular labor market surveys and
insufficient understanding of the economic status of IDPs. In health care, the discrepancy
between Government statistics and survey data makes it difficult to gauge the progress in
reducing maternal and under-five mortality. On the whole, the Government needs
assistance to improve the statistical basis for benchmarks and for the monitoring of their
progress.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

62.     The PRSC was a fast-disbursing operation in support of the budgetary needs, but
was expected to have important institutional development impact during its three-year
time horizon. That impact, in the case of the PRSC, has been very significant as is
described below. Part of this success was due to the fact that the PRSC coincided with the
implementation of the IBTA-II operation, which helped strengthen the institutional
capacities, including the computing capacities, of many agencies that were responsible
for the implementation of SAC-II/PRSC measures.

63.     On component 1, managing the oil boom, a wide range of institutional changes
were implemented to increase efficiency of public resources and enhance the
transparency of oil revenue management. The key agencies for which institutional
developments have been significant, or have improved their operational system and
procedures, include: SOFAZ, the Chamber of Accounts, the MED, and the MoF. Of
particular importance has been the establishment of the Public Investment Appraisal
Division in the MED and a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as well as an
automated Treasury system in the MoF.

64.     On component 2, generating jobs and sustainable non-oil growth, banking
supervision was strengthened. The National Bank of Azerbaijan's on-site inspections and
payments system (RTGS) now meets the BIS norms. The minimum capital requirements
have increased and international accounting and financial reporting standards have been
adopted by almost all banks.

65.     On component 3, improving social services and infrastructure, institutional
development impacts include: the establishment of the Department for the Assessment of
Pupils' Achievement; an increased enrollment of students at all levels; an increased
number of patients in primary health care facilities; changes in the Social Insurance Law
to unify collection; adoption of the Pension Reform Concept; a computerized individual
record system for pensioners; a Labor Force Survey; preparation of a National
Employment Strategy; strengthening the Tariff Council; the establishment of the Road
Administration; the preparation of a National Traffic Safety Plan and Pavement
Management System; the development of National Caspian Action Plan; the preparation



                                               27

of a Hazardous Waste Management Strategy; the creation of a Toxic Waste Management
Agency; and the establishment of National Monitoring Department to track pollution
emissions.

66.     On component 4, realizing oil and gas potential, the institutional impact has
included: the financial restructuring of SOCAR.

67.     Finally, in developing a monitoring mechanism and institutional capacity building
to implement SPPRED, the institutional development impact has included: conducting a
new Household Budget Survey; strengthening various organizations to collect, analyze,
and disseminate information on poverty and other Government programs; adopting the
Law on Legal Entities Registration to facilitate the participation of NGOs; and the
completion of a three-year programmatic poverty assessment.

68.     The above-mentioned institutional developments were complemented by those of
the other donors and contributed to the further strengthening of the institutional capacity
in the public sector.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

69.     The partnership that was established between the Government and the Bank with
the PRSC provided a good foundation for the preparation of the CPS for FY07-FY10,
which allows the Bank to participate in Azerbaijan's reform program in the medium term.
This positive outcome is not unintentional, but is an outcome beyond the scope of the
operation.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

70.     A beneficiary survey was not conducted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

71.     The Government is committed to deepening the PRSC reforms under the Country
Partnership Strategy in the next 4 years, and, as indicted above, reforms are progressing,
albeit not at the originally agreed upon pace. However, risks identified in the CPS, which
include delays in building reform consensus, a risk of state capture and corruption, a
regional security risk, and a risk associated with a collapse of oil prices (or yet higher oil
prices), could hamper the gains already made and the gains likely to be made under the
full completion of the reform program.




                                                28

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.      Although no quality at entry review was carried out by the Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) on this operation, the Bank aimed to uphold quality at entry by ensuring:
(i) the consistency of the operation with the CAS and the development objectives; (ii) the
timeliness of the operation; (iii) the continuity of policy dialogue on the reform measures;
and (iv) close coordination with other donors.

73.      Overall, the operation was timely and its objectives were directly linked to the
SPPRED objectives, making it an appropriate instrument for supporting those objectives.
Moreover, as has been mentioned, the operation was prepared with a full knowledge of
the economy and Azerbaijan's constraints. This preparation took into account the results
achieved under other operations in Azerbaijan, particularly the SAC-II. In addition,
poverty and social impact assessment were carried out for some key reforms and the
results were reflected into the PRSC policy measures (e.g. implications of higher
electricity tariffs on the heating bills of the urban poor).

74.      The policy dialogue was constructive and it helped with the preparation of the
operation in close collaboration with the responsible implementing agencies. The PRSC
team was involved continuously in a relevant policy dialogue with the Government
agencies and had technical expertise in the areas supported by the PRSC program. The
team gained the trust of the counterparts and established a substantive working
relationship with them. Strong efforts were made by the team to build consensus on the
proposed reform measures (particularly among the MoF, MED, and Cabinet of Ministers)
and to ensure a participatory approach in project design.

75.      The Bank leveraged the involvement of other donors in Azerbaijan and ensured
close coordination for this operation. Thus the PRSC was selective and did not aim to
cover all lending areas identified in the CAS. Coordination with the IMF was strong, to
ensure consistency with the macroeconomic framework and the continuity of the policy
dialogue on macro-financial issues. Other areas of coordination included the following
bodies: UNDP (to assess progress toward the MDGs and environmental protection);
UNICEF (activities in the social sectors); IFC, EBRD, USAID and GTZ (activities
involving private sector development); ADB (activities in rural development); ADB,
Switzerland, and UNDP (formulation of the SPPRED); EU, OSCE, and USAID
(technical assistance for the implementation of SPPRED Treasury Systems, PIP and
utility regulatory reform); TACIS (accounting law, governance); and, EBRD, USTDA
(SOCAR restructuring). Coordination was also carried out internally to ensure



                                                29

consistency with other IDA operations in agriculture, the environment, the social sectors,
and financial services.

76.     Despite these important gains, more might have been achieved if the Bank could
have worked with the Government to define a narrower scope of the operation ­ one that
that would have attempted greater success for those aspects of the reform agenda that
seem most critical to securing the macro framework and the business environment.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.     As a multi-sectoral programmatic operation, the PRSC was supervised intensively
by the country team members. The team monitored progress in the policy programs
described in the LDP and the Program Document in both headquarters and the field. The
presence of the Bank Office in Baku also greatly facilitated monitoring the
implementation of the PRSC programs. The supervision team established a good working
relationship with the Government counterparts and was able to resolve many
implementation problems. Nevertheless, during the implementation the Bank team could
have helped the government to be more aware of the risks of delays                 in the
implementation of some of the reform areas.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory in view of the
performance during the lending phase and the quality of supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     The preparation of the PRSC began on a solid base with the strong support of the
Government to ensure its quality. During the preparation, each component and its related
policy measures was discussed and agreed on with each implementing agency, with the
Ministries of Finance and of Economic Development, with the Cabinet of Ministers, and
the with Office of the President. The Macroeconomic discussion included consultations
with the National Bank of Azerbaijan. This helped the authorities to obtain full ownership
of the program as well as good understanding of the elements of the PRSC as highlighted
in the Letter of Development Policy and the Matrix of Policy Measures. The relationship
among different government agencies improved during the preparation and
implementation of the operation as they needed to coordinate their activities. The four
economic agencies, namely, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic
Development, the National Bank and the Oil Fund, played an active role in this regard, as



                                             30

did the Cabinet of Ministers. They were also instrumental in ensuring compliance with
credit agreements. Nevertheless, the Government could have been more selective in
defining its reform program, and providing less ambitious and more practical
intermediate targets in the operation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     Although the Ministry of Finance was nominally the main implementing agency
for the operation, leadership for the reforms was provided by all of the leading economic
agencies (the Ministries of Finance and of Economic Development, the National Bank
and the Oil Fund) and by the Cabinet of Ministers. The Ministry of Finance took the lead
in facilitating the policy dialogue on macro and fiscal issues, coordination accounting and
other public finance-related reforms, while the Ministry of Economic Development took
the lead in private sector issues and investment policy issues. All four leading economic
agencies were active participants in the macroeconomic policy discussions. However,
developments during the second half of 2006 require a more diligent effort by the
Government to balance public spending priorities with a competitive macro environment
that will ensure the sustainable development of the non-oil economy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.     In view of its moderately satisfactory preparation and implementation, the overall
performance of the Borrower is rated as moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

82.     Good policy dialogue can sustain Bank contributions to development in the
absence of country financing needs. The experience in Azerbaijan shows that once the
reforms were brought in at various levels of the Government, this lead to complementary
reforms and further expansion of the policy dialogue, regardless of the financing needs of
the country. Azerbaijan's financing needs have been declining in recent years. However,
the policy dialogue has expanded and the implementation of reforms has been on the rise
with important outcomes. This is because the Government sees the value of Bank
assistance in the shaping of its reform agenda more than in the financing of it. This has
kept the policy dialogue active and vigorous despite the rising oil revenues and the lesser
need for financial assistance.

83.     A broad program can help secure policy dialogue in multiple areas, and can
allow for the refinement of reforms as the policy environment permits. The policy
dialogue under the PRSC was intensive. The PRSC county team members knew the
country well and worked closely with their counterparts in shaping this dialogue into
concrete policy actions. This helped the Government with the identification of reforms
that would match the circumstances of Azerbaijan. It also allowed the fine tuning of the



                                              31

program during implementation. The involvement of the county team through the life of
the program also proved to be important in keeping the dialogue on track and to sharpen
the focus of the operation.

84.     There are trade-offs between a broad program and a more focused one, which
can have real effects in a risky economic environment. Resource rich countries face
exceptional risks, over and above the "average" non-resource rich country, which the
Bank and the Government identified. One risk, however, the resource flow risk,
materialized in the inverse direction from what was anticipated ­namely, instead of oil
prices dropping, they rose and created windfall revenues from the "old oil" which raised
spending pressures well before the implementation of the public finance reforms and the
business environment reforms were completed. Should the PRSC have tried to secure the
public finance reforms "as soon as possible" given the high risk environment, before
pursuing reforms in the transport sector or social protection sector? Should the PRSC
operation have included a component on customs or tax administration, given the
development constraints that the business environment poses, and the risks those
constraints place on non-oil growth?        Did the Bank overestimate the window of
opportunity for reforms, in designing a three-year program with Government. If within
the broad operation, even greater emphasis had been given to the macro/fiscal and
business environment issues, the operation may well have had a tapering impact on the
rate of the public spending increase and to the challenges to competitiveness in the non-
oil sector.

85.     Long-term vision pays off. Overall, Azerbaijan and the Bank faced a narrow
window of opportunity to establish a necessarily far-reaching medium term reform
program, which addressed the large and urgent institutional development needs to prepare
for the large resource revenue inflows. The reform program presented with the PRSC
addressed that need, and was based on a longer term vision. Although ambitious, the
PRSC was the most appropriate instrument at the disposal of the team, seeking to engage
the country for the medium term, including after the rise in resource revenues. The
PRSC helped establish a sound reform strategy and partnership between the country and
the Bank, which today is being implemented throughout the 2006-2010 CPS period

86.     The impact of operations with deep institutional reforms cannot be judged
within a short or even a medium term time horizon, even if the lending program is
interrupted. Institutional reforms are intrinsically time-consuming - to implement, with
changes taking place at a slow speed. The institutional measures supported by the PRSC
were combined with the introduction of new methods and procedures for the operations
of many agencies (e.g. oil revenue management, public expenditure management). The
assessment of the impact of these changes would need a time period beyond the one-year
horizon of the PRSC. This is also true for some other reforms (e.g. governance,
transparency). Many of the policy measures also required certain political decisions (e.g.
the Oil Fund), the impact of which goes beyond the envisaged time period of the PRSC
operation. Full review of the implementation of the medium term reform program
supported by the PRSC should be undertaken during the mid-term review of the CPS, and
during the final review of the CP in FY10

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

87.    The ICR was discussed in detail with Government. However, the government did
not provide written comments.

(b) Cofinanciers

88.    The operation did not have cofinanciers.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

89.    No comments were received from other partners and stakeholders as discussion
on the Bank's overall program (including the PRSC) were recently concluded as part of
the preparation of the new Country Partnership Strategy.
