"Ratings for the Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit (PRSC) Project in Azerbaijan were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            1) Good policy dialogue can sustain Bank contributions to\n            development in the absence of country financing needs; 2) A\n            broad program can help secure policy dialogue in multiple\n            areas, and can allow for the refinement of reforms as the\n            policy environment permits; 3) There are trade-offs between\n            a broad program and a more focused one, which can have real\n            effects in a risky economic environment; 4) Long-term vision\n            pays off; and 5) The impact of operations with deep\n            institutional reforms cannot be judged within a short or\n            even a medium term time horizon, even if the lending program\n            is interrupted."}, "docdt": "2007-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
