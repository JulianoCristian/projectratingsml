The loan became\n            effective on June 23, 1999. The loan closed on December 31,\n            2001 with only US$11.9 million disbursed. An amount of US$88\n            million was cancelled at the request of the government\n            before significant implementation of the project could be\n            initiated. Due to extensive negotiations with the government\n            over the Country Assistance Strategy, the project was\n            delayed. The government made an internal decision in early\n            1999 to finance the activities of the National Y2K project\n            team outside of the World Bank project. Given the nature of\n            the project and the precise timing that was required for\n            implementation, the delay in project processing ultimately\n            affected the effectiveness of the project and its implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
