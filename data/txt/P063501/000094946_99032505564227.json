{"cdata!": "The Year 2000 (Y2K) Technical Assistance\n            Project seeks to: a) contain and minimize the disruption in\n            the country's social and economic infrastructure that\n            will be caused by the failure of critical central, state,\n            and local government systems to process dates after December\n            31, 1999; and b) coordinate Y2K efforts in key sectors,\n            monitor closely the evolving overall national situation, and\n            prepare measures to deal with possible disruptions. There\n            are two primary components: 1) Public sector Y2K efforts\n            will address the Y2K problems of many agencies which have\n            large computerized applications that are at risk. Since many\n            of the applications were developed in-house, the remedial\n            efforts will similarly be done that way. Many at-risk items\n            require the procurement of upgrades or replacements. Goods\n            will therefore form the bulk of the intended expenditure\n            under this component. 2) National coordination efforts will\n            cover the coordination of contingency planning, critical\n            services with cross dependencies, national monitoring,\n            dissemination efforts, public information management, legal\n            planning, etc."}, "docdt": "1999-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
