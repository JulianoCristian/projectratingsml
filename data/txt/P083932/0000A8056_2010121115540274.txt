                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         NEHRP would facilitate the reconstruction of 31,200 houses in the North East over a four-year period through the provision of housing support cash grants. In
                         doing so, it would support the return of displaced populations in the North East and the regularization of land title to targeted beneficiaries. It would contribute
                         to the training of skilled construction workers, consequently allowing the resumption of economic activity in the war-devastated region through increased
                         construction activity.

                         The overall project performance continues to be satisfactory. The performance of the Financial Management was upgraded from MU to MS, as there are still few outstanding issues
                         that need to be addressed before the FM performance is rated fully satisfactory. The Project has disbursed about US$ 93 million as of November 15, 2010, which leaves US$ 26

                         construction in the North was put on hold due to resumption of conflict during 2007-2009. The target housing is now 50,091 of which 70% is completed and close to 22% is at various
                         stages of construction. Housing construction is more challenging for the returnees to Jaffna, Killinochchi and Mullathivu in the North which account for over 93 percent of the
                         remaining 4,659 beneficiaries. The project is expected to close as scheduled on December 31, 2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Implementing Agency to scale up technical supervision of the housing to improve quality of the houses to acceptable standard, enforce the size limit of 550 sq feet core house as
                         agreed under the project to make sure that houses are completed and beneficiaries do not face financial burden of having to complete bigger houses, and prepare a Defect List of
                         houses completed and work with respective beneficiaries to rectify the defects. The Implementing Agency also requires to identify those beneficiaries displaced and left their houses
                         incomplete and try to help them under the NEHRP if possible or other donor funded projects supporting housing in the conflict areas. It is also essential to re-establish
                         Land Task Force to resolve all the land related issues caused by 25 years of conflict and displacement of people. The IDA continue close supervision of the project to ensure
                         smooth implementation; and closes the project as scheduled on December 31, 2011.
