                                                                     The additional financing of US$43
                                                                     million for the North East Housing
                                                                     Reconstruction Program would help
                                                                     rebuild 13,615 more houses.




   The twenty-five year old civil conflict in Sri Lanka led to loss of life, the displacement of persons
   belonging to all ethnic groups and the destruction of infrastructure, housing, health care centers
   and schools.

   A Joint Donor Needs Assessment in 2003 estimated that 290,615 houses destroyed in the civil
   conflict in Sri Lanka’s North and East prior to 2002 remained unrepaired. 25,300 more houses
   were destroyed with the resurgence of the conflict in 2006.


   The destruction or damage to the total housing stock in the North and the East provinces was 58
   percent, and 90 percent of the houses belonging to the displaced population were also destroyed
   by the conflict This destruction to housing precipitated a significant level of population displacement
   and economic deprivation during periods of armed hostility.

   The challenge is to reconstruct conflict-damaged houses deemed safe for reconstruction and
   facilitate the return of the conflict-affected poor.




   • The approach is to support reconstruction through a cash grant scheme, paid in installments to
   help reconstruct homes.

   • The technical assistance will be provided under this program to help meet the long term housing
   needs in the North and East through improved construction standards, enhanced community
   involvement in housing construction and streamlined mechanisms to resolve property disputes.
• 84 percent of the entire project caseload is either complete or nearing completion.

• 22,946 houses out of the allocated 34,784 houses had been completed as at July, 2008.

• NEHRP had trained 1,266 masons and carpenters as at May , 2008. An added 160 youth are
currently being trained.

• The Land Task Forces established under NEHRP had registered 96,385 conflict or displacement
related land disputes. They had investigated 73,475 cases and resolved 52,721 cases of
disputed/unclear land title in 2006.

• Below is the completion rate of the houses to be built in the Third phase of NEHRP, since
commencement in June 2007.

    US$ 85 million IDA equivalent approved on December 14, 2004 and declared effective on
    March 15, 2005.
    Euros 15.6 million in parallel financing, from the European Commission based on robust
    implementation
    US$43 million in additional financing in June, 2008




The Additional Financing fits in well with the overall thrust of the IDA country program in its
emphasis on meeting the immediate reconstruction needs of the impoverished conflict-affected
population. It would build upon ongoing IDA financed efforts to support the return of IDPs, housing
reconstruction, the restoration of health services, education, rural livelihood and drinking water
supply in the North and East. IDA management took the decision to specifically support the
housing sector given the success of the program to date, the scale of financing needs and
absence of significant other donor support in that sector.

The upcoming supplementary program would have three components i.e.:

(a) Housing Assistance - This component would finance the housing reconstruction scheme, i.e. a
grant of Rs 325,000 to each family meeting the eligibility and prioritization criteria to help rebuild
their damaged houses.

(b) Capacity Building Measures - This component would include technical assistance to ensure
social and environmental safeguards, the training of construction workers and a robust
communications campaign.
(c) Support for Overall Program Management - This would finance the technical expertise in the
North East Housing Reconstruction Unit (NEHRU), the incremental operating costs and the costs
incurred in supervising Program implementation.
