Some\n            lessons learned included: an 'owner driven'\n            housing reconstruction program is the most preferred\n            strategic option, even in war damaged and displaced\n            societies, if adequate institutional and financial supports\n            are made available. As the house owners themselves will be\n            staying in the houses after reconstruction, they will be\n            more interested and committed to ensure that a high quality\n            is maintained in construction. For a large scale housing\n            program to be successful, important factors to be considered\n            are: (i) a simple project design; (ii) appropriate\n            administrative arrangements, at the village, division,\n            district, and province; (iii) appropriate coordination among\n            these stakeholders; and (iv) a decentralized supervision of\n            the project by technical officers and other sectoral staff\n            at the village/division level. In addition, the arrangement\n            to pay the housing cash grant money directly to\n            beneficiaries, giving them responsibility, linking physical\n            progress with financial payments, and avoiding middle men\n            are also critical factors for the success of a project.\n            Third party technical audits at the household level will\n            help in improving construction activities and quality. For\n            this project, the use of Continuous Social Impact Assessment\n            (CSIA) was very useful as a third party monitoring, due to\n            the fact that the project comprised private goods where a\n            transparent beneficiary selection process was essential,\n            especially in a politically highly sensitive context.\n            Capacity building should be given greater importance,\n            especially in backward areas such as NEHRP project area. Not\n            only should the capacity of the project office be built but\n            also of partner agencies who are mandated to enforce\n            regulations and/or monitor activities."}, "docdt": "2012-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
