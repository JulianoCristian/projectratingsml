                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         NEHRP would facilitate the reconstruction of 31,200 houses in the North East over a four-year period through the provision of housing support cash grants. In
                         doing so, it would support the return of displaced populations in the North East and the regularization of land title to targeted beneficiaries. It would contribute
                         to the training of skilled construction workers, consequently allowing the resumption of economic activity in the war-devastated region through increased
                         construction activity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         NEHRP has been performing satisfactorily since the start. However, there has been a decline in the performance of the project as observed and reported since last supervision
                         mission in May 2010, both on quality of construction and pace of implementation. The main reason for this is the lack of attention to management of the project, when project needs

                         most attention for phase 5. There has been a frequent turnover of senior and technical level staff in the Project Unit (NEHRU). Majority of the positions (senior and field) are vacant
                         for over one year. Inadequate technical capacity at the field level is resulting in less than satisfactory standard of construction. Ratio of house per Engineer is about 1,800 and that

                         for Technical Officers is close to 200 which are very high. There have been lapses in enforcing the size limit of 550 Sq feet for a core house as agreed in the past.

                         As of May 2011, out of 50,091 target houses under the project, a total of 39,367 houses (78.6%) have been completed. Of the 10,374 balance houses under construction, only 4,962
                         (49%) reached the roof level. This is cause for concern as most of these incomplete houses are in Killinochchi and Mulathivue districts where beneficiaries are most vulnerable and
                         housing construction requires more effective and frequent technical supervision. In addition, 634 houses fall under Special Cases where beneficiaries received first and second
                         installments but are not constructing their houses due various reasons, such as displacement, land disputes, family issues, etc. For these special cases the Implementing Agency
                         requires to give a deadline beyond which those who do not complete the respective stage, will not be eligible for further installments, and will be subject to recovery of installments
                         already made.

                         Some beneficiaries who reportedly were selected still do not meet the selection criteria and do not have the title to land deed, hence construction did not commence. As for
                         Grievance Redress mechanism it was observed that in several cases complainants have been included in the beneficiary list with a lower score than what had been established as
                         cut-off point for their GN Division. This raises very serious issues of inequity, since there would potentially be numerous households with a similar score, who were excluded from the
                         beneficiary list.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Implementing Agency to scale up technical supervision of the housing to improve quality of the houses to acceptable standard, enforce the size limit of 550 sq feet core house as
                         agreed under the project to make sure that houses are completed and beneficiaries do not face financial burden of having to complete bigger houses, and prepare a Defect List of
                         houses completed and work with respective beneficiaries to rectify the defects. As of May 2011, out of 50,091 target houses under the project, a total of 39,367 houses (78.6%)
                         have been completed. Of the 10,374 balance houses under construction, 4,962 (49%) reached the roof level. Most of these incomplete houses are in Killinochchi and Mulathivue
                         districts where beneficiaries are most vulnerable and housing construction requires more effective and frequent technical supervision. The project is scheduled to close on
                         December 31, 2011.
