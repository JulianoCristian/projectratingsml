A Joint Donor Needs\n            Assessment in 2003 estimated that 290,615 houses, destroyed\n            during the conflict in the North and East prior to 2002,\n            needed repair. 25,300 more houses in the Batticaloa and\n            Trincomalee districts were badly damaged in 2006. The\n            destruction to housing at different times coincided with\n            significant levels of population displacement and economic\n            deprivation as armed hostilities erupted. 206,995\n            conflict-damaged houses of the pre-2002 caseload still\n            remain unrepaired. 23,398 houses destroyed in 2006 are yet\n            to be rebuilt. The NEHRP is the only program in Sri Lanka\n            intended to rebuild conflict-damaged houses on the scale\n            envisaged. The parent project was intended to rebuild 34,784\n            houses. International Development Association (IDA) rated\n            progress towards achieving NEHRP's development\n            objective and its implementation performance as\n            satisfactory. Implementation complied with IDA fiduciary,\n            social and environment safeguards. The Government of Sri\n            Lanka was keen to scale-up the program given its results in\n            a challenging security environment. An additional 13,615\n            houses will be rebuilt in the North and East under the IDA\n            additional financing. This will include houses both from the\n            pre-2002 caseload of 206,995 conflict-damaged units; and the\n            2006 caseload o f 23,398 that need to be repaired. The\n            houses to be rebuilt under the parent project, European\n            Commission parallel-financing and supplemental IDA funds\n            covers 18 percent of the original caseload. The houses to be\n            reconstructed will be distributed across the eight districts\n            in proportion to the incidence of conflict-damage. The most\n            vulnerable households will be identified. The first tranche\n            of Euros 5.8 million in European Commission resources\n            currently supports the reconstruction of 3,514 houses under\n            the parent project. The second tranche of Euros 9.8 million\n            will support the reconstruction of 4,900 houses to\n            complement the IDA additional financing. The 13,615 houses\n            to be covered under IDA and the 7,742 to be rebuilt under\n            the second tranche of the European Commission\n            parallel-financing add up to a total of 21,357 houses."}, "docdt": "2008-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
