                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         NEHRP would facilitate the reconstruction of 31,200 houses in the North East over a four-year period through the provision of housing support cash grants. In
                         doing so, it would support the return of displaced populations in the North East and the regularization of land title to targeted beneficiaries. It would contribute
                         to the training of skilled construction workers, consequently allowing the resumption of economic activity in the war-devastated region through increased
                         construction activity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         NEHRP has been performing satisfactorily since the start. However, there has been a decline in the performance of the project during phase 5 of the construction. The main reason
                         for this is the lack of adequate attention to management of the project, when project needs most attention for phase 5. There has been a frequent turnover of senior and technical

                         the field level is resulting in less than satisfactory standard of construction. Ratio of house per Engineer is about 1,800 and that for Technical Officers is close to 200 which are both
                         very high. There have been lapses in enforcing the size limit of 550 Sq feet for a core house as agreed in the past.

                         There was a one day review of the NEHRP in October 3, 2011 when the team was in Colombo followed by a field visit by World Bank Consultant to the Northern areas during
                         November 28-December 2, 2011. Less than one month is left before project closing and there are 1,618 houses still under various phases of construction, for which funds yet to be
                         paid to the beneficiaries and disbursement made. These houses are predominantly in the North (Jaffna, Killinochchi and Mullatihivu Districts) and in difficult areas where people were
                         resettled recently. As they resettled the beneficiaries were identified, evaluated and selected. This was one of the reasons behind delay in completion of the phase 5. These
                         beneficiaries are particularly more vulnerable, many are with special needs and with a high concentration of women headed households. Difficulties in sourcing material and labor
                         initially are added factors to the slow progress of the housing in the North. It is unlikely that all of these beneficiary families complete their houses before project closing date. An
                         estimated 400 houses are likely to remain incomplete before project is closed. As project approaches closure, it is important that special attention is given to the beneficiaries of the
                         project; especially the most vulnerable and help them complete their houses to receive full benefit of the project.

                         As of November 28, 2011, out of 50,091 target number of houses under the project, a total of 48,049 houses (96%) have been completed. A total of 424 houses that started
                         construction in previous phases and recipients of the housing grant did not complete their houses; and it is assessed by the NEHRU that they never will. A total of Rs. 60.22 million
                         was given to these families. The team asked NEHRU to prepare a specific report on these cases to assess whether the payments were eligible expenditures at the time of selection
                         for housing grants and whether leaving these houses incomplete was acceptable in terms of social or conflict related reasons. Their report was submitted and it indicates poverty,
                         vulnerability and other social reasons as the main factors contributing towards the incompletion of these houses.

                         At the wrap up meeting with the Ministry of Economic Development, it was decided not to commence consultancies for third party technical audit and social impact assessment due to
                         shortage of the funds. The Mission indicated that it is important to make sure that balance houses are completed and that Government make arrangements to source funds to
                         complete the houses under construction after project closure.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Implementing Agency to scale up technical supervision of the housing to improve quality of the houses to acceptable standard, enforce the size limit of 550 sq feet core house as
                         agreed under the project to make sure that houses are completed and beneficiaries do not face financial burden of having to complete bigger houses, and prepare a Defect List of
                         houses completed and work with respective beneficiaries to rectify the defects. As of November 28, 2011, out of 50,091 target houses under the project, a total of 48,049 houses
                         (96%) have been completed. There are 1,618 houses under construction and it is unlikely that all these houses are completed by the project closing date. The most of these
                         incomplete houses are in Kilinochchi, Jaffna and Mulativu districts where beneficiaries are most vulnerable and resettled recently. The project is scheduled to close on December 31,
                         2011 and project fund are fully disbursed.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
