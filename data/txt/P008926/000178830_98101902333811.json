    while promoting essential expansion and value added by the\n            sub-sector. Related objectives are to: improve productivity\n            and product quality, lower costs to domestic consumers,\n            improve export competitiveness, induce modernization of\n            equipment, promote exports and input supply to enhance\n            export quality, and improve the institutional and policy\n            framework for the sub-sector. Major components are: (i) $75\n            million for sub-projects. (ii) $4.5 million for technical\n            assistance ($1.2 million for an extension service providing\n            training and consultancy services, and $3.3 million for a\n            supplementary training, technical assistance and technology\n            fund).
