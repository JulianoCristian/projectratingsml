In 1986, about a year after\n            approval, the Bank was reluctant to sign because it no\n            longer considered Peru creditworthy. The Bank believed that\n            the 1986 economic boom was unsustainable and had fundamental\n            reservations about the Government's economic policies.\n            However, the fragile Bank-Government relations at the time\n            made it difficult for the Bank to withdraw the loan\n            immediately. In February 1987, management decided to\n            postpone withdrawal in view of the Government's\n            expressed interest in the project. However, there were\n            indications that the Government appeared prepared to default\n            on its World Bank debt. In May 1987, Peru suspended debt\n            service payments to the Bank, causing the Bank to suspend\n            disbursements on all loans to Peru. Still, the Bank took no\n            action at that time on this relatively small project. In\n            July 1988, the Borrower and the Bank agreed that the\n            operation be withdrawn. Still, the project concept and\n            design were so well developed and the country priority and\n            commitment were so high that the project was fully\n            implemented even though the Bank funding failed to\n            materialize. The project continued to enjoy support among\n            the Government and is expected to make a significant\n            contribution to institution building and human capital\n            development in the energy sector. The main lessons learned\n            from the preparation and appraisal of this project were the\n            importance of: (i) finding support at the highest Government\n            level to ensure the acceptance and success of a project;\n            (ii) developing a close working relationship with industry,\n            and ensuring its participation in the benefits of the\n            project; (iii) charging fees for the services provided; and\n            (iv) setting up a supervisory institution that is not part\n            of the Government, so as to avoid the exigencies of bureaucracy."}, "docdt": "1993-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
