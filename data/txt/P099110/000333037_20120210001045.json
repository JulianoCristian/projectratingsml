 outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project showed the value of\n            incorporating preparedness and Disaster Risk Management\n            (DRM) related elements in a recovery and reconstruction\n            efforts. Not only did the project focus on reconstruction\n            and livelihoods support, but also supported creation of a\n            culture of preparedness in the earthquake affected areas\n            that were later replicated in the entire country.\n            Construction of more earthquake resistant houses and roll\n            out of DRM trainings are among two of the tangible\n            achievements in the aftermath of the disaster. A robust\n            Grievance Redressal Mechanisms (GRM) was designed into the\n            project to ensure that any grievances were recorded,\n            compiled and acted upon in a seamless manner without wasting\n            time. The GRM enhanced accountability by providing the\n            beneficiaries with a framework through which to resolve\n            their complaints. The houses reconstructed under the project\n            needed to comply with very strict construction standards to\n            make them resilient to the impacts of future earthquakes. To\n            ensure adherence to the minimum standards, a robust\n            framework in the form of a Non-Compliance Referral and\n            Response System (NCRRS) was provided. This system was\n            established at the grass root level in place to identify,\n            document, analyze and resolve issues of non-compliance\n            leading to higher levels of compliance in problematic areas.\n            This enabled the project to cover a greater proportion of\n            beneficiaries which might not have been able to benefit from\n            the project due to non-compliance with the standards of reconstruction."}, "docdt": "2011-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
