objectives of the Earthquake\n            Emergency Recovery Credit Project for Pakistan are: (i) to\n            reduce the immediate suffering resulting from the effects of\n            the earthquake and restore livelihoods destroyed by the\n            earthquake; (ii) to restore basic services to the affected\n            population and rebuild public infrastructure; and (iii) to\n            start the recovery and reconstruction process. The\n            additional financing and restructuring will support the\n            Government of Pakistan (GoP) efforts to respond to the loss\n            of life and destruction wrought by the recent floods,\n            helping to finance some of the critical imports necessitated\n            by the disaster. The credit is part of the first phase of\n            the World Bank's strategy to assist in the floods\n            recovery in Pakistan, helping to ensure the availability of\n            adequate fuel supplies essential for relieving suffering and\n            beginning the restoration of the productive capacity of the\n            economy. The financing will cover expenditures incurred by\n            the GoP on motor gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel imports\n            needed for recovery efforts, which will be determined on the\n            basis of import Bills of Lading."}, "docdt": "2010-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
