In\n            Pakistan, the earthquake left widespread destruction,\n            killing and injuring people, leaving 2.8 million people\n            displaced. Pakistan-administered Kashmir, known as Azad\n            Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and the eastern Districts of the\n            North West Frontier Province (NWFP) were dealt the most\n            serious blow and have suffered extensive damage to economic\n            assets, and infrastructure, with social service delivery,\n            governance, commerce and communications either debilitated,\n            or destroyed. This Earthquake Emergency Recovery Credit\n            (ERC) Project will support emergency recovery efforts over a\n            three year period, to mitigate the negative impact of the\n            earthquake, and restore livelihoods, rebuild houses,\n            purchase critical imports, and strengthen capacity for\n            implementation and hazard risk management. The housing\n            component will support the Government's\n            homeowner-driven housing reconstruction program that was\n            recently launched through: housing grants for reconstruction\n            with new seismic resistant core units, and the restoration\n            of damaged homes to seismically acceptable standards; and,\n            technical assistance and capacity building to support the\n            Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority\n            (ERRA), and provincial and local governments in overall\n            project management, reporting, monitoring and evaluation.\n            The strategy for the livelihood component is geared towards\n            the dual objectives of protecting the most vulnerable\n            households in the short-term, through cash grants, and\n            rejuvenating economic activity by reviving small businesses\n            and replacing assets lost in agriculture and livestock. The\n            import financing component will reimburse funds on the basis\n            of expenditures incurred by the Government on\n            reconstruction-related imports, which will be determined on\n            the basis of import Bills of Entry, and will provide foreign\n            exchange for private sector imports. The activities financed\n            under the capacity building component include: a) provision\n            of human resources and consultancy inputs at the federal,\n            provincial, and district levels; b) continuous social impact\n            assessments, and third party evaluations; c) design and\n            delivery of training programs on financial management, and\n            streamlined implementation processes; d) provision of\n            information technology connectivity, and the establishment\n            and/or improvement of management information systems (MIS);\n            and, e) facilities upgrade, including infrastructure, office\n            supplies and needed vehicles; and, development of a\n            communications strategy."}, "docdt": "2005-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
