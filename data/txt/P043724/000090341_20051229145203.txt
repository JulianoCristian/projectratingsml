3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The Project Development Objective was to generate and stimulate sustainable rural employment in poor
rural areas of northwest Algeria.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The original objectives were not revised.


3.3 Original Components:

The project had the following components (all amounts in this section reflect total costs at project
effectiveness and include physical and price contingencies. They do not reflect the revised costs as a result
of further budget reallocation and the withdrawal of part of the loan towards the end of the project):

A. Erosion Control Measures (US$ 59.6 million) to be implemented through labor-intensive techniques
and involving activities such as construction of bench terraces, reforestation, stabilization of river banks in
order to protect the natural resource base, prevent floods and safeguard the environment.

B. Agricultural Development (US$ 58.0 million) to create income generating assets including land
improvement, establishment of windbreaks, planting of fruit trees and grapevine and construction and
restoration of rural roads.

C. Water Resource Mobilization (US$ 1.8 million) for constructing small hill dams, sinking wells and
managing springs for drinking water.

D. Promotion of Rural Women (US$ 0.7 million) for helping women develop income generating activities
such as small vegetable gardens, beekeeping and poultry production and handicraft.

E. Institutional Development (US$ 2.7 million) to fund vehicles, equipment and the training of field-staff
needed by the implementing agency to execute the project.

F. Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 0.4 million) to monitor project performance and derive lessons for
project adjustment and development.

  Unallocated (US$0.5 million).

3.4 Revised Components:

The project's components were not revised. However, the scale of some activities changed (a) to better
adjust to demand by local communities; and (b) to respond to government request to expand project to
additional regions (more details are provided in Section 4.2 below).


3.5 Quality at Entry:

Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory. The project was in line with the 1994 Government's policy which
emphasized urgent attention to rural unemployment and poverty; and with the 1996 World Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) which supported Government's policies. The project helped implement
Government's strategy of giving priority (a) to labor-intensive rather than capital-intensive works, (b) to
small scale investments accessible to small entrepreneurs, and (c) to a participatory rather than a top-down

approach towards rural communities calling for beneficiaries' participation in project design in order to
achieve greater local relevance and for project investments' sustainability.

This large project for financing dispersed and often remote small rural works was originally expected by
the Borrower to be implemented over 3 years. Given the political and institutional situation in Algeria at the
time of preparation, the Bank, as stated in the QAG's Quality of Supervision Assessment (Oct. 31, 2002),
compromised over this unrealistic timeframe on the understanding that there would be a mid-term review at
the end of the first year of implementation. As indicated explicitly in the project documents, this mid-term
review was to have the authority to restructure the project to a five-year program. A longer project
implementation period could have been decided up-front.

The risks were correctly identified and suitable mitigation measures included. The project meant to address
a post-conflict situation and help communities return to their homes and re-establish their livelihood.
Nobody, however, expected the armed conflict and insecurity to last. In addition, many rural communities
were returning to their villages after ten years of civil unrest and community mobilization could not
commence as quickly as planned. Also, the project's participatory approach took longer than anticipated to
instill and labor-intensive works methods required longer execution time. It could be argued that the project
was not fully ready for implementation but, given the post conflict situation mentioned above and the
government financial constraints, readiness could not have been possible prior to project start and there was
no point of delaying the starting date for such reasons. As a matter of fact, the project succeeded in
achieving early and close coordination between government, private sector agencies and the beneficiaries;
and in providing up-front training to project staff prior to effectiveness. Subsequently, the project had to be
flexible and constantly adapt to the situation and adjust its targets accordingly. It successfully responded to
local needs and opportunities as they arose (see also Section 4, Achievement of Objective and Outputs
below).


4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The project outcome is rated Satisfactory. The project succeeded in generating and stimulating sustainable
rural employment in the poor rural areas in northwest Algeria. Through the adoption of labor-intensive
techniques, the Project financed 9.8 million person-days of salary representing the equivalent of about
41,000 person-years, slightly over the 40,000 targeted at appraisal. This mainly benefited unemployed and
underemployed rural youth and generated a cash income of some DA 3.4 billion (US$ 46 million).
In addition, The 239 small and some medium-sized enterprises set up to carry out civil works were
awarded three quarters of the total value of all the contracts and provided full time employment to about
1,100 people annually.

In terms of rural employment sustainability, several investments made under the project contributed to
achieve this objective:

l Erosion Control Measures involved investments that will require operation and/or maintenance
    activities over a long-term : this is the case for earth and stone structures and for forest trees
    plantations;
l Agricultural Development investments created under the project generated new long-term employment
    for about 30,000 farmers (7.4 person-days/ha). Returns from the new (fruit tree) crops added DA
    300,000/year (US$4,167) in terms of net profit plus salaries paid to hired labor; and
l the Promotion of Rural Women component enabled women to find long-term employment opportunities
    and incomes through the small scale production units created under this project, especially beekeeping



                                                     - 3 -

    and poultry units. Beekeeping employs about 300 person-years and yields incomes of DA 130,000/year
    from a unit of five beehives.

The project achieved many more outcomes beyond the objective of employment creation:

l project-financed roads (489 km of new roads and 602 km rehabilitated roads) facilitated farming and
    trade, improved local incomes and reduced the economic and social isolation of the rural communities;
l water delivery points (springs, wells and others) established under the project immensely improved
    local living conditions;
l environmental benefits achieved include increase of vegetative cover in the project area by over 30,000
    ha which helped reduce soil erosion. Reduction of dam sedimentation rates at 12 test stations in the
    project area averaged 88%, compared to the 55% targeted at appraisal;
l the project helped rejuvenate economic life in areas which had been abandoned in ten years of civil
    strife; and
l the project taught Forestry Department staff to operate as extension agents who worked with the
    communities on development, rather than as `policemen' guarding the forests.

4.2 Outputs by components:


During implementation, the project faced major challenges:

l the first mid-term review took place in October 1998, during which: (i) the project closing date was
    extended to March, 31, 2003 in view of persistent drought and continued unrest during the first year;
    (ii) new project sites within the same regions were added; and (iii) the targeted volumes for some
    activities were adjusted to reflect the demand;
l a second mid-term review took place in November 2000 when the main issue was what to do with the
    savings arising from the local currency depreciation and reduced costs achieved by contracting
    compared with the force account norms used at appraisal. The borrower considered the project to be
    highly successful and proposed using the savings to expand the project into two neighboring provinces.
    As a result, (i) two new provinces (Relizane and Mostaganem) were added; (ii) the project closing date
    was extended to March 2005 to provide sufficient time for completion of the activities in the new
    provinces. Activities were to be kept simple by focusing on erosion control and agricultural
    development to the exclusion of works such as hill dams that would have required major preparation
    work; and
l a seventh province, Oran was added in 2003 following pressing local community demands and
    a special request from the country's President, bringing the total number of communes from
    67 to 139.

Despite these challenges the outputs for all components were satisfactory.

A. Erosion Control (US$ 50.52 million, rated Satisfactory). Besides the initial four sub-components
(Reforestation, Stabilization of river banks, Construction of bench terraces and Construction of flood
control structures), a fifth sub-component (Silvicultural works on public lands) was included, following the
improvement of the security situation. The achievements for each of these sub-components are as follows:




                                                     - 4 -

Reforestation: The original target of 23,475 ha was almost halved to 14,352 ha for multiple reasons: a
severe drought in the early project years, the limited capacity of the sole public reforestation agency in
initial years, procurement delays, difficulty in finding suitable public lands for the program and lack of
interest among private landowners who preferred fruit tree plantations to forest plantations. The 14,210 ha
achieved by project completion represented 61% of the initial target but 99% of the revised target. The
quality of the work was satisfactory with a seedling survival rate of over 80%.

River-bank stabilization: a total of 3,758 ha of river banks were treated, representing 140% of the initial
target and 108% of the revised target.

Restoration of bench terraces: 7,370 ha were achieved, representing 35% of the initial target and 101% of
the revised target. Fodder species planted on some of the terraces were an added benefit to the pastoralists.

Construction of flood control structures: Over one million m³ of stone work was accomplished,
representing over 330% the initial target and 102% of the revised target. This was due to increased local
demand and the quick uptake by private contractors.

Silvicultural works: This consisted mainly of tree pruning and cleaning of underbrush in forests which had
been abandoned for a decade due to the armed conflict. Though not initially included in the project, 5,796
ha were treated, which made these forests again accessible for animal grazing and community use.

B. Agricultural Development (US$ 53.24 million, rated Satisfactory). This component included land
improvement, the establishment of windbreaks, the plantation of fruit trees and grapevine and the
construction and restoration of rural roads.

Land improvement. Local demand for this program was initially weak but improved after the project
reduced labor contribution from beneficiaries from 50% to a more realistic 30% due to soil conditions not
suitable for manual work, calling for the occasional use of machinery . A total of 12,529 ha were
completed, representing 52% of the initial target or 100% of the revised target.

Establishment of windbreaks. This activity became very popular with the rapid expansion of fruit tree
crops, resulting in the creation of 1,836 km of windbreaks by project completion, which represented
16,691% of the original target of 11 km.

Fruit tree and grapevine plantations faced, initially, weak demand because of the prolonged droughts and
the limited availability of quality seedlings but picked up from the third project year as confidence grew and
more private enterprises got involved. From year 2000, the National Program for Rural Development and
Agriculture (PNDRA) financed equipment and materials for plantation establishment. In total, 46,046 ha
were planted to fruit trees (162% of the initial target, 102% of the revised target). An additional 6,034 ha
was planted to grapevines, more than five times the initial target. More than three quarters of the total area
planted with fruit trees and grapevine replaced previous cereal cultivation which had low yields and low
value and which had made the area more prone to soil erosion.

Rural Road Construction and Restoration. These activities achieved, with 489 km and 602 km
respectively, 119% and 107% of appraisal targets. Proper environmental assessments were carried out and
the required mitigation measures were prescribed and carried out.


C. Small Scale Water Resource Mobilization (US$ 2.54 million, rated Satisfactory). This component
comprised the construction of small hill dams, wells and springs to provide water for human and animal
consumption and madjens (traditional rain-water collection systems) for complementary irrigation.

Dams. Twelve dams were planned at appraisal. Substantial delays occurred over the conduct of feasibility



                                                      - 5 -

and environmental impact studies due to security issues and Government's lack of familiarity with the
Bank's environmental guidelines. In addition these studies led to the elimination of ten dam sites for
technical or environmental reasons. Given the long time required to execute such studies and the extreme
caution required in dam building, it was decide not to consider new sites and to downsize this activity. The
two dams constructed have each a capacity of roughly 200,000 m³. Water Users Associations (WUA)
have been successfully set up for their management, and sixty WUA members have been trained in
operation and maintenance.

Wells. Of the 26 wells planned at appraisal, only five were sunk. The shortfall was due to drought in the
projected sites which caused a drastic drop in the water table; difficulty in estimating its depth made it too
risky for local enterprises to bid for these works.

Springs and Madjens (traditional rain water collection systems) were successfully established. In total, 74
springs, representing 140% of appraisal targets were managed. Madjens were not planned at appraisal but
the project responded to local demand and established 150 by project completion. Over 9,000 people are
benefiting from these water delivery points.

The Springs and Madjens compensated for the reduction in the number of dams and wells and explain the
overall "Satisfactory" rating given to this component.


D. Promotion of Rural Women (US$ 2.00 million at completion, rated Satisfactory) comprised support
for gardening, embroidery, poultry, farming, and Beekeeping.

Gardening was unfortunately abandoned due to water scarcity caused by drought in the initial project
    years.

Embroidery was found of marginal financial viability and was abandoned while Weaving achieved 67% of
    the original target mainly because of short supply of machines and high cost of raw materials.

Poultry farming was successful, with a 99% achievement of the original target.

Beekeeping, despite start-up problems- proved very profitable and highly-demanded, and 1,843 units were
    put into production, representing 293% of the initial target.


E. Institutional Development (US$ 2.10 million at completion, rated Satisfactory).

Vehicles and Equipment. All the 14 vehicles, 132 motorcycles and office computer, equipment and
materials were acquired and distributed to the Provincial Forestry Departments and the PMU as planned at
appraisal.

Training. Practical training in the use of participatory approaches was given in Italy as well as in France
and in Algeria. Twenty seven staff members were trained in participatory approaches and, in turn, trained
203 other people (mostly DGF staff). Eighty staff were trained in France and Algeria in project
management and 46 in technical matters (including restoration of mountainous lands). This training was
well appreciated and resulted in a much more progressive attitude by the trainees towards their work and
towards the local communities (see also section 4.5).

F. Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 0.4 million at completion, rated Satisfactory).

To cope with the dire security situation and the limited M&E capacity of the implementing agency, M&E
was contracted out to a national consulting firm based in western Algeria, closer to the project sites and to
the Forestry Department provincial offices than the PMU, located at headquarters in the capital city. The
firm collected and regularly provided project information, identified implementation problems and proposed
solutions to the Project Management Unit and to the Bank. The firm satisfactorily complemented the work
of Bank supervision missions whose movements were often restricted by the security situation - an
approach which QAG commended as a model for other Bank operations implemented under conflict
conditions (DSA5 of Oct. 2002). Data collection was largely focused on the project outputs and on the
employment creation outcomes. Though the consultant firm was not asked to assess other impacts such as
changes in rural household income and employment generated through indirect and secondary effects of
increased economic activity, the information collected through a number of field surveys contributed useful
qualitative data on the additional project benefits realized.

Although the decision of charging an outside agency for the responsibility of the M&E system was sound
and produced fully satisfactory results, the question remains whether, under normal conditions, the M&E
system should not be integrated within the PMU as a key decision making tool. With such in-house
capacity, the implementing agency might have been better equipped to respond and react faster to project's
need for adjustments.


4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) calculation takes into account the following main benefits: (i)
increase in volume of water available for farm use and consumption, arising from reduced sedimentation
and water retention; (ii) increased production of valuable fruit crops (apples, pears, apricots, olives,
almonds, grapes, etc.); and (iii) income-generation from off-farm enterprises such as beekeeping.
As at appraisal, unskilled labor was valued at one third of its financial cost to account for severe
unemployment and water was valued at 150% of its financial price to account for subsidies. The market
prices for agricultural products were deemed to be good proxies of their economic value.

The ERR calculated at completion reaches 23%, compared to 27% estimated at appraisal. This is mainly
due to the substantially higher investment costs for plantations, delays in starting up several project
activities, resulting in delays in achieving the benefits, and the need for irrigation for tree crops due to the
drought. The ERR is conservative as it does not include other benefits, such as those from institutional
development as well as from the construction and restoration of rural roads. The sensitivity analysis shows
that the ERR would still be around 12% should there be a 30% overall decline in prices or in yields.


4.4 Financial rate of return:

The Financial Rate of Return (FRR) for the income-generating activities (fruit tree and grapevine
plantations and beekeeping) shows a weighted FRR of 21%. Hardy tree crops (such as olive and almond
trees) which can grow without irrigation are more viable in the long-term (FRR=73% for almond trees)
than the tree crops that must rely on irrigation (FRR=8% for apple trees); the latter are also very sensitive
to price decreases due to popular uptake and local supply. Beekeeping is a financially viable activity; one
apiary of five beehives generates more than US$ 1,000 a year, as much value-added as one hectare of
hardy tree plantation at full development.




                                                      - 7 -

Of concern are the incentives and subsidies provided by both the REP and PNDAR which have led some of
the farmers to adopt crops or cropping techniques that have a lesser or no comparative advantage. For
example, without subsidies, the FRR for irrigated apple tree plantations drops to -1%.


4.5 Institutional development impact:

This impact is rated Satisfactory. The project transformed the Forestry Department, at least in the project
area, from a paramilitary organization to a development agency, working together with the local
communities and earning their respect and trust. The project deferred to the local preference to work
through existing traditional grassroots organizations and leaders, rather than to set up the new village
committees (Comités de village) that had been suggested in the project design. Inspired by this project,
other national programs in integrated rural development such as the PNDAR and PPDR have also adopted
similar participatory approaches.

From having no previous experience in implementing externally co-financed development projects and in
dealing with the private sector, Forestry Department provincial offices in the project area have since learnt
to handle internationally-recognized procurement procedures and to deal with private contractors. The
overall efficiency of the organization, as well as the effectiveness of their field operations has increased.

Other positive institutional impacts include the establishment of and experience gained by private
contractors, who continue to operate after the project period on contracts awarded through projects such as
the PNDAR and PPDR.


5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

These factors include the severe drought during the first three years of project implementation as well as the
armed conflicts and the resulting insecurity in northwest Algeria.


5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Factors that slowed down project implementation at the initial stage were the shortage of Government
counterpart funds in the early project years, delays over procurement at the provincial level, and
bottlenecks caused by weak management in one of the government provincial bank through which project
funds were channeled. These issues were later resolved.


5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

Staff changes in the Project Management Unit (PMU) temporarily affected the project's financial
monitoring but this was later corrected and had no final negative impact on project implementation.


5.4 Costs and financing:

At appraisal, the total project cost was estimated at US$ 123.6 million; of this, US$89 (72%) was to be
financed by the Bank, US$15.9 (13%) by the Government and US$ 18.7 (15%) by the beneficiaries.
The actual project cost is US$ 110.8 million divided as follows: the Bank US$ 81.0 million (73%); the
Government US$ 19.58 million (18%); and the beneficiaries US$ 10.22 million (9%). Bank's


                                                      - 8 -

disbursements were 91% of the original allocation due to the cancellation of US$ 8.0 million in 2004 and
100% of the revised allocation. Government's disbursements were 123.1% of appraisal estimates.
Beneficiaries' contribution was around half (54.7%) the initial target because (a) the unit cost of local labor
were lower than those anticipated at appraisal as the latter were based on rates used by public works
projects relying on force account; and (b) some of the land management work had to be done mechanically
due to very difficult soil conditions. On the other hand, the quantity of works (particularly for erosion/flood
control measures) was many times the appraisal estimates, which helps explain why the overall short-term
objective of direct employment was achieved despite the drop in the beneficiaries contribution rate.
Beneficiaries' labor contribution as well as implementation by private enterprises led to a drastic reduction
of implementation unit costs. The project also achieved considerable foreign exchange savings with the
devaluation of the local currency.


6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

In October 2002, the Quality of Supervision Assessment panel (QSA5) reported that it was confident that
the operation's results will be sustainable in the longer term and that, despite imperfect legal and
administrative frameworks for decentralized, demand-driven developments, the panel agrees that the
attitudinal changes achieved in the forestry and agricultural services are irreversible. The project has in
reality become part of a wider process of participatory development that has powerful champions, both in
the Cabinet and at high levels of the administration, again both in the capital and in the provinces.
Sustainability would nonetheless be even more likely if rural communities were given a greater role in
decision-making, and if the legal and administrative frameworks were amended to foster decentralized
development.

Project sustainability is rated as Likely. The project has been successful in creating and maintaining
investments in partnership with private enterprise and local beneficiaries in an area that has extended
beyond original the original targets - from 4 to 7 provinces and from 67 to 179 communes. Farmers, now
convinced of the importance of upstream erosion control, reforestation and water management, willingly
help to protect and repair the project investments. Highly motivated by the income from their new cash
crops (compared to previous low returns from traditional cereal crops) and off-farm enterprises, they now
have the means to invest in further production. Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD)
has directed that its agencies continue to support farmers in the project area, in order to consolidate the
benefits achieved during the project. Government received support from the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) to undertake studies on agro-processing/marketing pilot operations (
agri-marchés) to help market local agricultural produce.

Government has now included project activities such as erosion control, agricultural development, water
resource mobilization and programs for rural women as regular programs in the PPDR and the National
Plan for Agricultural and Rural Development (PNDAR). The participatory approach as well as
decentralization, de-concentration and privatization are models which are now integral to Algeria's national
agricultural development programs. The model of sustainable employment generation and asset creation
successfully tested under the project, even in situations of continuing unrest, will be pursued by
Government in other economically sensitive parts of the country.

There are, inevitably, some risks for continued sustainability. The strong interaction between the
public and private agencies might be less coordinated after the project closure. More conservative
bureaucrats might tend to revert to old top-down approaches and not continue the pace of decentralization
promoted by the project, especially if they are pressed to do more in a shorter period as a result of



                                                     - 9 -

availability of abundant financial resources. The new Water Users Associations may not fully discharge
the functions that they have been trained to undertake.       These concerns have been flagged to the
Government and will continue to merit attention maintain high sustainability in the post-project period.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

Government will expand the approaches successfully demonstrated through the project to additional areas.
A Second Rural Employment Project (REP-II) will cover several new provinces (wilayate) in the central
part of Algeria. To ensure a smooth transition to regular operations, the Project Management Unit (PMU)
of the REP will oversee both the REP-II as well as monitor follow-up actions in the REP project area. The
Forestry Department will continue to operate the reforestation and soil erosion control programs and the
relevant Agricultural Services Departments (DAS) will continue to provide support to the farmers already
covered by the REP as part of their regular operations, hence internalizing and mainstreaming the work
conducted under the REP.


7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Bank performance was Satisfactory. Identification and preparation were completed within four months.
The Bank mobilized a PHRD grant to assist project formulation and pre-project training of DGF staff in
project management and the use of participatory approaches.        To facilitate disbursements, a special
account was set up with 90 days' worth of fund advance.          When the intended participation of the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) did not materialize for co-funding the project, the
Bank increased its funding to make up the difference.

During project implementation, the Bank was responsive to the difficult implementation situation and
consulted closely with Government and stakeholders at national and local level to retain flexibility, given
the progress on the ground and to make appropriate adjustments as needed.


7.2 Supervision:

Consistent with QAG's quality of supervision evaluation in October 2002, Bank supervision is considered
Satisfactory. High insecurity up to Year 2000 prevented the fielding of supervision missions and required
that the missions that finally went were kept small. Nonetheless, from late 2000 to 2005, the Bank
conducted sixteen supervision missions and two mid-term reviews and included relevant specialists as
needed. This effective supervision led to the carrying out of two timely extensions. The success of
mitigation measures implemented as a result of EIAs done on the hill dams was due to the close attention of
the Bank. The Bank worked closely with the PMU and its external M&E consultant to ensure that field
data were transmitted in a timely manner to the PMU and used effectively to help management
decision-making. Problems with procurement and financial management were systematically raised by the
Bank through project supervision. The Bank was pragmatic and flexible in working with Government to
modify the implementation schedules when warranted by field conditions.


7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Based on the above considerations, the overall Bank performance is considered Satisfactory.




                                                   - 10 -

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

The Borrower's performance at preparation was Satisfactory. The Government was strongly committed to
the project, recognized the need for advance work including pre-project training and worked with the Bank
to secure a PHRD grant for the purpose. The Government ensured that by appraisal, it had appointed the
PMU staff as well as Provincial Forestry Coordinators. The implementing agency was actively involved in
the project design. The government also earmarked financing for the project in their public budget.


7.5 Government implementation performance:

Government's implementation performance was Satisfactory. An initial shortage of counterpart funds was
quickly dispelled once the Government's financial situation improved. Procurement and financial
management experience evolved during the project life and is benefiting the implementation of the Second
Rural Employment Project. Government has consistently given strong political and financial backing to the
project and supported implementation as well as the work of Bank supervision missions. By completion
date, the Government disbursed US$19.58 million as opposed to the US$ 15.90 million originally planned.


7.6 Implementing Agency:

The implementing agency's performance was Satisfactory. The DGF competently and effectively carried
out project works and showed flexibility in modifying activities when appropriate. The staff rapidly learnt
their new roles and evolved from being conventional foresters into development agents. Some changes in
staffing of the PMU caused some initial operational constraints, particularly in financial monitoring, but
these were later overcome.


7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

In light of the above, the Borrower's overall performance is considered Satisfactory.


8. Lessons Learned

There were several significant lessons learnt.

(a) The     has demonstrated that it is possible to address urgent issues of rural unemployment and
socioeconomic and political instability and, at the same time, create economic assets with long-term
benefits and sustainable livelihood. This was the case in this with properly-executed environmental
management and agricultural development activities. The investments were selected in such a way that
they were labor intensive and generated immediate employment; some had a positive impact on the
environment and the natural resource base that constitute the foundation for sustainable agricultural
production and growth and for safe livelihood; while other productive investments generated more
employment and generated additional incomes through the production process.

(b) To ensure willing and effective collaboration between governmental organizations, private agencies
and the local communities, it is important to involve these communities throughout           planning and
implementation, and be able to demonstrate the economic and social benefits of their involvement in the .

(c) To maximize involvement of benefiting communities, staff should be trained to work with them and
understand what it takes to make them willing participants. It is useful to include a sociologist and



                                                    - 11 -

economist in the design and implementation teams. This shows that simple, easy to manage investments
are preferred by beneficiaries and have a better chance to be sustainable beyond life. It is important to
leave the door open to non conventional investments if there is a good market for the end product.

(d) M&E and good economic analysis help authorities to make the right decisions and choices. The lesson
on M&E is that is can be outsourced and yet done well, as long as this function remains closely connected
to management and that the data generated by the M&E system are constantly and readily available to
decision makers. This is an important lesson for s in post-conflict areas, or where implementing agency is
too weak.

The Borrower and the Bank agreed to organize a workshop in 2006 to share the lessons learned under this
project with other projects and other departments and compare similar experiences.

NOTE
·       The average exchange rate during project implementation (weighted according to annual costs) was
        US$ 1 = DA 73.71, compared to DA 58.91 at appraisal.
·       The main reasons for the shortfall of 90% is the cancellation of US$8.0 million in 2004 and the
        devaluation of the DA. (Had the exchange rate at appraisal been maintained, total project
        expenditure would have been the equivalent of US$ 138.4 or 112% of appraisal allocation.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

Financial analysis

Project's income generating activities that can be subject to financial analysis include: fruit tree plantations,
viticulture, and, to a less extent, apiculture. Given the large number of fruit tree species planted, it was
decided to group them in five categories: (a) the fully irrigated species (apple trees, pear tree, etc.); (b) the
partially irrigated species (apricot, plum, peach, etc.); (c) the almond-trees; (d) the olive-trees; and (e) the
grape wine. For each group, specific investment and operating costs, and returns have been estimated
through beneficiary assessments and technician evaluation. Selling prices represent either on-farm prices,
or wholesale market prices, less transportation costs. Initial investment costs for plantations were borne by
both the project and the beneficiaries (50% of labor costs for planting). For the irrigated species, the initial
investment costs were supported by the PNDA which financed in most of the cases 100% of infrastructure
(water reservoir, motor-pump and drip irrigation system). The time spent by farmers and their employees in
the farm for the establishment and maintenance of the plantation and for production harvesting was valued
on the basis of the average wage (500 DA/day). Water was valued at a flat rate of (17 DA/m3), as
indicated by ARNH during the assessment of PER2 (in 2002), and updated according to the inflation rate.

It was found that, in the absence of subsidies from both the project and the PNDA, net income would be
negligible for irrigated species, poor for grapevine, and substantial in the other cases. With subsidies, the
financial IRR varies from 8% for the apple trees to more than 70% for the almond-trees. The weighted IRR
average rate is around 21%. The analysis confirms that rustic species which do not require irrigation are
more cost-effective on the long run than irrigated species. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates that
irrigated species are very sensitive to price or productivity decrease. The profitability of rustic species is on
the other hand less sensitive to prices fluctuation. Apiculture is a high income generating activity as 5
beehives provide comparable income with an acre of plantation.

Economic Analysis

Price and economic costs

Based on the assumptions made during the project appraisal (and confirmed in the appraisal of PER2), the
unskilled labor used for works and plantations have been valued at 1/3 of its cost, given the high
unemployment rate in the area. Mechanical works and transportation costs have been valued at 80% of
their cost before taxes (or at 68% of their cost with taxes). Vehicles have been valued at 50% of their cost
including taxes, as in the appraisal, and inputs at 85% (compared to 70% during appraisal).

As far as benefits are concerned, fruits have been valued at their on-farm financial price, since no distortion
has been noticed. Water has been valued at 26 DA/m3 (150% of its financial price), on the basis of the
average production cost (24 DA/m3) calculated during the preparation of PER 2, and adjusted based on the
actual the inflation rate. The value estimated at appraisal was 16 DA/m3). The lost opportunity in cereal
production which has been replaced by arboriculture in most of the cases, was considered nil, given the
history of non profitability of traditional cereal culture in the project area. The cereal productivity
represents 400 Kg/ha in average, and the production barely covers the cost of labor. The sensitivity
analysis confirm that results are unchanged if cereal culture is taken into consideration.

Economic profitability of fruit trees and vineyard plantations

Agricultural development initiatives on private lands (plantations, preceded in 27% of cases by land
development, and followed in 4% of cases by windbreak plantations) have been subjected to a detailed
economic analysis, in order to measure their economic efficiency. The economic investment cost in
plantations includes, apart from the cost supported by both the project and the beneficiaries, the investment
cost of irrigation supposedly borne by PNDA.

This gives an average ERR of 36% (compared to 39% estimate at appraisal) with the lowest ERR (15%)
for apple trees and other irrigated species and the highest ERR for almond trees (65%). Sensitivity to price
and yields variation is higher for irrigated species than for the others. The comparison of economic and
financial results give interesting indications on the impact of subsidies on arboriculture: irrigated fruit tree
plantations which have the lowest ERR and are the most sensitive to price and yields fluctuations, are the
most subsidized -eight times higher than the other species that are better adapted to mountain arboriculture.
Due to those subsidies, the financial profitability of irrigated fruit tree plantations is artificially inflated,

and has led many farmers to opt for irrigated plantations as long as water resources were available. The
sustainability of these plantations remains questionable (a) due to the high cost associated to the renewal,
after a few years, of irrigation equipment that producers would have to bear (at their own expense) and (b)
due to the lack of competitiveness of that production, compared to fruit production in plains with denser
and more productive plantations or to imported fruits. These conclusions call for a better targeting, in the
future, of subsidies towards species presenting better economic returns and more sustainability.

Overall analysis

Economic Benefits

Project activities generating measurable economic benefits are mainly: forestry works, agricultural land
management, development and management of water sources (springs, wells etc.) and irrigation, fruit tree
planting, windbreaks, rehabilitation and upgrading of rural roads;, and apiculture. Other activities such as
those pertaining to institutional development cannot be analyzed on the basis cost-benefits scheme due to
the lack of measurable outcomes and have not be considered for such exercise at appraisal.

The increase of water resources generated by anti-erosion actions and plantations is calculated on the basis
of the analysis of their impact on erosion carried out by the project's M&E unit. On the basis of an average
annual erosion level of 12 m3 per ha prevailing in the area, mechanical corrections (flood control
corrections) are expected to have reduced erosion by 91% and biological corrections and all other initiatives
by 7%, based on measurements carried-out through an erosion monitoring protocol installed in the project
area. The decrease in the volume of silt deposited in the water reservoirs and dams corresponds to an
increase of water in those reservoirs in nearly equivalent volume (respectively 10.92 m3 and 10.44 m3 per
ha. Flood control corrections are converted into hectares on the basis of 1 m3 = 0.1 ha. These gains, valued
at the economic price of water, are taken into account conservatively, i.e. at 50% of their calculated value.
For the hill dams, the annual water resource is estimated at 80% of the useful capacity of the two dams
(560.000 m3).

Plantations made on public lands (reforestation, terraces, river banks) are principally meant for
conservation rather than logging. However, some wood will be harvested as a result of necessary thinning
and pruning operations and can provide additional incomes to the government. It is estimated that these
plantations can produce 1 m3/ha, at the price of 2.000 DA/m3, from the 16th year for the coniferous and
the 30th year for the deciduous trees.

In total, benefits generated from fruit trees and vineyards represent by far, the most important portion of
economic benefits, while benefits deriving from the increase in water resource and sale of wood remain
marginal.

Economic costs

The economic analysis takes into account the overall costs of the project (including those that do not
generate measurable benefits), including the part of investments financed by the beneficiaries or the PNDA,
after conversion of financial prices to economic prices. Project costs include original investment costs and
in the case of reforestation only, maintenance costs during the first two years after planting. For
investments on the public domain, there is a need to include maintenance costs estimated as follows, on the
basis of data indicated at appraisal:

For investments on the private domain, the cost of maintenance is supported by the beneficiaries and
deducted from the net income. For hill dams, maintenance costs, estimated at 2% per year, are also
expected to be borne by beneficiaries (but is included in the project costs).

Fiscal impact
Costs supported by the Government are those it has financed under the project and the subsequent recurrent
costs for investments on public lands. Government incomes derive from taxes levied on project costs, on
agricultural inputs for plantations future maintenance, on sale of wood from public lands, as well as from
increased amount of water resource (supposedly sold to farmers at financial price, excluding the water
coming from hill dams). On net balance the fiscal impact is positive.

The ERR is at 22.5% compared to 26.5% as appraisal estimate. The difference is mainly due to (a) the
increase in plantations investment costs, as a result of the introduction of irrigation and (b) the delays in
assets creation which cause delayed benefits). The main factors likely to influence the productivity in the
future are: i) the price of agricultural products and the production yields. It is noted that, even with there is
a 30% decrease in prices or productivity, the ERR remains high at 12%.

Additional Annex 8. Borrower/Implementing Agency Contribution

A. Summary

1.       The Rural Employment Project is operating in an economic environment characterized by: i) a
reduction in the country's financial resources due to the decline in oil the price, Algeria's primary source of
export; ii) increased unemployment, which went from 21% in 1987 to over 30% in 1998; iii) the
introduction of the IMF-recommended structural adjustment program, the negative impacts of which were
soon felt in terms of social welfare.

2.       The project is a continuation of efforts by the Algerian Government to mitigate unemployment
among disadvantaged segments of the population, and follows up on a series of multisectoral public welfare
programs based primarily on labor-intensive works designed to generate a large number of jobs,
particularly in road maintenance, forestry and water supply, as well as in the housing and agricultural
sectors.

3.       In 1997, the Algerian Government conveyed to the World Bank a loan request for partial (i.e.,
80%) financing of the project (Loan 4143-AL) proposed by the Forestry Directorate (Direction générale
des forêts, DGF) under the oversight of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR).

4.       The objective of the project is to contribute, directly and indirectly, to employment creation in
rural areas.    This contribution is to occur through physical interventions aimed at creating assets,
developing productive resources, and improving agro-ecological conditions. Over the short-term, the
project is intended to offset the inadequacy of incomes and consumption and, in order to generate
longer-term impacts, particularly on labor productivity; it has focused efforts on the creation of assets.

5.       The project components were the following:

·        Erosion Control Measures including reforestation, stabilization of river banks, and construction
of bench terraces and flood protection structures;
·        Agricultural Development, including land improvement, fruit tree and grapevine plantations,
establishment of windbreaks, and improved access for local populations through the construction and
improvement of rural roads;
·        Water Resource Mobilization through the construction of small hill dams, digging of wells and
improvement of water points;
·        Promotion of Rural Women (through agricultural and handicrafts activities); and
·        Institutional Development (training, studies and equipment).

6.       This multidisciplinary and multidimensional program is based on national policy themes in the area
of land management and works, particularly in mountainous areas, and on the Plan National de
Développement Agricole (PNDA).

7.       The approach chosen assumes the rural population's sustained involvement in, and accountability
for, the choice and implementation of project activities. This participatory approach is aimed in particular
at integrating these populations into a dynamic ensuring the sustainability of the envisaged actions.

B. Introduction

8.       The purpose of this summary of the completion report is to describe a rural development project
and to compare the results obtained to the objectives assigned at the outset.

9.       In terms of direct job creation, the objective was to create about 40,000 person-years of direct
employment. The project generated 9,813,449 days of labor, or the equivalent of 40,889 person-years, a



                                                    - 26 -

figure corresponding to 100% of the project objective.         Through the agricultural component, and
particularly the establishment of fruit orchards and vineyards, the project benefited 30,000 farmers who
can be deemed to have permanent employment on their own farms. In addition, the project provided 3,018
disadvantaged women with income-generating activities that can be considered to be permanent jobs.

10.      Regarding the creation of indirect jobs generated by the exploitation of assets, the project
increased on-farm employment by an average of 7.4 person-days per hectare. This figure corresponds to
additional employment generated from the conversion of on hectare of cereal cultivation into one hectare to
fruit tree or grapevine cultivation.

11.      In addition to the labor requirement generated during project execution, another of the project's
significant characteristics was the creation of small and medium enterprises. Most of these enterprises
were created starting at the beginning of the project. Only 1.5% of them existed before 1997. Thirty-four
percent (34%) of them emerged during the first three years of the project, and nearly 61% between 2000
and 2003. The opportunities offered by the project, and subsequently by the PNDA, were clearly very
conducive to the emergence of small private enterprises specializing in forestry-related, agricultural and
rural infrastructure works.

12.      From the standpoint of environmental impact, positive results were obtained in terms of erosion
control and protection of some villages that had previously been subject to flooding. The reduction of
erosion through the project's erosion control activities was estimated by means of an observation
mechanism set up throughout the project area. This mechanism worked by trapping the solid material
accompanying run-off from every rainfall in basins located downstream from impluviums.

13.      As for the impact on living conditions, the project provided additional income to beneficiaries
through its fruit tree and vineyard activities.

C. Main results and conclusions

14.      The National Agriculture Development Plan (PNDA), which was recently expanded to include
rural development, thereby becoming the National Plan for Agricultural and Rural Development              (
PNDAR), is based upon various programs, including the Rural Employment Project (REP). This resulted
in a variety of financing mechanisms that made it possible, on the one hand, to respond to the equally
diverse concerns of the targeted rural populations and, on the other, to ensure complementarity between
water resource mobilization activities and agricultural development. There is therefore an actual synergy
in this respect. For example, many beneficiaries of fruit tree plantations under the REP installed drip
irrigation networks in their orchards with financing from the National Fund for Agricultural Regulation and
Development (FNRDA).

15.      Project impacts are many and various. Studies have incontrovertibly demonstrated many positive
impacts in terms of socio-economic conditions and natural resource protection.

Social welfare impact

16.      It was noted that small farming operations, long mired in       archaic management and left to
themselves without outreach or technical support, gained under the REP an awareness of new ways to work
the land and derive profit from their labors, as well as tangible innovations in terms of agricultural
practices. The project therefore brought new hope.

17.      One of the main factors accounting for the acceptance of the REP on the part of farmers (fellahs)
was the introduction and gradual application of the participatory approach to the implementation of
interventions. The fellahs were thus involved in the creation of orchards, the choice of species, and the
construction of small hydraulic works.




                                                   - 27 -

18.      The broad involvement of small and medium private-sector enterprises also had significant
impacts, both direct and indirect, on the generation of jobs and income, even though the jobs created were
temporary ones. The great increase in job creation through REP worksites is increasingly accompanied by
a demand for labor arising from the need for orchard maintenance and for fruit and grape harvesting.

19.      It can be confidently asserted that a real change in farmers' behaviors and ways of thinking is
now occurring. The REP has enabled beneficiaries to equip themselves, and this has led to a change in
investment behavior: e.g., refurbishment of tractor motors and the purchase of irrigation equipment with
initial profits from fruit harvests. The self-financing of maintenance is an indication of the economic
profitability of investments beginning in the earliest years of project implementation.

20.      The regulation of commercial circuits is starting to occur through direct sales to local fruit and
vegetable markets: agents used to purchase orchard crops prior to the harvest and, while it is true that this
practice still exists, it is beginning to be supplanted by direct sales by the fellahs. This is increasingly
being encouraged in order to expand sales to regional-scale markets, thereby ensuring more efficient
disposal of production. This short-cut in the distribution chain will eventually, and logically, lead to a
reduction in the consumer price of agricultural products due to the reduction in the margins previously
taken by agents, and will thereby also lead to improved remuneration of producers. This will inevitably
have a positive influence on the sustainability of project activities.

21.      The project's effects on household incomes and consumption, and the impact of project activities
on job opportunities, are manifesting themselves through a burgeoning entrepreneurial mindset: the
creation of olive oil mills, fruit canning plants, fruit juice processing units and privately-operated wine
cellars has picked up considerably. These impacts will probably be felt in terms of consumption of
manufactured goods, and through the savings critical for the replenishment of capital.

22.      A perceptible improvement has been noted in income levels through initial sales of fruit harvests in
particular, and more specifically of grapes. This is perceptible through projects encouraging fellahs to
consider expanding their orchards and acquiring irrigation equipment. Many fellahs are already envisaging
agro-alimentary units (e.g., SABRA) for the processing of orchard fruits.             The strong demand for
expansion of the tree cultivation program and for the conversion of hectarage previously under cereal
grains is a perfect illustration of this. This is the result of a dawning awareness that market gardening does
not bear any `fruit' (in the `wealth' sense of the word), and that it requires a lot of water and labor. The
impact of this transition on income levels is definitely a primary factor in the transition itself.

23.      The demonstration effect often spurs new requests on the part of fellahs who, at the beginning of
the operation, were reticent and now definitely want to benefit from tree planting programs once they have
seen the initial results on their neighbors' farms. The dissemination effect is thus induced by the visible
financial connection, but this activity still requires much more work than cereals cultivation. It is precisely
this labor, and the continuous presence of the fellahs in the orchards, that have brought about the change in
behaviors.

24.      Sustainable resource management is ensured by beneficiary participation and by the practice of
taking local know-how into account, since farmers are involved from the outset in project planning, and
especially because they have internalized the idea that this project belongs to them and not only to the
Administration.

25.      The REP has thus helped reduce unemployment by creating jobs through works such as
reforestation, run-off remediation, and grapevines and fruit trees plantation. It has also improved the
incomes of family farms through the support it has provided to small-scale beekeeping and poultry-raising
operations. The goal now must be to create the conditions needed to ensure the sustainability of the positive
impacts, while at the same time providing greater support to beneficiaries through regular follow-up

interventions in which they must take part.

Technical and environmental impacts

26.      In order to gauge the efficacy of the erosion control measures, it was agreed, within the context of
the project's monitoring/evaluation function, that erosion reduction would be determined by means of an
observation and measurement mechanism. This mechanism, which was put in place during the summer at
the end of Year 2, and was improved and expanded in Year 3, is comprised of 13 operational stations, each
consisting of two below-ground basins located downstream from an impluvium.                      Analysis of the
observations indicates indisputably that the set-ups have been effective. The ratio of abrasion (or erosion)
at the control site, i.e., the unprotected site, to that of the equipped site is 16% for planted sites and 11% for
sites equipped with runoff remediation. In other words, the gain (i.e., rate of efficiency) corresponding to
each type of site equipment is 84% for biological protections and 89% for mechanical protections.

Impact on forestry staff

27.      Through its institutional development component, the project has had a positive impact on DGF
structures in general and on forestry personnel working in the project area in particular. The benefits of
this component have been felt in several ways: i) provision of central and local services with computer and
office equipment and means of transportation that had been lacking; ii) training in the areas of project
management and participatory approaches; and iii) experience acquired in the areas of procurement and
works oversight.

28.      Moreover, the corps of forestry workers obtained greater acknowledgment from the populace,
which increasingly thinks of them as partners in development. The project enabled foresters to go from the
status of forest guards to that of development agents, and to become privileged partners of the rural
population instead of being seen exclusively as a coercive force. Currently, it is foresters who are
animating the government's integrated rural development program at the local level, using skills acquired
under the REP.

Sustainability of project activities

29.      The project has some ingredients of sustainability built into it. In terms of methodology, it has
used the participatory approach as a basis for activities, and particularly for those concerning the
population directly. By being involved in works execution, investing their labor, and committing their lands
to the project, beneficiaries have demonstrated their commitment to the long term. They have generally
acquired a good understanding of the economic value of fruit orchards and vineyards.

30.      Sustained activity has been observed on the part of most beneficiaries where orchard maintenance
is concerned: i.e., fencing, construction of basins, fertilizer application, pruning, weeding, etc. Surveys
indicate that at least 10% of additional income from sales is being reinvested in the farming operation.

31.      The establishment by the Government of a rural development support fund (FNDR) has enabled
most REP beneficiaries to finance supplemental investments such as well-boring, installation of local
irrigation kits, construction of water storage basins, and even the expansion of orchards. This strategy of
combining the contributions of the REP and the opportunities of the PNDAR, which is encouraged by the
project implementation agency and is being adopted naturally and systematically by all beneficiaries, is an
additional factor ensuring the sustainability of the project.

32.      Other beneficiaries have financed these activities out of their own funds in order to consolidate the
investment realized under the project.




                                                         - 29 -

Impact in terms of additional income

33.      Additional income generated by the exploitation of assets provided by the project has, to varying
degrees, helped improve living standards for beneficiary households. This improvement is, of course,
proportional to income, which is in turn related to the surface area planted under the project. The extent of
the improvement is related to the size of the orchard or vineyard and the extent to which it is worked under
irrigated conditions.

34.      Improvement in living standards was measured through increased household consumption, as
determined before and after the project. On average, increased consumption of about DA 10,000/annum
per household was noted. Expenditures associated with various consumption categories all increased to
varying degrees. Food and hygiene were the first categories to benefit from the additional income (68%).
Domestic expenses were in second place (19%), and health, schooling and clothing were in third place with
13%.

35.      As regards rural women, only the beneficiaries of beekeeping activities showed a clear increase in
income, which they used primarily, and substantially, to boost household consumption.

36.      As orchards and vineyards (under the agricultural development component) and hives (under the
`promotion of rural women' component) came into production, beneficiaries' increased income enabled
them not only to increase household consumption levels but also to invest in their farms.

37.      Surveys of these categories of beneficiaries indicated that over one fourth of beneficiaries of fruit
and vine plantations reinvested a portion of their additional income in equipment, irrigation and the
maintenance of orchards and vineyards. In addition, 30% of female beneficiaries of beekeeping activities
also used the additional income obtained from sales of honey to maintain their hives and acquire additional
ones.

Reduction of rural outmigration

38.      From 1994 onwards, the phenomenon of outmigration worsened markedly along with the
deterioration in the security situation, and primarily affected scattered populations and remote settlements.
By targeting the inhabitants of mountainous rural areas within the context of a difficult economic and
security environment, the project sought to keep the populace in place by creating jobs, re-energizing
agricultural activity and improving physical access.

39.      Beginning with their initial contacts with the project, this populace came to perceive the
authorities' concern about their circumstances, and the ongoing presence of forestry personnel among them
also helped gain their trust. In this respect, the project averted further departures by offering the alternative
of on-site employment.

40.      In addition, monitoring and evaluation missions consistently noted the return, under the project, of
many families to their rural lands after more than a decade of absence. This observation, although difficult
to quantity on the scale of the project area, was confirmed by testimony from the local authorities of many
townships, including in particular those in the areas of Tessala, Beni Chougrane, Sidi bel Abbès and
Dahra. Surveys of beneficiaries of the Agricultural Development component showed that 13% of them left
their homes between 1994 and 1997, most (87%) of them for security reasons. Returns occurred mainly in
1997, i.e. when the project started. In addition, 9% of households have one or more active members who
left the area in search of work and returned between 2002 and 2004 due to the combined effect of the
project and the PNDAR.

41.      A dynamic of working the land established itself in Year 2 throughout the project area, and was
consolidated by implementation of the PNDA/PNDAR. The rural and mostly poor population was unable
to provide the funding needed for agricultural activity, which is still the main source of income. A survey



                                                      - 30 -

of beneficiaries of the agricultural development component indicates that 5% of them began to work the
land with the help of the project, which provided them with the means to make improvements to their own
farms.

42.      The approach adopted under the project had a spillover effect on these inhabitants, who continued
to request additional fruit tree and grapevine plantations until the project ended. Several instances were
reported of individuals, particularly in the perimeters in the province (wilaya) of Tlemcen, converting cereal
cropping into tree or grapevine cultivation after many years spent as emigrants.

Impact on the organization of project implementation

43.      In the interest of greater efficiency, the project opted for a decentralized organization of
implementation, which made it possible for the implementing agency to have an ongoing presence in the
area and to remain in continuous contact with both the local population and the other actors.

44.      The project's pyramidal organization, in which the base level enjoys broad autonomy, had a
positive impact on the sequence of project activities. Freedom of initiative, especially at the regional level (
Conservation des Forêts), made it possible to overcome many difficulties and to maintain an acceptable
pace of implementation.

Conclusions

45.      This project responded to a major concern of the local authorities, namely, reducing
unemployment. The volume of jobs generated by the project worksites made a significant contribution to
keeping rural populations settled in their villages (douars), thereby reducing rural outmigration.

46.      It can also be asserted that this project capitalized on positive experiences acquired in the area of
integration of rural populations through the participatory approach, and that it spurred an unprecedented
dynamic of agricultural development in the region.

47.      Thus, the positive results recorded and the vigorous participatory dynamic are an argument in
favor of extending this type of program, especially in terms of its approach and implementation logistics, to
other zones having the same agro-ecological and socio-economic characteristics. It is precisely in this
connection that the Government has initiated the Second Rural Employment Project currently being
implemented with assistance from the World Bank.

D. Recommendations

48.      Based on results obtained with the implementation of this project, and in order to ensure the
sustainability of the actions initiated and assets created under the project, one of the main recommendations
is to think about their maintenance and sustainability once it the project is over. It is important not to lose
sight of accomplishments in the areas of organization and monitoring. It would therefore be prudent to
consider a consolidation phase.

49.      A workshop is proposed in order to identify the lessons of the REP. The purpose of this workshop
would be to: (i) review the conclusions and recommendations of the Implementation Completion Report
with the various partners; (ii) formulate recommendations aimed at improving implementation of the 2nd
REP and of other similar projects in the country; and (iii) identify the mechanisms for collaboration and
cooperation with other actors such as local authorities, beneficiaries, and representatives of other ministries
operating in the zone.

50.      Communication is a crucial element in the project implementation process. A number of measures
will therefore be taken in this area, including:

    l development of a communication plan setting out all operations needed for disseminating

         information about the project, and for communication via means adapted to the sociological and
         cultural specificity of the project area;

   l establishment and implementation of a program of in-service training for forestry agents in
         communication procedures is crucial to project success. Indeed, the corps of forestry agents is not
         only involved in implementing project activities, but also serves as an intermediary between the
         rural population and the Administration;

   l decentralization of project management made the project easier to implement and monitor. The
         model chosen for its implementation proved effective:           Project Management Unit (central) ­
         Coordination Unit (local) ­ Heads of schemes ­ Inter communal Development Unit (Cellule
         intercommunale de développement). However, the relationships among the various actors need to
         be clarified. Indeed, while the Algerian authorities encourage participatory development, the
         promotion of a contractual mode of management requires a reorganization of institutions with a
         view to their decentralization, i.e., an efficient local administration possessing substantial resources
         and a well-trained and technically competent staff.

51.      The rural women's component was more successful in beekeeping and embroidery activities than in
poultry-raising and weaving. It would henceforth be advisable to propose activities that are well suited to
the context of the zone being promoted. An in-depth study should first be done of the rural female
population in order to determine its expectations and identify the most appropriate proposals. The project
nevertheless succeeded in rectifying the situation by emphasizing beekeeping, which has become the most
suitable.

E. Relation with the Bank

52.      All along project preparation and implementation, there has been a regular monitoring from Bank
staff. Supervision missions took place every three months. Some difficulties were faced at the beginning, in
procurement, as Bank procedures were not fully mastered by the project staff but, overall, there was a good
synergy with the Bank.
