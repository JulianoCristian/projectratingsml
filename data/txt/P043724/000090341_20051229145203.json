     likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: The project\n            has demonstrated that it is possible to address urgent\n            issues of rural unemployment and socioeconomic and political\n            instability and, at the same time, create economic assets\n            with long-term benefits and sustainable livelihood. To\n            maximize involvement of benefiting communities, staff should\n            be trained to work with them and understand what it takes to\n            make them willing participants. Monitoring and evaluation,\n            and good economic analysis help authorities to make the\n            right decisions and choices."}, "docdt": "2005-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
