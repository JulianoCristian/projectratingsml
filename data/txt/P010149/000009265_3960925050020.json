There are several reasons for\n            this poor outcome. First, Bank preparation and appraisal\n            missions lacked experience. Second, implementation schedules\n            were too ambitious and failed to appreciate the lead-time\n            needed for learning and coaching. Third, tender procedures\n            lacked clarity. Lastly, the Bank's resident office was\n            perceived as having a hands-off attitude in regard to\n            project problems. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            experience. First, project preparation and appraisal\n            missions should consist of persons who possess practical\n            experience in implementing this type of project under the\n            conditions prevailing in countries such as Nepal. Second, it\n            is important to ensure that the facility design corresponds\n            to actual needs. Third, specific attention must be paid to\n            the rules of local tender procedures when they contradict\n            Bank procurement guidelines. Fourth, there should be an\n            adequate analysis of an executing agency's\n            institutional capacity or decision-making authority. Lastly,\n            communications between the Borrower and the Bank were\n            inadequate. In the future, the local Bank office should be\n            used more effectively to reduce problems."}, "docdt": "1989-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
