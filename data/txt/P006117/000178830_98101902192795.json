about 750 employees to achieve a target of\n            5,500 by 1977; (viii) close the Sucre-Tarabuco line, which\n            has no prospects of generating sufficient traffic to justify\n            its continuance; (ix) improve the financial performance of ENFE."}, "docdt": "1972-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
