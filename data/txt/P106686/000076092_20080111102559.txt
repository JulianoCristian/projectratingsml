1.  Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
The
education
sector
has
reached
important
milestones
More
than
percent
of
government
social
spending
was
dedicated
to
education
in
up
from
less
than
percent
in
The
increased
spending
allowed
Panama
to
make
great
progress
in
increasing
access
to
education
At
the
preschool
level
the
net
enrollment
rate

for
children
aged
and
rose
to
percent
in
from
percent
in
while
achieving
almost
universal
enrollment
at
the
primary
level
in
Enrolment
in
secondary
rose
by
percent
in
At
the
tertiary
level
Panama
has
the
second
largest
proportion
of
students
enrolled
in
Latin
America
the
gross
enrollment
rate
is
about
percent
behind
Argentina
The
proportion
of
the
population
with
completed

education

is
higher
not
only
than
in
the
average
LAC
country

percent
but
also
in
comparison
with
the
OECD
percent
Panama
has
met
the
MDG
targets
of
gender
parity
in
all
education
levels
World
Bank
c
In
addition
additional
spending
in
education
has
resulted
in
the
implementation
of
a
National
Student
Assessment
SINECA
and
also
supported
participation
in
regional
student
assessment
tests
such
as
the
UNESCO
LLECE
However
national
averages
mask
deep
social
regional
and
ethnic
disparities
when
it
comes
to
education
Several
analytical
studies
have
pointed
to
the
need
for
programs
aimed
at
improving
equity
quality
internal
efficiency
and
governance
in
education
as
well
as
systems
to
measure
outcomes
and
longer
term
impacts
The
key
sector
issues
mentioned
above
are
analyzed
next
There
is
an
unequal
distribution
of
education
opportunities
Given
Panama
s
stark
inequalities
equity
is
an
issue
that
cuts
across
all
other
education
sector
concerns

worked
to
increase

at
all
levels
but
as
noted
the
results
have
varied
widely
by
income
groups
urban
rural
locality
and
ethnicity
Inequities
are
deeply
ingrained
in
the
education
system
and
are
apparent
in
measures
of
enrollment
retention
and
completion
and
also
in
learning
achievement
The
poor
the
rural
and
indigenous
communities
show
consistently
lower
levels
of
education
although
the
improvements
in
enrolment
mentioned
earlier
have
benefited
more
than
proportionally
the
poor
particularly
with
the
non
formal
early
childhood

Regarding
coverage
NER
in
secondary
education
ranges
from
a
high
of
percent
in
the
relatively
urbanized
province
of
Colón
to
percent
in
the
Ngöbe

Summing
up
there
is
growing
inequity
in
education
between
the
indigenous
and
the

The
Government
has
increased
enrollment
rates
at
every
level
but
the
progress
has
not
been
matched
by
gains
in
student
achievement
The
most
recent
student

that
a
high

Emphasis
on
quality
is
needed
at
every

Quality
is
especially
lacking
in
indigenous
areas
where
curricula
are
poorly
matched
to
economic
and
social
roles
but
also
in
rural
areas
As
mentioned
above
students
from
indigenous
communities
scored
well
below
national
averages
in
the
student
assessment
attaining

Similar
results
were
found
in
grades
and
The
percentage
of
qualified
teachers

proxy
for

ranges
from

The
World
Economic
Forum
s
assessment
is
consistent
with
the
fact
that
in
comparison
with
the
average
country
in
the
region
Panama
exhibits
lower
research
and

as
a

of

and
fewer

D
expenditures
were

of

compared
to

for
LAC
and

in
the
OECD
In
the
same
year
Panama
had
researchers
per
million
population
vs
in
LAC
and
in
the
OECD
Internal
efficiency
is
low
overall
and
perpetuates
inequality
The
rise
in
enrollment
is
posing
new
challenges
to
the
education
system
and
this
is
evident
in
repetition
drop
out
and
completion
rates
According
to
MEDUCA
the
rate
of
overage
students
is
percent
in
primary
and
almost
percent
in
secondary
education
As
for
drop
out
and
completion
rates
cohort
analyses
in
show
that
of
students
who
began
primary
school
only
completed
the
full
six
year
cycle
and
fewer
than
did
so
without
repeating
a
grade
Similar
cohort
analyses
at
the
secondary
level
showed
that
for
every
students
entering
grade
fewer
than
half
went
on
to
complete
grade
and
only
did
so
without
repeating
a
grade
Similarly
the
poor
and
the
indigenous
peoples
are
more
affected
by
internal
inefficiencies
This
is
evident
from
the
high
repetition
and
drop
out
rates
reported
in
these
communities
repetition
rates
in
primary
are

and
in

while
the

Drop
out
rates
in

are
close
to

in
all

communities
and

Weak
sector
s
governance
hampers
administration
and
management
but
also
equity
quality
and
technical
efficiency
MEDUCA
has
increased
its
capacity
to
deliver
services
in
the
last
years
but
governance
issues
still
hamper
its
ability
to
deliver
targeted
results
The
outcomes
described
above
do
not
match
education
spending
in
formal
education
Panama
invests
the
equivalent
of
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
in
education
high
relative
to
the
percent
average
investment
of
its
middle
income
peers
in
the
region
but
it
ranks
below
Latin
American
countries
of
similar
income
in
pre
primary
and
secondary
net
enrolment

Low
internal
efficiency
in
particular
high
overage
and
repetition
rates
increases
operational
costs
and
reduces
spending
efficiency
A
recent
study
of
Panama
s
education
sector
carried
out
by
PREAL
CoSPAE
estimated
that
the
cost
of
grade
repetition
averaged
USD
million
per
year
from
7
Learning
outcomes
as
measured
by
national
assessments
have
worsened
despite
additional
spending
In
addition
the
centralization
of
decision
making
at
the
national
level
has
prevented
regional
and
school
level
officials
from
increasing
their
own
capacity
and
accountability
while
there
is
the
lack
of
a
culture
of
strategic
planning
at
the
national
level
MEDUCA
needs
to
plan
by
looking
at
the
issues
rather
than
by
the
action
of
directorates
working
in
isolation
and
therefore
to
strengthen
coordination
between
divisions
to
articulate
strategic
actions
and
to
delegate
more
authority
to
local
officials
In
short
there
is
substantial
room
for
improving
Panama
s
education
outcomes
with
the
same
level
of

by
using
them
more
efficiently
and
targeting
them
better
on
the
most
needed
which
requires
and
improved
governance
of
the
sector
The
GoP
and
the
Bank
have
produced
a
strong
base
of
analytical
studies
on
Panama
s
economic
growth
prospects
and
social
development
including
the
Poverty
Assessment
the
Public
Expenditure
Review
and
the
Country
Economic
Memorandum
These
studies
incorporate
analyses
of
challenges
and
opportunities
facing
education
training
and
innovation
systems
and
are
intended
to
informing
policy
decision
making
and
guide
future
sector
investments
including
the
proposed
project
in
line
with
the
Government
s
policy
agenda
At
the
sector
level
the
Bank
has
established
a
year
technical
dialogue
and
investment
partnership
with
MEDUCA
supporting
operations
in
initial
and
basic
education
with
satisfactory
outcomes
Currently
the
Bank
is
financing
a
Second
Basic
Education
Project
with
a
Loan
of
million
Ln
approved
in
and
an
Additional
Finance
Loan
of
USD
million
Ln
approved
in
August
The
ongoing
project
is
a
continuation
of
the
First
Basic
Education
Project
completed
in
and
rated
successfully
in
the
achievement
of
all
of
its
development
objectives
With
the
launch
of
the
Government
s
program
Red
de
Oportunidades
also
supported
by
the
World
Bank
and
Inter
American
Development
Bank
the
ongoing
education
project
became
central
to
its
success
since
Oportunidades
seeks
to
promote
enrollment
and
consistent
attendance
in
early
education
and
primary
school
among
children
living
in
extreme
poverty
with
conditional
cash
transfers
Thus
while
Oportunidades
stimulates
the
demand
side
the
ongoing
and
proposed
operation
focuses
on
meeting
supply
side
challenges
to
meet
the
increase
demand
for
places
and
improve
the
quality
of
service
provision
The
accumulated
stock
of
analytical
studies
technical
partnership
and
lessons
learned
through
the
implementation
of
Bank
financed
programs
in
the
education
sector
places
the
Bank
in
an
advantageous
position
to
assist
MEDUCA
in
the
design
of
a
new
operation
Finally
the
Government
has
expressed
strong
interest
to
work
with
the
Bank
team
to
ensure
the
new

2. Proposed objective(s) 
 
The
principal
objective
of
the
proposed
investment
is
to
contribute
towards
the
development
of
the
educational
system
while
mainstreaming
interventions
aimed
at
promoting
equity
as
a
transversal
objective
The
proposed
development
objectives
are
as
follows
i
improve
the
quality
of
early
childhood
and
basic
education
programs
ii
increase

a
Project
financed
by
the
IDB
and
other
more
localized
NGO
programs
Thus
the
proposed
project
expects
to
build
from
and
add
value
to
an
existing
inventory
of
interventions
on
early
childhood
education
junior
secondary
education
bilingual
education
and
institutional
capacity
Mainstreaming
of
equity
will
be
achieved
by
focusing
program
benefits
on
disadvantaged
populations
and
or
regions
of
extreme
poverty
urban
and
rural
as
well
as
by
financing
programs
that
are
in
accordance
with
the
rights
and
requirements
of
indigenous
children
and
their
communities
The
project
is
set
to
achieve
the
following
four
development
objectives
which
will
be
measured
by
the
proposed
outcome
indicators

4.  Safeguard policies that might apply 
 
The
project
will
trigger
the
Indigenous
Peoples
OD
safeguard
policy
The
project
encompasses
strategies
to
integrate
children
from
indigenous
communities
into
the
education
system
and
so
an
Indigenous
People
s
Plan
IPP
will
be
developed
during
project
preparation
The
IPP
will
be
developed
in
consultation
with
government
authorities
and
will
build
on
the
indigenous
survey
and
analysis
completed
for
the
Panama
Poverty
Assessment
and
the
Red
de
Oportunidades
program
The
project
does
not
envisage
new
construction
of
classrooms
but
it
is
likely
to
include
rehabilitation
of
physical
spaces
in
targeted
areas
