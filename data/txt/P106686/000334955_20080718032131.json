           Improvement Project for finance are improve: (i) the quality\n            of non-formal initial, basic (grades 1-9) and secondary\n            (10-12) education programs; (ii) the coverage and internal\n            efficiency of initial and basic education; and (iii) the\n            strategic planning and institutional performance of the\n            Ministry of Education at the central, regional and local\n            levels. Improving equity is considered a\n            universal/cross-cutting principle and therefore embedded in\n            each component of the project. There are three components to\n            the project. The first component of the project is to\n            improve learning processes at non-formal pre-school\n            programs, as well as in primary and secondary levels. This\n            component aims to advance the education quality in the\n            system through supply-side interventions on pedagogical\n            methods, curricular relevancy, promotion of Information\n            Technology (IT) literacy skills, and improved technical\n            capacity to measure student learning outcomes. The second\n            component of the project is to increase coverage and\n            retention of the school population in initial and basic\n            educational programs. This component seeks to expand\n            coverage of non-formal initial education programs, while\n            increasing the internal efficiency in the system from\n            pre-school to basic education (grades 1-9). The third and\n            final component of the project is to enhance institutional\n            capacity and performance of the Ministry of Education. This\n            component aims to support strategic investments to the\n            Ministry of Education (Ministerio de Educacion)\n            (MEDUCA's) to build institutional and technical\n            capacity to improve the administrative, management,\n            monitoring and evaluation performance of the education system."}, "docdt": "2008-07-10T00:00:00Z"}
