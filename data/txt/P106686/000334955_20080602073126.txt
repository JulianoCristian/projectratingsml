The IPP below has been extracted from Annex 10 of the PAD 
 
                        21. THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES PLAN (IPP) 
                                                   
1. The Indigenous Peoples Plan is an effort of the National Directorate of Intercultural 
Bilingual Education (DNEIB) with technical assistance of the World Bank. The IPP was 
built  on  the  recommendations  and  agreements  resulting  from  consultations  with  the 
Kuna, Emberá, Wounaan, NgäbeBuglé (2007), and NasoTeribe (2008). The IPP seeks to 
support the MEDUCA on its effort to provide quality intercultural bilingual education 
to bilingual children speaking indigenous languages.   

2. The IPP includes the following principles that apply across the Project components:   
    (a) The  programs,  actions,  activities  and  materials  related  to  indigenous  regions 
         under  the  present  project  should  be  consulted  and  agreed  by  the  other 
         Directorates of MEDUCA with the DNEIB. This applies to the entire project. 
    (b) The  variables  "ethnic  group",  and  "native  language"  should  be  included  in  all 
         the  information  databases  to  allow  desaggregation  of  data,  and  to  ensure 
         monitoring  and  evaluation  of  improvement  of  education  indicators  of 
         indigenous peoples can be measured in time.
