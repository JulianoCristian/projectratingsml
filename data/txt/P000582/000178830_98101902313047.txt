INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS
FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros for the
equivalent of US$5.00 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a hignway
project. The project would be cofinanced on a parallel basis with a loan of
US$4.5 million equivalent from the African Development Fund for a period of
50 years including 10 years grace, with an administrative charge of 0.75 per-
cent per annum, and a loan of US$1.0 million equivalent from the Opec Special
Fund for a period of 20 years including 5 years grace, with an administrative
charge of 0.75 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of Comoros" (Report No. 1626a-COM)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 26, 1977. An updated sum-
mary of the conclusions is set out below. Country data sheets are provided
in Annex I.
3.        The Comoros Archipelago, located at the northern end of the Mozam-
bique channel, consists of four islands: Grande Comore, Anjouan, Moheli and
Mayotte, about 100-300 km distant from one another. Following a referendum
held in December 1974, Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli declared unilateral
independence in July 1975, while Mayotte decided to remain French.
4.        The country's relatively small land area is characterized by a
rugged topography of volcanic origin and lush vegetation. The climate is
marine tropical marked by heavy rains during the six month rainy season. The
vast majority of the 380,000 people (1977) live in rural areas and derive
their livelihood from agriculture.  The staple crops are rice, bananas and
coconuts; meat, and fish in the coastal areas, are a minor part of the diet.
High-value export crops such as ylang-ylang, cloves and vanilla grow well in
the coastal areas up to an altitude of about 500 m. However, as population is
dense and agricultural practices are rudimentary, food crop production is
insufficient to meet local needs and most of the export revenues are spent on
food imports. Malnutrition is widespread. Non-agricultural activities are
limited, and consist mainly of ylang-ylang distillation into perfume essences,
a small soft drinks bottling plant, a sawmill, a brickworks, a furniture
factory and a soap factory.
5.        Social services are also limited.  Although all children attend
koranic schools until they are able to read classical Arabic, only half of



-2-
the children of school age attend primary classes. Furthermore, these classes
are overcrowded and about two thirds of the teachers are insufficiently
trained. Thereafter, only 7 percent of the relevant age group enter secondary
schools, which are almost entirely dependent on expatriate teachers. Between
1970 and 1975 enrollment ratios doubled at the primary level and tripled at
the secondary. Little vocational training took place until 1975 when the
International Labor Organization helped establish an artisan training center.
During the period 1966-76 only about 40 Comorian graduates from foreign
universities (10 percent of the total) returned home. Medical services are as
limited as the educational system. There are 5 doctors in state service, with
an undetermined number in private practice; 2 hospitals and 6 health centers,
totaling about 660 beds; 4 rural maternity wards, totaling 26 beds; and 46
health posts. These resources have proven insufficient to curb endemic diseases
such as malaria, which affects 80 percent of the population, and to reduce the
high infant mortality rate.
6.        Lack of adequate infrastructure is another constraint to develop-
ment. The transport of food and export crops requires all-weather roads,
but many villages are not linked to the main road system or at best are con-
nected by tracks that only four-wheel drive vehicles can manage. Public
power supplies are available only in two cities and fall short of demand.
Water supply is scarce on Grande Comore where there are no perennial rivers.
7.        The French Administration increasingly supplemented the scarce local
resources in the early 1970s, thereby improving considerably the Comorian
economy until independence in 1975. From 1970 to 1974, France financed about
half the costs of administering the territories through a variety of services
included in the metropolitan budget, made available about 1,500 persons for
local administration staffing, and provided direct budget support, representing
a total of about US$80 million equivalent for the period. Investments, mainly
in public works and house construction, accounted for about 30 percent of GDP.
With an annual increase of 6-7 percent in the real domestic product, GNP per
capita reached over US$200 in 1974, an average which partly reflected higher
expatriate salaries.
8.        Almost immediately following Independence, Comoros faced a budgetary
and financial crisis, as France withdrew its financial aid and most expatriate
personnel. Comoros managed initially by cutting back drastically on most
activities (e.g., closing secondary schools) and delaying a number of payments
including, occasionally, salaries. Total public expenditure dropped by about
half; investment plummeted. The national income fell by 13 percent in 1975
and 9 percent in 1976, leaving the per capita income at about US$150. In
response to worldwide appeals for help, some free food and medical supplies
were contributed in early 1976. A few months later, the Special Arab Aid
Fund for Africa provided a concessionary loan of US$10 million, and the
People's Republic of China made available US$10 million equivalent. In spite
of this assistance and in view of the traditionally large trade deficit, the
Government had to curtail imports drastically.



- 3 -
9.        In 1977 the Government continued to confront an extremely tight
financial situation. Tax revenues, mainly based on imports, declined while
at the same time expenditures increased, owing in part to emergency assistance
that had to be provided to about 18,000 Comorians repatriated from Madagascar
and to victims of a volcanic eruption on Grande Comore. The Government
reorganized the administration, substantially reducing the number of civil
servants, halved the salary levels of remaining staff and authorized expendi-
tures only on an ad-hoc basis as and when resources became available. Even
so, the overall 1977 budget deficit amounted to about US$10 million. As the
loan of the Special Arab Aid Fund for Africa was exhausted, the deficit was
financed mainly by aid from Libya, Saudi Arabia and the European Development
Fund, advances by the Comoriaa Currency Board and the gold tranche drawing on
the International Monetary Fund.
10.       Comoros will have to continue to rely on foreign financial and
technical assistance, on terms as concessionary as possible. Current revenues
are insufficient to run government services, and it will take some time before
an adequate administrative base can be built up, and government revenues in-
creased. About US$10 million budgetary aid, and some US$15 million for project
implementation, would be required annually over the next few years to allow a
steady resumption of economic activity. Aid agencies should be prepared to
finance considerably more than the foreign exchange costs, if the lack of
local funds is not to impede successful implementation of their assistance.
Comoros will also need considerable technical assistance. The administration
experiences severe shortages of qualified staff and has a very limited capa-
city for project preparation and implementation; the Kuwait Fund has provided
a four-man team to help prepare projects in agriculture and highways.
11.       Comoros has potential for development and may be able in the longer
run to obtain a growth of about 5 percent per annum. It has been estimated
that the agricultural production could increase as much as five-fold with the
introduction of new food crops such as maize, and new techniques instead of
the traditional farming practices, which are eroding the soil. Establishment
of small import-substitution or larger export-oriented industries could solve
the long-term problems of absorbing an increasing labor force and raising
incomes above subsistence levels. A major problem which the Government will
have to address is that of rapid population growth. Deforestation is extremely
serious, especially in Anjouan.
12.       With respect to basic infrastructure, the Kuwait Fund provided
US$5.4 million in 1976 to complete road construction initiated under the
French Administration, and Government attaches importance to the enlargement
of the ports. Saudi Fund is also providing assistance in infrastructure con-
struction.
13.       The Government intends to set a climate favorable to private national
and foreign investment, and does not envisage major changes in economic
policies and monetary arrangements. An organization called CREDICOM, jointly
owned by the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (France) and the Comorian
Government, provides medium-term credit for the private sector. There is only



- 4 -
one commercial bank, a subsidiary of the French-owned Banque de Madagascar
et Comores. Comoros continues to belong to the French franc zone, whereby
France guarantees full convertibility of Comorian francs into French francs
and allows drawings on an operation account which ensures free capital move-
ments between the two countries. As of June 30, 1978, Comoros' official
holdings of foreign exchange were about US$4.7 million, equivalent to about
two months of imports. At the end of 1976 total public debt stood at US$17
million and debt service amounted to 5 percent of export earnings in that
year.
PART II - WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COMOROS
14.       Comoros joined the Bank in December 1976 and the Association in
December 1977. The first economic mission visited the country in December
1976; its report (referred to in paragraph 2 above) was circulated to the
Executive Directors on July 26, 1977. Our future lending to Comoros will
concentrate on agriculture and transport, emphasizing institution building and
technical assistance, and is aimed at helping Comoros achieve financial and
economic viability. We expect to appraise an export crop improvement project
before the end of FY79, and a rural development project is being prepared for
the Nioumakele peninsula.
15.       The proposed highway project would be the first Bank Group operation
in the country.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
16.       The transport infrastructure in Comoros comprises two ports, four
airports and about 700 km of roads. There are no railways or navigable
rivers. Comoros' long distances to foreign markets, its small islands, the
absence of a harbor for large ocean-going vessels and the rugged terrain
create special transport problems and make transport expensive.
17.       The islands' port infrastructure is rudimentary.  Only small vessels
can approach the existing quays at Mutsamudu in Anjouan, and Moroni in Grande
Comore.  Other ships must lie offshore and be unloaded by dhows; during the
cyclone season (November to April), this procedure is dangerous and ships are
reluctant to call at the islands. Most of the freight is shipped to the ports
of Majunga or Dar es Salaam, from where it is transshipped to Comoros.  Govern-
ment owns landing craft tankers used mainly for inter-island freight traffic
and to a limited degree for passenger transport.
18.       An airport capable of accommodating jumbo jets has been recently
constructed at Hahaya on Grande Comore. In addition, each island has an air-
port suitable for DC4s or Boeing 737s. Although the number of airports is
adequate, all need some upgrading. Air Comores, operating three DC4s, serves
the inter-island traffic, which is the most important means of passenger
transport, given the lack of adequate passenger shipping services.



19.       The road network comprises about 340 km of paved roads, 375 km of
dry weather roads and tracks. The length and condition of the network are
inadequate. Large portions of the country are served only by tracks which
become impassable during the 6-month rainy season. Road maintenance is
carried out only sporadically, as Government lacks an efficient administrative
organization, equipment and funds to adequately maintain and improve its road
network. The vehicle fleet comprises about 1650 units, mostly small and
medium size cars, with one motor vehicle per 200 persons. Traffic volume is
low, and only the main road axes around the towns have traffic of up to 250
vehicles per day.
20.       The Ministry of Equipment, Improvement of Territory and Quality of
Life is in charge of public works.  Its Directorate of Equipment and Improve-
ment of Territory administers all matters relating to road infrastructure,
gives technical advice to local administration, prepares minor design for
civil works and buildings through its Technical Studies Division, and awards
and follows up on civil works contracts, including those for procurement of
equipment. The Directorate's Road Maintenance Division has three subdivi-
sions, one for each of the three islands, which are in charge of road mainte-
nance and minor construction works done by force account. Maintenance and
construction of minor rural roads are carried out by local communities with
self-help. The Directorate operates one main workshop at the major town of
each island.
21.       Development of the transport sector is one of Government's priori-
ties, specifically, transforming Mutsamudu into an international port to
reduce transshipments through foreign ports, and expanding and upgrading the
road network on all the islands to facilitate rural development. The Govern-
ment is now completely dependent on its own local staff for highway related
matters and faces a severe shortage of trained and experienced staff at nearly
all levels. Engineers and technicians are in short supply and only one
engineer has substantial experience in civil engineering. There are no
mechanical engineers or transport economists in the country; qualified
mechanics and equipment operators are scarce. As a result, the Comoros will
depend heavily on foreign expertise in the near future. Financially, it will
also have to rely on foreign assistance to carry out any sizeable project.
The Saudi Fund and the Kuwait Fund are assisting in the construction of major
roads, and the latter has also agreed to finance equipment and technical
assistance for road maintenance; the European Development Fund has agreed to
finance equipment for a road improvement unit. The proposed project has been
designed in close consultation with these agencies to ensure that it would
complement their assistance.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report, Highway Project, Comoros,"
(No. 1930b-COM) dated August 1, 1978, is being distributed separately. A sup-
plementary project data sheet is given in Annex III. The proposed project was
identified by a transport sector mission in March 1977. For its preparation,



- 6 -
the UNDP agreed to finance the required detailed engineering studies for the
road construction component. As the project scope was enlarged during ap-
praisal in October 1977 in view of co-financing possibilities, the Association
made available an advance of US$80,000 under its Project Preparation Facility
to enable consultants to identify specific needs for road improvement and
maintenance as well as for training of local staff. To this end, the Govern-
ment has engaged French consultants BCEOM. The project was appraised in
October 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington D.C. from May 10 to 12,
1978. The Comorian delegation was led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Objectives
23.       The objectives of the proposed project are to assist the Government
in meeting the most pressing needs for improving the country's road infra-
structure and its related administrative institutions, through expansion
of the main network, establishment and implementation of a three-year road
improvement and maintenance program, and provision of technical assistance.
The project also includes studies for preparation of a subsequent highway
project and an integrated rural development project.
Description
24.       The proposed project comprises:
(i) road construction and supervision of 20.4 km in the
Nioumakele area on Anjouan;
(ii) road improvement, including urgent repairs of 700 m of
a main road on Anjouan, and establishment and operation
of a road improvement unit;
(iii) road maintenance, comprising establishment and operation
of two patching units and one resealing unit;
(iv) improvement of workshops and procurement of workshop
equipment and tools;
(v) procurement of soils laboratory equipment;
(vi)  technical assistance for:  improving highway mainte-
nance; setting up an appropriate administrative
structure; establishing and implementing a road
improvement and maintenance program; and on-the-job
training of local staff;
(vii) fellowships; and
(viii) studies: detailed engineering of the Fomboni-Hoani-
Miringoni road (25 km); feasibility study of the
Miringoni-Nioumachoua road (20 km) and, if feasible,
detailed engineering for this section; and a rural
development preinvestment study for the Nioumakele
area to be served by the proposed road.



-7-
(i) Road Construction and Supervision
25.       The proposed project provides for the construction to paved standards,
and related supervision, of a 20.4 km ro,1 on the Nioumakele peninsula on
Anjouan island, including 15.7 km of main road from Ongoujou to M'Ramani with
a 5 m bituminous pavement width and 4.7 km of access roads from Antsahe to
Dziani, and Antsahe to Niambamoro with a 3.5 m bituminous pavement width. The
new alignment will follow the existing track, which is in poor condition and
impassable during the rainy season.  Given the rugged terrain with slopes as
steep as 30 to 40 degrees, the heavy rainfall, and the predominantly clayish
soils, paving is necessary  io prevent washouts.  The road serves one of the
country's most densely populated and underdeveloped areas with agricultural
potential. Present traffic volumes are about 30 vehicles per day in the dry
season but are expected to increase to 100 vehicles per day once the road is
improved.
(ii) Road Improvement
26.       A 700 m stretch of the zoastal road near Mutsamudu on Anjouan
required urgent repairs, namely (i) an increase in the height and repair of
an existing retaining wall along a section of about 500 m; (ii) new construc-
tion of about 200 m of retaining wall, and (iii) reconstruction of about 150 m
of washed away sections of the road pavement. The coastal road is the only
link between the western part of the island and its major city and only
harbor, Mutsamudu, and present traffic is about 200 vehicles per day. Early
repair of this section was required to avoid it being completely washed away,
which would have cut off about one third of the island's population from the
rest of the country. These works, which were carried out between March and
June 1978, would be financed under the proposed credit (see paragraph 37
below).
27.       About 120 km of tracks on the three islands will be upgraded to all-
weather standards over a three-year period (1979-81). Most of these tracks
are at present in bad condition and only passable during the dry season.
The works will consist of partial improvement of the alignment, including the
necessary earthwork, spreading of a gravel layer and providing the necessary
drainage facilities, such as ditches, culverts and bridges. The proposed
project will finance equipment, spare parts and operating expenditures for
IL            fuel and imported materials for the project period, as well as technical
assistance for the operation of one road improvement unit. It complements
technical assistance and equipment being provided by the European Development
Fund and the Kuwait Fund.
(iii) Road Maintenance
28.       Routine and periodic maintenance of the paved road network will
be improved through the project over a three-year period (1979-81); routine
maintenance for earth roads is carried out primarily by labor intensive
methods and will be improved with the Kuwait Fund's assistance. The proposed
project will help create two patching units and one resealing unit, through
financing of equipment and spare parts, provision of operating expenditures



- 8 -
for fuel and imported materials over the project period, and technical assis-
tance for the unit's operation, complementing equipment being provided by the
European Development Fund and the Kuwait Fund. The project includes a spare
part stock for existing and new equipment procured by the various aid agen-
cies. The two patching units will repair the paved road surface and edges;
the resealing unit will reseal the paved roads on an average of every seven
years. These units will be sufficient to adequately maintain the country's
paved network. It is expected that over the three-year period, a total
of about 190 km will be resurfaced, and patching and repair of pavement edges
will be done annually on about 250 km.
(iv) Workshops
29.       The buildings and offices of the three central workshops at Moroni,
Mutsamudu and Fomboni, which handle repair and maintenance of all road
equipment, will be repaired and extended. The project will also provide for
the required workshop equipment and tools, and technical assistance for the
workshops' organization and operation.
(v) Soils Laboratory Equipment
30.       A soils laboratory will be established for carrying out the soils
tests required for the road improvement program, road construction and for
future civil works in the country. The project provides financing for the
equipment to carry out these tasks.
(vi) Technical Assistance and Fellowships
31.       The proposed project will finance about 126 man-months of consul-
tant services. A team of 5 consultants would be employed over twelve to
thirty-six months, as well as various short term consultants for a period
of six months, to assist Government to implement the three-year maintenance
and improvement program, and train Comorian staff. Consultants financed under
the Project Preparation Facility helped determine the country's needs to
adequately maintain the road network, define training needs and a three-year
road maintenance and improvement program, and prepare bidding documents for
items to be procured under the project. Consultants will be employed on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.02, draft Development
Credit Agreement). The project will also provide fellowships for training of
Comorians abroad.
(vii) Studies
32.       The project includes:  (a) Detailed engineering of the Fomboni-
Hoani-Miringoni road (25 km); (b) a feasibility study, detailed engineering
and preparation of bidding documents for the 20 km Miringoni-Nioumachoua
section, serving a rich agricultural area whose potential is constrained by
lack of an all-weather road; and (c) a preinvestment study for an integrated
rural development project on Anjouan island, to be served by this project's
road construction component.

Cost Estimates
33.       Total project costs are estimated at US$11.06 million, net of taxes,
including a foreign exchange component of US$9.54 million or 86 percent.
Detailed costs are as follows:

Financing Plan
34.       The financing of the proposed project would be shared by IDA, the
African Development Fund, the OPEC Special Fund and the Government. The IDA
contribution of US$5.0 million, representing about 45 percent of total project
cost, would be applied towards the setting up of one resealing and two patching
units, the financing of road improvement and maintenance equipment, including
spare parts, materials and fuel. It would also cover the cost of building
repairs and equipment for workshops, soils laboratory equipment, the major
part of technical assistance and the proposed studies under the project. On
August 18, 1978, the African Development Fund and the Comoros signed an
agreement for a loan of about US$4.5 million equivalent for a period of 50
years, including 10 years grace, with an administrative charge 0.75 percent
per annum for the construction and supervision of the Nioumakele road. On
July 28, 1978 the OPEC Special Fund and the Comoros signed an agreement for a
loan of US$1.0 million equivalent for a period of 20 years, including 5 years
grace, with an administrative charge of 0.75 percent per annum to assist in
financing road improvement and maintenance equipment, technical assistance and
fellowships. The Association will be the executing agency for items financed
by the OPEC Special Fund. A Memorandum of Understanding with the OPEC Special
Fund will be executed after the credit has been approved. Fulfillment of all
conditions precedent to disbursement of the OPEC Special Fund loan is a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit (Section 6.01, draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement). Contributions by IDA, the African Development Fund
and OPEC Special Fund would cover the full foreign costs of US$9.54 million plus
US$0.96 million of local costs. The balance, mainly salaries for local staff
estimated at US$0.56 million, would be financed by Government.

Project Implementation and Procurement
35.       The Ministry of Equipment, Improvement of Territory and Quality of
Life, through its Directorate of Equipment and Improvement of Territory, will
be responsible for overall project execution and, in particular, will be
in charge of overall planning and budgeting for road improvement and mainte-
nance operations. The Directorate's road maintenance division will be respon-
sible for the execution of maintenance and road improvement, which will be
done by force account, and for maintenance and repair of equipment.  The
technical assistance team under the project will operate in an advisory
capacity within the Directorate; its team leader will be responsible to the
Dirctorate for supervising the implementaton of the road improvement and
maintenance programs. Project implementation and procurement will be as
follows:
(a) Construction of the Nioumakele road will be carried out by con-
tractors on the basis of unit prices, following international competitive
bidding in accordance with African Development Fund's guidelines. Work is
expected to start during the first half of 1979 and will be completed within
one year; supervision of construction will be carried out by consultants
selected by the Government and employed on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the African Development Fund.
(b) Repair of 700 m of main road on Anjouan has been carried out by
contractor. The contract was awarded with the Association's approval, fol-
lowing local bidding procedures since the scope of the work and its relatively
small cost (US$140,000) would not have warranted international competition
bidding.
(c) Improvement of tracks and maintenance of paved roads will be carried
out by mechanized brigades on force account, which would be the most efficient
method for this type of work in the country. Work will follow a program out-
lined by consultants under the technical assistance component; the program
will be reviewed annually and submitted for the Association's approval three
months before the start of each year's work (Section 3.05, draft Development
Credit Agreement). The program is expected to start late in 1978 (following
arrival of equipment to be procured under the project). The Ministry will
prepare the necessary drawings and carry out the engineering surveys; its
soils laboratory to be established under the project will carry out the
required soils tests. Consultants will help execute and supervise the works,
and will ensure cost control and efficiency of the units' operations. Upon
completion of the three-year program, the units will continue to be used by
Government for road improvement and maintenance work.
(d) Improvement of workshop buildings and method of execution, either
by force account or by local contractor, depending on costs and construction
period, will be defined by consultants. Works are expected to start during
the second half of 1978 and will be completed by early 1979.
(e) Technical assistance, will be provided by a consultant firm at an
average total cost of US$7,000 per man-month.



- 11 -
(f) Equipment and spare parts, workshop tools and equipment, and soils
laboratory equipment will be procured on the basis of negotiated con,ractb
following international shopping among potential suppliers in line with Bank
Group Guidelines. This method of procurement has been found to be the most
adequate, given (i) the small number of individual items to be procured, (ii)
the need for standardization so that the equipment financed under the project
will complement that provided by European Development Fund and the Kuwait
Fund, and (iii) the lack of response to international competitive bidding for
similar types of equipment recently purchased with European Development Fund
financing. The list of road maintenance equipment to be procured under the
project was agreed with Government. The requirements for spare parts and
workshop tools and equipment, and soils laboratory equipment will be determined
by consultants during project implementation. The Ministry of Equipment, with
assistance from consultants under the project, will be in charge of procurement.
(g) The studies will be carried out by consultants to be selected in
agreement with the Association, as Government does not have the capacity to
carry them out itself. The studies are expected to start in early 1979 and
will be completed by mid 1980.
36.        Until 1977, local funds for road improvement consisted essentially
of revenues from tax on gasoline, which were allocated to a Road Fund ear-
marked for that purpose. Although Comoros will continue to depend on foreign
financing for new highway construction and maintenance, Government will
re-establish the Road Fund in order to ensure, following project comple-
tion, adequate financing of its road maintenance program from domestic re-
sources (Section 4.03, draft Development Credit Agreement).
Disbursement
37.        The IDA credit will be disbursed against 100 percent of foreign and
local costs of the selected components, excluding local salaries. As mentioned
in paragraph 22, in order to allow detailed definition of the road maintenance
and improvement components, up to US$80,000 is being made available under the
Project Preparation Facility to finance consultant services. The advance will
be reimbursed to the Association out of the proposed credit upon its effective-
ness. Retroactive financing up to US$140,000 as from March 1, 1978 is proposed
for the repairs of the 700 m road section near Mutsamudu described in paragraph
26 above (Schedule 1, para 2(a), draft Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Justification
38.        The proposed project is expected to yield benefits in several areas.
Firstly, it will assist in the establishment of an adequate road administra-
tion, through an organization study, provision of technical assistance to im-
plement the study's recommendations and on-the-job training and training
abroad of local staff, so that gradually fewer foreign experts will be neces-
sary. The institution building component accounts for about 15 percent of
the project cost, for which no economic rate of return calculation has been
attempted. Secondly, the project will provide the administration with the



- 12 -
means to carry out its tasks, through the financing of additional road equip-
ment and initial stock of spare parts, fuels and other imported materials
for a three-year road maintenance and improvement program. This project com-
ponent accounts for about 40 percent of total cost, and is expected to yield
an overall economic rate of return of 17 percent (resulting from rates of
34 percent for the resealing and patching units and 12 percent for the improve-
ment unit), through reduction in vehicle operating costs and the provision of
all-weather roads to some areas with only dry-weather access at present.
Thirdly, the road construction element, about 40 percent of project costs,
will benefit one of the most densely populated and underdeveloped areas, paving
the way for a planned integrated rural development project through which agri-
cultural net value added could increase as much as five-fold. The expected
economic rate of return of this component, evaluated as a combined road con-
struction/rural development project, would be about 12 percent, depending
essentially on the success of the rural development project. The project's
overall economic rate of return is about 13 percent. Social benefits to be
derived from the road cannot be quantified but are expected to be considerable.
Among these are road user time savings and better access to social facilities.
Risks
39.       There are no major technical risks involved in the proposed project,
and provisions have been made for an adequate preparation to minimize subse-
quent project implementation delays which would increase costs and postpone
benefits. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out, considering the risks of
lower than expected benefits, and the results are still satisfactory. Should
lower than expected traffic growth and/or unit vehicle operating savings
reduce benefits by 20 percent, the rate of return of the resealing and patching
component would be about 28 percent, and of the improvement component, 10
percent. Should the integrated rural development project planned for the
Nioumakele area be postponed, the rate of return for the related road cons-
truction to be financed by the African Development Fund could be as low as 8
percent, but it is expected that the project, which is proposed for IDA
financing, will proceed as scheduled.
40.       However, Government may face some difficulties with the recruitment
of necessary qualified staff and with Bank Group procedures, since this would
be Comoros' first Bank Group-financed project. The possible shortage of local
funds for financing even the small portion of local costs required under the
project, is also a risk.  However, project preparation has been satisfactory,
and the implementation schedule adopted seems realistic. Close supervision
during project implementation will be undertaken.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Federal Islamic
Republic of the Comoros and the Association, and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment of the Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.



- 13 -
42.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the usual pattern
of agreements on highway projects. Special conditions of the project are
listed in Section III of Annex III. Fulfillment of all conditions precedent to
disbursement of the OPEC Special Fund loan is a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed credit (Section 6.01, draft Development Credit Agreement).
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
