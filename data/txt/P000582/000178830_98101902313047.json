and of an integrated rural\n            development project. Major components are: (i) road\n            construction (about 20 km) and supervision; (ii)\n            establishment and operation of one road improvement unit,\n            two patching units and one resealing unit; (iii) improving\n            mechanical workshops and equipping a soils laboratory; (iv)\n            technical assistance and training; and (v) feasibility study\n            and detailed engineering for a future highway project, and\n            preinvestment study for a future integrated rural\n            development project."}, "docdt": "1978-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
