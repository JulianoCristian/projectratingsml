satisfactory.\n            However, the present uncertainty in Venezuela, which is\n            described in greater detail in the report, makes it\n            difficult to predict project sustainability in the medium\n            term. Therefore, the more conservative unlikely rating is\n            chosen to characterize project sustainability. The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            considered satisfactory overall. Lessons learned included\n            the following:  1) The pace and sequencing of\n            decentralization should be commensurate with the capacity of\n            sector institutions at the central and local government\n            levels: Political decentralization took place without fully\n            considering the potential impact of decentralizing road\n            management to the states. In this manner, the sequencing of\n            road sector decentralization diverges with international\n            best practice of first creating the appropriate institutions\n            and the corresponding financing mechanisms at the central\n            level and then setting up the local entities to carry out\n            administrative, technical, and operational activities for\n            road management. Contrary to its original intention, the\n            government did not establish a road network for national\n            interest in which the central government would retain some\n            management responsibilities, nor did it define a plan to\n            share responsibilities and resources with the states. The\n            central government should have also retained greater control\n            over coordination and planning for the national road network\n            to ensure adequate integration and continuity of activities\n            among the states. 2) The appropriate sector financing\n            mechanisms need to be in place prior to political\n            decentralization: Decentralization was carried out without\n            the establishment of appropriate financing mechanisms for\n            road maintenance activities. A road fund was designed under\n            the project, but was not approved by the National Congress\n            by project end. As a result, the lack of sustainable sector\n            financing mechanisms has placed severe limits on resource\n            availability, constraining the ability of state governments\n            to manage and maintain their respective road networks. The\n            lack of sustainable financing mechanisms has made\n            decentralization more vulnerable to potential policy\n            reversals, especially during periods of political and\n            economic instability.  3) Project design needs to be\n            appropriate for political, institutional, and legal\n            realities: Project design was not appropriate given the\n            limited experience of the GoV in implementing Bank projects\n            in the sector as well as a number of uncertainties regarding\n            the decentralization agenda at the time of appraisal.\n            Moreover, project scope and size exceeded the absorptive\n            capacities of the Borrower, leading to the cancellation of\n            US$40.0 million of the original loan amount.  4) There is a\n            need to develop adequate capacity and improve coordination\n            in implementing simultaneous institutional strengthening\n            programs at the national and state levels. 5) Maintaining\n            continuity was an important factor in enabling the Bank to\n            build relationships with the Borrower over the long-term.\n            Throughout most of the project implementation period, the\n            composition of the Bank supervision team remained relatively\n            unchanged, with the same task manager during the entire life\n            of the project, from signing to closing, despite a number of\n            reorganizations within the Bank.  This allowed for the\n            comprehensive identification of Borrower needs as well as\n            the resolution of implementation difficulties."}, "docdt": "2003-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
