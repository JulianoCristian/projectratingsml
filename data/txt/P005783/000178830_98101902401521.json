Taiz-Al Mafraq road and restoration\n            of its drainage and stormwater protection facilities; and\n            (ii) provide technical assistance to the newly established\n            Department of Transport in the Ministry of Communications\n            and Transport. The project will benefit the producers and\n            consumers of the Taiz and Ibb Governorates through savings\n            in vehicle operating costs, and the Yemen Government by\n            limiting increases in road maintenance and repair costs."}, "docdt": "1982-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
