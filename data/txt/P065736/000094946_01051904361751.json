The project\n            supports a wide range of actions in the telecommunications,\n            information technology, and postal sectors, outlined in\n            section IV.B, in Annex 1 (Letter of Sector Development\n            Policy) and in Annex II (matrix of policy objectives and\n            actions). The development of a modern and diversified\n            information infrastructure will have a positive impact on\n            private sector development and economic growth, thus\n            contributing to poverty reduction. Extension of\n            communication and postal financial services to remote,\n            mainly rural areas will improve the living standards of the\n            rural population, thereby reducing the urban/rural gap."}, "docdt": "2001-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
