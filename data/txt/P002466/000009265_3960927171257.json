the agriculture sector. Food production would be raised\n            by about 5,600 smallholders through rehabilitation of a net\n            irrigated area of 5,100 ha in Farahaane, reconstruction of\n            two barrages, and strengthened services such as extension,\n            input supply, and on-farm trials and demonstrations. Special\n            emphasis would be given to strengthening the Department of\n            Irrigation and Land Use in the Ministry of Agriculture to\n            implement rehabilitation activities and simplified land\n            registration procedures. To ensure maintenance of irrigation\n            facilities rehabilitated under the project, cost recovery\n            mechanisms would be developed and water users organizations\n            would be strengthened to eventually take over the operation\n            and maintenance of the entire system."}, "docdt": "1989-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
