of Posts and Telecommunications responsible for all postal\n            and domestic public telecommunications services in the Ivory\n            Coast. The project, estimated to cost US$53.6 million, aims\n            to improve the present poor quality of service and meet\n            demand until 1980 in Abidjan and in 39 provincial towns by\n            expanding local and long distance facilities; in addition,\n            service will be extended to 21 rural localities that\n            presently have inadequate or no communications. The project\n            will include automatic switching equipment for about 39,000\n            exchange lines, the extension and rehabilitation of local\n            distribution networks, ten high-capacity microwave and two\n            very high frequency (30-300 MHz (VHF) links, additional\n            carrier equipment, telex facilities and related buildings,\n            power plants, equipment, training consultants, and expert services."}, "docdt": "1974-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
