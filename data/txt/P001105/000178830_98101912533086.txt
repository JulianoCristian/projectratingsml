AKZI 3TRATION DES POSTES ET TEL3CO&MUNICATIONS (APT)
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMTJNICATIONS PROJECT
SUIARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The project is the 1974-1978 telecommunications development
program of the Administration des Postes et Tlécommunications (APT),
a Government entity under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
responsible for all postal and domestic public telecommunications
services in the Ivory Coast. The project, estimated to cost US$53.6
million, aims to improve the present poor quality of service and meet
demand until 1980 in Abidjan and in 39 provincial towns by expanding
local and long distance facilities; in addition, service will be extended
to 21 rural localities that presently have inadequate or no communications.
ii.       A Bank loan of US$25.0 million is proposed, which would cover
about 63e of the foreign and 47% of the total cost of the project.
iii.      This would be the Bank's first telecommunications project in
the Ivory Coast. The borrower would be the Government, and the project
would be executed by APT with the assistance of consulting engineers.
iv.       Since 1971, APT has been carrying out the first phase of a
development program originally intended to cover the period 1971 through
1975; the foreign costs of these works have been financed by suppliers
credits, French bilateral assistance, and APTts on>m resources.  APT has
now revised its requirements and established a program of works to be
executed from 1974 through 1978.  The 1974-1978 program comprises ongoing
works carried over from the earlier development program and new works to
be undertaken through December 1978.
v.        In the past APT has purchased its imported equipmenit either on
a negotiated contract basis or after limited competitive bidding. How-
ever, with the exception of contracts already awarded or equipment which,
for reasons of technical compatibility must be obtained from existing
suppliers, the Government has now decided to go to international competi-
tive bidding, with Bank financing, for all other equipnent to be imported
directly for the project. This is expected to result in decreases in
switching equipment prices compared iwith the high prices previously paid
and also have a downward influence on prices for equipnent to be procured
under negotiated contracts with existing suppliers.
vi.       The institutional development of APT has been allowed to lag
and at present the entity's internal organization is not equipped to meet



- ii -
the demarids being made upon it.  With the failure to progressively develop
its orgarization by way of experienced and adequately qualified managerial,
technical and financial staff, satisfactory planning systems, operational
routines and controls, APT now finds itself with many institutional pro-
blems, some of which are serious. APT requires long term institutional
assistance and policy guidance. The proposed project, supported by the
Bank, will help to bring about the improvements that are critical if the
entity is to adequately fulfil-1 its role in the telecoamunications sector.
vii.      Although postal operations are carried out at a loss, because
of its profitable telecommunications operations APT is earning a surplus
from its overall operations. However, owing to delays in subscriber
billing, poor collection procedures, non-payment of Government bills and
lack of adequate financial and budgetary control, APT has a serious liqui-
dity problem and is relying heavily on the overdrâft facilities available
fro-m the National Treasury.
viii.     The project is technically sound and financially and economically
justified; it would provide support for the Government's development schemes
for industry, commerce, agriculture and tourism. The project would also
contribute to the expansion of administrative, public health and social
services in rural areas and the integration of remote areas into the national
econormy. The return on investment is estimated to be at least 22%.  Owing
to the time lag between the commissioning of new plant and the buildup of
related revenues, APT's financial rate of return on net telecommunications
assets, presently about 20%, is expected to decline considerably until 1978.
Thereafter, with the additional revenue accruing from plant installed under
the project the rate of return should improve again.
ix.       The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$25.o million having a terzm of 20 years vith a five-year grace period.

AMINISTRATION DES POSTES ET TELECOMMUNICATIONS (APT)
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMLNICATIONS PROJECT
1.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Ivory Coast has asked the Bank to help
finance the 1974-1978 telecommunications development program of its
Administration des Postes et Télécommunications (APT), the entity res-
ponsible for postal and domestic telecommunications in the Ivory Coast.
1.02      In 1970, following studies carried out by the French engineer-
ing consultants, Societe Française d'Etudes et de Réalisations d'Equipe-
ments de Télécommunications (SOFRECOM), and the Italian financial con-
sultants, Societe Finanziaria Telefonica (STET), APT established a five-
year, 1971-1975, development program.  A first phase of that program,
financed by supplier credits, French bilateral assistance, and APT's own
resources is now under construction. In 1971 a Bank mission identified
a project within that program suitable for Bank financing however, APT
subsequently revised its requirementa and established a new 197h-1978
program to meet demand until 1980. This program, which is the project
proposed for Bank financing, would be the first telecommunications project
financed by the Bank in the Ivory Coast. As APT is a branch of
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Government would be the
borrower.
1.03      Preappraisal took place in December 1972, and was followed by
an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. J. G. Davis and G. A. V. Buttex
that visited the Ivory Coast in July/August 1973.
2.  THE ECONÇWY AND THE TELECOIHMUNICATIONS SECTOR.
The Economy
2.01      The Ivory Coast, with a land area of 324,000 km2, has a popula-
tion of about 5.4 million. Over the past six years the annual population
growth has been 3.3%; immigrants fram neighboring countries, attracted by
job opportunities, account for part of this high growth rate.  Twenty-three
percent of the population is urban, of whom about half (600,000) live in
Abidjan, the capital and principal town. The 1970 GDP per capita was about
US$310; this was surpassed by only a few countries in Africa. Ivory Coast
economic growth in the first decade of independence has been spectacular;
to 1970 the average annual increase of GDP in real terms has been about
7.5%. Although it is estimated that there has been some slowdown in the
growth of the economy since that time the prospects for a sustained 6%
annual growth remain good.

The Telecommunications Sector
a) The Institutions
2.02      At independence in 1960, the autonomous Office des Postes et
Télecommunications de Cote d'Ivoire (OPTCI) was created to take over
domestic telecommunications and postal services from the French adminis-
tration. Responsibility for international telecommunications was retained
by France Cable et Radio (FCR). In 1964 OPTCI became Administration des
Postes et Télécommunications (APT), a branch of the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications. International telecommunication services were oDerated
by FCR until 1969 when transferred to Société des Téléecommunications Inter-
nationales de Cote d'Ivoire (INTELCI) owned, 52% by the Government and 48,
by FCR. The present arrangement, APT for domestic, and INTELCI for inter-
national services is satisfactory. With the exception of the military,
Ministry of the Interior, civil aviation, and the railway and broadcasting
services, which have their own telecommunication networks, APT provides all
domestic telephone, telegraph and telex services. APT also operates the
usual postal services, a nationwide public checking account service and
the national savings bank. The operation of the highly technical domestic
telecommunication service jointly with the postal service is not entirely
satisfactory and should be reviewed at an appropriate time (see para. 5.02).
The internal organization of APT, so far as it concerns telecommunications,
is unsuited to meet operational demands; telecommunications tariff policy
requires review. Consequently APT needs considerable help in institution
building and policy making; its problems and deficiencies are such, however,
that to be effective this would have to be provided on a continuing long-
term basis.
2.03      Telecommunications policy is formulated by APT and approved by
the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and the Council of Ministers.
The Ministry is the licensing authority for the sector and also has repre-
sentatimn on the Board of INTEIC I. The institutional structure of APT is
discussed in paras. 5.01 to 5.04.
b)  Existing Telecommunications Facilities
2.0      Local Telephone Service - As of January 1, 1973, the Ivory Coast
had some 45,00o telephone stations connected to about 20,000 direct exchange
Unes of which about 60% were for business, 28% for residential and 12& for
other purposes,including administration. The telephone density of 0.8 per
population is higher than in most African countries and reflects the state
of development in the Ivory Coast particularly that in the Abidjan region
where about 74% of the country's direct lines are located and where the
telephone density is about 5.5 per 100. Annex I gives the comparative sta-
tistics for other countries, and basic data on APT's facilities are set out
in Annexes 3 and 4 and Maps IBRD 10684(R) and 10685(R). Ivory Coast has 22
automatic exchanges (12 in the Greater Abidjan area, 10 in provincial towns)
and 79 small manual exchanges in the provinces. Total effective terminal
capacity of the Abidjan exchanges is about 177,400 lines, and tne total nuumber
of connected direct lines about 15,000 lines.  This is a high rate of exchange



- 3 -
fill and leaves little margin for expansion.  Total capacity of the pro-
vincial exchanges is 7,700 lines (4,500 automatic, 3,200 manual) and
5,100 direct lines are connected. Owing to lack of switching, junction
and local distribution facilities, local telephone service is generally
poor.
2.05      Long Distance Service - APT has a long distance network con-
sisting of about 110,000 channels-km. High-capacity microwave links (53o')
and overhead lines  supplemented with carrier equipmnt (39v), provide
the greater part of the network, the remainder consists of HF links and
long distance cable. AIl the principal regional centers have long distance
service with Abidjan, but due largely to lack of switching equipment ser-
vice is only fair.  Service to rural areas is poor and many areas are with-
out telecommunications facilities.
2.06      Telegraph and Telex Services - APT has no separate telegraph
network and domestic telegraph service is provided through the telex and
telephone facilities. Telex service is provided by a 500-line exchange
located in Abidjan; as of January 1, 1973, APT had 400 telex subscribers
in Abidjan and 36 in the provinces.
2.07      International Services - International telephone, telegraph,
telex and eata transmission services are provided by INTELCI, either through
earth satellite station or by HF radio circuits.
Sector Development Objectives
2.08      Principal sector objectives during the construction period of
the proposed project, 1974-1978, are to:
(i)  expand and improve the facilities in Abidjan and the principal
urban areas in order to provide an adequate level of service
and to Teet demand, particularly that froin commerce and
industry, until 1980;
(ii) improve the facilities in regional areas to provide necessary
support for the Government's regional development efforts;
(iii)  extend and improve services to rural communities, in order
to support agricultural diversification and the integration
of remote areas into the economy;
(iv) improve the quality of transmission and speed of connection
in long distance service; and
(v)  establish and commence to inplement a long-term program for
improving the internal organization and operational policies
of APT's telecommunications services.

currently obtained under international competitive bidding for switching
equipment in West Africa,and for other items of equipment outside West
Africa.  Costs for items to be financed from sources other than the Bank
are based on the prices included in firm contracts made by APT, or on
current prices in West Africa. Contingencies have not been added to
items which are to be procured under firm contracts or extensions to
existing contracts; the cost estimates for these items, whi¢h total
US$13.0 million, include escalation provisions. For all other items, a
5% physical contingency has been provided to cover unforeseen design and

engineering modifications, and price contingencies of between 9% and 46%,
depending on the purpose and year of expenditure, have been added to cover
unforeseen increases in prices.  During negotiations Governaent oonfirmed
that APT would be relieved of customs duties and import taxes on equipment
imported for the project.  APT vill however pay local taxes aaountzng to
about US$1.6 million on vorks related to the project; this exjpees eWhich
has been included in the financial plan, vill be met from APT s own resources.

Procurement
3.06      Bank-financed items - All goods financed by the Bank would be
procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Guidelines for Procurement.
3.07      Other items - 7,100 lines of automatic switching equipment, six
microwave links, and telex equipment have already been ordered under firm
contracts through bilateral assistance arrangement or suppliers crodits;
9,900 lines of automatic switching equipment to be installed in 1977 and
1978, and financed from APT's internal resources will, for rea.ons of
standardization, be procured from the suppliers of the 7,100 lines on a
negotiated contract basis. Contracts fqr project buildings and civil works
would be awarded under the Governient's standard tendering procedures which
are acceptable.
Implementation
3.08      APT would require assistance for the detailed engineering, pro-
curement and supervision of installations involved under the project.
Consequently, during negotiations Government agreed that APT would appoint
experts, employed either directly or through consulting firms, in accordance
with ternms of reference acceptable to the Bank, to advise on the detailed
engineering and preparation of specifications and bidding documents, to assist
in the evaluation of bids, and to supervise construction; furthermore, it was
agreed that if the Government and the Bank deem it necessary an experienced
engineer wolild be appointed to assist APT's management in the coordination
ane implementation or the project.
3.09      Suppliers would install the main equipment (exchange installa-
tions, microwave links) under the supervison of the experts. The suppliers'
contracts would specifically provide for APTts staff to be trained in
installation, testing and maintenance. Larger civil works and buildings
would be constructed by contractors, smaller works and buildings by APT's
building division. Gable laying would be undertaken by local contractors
and APT force account. Subscriber installations would continue to be under-
taken partly by APT directly and partly by local contractors-until these
operations are entirely taken over by APT's staff (see para. 5.10).
3.10      A construction schedule for the project is at Annex 6.  The
project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1978.
Disbursement
3.11      The proposed loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of
imported equipment and the foreign cost of consultant services and training.
An estimated schedule of disbursement is at Annex 7. The use of any unused
loan funds would be subject to agreement with the Bank; in view of APT's
expansion requirements it would appear that a case could be made for using
them in the purchase of additional goods and services similar to those
procured under the proposed loan.

h. JUSTIFICATION
Support of Country's Economic Development
4.01      In order to sustain the current momentum of economic growth
Government is proceeding with a number of important development schemes;
several of these are supported by the Bank. Many schemes are aimed at
the further diversification of agriculture and involve opening up new
areas such as the southwest; others are concerned with developing the
north which in the past has benefitted less than southern areas from
C-overnment's development efforts.  Other schemes are directed at indus-
trialization with emphasis on exports, and the expansion of tourism. A
good telecommunications service is an essential to the success of these
projects.  Unfortunately, in recent years domestic telecommunications
services in the Ivory Coast have failed to keep pace with the demands
of a booming economy and the lack of good telecommunications is becoming
a serious development constraint.  The project, by providing the facil-
ities necessary to meet present and anticipated demand through 1980,
would remove this constraint. The project would improve and extend long
distance services and provide new rural development areas with service;
mainly improving administrative and social services in these areas and
generally helping to assimilate and integrate the remote areas into the
mainstream of the economy.
h.02      About 71&% of the 39,000 local service lines to be provided under
the project would be installed in the Abidjan area and would mainly meet
the needs of coamerce, industry, tourism and administration (see para. h.06).
The new microwave links which would connect Abidjan with the northern,
eastern and western regions would later be extended to form part of the
Pan-African links with Liberia, Guinea and Ghana.  Current Governnent plans
provide for the large hinterland to the new port of San Pedro, situated in
the west of the country, to be extensively developed for palm oil, cocoa,
rubber, fruit, mining and timber. To meet the needs of this area local
telephone service in 13 important regional centers is to be automatized
and expanded, regional long distance services upgraded, and new routes to
6 rural areas built; a small telex exchange is to be installed at the
port of San Pedro.  To meet the development needs of the cotton, and sugar
growing areas and the expanding textile industries in the northern and
central regions, major microwave links from Abidjan are to be brought into
service in 1974, local telephone service in ten regional centers is to be
automatized and expanded, regional long distance routes upgraded, and new
routes to seven rural areas built; a small telex exchange is to be installed
at the important textile center of Bouaké.  To serve the needs of the southern
and eastern regions, where there is extensive cocoa and coffee production
in addition to an expanding textile industry, a microwave link to Abidjan
is to be built, local telephone service in 11 provincial towns is to be
automatized and expanded, the capacity of five important regional long
distance routes expanded, and new routes to three rural areas built. In the
tourism areas of' the northwest and south, local services are to be automa-
tized and expanded, and new routes to four rural areas built.



-9-
Support of Institutional Improvements in the Telecommunications Sector
4.03      The proposed Bank loan of U $125.0 million would finance about
6_- of the foreign cost of the project and would bring about major benefi ial
changes in APT procurement policy, since a substantial portion of imported
plant would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines; previously APT had purchased its imported equip-
ment either on a negotiated contract basis or after limited competitive bidding.
it is expected that the changes would result in significant decreases in
switching equipment prices compared with the high prices previously paid,
and also have a downward influence on prices for equipment to be procured
under negotiated contracts (see para. 3.07).
4.oh      APT requires long term institutional assistance and policy
guidance. The proposed project supported by the Bank will help to bring
about the institutional improvements that are critical if APT is to meet
the Ivory Coastts telecommunications need.
hlarket Demand
4.05      Demand forecasts are based on APT's block-by-block detailed
subscriber network development plan for the Abidjan region and a SOFRECCHl
ten-year demand study for the provincial urban areas that was completed in
1970. Tlhese provide a satisfactory basis for projecting demand forecasts.
tWhile the study showed that there exists in the provincial urban areas a
potential growth of 14-15% per year, owing to the high tariffs and poor
service, actual growth has only been about 10-11% per year.
4.06      Local Service - Although projected demand in the Abidjan region
varies between exchange areas it is forecast that demand in the region will
increase by an average of about 14% per year until 1980. This compares with
a growth of 13% per year over the last decade. Review of the exchange areas
indicates that about 65-70% of the 29,000 lines proposed for installation
under the project will be for industrial, commercial and tourism purposes,
25-30,' for residential and 5% for administrative and other purposes.  APTts
high tariffs are a constraint to any significant increase in the proportion
of residential subscribers.
4.07      With the conversion of local automatic services from manual to
automatic working, the provision of high quality transmission links to
Abidjan and subscriber trunk dialling, demand in the 31 provincial urban
areas concerned is expected to increase to 12% per year. Local service
would be provided under the project to 21 new rural areas; the installa-
tions would be minimal and provide mainly for administration, social
services, requested lines, and a public telephone. Exchange capacities
in cach area will generally not exceed 10 lines.
h.o8      Long Distance Service - Forecasts of the traffic and circuit
requirements of the new microwave and VHF links and for the carrier
systems on open-wire routes were made by S(FRECCM in 1970 and were based
on trafiic studies. Taking into account the effect of improved quality
of service following installation of the new equipment, it is estimated
that long-distance traffic will increase annually through 1980 by about



- 10 -
15$.  This estimate is in conformity with experience under similar cir-
cunstances irn other developing countries. The expansion program is designed
to meet this traffic growth.  Five of the new microwave links included in
the project (three are nearing completion), are to form part of the Pan-
African network.
Least-Cost Solution and OPtimization of Pro.ject Construction Period
4.09      APT's furdamental network plans, which are satisfactory, were
dr&wn up some years ago to provide for continuous expansion based on long-
term demand. Numbering, transmission, and routing plans have been care-
ful-Ly considered and are appropriate for the country. The choice of the
common control systems, made in 1961, is sound and the principal long
distance routes are being established to provide for easy and economic
expansion.
4.10      The planning of the local network and local exchanges in the
Abidjan region has been based on a study of telephone demand (see para.
h.05) to provide the least combined cost for local network and switching
eouipment. The size and timing of the additions to the switching system
have been related to the demand and to the lead time required before further
additional equipment can be installed under a next phase of development.
The small exchanges for provincial towns have been designed in accordance
with standard plant practices to provide for least cost.
h.11      Automatic service offers economy in operations, speed in connec-
tion and constant day and night service; automatic local switching systems
in the range of exchange sizes required for the principal towns, while re-
quiring an additional 10% investmnent as compared with manual systems, have
lower operating costs which more than compensate for the higher initial
investment, in addition they have greater flexibility. Automatic long dis-
tance switching systems require lower overall investment (including buildings)
than a manual system; in addition, operating costs are lower.  Manual systems
recuire skilled and reliable operating and supervisory staff, which is some-
times scarce, and when available could be better utilized in other fields
of activity. Costs of ticketing manual calls are higher than metered calls
and losses of revenue through unrecorded calls are not infrequent.
4.12      The choice of microwave systems for the  ten routes, compared
with the alternative system (coaxial cable), represents the least-cost
solution after considering such factors as physical features along the
routes, future capacity requirements and maintenance difficulties in the
areas concerned. For similar reasons, the choice of VHF for the new
S. Pedro/Buyo and Tabou/Grabo routes, as compared with open-wire line,
represents the least-cost solution.
h.13      The length of the construction period, size, and cost of the
project have been determined after review of APT's   technical
and financial resources, demaznd, the time required to order, manufacture;
and instaIl the plant, and prices.  The-proUect has been drawn up to
zchieve both a lowering of -unit costs through the benefit of bulk buying;



- il -
and the optimization of the project construction period with equipment use.
As regards the latter, the five-year period selected achieves this balance
and is consistent with normal telecommunication planning practice.
Return on Investment
4.14      The internal rate of return on the project, defined as the dis-
count rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues.attributable
to the project with the capital and operating costs excluding taxes, is
22p (Annex 8). A sensitivity analysis shows that the rate of return would
be 21% if a one year delay occurs in project completion, and 17% if cons-
truction costs increased and revenues decreased by 15%. Should a variation
of +10% in revenues occur the rate of return would be between 20' and 24%.
4.15      The true economic return on the project is however undoubtedly
higher than the foregoing suggest since (a) the prices charged,even though
high,do not adequately measure the full benefits to subscribers, particu-
larly those obtaining access to service for the first tiTme, (b) there are
external benefits which accrue to parties other than those who pay direct-
ly for use of the facilities, and (c) the costs include the full cost of
extending service to new areas even though the full benefits will be ob-
tained only in the future when additional lines are connected in those areas.
5.  TIE BENEFICIARY (APT)
Organization and Management
5.01      APT was established on February 20, 1964 and is a branch of the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.  APT's crief executive is the
Director-General and he is responsible to the Minister. APT has six de-
partments, Postal/Financial and Telecommunications are operational, and
the remainder - Buildings/Transport, Budget/Accounts, Personnel and In-
struction - provide support services; each is headed by a director. An
organization chart is at Annex 2.  The Postal/Financial Department provides
routine postal services and offers quasi-banking services through its
money order (national and international), and checking account operations;
it also operates the National Savings Bank.
5.02      In the case of Ivory Coast the close integration of postal/fi-
nancial and telecommunications services appears not to work well. The
domestic telecommunications service promises to become a large enterprise
which, to obtain the maximum benefits, should as far as possible be operated
on commercial principles; for this, the service needs considerable expertise
in telocormunications management and a greater degree of financial autonomy
than at p;resent. During negotiations, the Government agreed to undertake
a study by qualified and experienced consultants not later than December 31,



- 12 -
1976, in accordance with terms of reference approved by the Bank., and
consult with the Bank on any desirable institutional changes for the
national telecommunications services.  A sum of US$50,o000 has been
included in the proposed loan to cover the estimated foreign costs of
the study.
Staff and Training
5.03      on the top management level, the Director and the two senior
engineers of the Telecommunications Department are Ivorians; a further two
Ivorian engineers are receiving training abroad. While academically qua-
lified, this senior staff lack experience, particularly in management.
The Department would thus need during the projectts construction period
the technical assistance described in para. 3.08.
5.o4      At the operational level APT has 60 supervisory staff; 36 are
Ivorian and 24 French expatriates; the latter also perform advisory func-
tions. This level of supervisory staff is appropriate for the scale of
APT operations and given the proposed expansion of operations and develop-
ment will have to be maintained. Considering the scarcity of qualified
Ivorian staff, it would therefore be prudent during the construction period
of the project that the present level of expatriate assistance be retained.
During negotiations Government agreed that APT would (a) maintain a level
of qualified staff in adequate proportion to its operations,and (b) by
December 31, 1975 prepare and thereafter implement a program for the selec-
tion and training of Ivorian staff to tale over supervisory duties now per-
formed by expatriates.
5.05      The permanent staff of APT's Telecormunications Department numbers
about 1,370 (or 30 per 1,000 telephones) and another 300 are employed on a
daily basis. Even after taking into account that a number of services,
including PBX and extension telephone installation and maintenance, some
cable laying and jointing, are undertalcen by private contractors, the overall
number of staff employed by APT on telecommunications compares favorably with
similar entities in other developing countries. Analysis of staff categories
indicates, however, that to meet the needs of the project APT will have to
recruit additional skilled staff particularly in the technical and accounting
fields (see paras. 5.13 to 5.15).
5.06      APT engineers and senior technicians are trained outside the Ivory
Coast, mostly in France. Junior technicians are trained at the Abidjan
national telecommunications school and the multi-national UNDP-financed
school in Rufisque, Senegal. Generally speaking the facilities available
for training technical staff in West Africa are adequate, although it will
be necessary to send staff overseas for specialized technical courses.
5.07      Provision has been made in the proposed loan to cover the foreign
costs of needed additional overseas training (see Annex 5). Such training
would include investment and network planning and financial management and
planning. Provision has also been made for the foreign cost of training
given to APT staff by the firm engaged to establish APT's new accounting
department (see para. 5.13).



- 13 -
5-08      APT salary levels for certain supervisory staff, especially
accountants and skilled technicians, are not competitive with those of
similar staff in the private sector.  Xoreover, promotion prospects
within sorme APT services are less favorable than in other branches of the
public sector, and these deficiencies have caused APT difficulty in re-
cruiting and retaining staff. During negotiations Government agreed that
within one year of loan signing APT would review the grading and promotion
policies for APT telecommunications staff, following which the Government
would consult with the Bank, and within a reasonable period of time take
such necessary measures regarding the policies required to attract and
retain qualified personnel for APT.
Investment Planning
5.09      APT's telecommunications investment planning requires improve-
ment. During negotiations, the Government agreed that APT would strengthen
the Planning and Studies Office of the Telecommunications Department.
Subscribers Installation and Maintenance Services
5.10      Presently, the installation and maintenance of extension lines
and private branch exchanges (PBXs) is carried out partly by APT and partly
by private contractors; such work is highly remunerative.  Since APT could under-
take all this work, with the exception of medium and large-sized PBXs, with-
out major new investment, the Bank has advised APT to progressively take over
the installation and maintenance of all subscriber extension lines and small
PBXs/1 (see para. 3.09).
Accounting
5.11      APTts general accounting and budgeting is unsatisfactory.  APT
has no qualified accounting staff and its financial accounts are delayed,
incorrect and incomplete; operating accounts for individual services are
not maintained, and the basic essential information for good financial
control is not available.  Methods of budget preparation, presentation and
control are equally unacceptable.
5.12      After Government became aware of the above deficiencies it engaged
a French firm, IMessrs. Guerard and Vallas in early 1973, to prepare the 1971
and 1972 accounts. Government has also engaged, with French bilateral assist-
ance,and in consultation with the Bank, French management consultants, IDET-
CEGOS, to prepare and implement a new accounting system suitable for APTts
multiple operations which will provide separate operating results for each
of AI'T's services. The work of IDET-CEGOS will cover only a part of the
required improvements, however, complete reorganization of AI'T's accounting
operations on a commercial basis is required urgently. To provide for such
a reorganization, during negotiations, Government agreed that APT would:
/1 Up to ten lines.



- 1h -
(î)  reinforce no later than December 31, 1974 its accounting
department to be headed by a qualified professional assisted
by an adequate number of suitably trained staff to take res-
ponsibility for implementing and operating satisfactory
accounting and budgeting systems;
(ii) engage professional accountants to set up and maintain the
accounting systems until the arrangements in (i) are fully
operative, including:
(a)  establishing as from January 1, 1975, accounts
showing separate operating results and financial
positions of the postal/financial and telecommu-
nications services;
(b)  recording, valuing and where necessary apportion-
ing between postal/financial and telecommunications
services all fixed assets existing as of January 1,
1975;
(c)  establishing in APT satisfactory systems for budget
preparation and control by December 31, 1975;
(d)  establishing in APT appropriate systens of inventory
accounting by December 31, 1976; and
(e)  assisting in the establishing of the new department,
including the training of staff.
Telecomnunications Billing and Collection
5.13      The problems of APT's telecommunication billing and collection
are set out in Annex 17. Unsatisfactory telecommunications billing has
been creating serious liquidity problems and is the main cause for the
heavy borrowing by APT of Treasury funds.  Recent information indicates
some improvement in this field, however during negotiations Government
agreed that APT would:
(i) within six months of loan signing employ experts satis-
factory to the Bank to review the computer progran for
APT's billing operations to ensure correct and efficient
billing and accurate revenue accountiing;
(ii)  within six months of loan signing employ an expert, satis-
factory to the Bank, to (a) supervise and improve billing,
collection, and revenue accounting at APT's headquarters,
and (b) prepare for agreement with the Bank a timetable
for effecting the required improvements in APT's revenue
operations; and



- 15 -
(iii) within one year of loan signing take measures, satisfactory
to the Bank, to strengthen and then maintain qualified staff
in charge of APTts billing, collection and revenue operations.
Audit
5.14      Financial control is weak; the internal audit is unsatisfactory
and an external audit of the accounts has never been made. During nego-
tiations Goverrment agreed that APT would (i) establish by December 31,
1975, an independent internal audit unit, satisfactory to the Bank,
whose chief would report directly to APTts Director-General; (ii) engage
independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, to conduct annual audits
of APT's accounts; and (iii) submit to the Bank certified financial state-
ments and auditors' report within six months of the end of each fiscal
year.
Tariffs
5.15      APT tariffs are recommended by the Minister of Posts and Tele-
cormmunications and fixed by the Council of Ministers. APT's telecommuni-
cation tariffs (see Annex 9) are generally comparable with those of the
other francophone West African countries, but very high compared with
tariffs elsewhere; for example, the charge  for local telephone calls is
US012 compared with US02-6 in most developing countries.  Tariffs include
a number of unusual features, including anomalies in the call charges and
exceedingly high connection fees for manual subscribers. Since manual
subscribers are located in the provincial towns and rural areas the high
charges are not conducive to development in those areas. With respect to
interstate traffic within the francophone zone APT foll._ows tariff policies
recommended by the Confd'rence Africaine des Postes et Télécommunications
des Etat3 de L'Afrique Occidentale (CAPTEAO).
5.16      APT tariffs need early review but before this is possible Govern-
ment must agree the objectives of any new telecommunications tariff policy,
and APT must have established accurate telecommunication service accounts
and collated information on the pattern of telephone usage, including the
economic status of users, the purposes for iwhich calls are made, and the
importance of communications for regional development. As the 1975 audited
accounts for APT's telecommunication services could be available by June 30,
1976, Goverruent agreed during negotiations that APT would undertake and
complete a study of telephone usage and the economic benefits of the tele-
communication services, not later than December 31, 1976 and a tariff
study not later than June 30, 1977; and that both studies would be in
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.  The Governnent
also agreed that no changes would be made in APT's telecommunication
tariffs until the tariff review had been completed and a course of action
discussed and agreed with the Bank.

Pôstal/Financial Department
/1
5.17      APT's Postal/Financial Department operates at a loss- ; one of
the main reasons for this is the heavy costs of operating the public
cheeking account service. In addition, the Departioent has other finan-
cial problems not least of which are an unusually large amount of unpaid
receivables and a shortage of working capital. A comprehensive review,
covering operations, staffing, financial arrangements, unpaid receivables,
the use and deposit of funds, and the cash cover required for public check-
ing account and money order transactions would appear to be long overdue.
During negotiations, the Government agreed that APT would employ qualified
and experienced consultants to complete a review of APT's postal/financial
services by December 31, 1976, and then after consultation with the Bank
implement the measures necessary for improving the operations and finances
of those services.
6. FINANCES
6.01      With an estimated financial rate of return of about 20% APTIs
telecommunication services are very profitable and contrast with its
postal/financial services which are operated at a loss.  In recent years
telecommunication surpluses have more than covered the losses and invest-
ment requirements of the postal/financial services. Nonetheless, APT's
overall financial position is unsatisfactory; the entity has a serious
liquidity problem and has had to take up large overdrafts from Government
to maintain operations and carry out modest development. This sitiùation
bas been caused by delays, o! as much as one yeare in billing telecommu-
nications subscribers, poor collection procedures, non-payment by the
Government of its bills, and generally poor financial and budgetary con-
trols.  APT urgently needs additional long-tenm capital to implement its
programs of administrative and institutional improvement as well as a
major physical development program.
Telecommunications - Past Finances
6.02      In the absence of accurate and separate accounts, the estimated
Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Sources and Applications of Funds
Statements for APT's Telecommunications Department for the period 1970-1973
/1 Financial aspects of APT's postal/financial operations are dealt with
in Annexes 18 to 21.

and which appear irn Annexes 10, 11 and 12 were prepared on a pro-eorma
basis from existing financial data, supplemented and amended by îiiforma-
tion received from ?enior staff. Between 1970 and 1973 APT's overall
telecommunications revenue increased by about 13% per year, and aVerL._
gross plant added wâs about 11% annually.  In the same period net income
from operations rose from CFAF 807 million to CFAF 1256 million, the tele-
communications operating ratio fell from 68 to 64, and the estimated rate
of return on telecomunications net fixed assets increased from about 17%
to 20%.
6.03      In contrast to the above, the Department's Balance Sheet reflects
APT's serious liquidity problem.  As of December 31, 1973, unpaid subscriber
accounts alone amounted to about CFAF 7.4 billion (US$30 million), equiva-
lent to about two and a half years of telephone revenue, and of which about
50% was due from the Government. Delayed billings are expected to result
in collection losses amounting to about CFAF 1 billion (US$4 million) in
private subscribers debts. APT's Governrnent overdraft pertaining to tele-
communications as of end-1973, amounted to about CFAF 4.8 billion (US$19
million), although as telecommunications accounts are not kept separately
this figure does not show independently in APT accounts.
6.oh      Below, the financing of APT's telecommunication services during
the four years 1970-1973 is summarized:

TOTAL                  4,o61
In the past four years about 25% of telecommunications development has been
financed by long and medium term borrowings; as telecommunication services
were highly profitable APT should have been able to finance the remaining
75% of capital investment as well as debt service and postal/financial
losses from its own resources and still have shown reasonable surplus.
However, owing to poor billing and collection described above, APT was
forced to resort to Government overdrafts to meet operational and develop-
ment requirements.



- 18 -
6.05      Government is APTts principal debtor due both to billing delays
and failure to pay fully the bills subnitted for settlement.  Therefore,
d-ring negotiations, Governrent agreed that it would settle its telecom-
munication debts as of December 31, 1973 by four equal annual install-
ments terminating in 1977 and settle all bUils for future telecomnunica-
tions services within 90 days of their presentation.
6.06      The APT practice of automatically charging the losses and invest-
ment requirements of the Postal/Financial Department against telecommuni-
cation surpluses militates against operational and development efficiency
and good financial management. It is essential that the two Departments
be financially autonomous and transfers of funds between the two be the
subject of properly prepared action the implications of which are critically
analyzed. During negotiations Government agreed that (i) APT would use
telecommunications funds for other purposes only when those funds were
surplus to telecommunications operational, debt service, and investment
requirements  and (ii) in the event of lisufficient funds being aviilable
for any of APT's operations and inves tuant it Yould take steps,8 satisfactoy-
to the Bank, to cover the deficit.
6.07      The capitalization of APT's Telecommunications Department as of
December 31, 1973, has been estimated conservatively as follows:

6.09      Analysis shows that APT would require continued financing
assistance from Government until 1976.  During negDtiations, the Govern-
ment agreed to continue to give Treasur7 support to APT to enable it to
meet cash requirements for day-to-day operational and development needs
until the entity has established a cash position satisfactory to the Bankc.
Furthermore, at negotiations the Government agreed that during the project
construction period APT will undertake no capital expenditure for telecom-
munications, in addition to that included in the 1974-1978 program, in any
one year in excess of US$400,000 without a financing plan approved by the
Bank.
6.10      Initially, APT's 1974-1978 program provided for the construction
of a high-rise building to accommodate postal/financial and telecomunica-
tions technical and administrative staff in Abidjan; the estimated cost
of CFAF 1 billion (US$4 million) was to have been met from APT's internal
resources. During negotiations Government asked that the building be
taken out of the program since it had no immediate intention of starting
construction and that completion of it within the project period was uncer-
tain. The Government however agreed that it would consult with the Bank
before deciding on the construction of the building and also present a
financing plan for it if construction is to be undertaken prior to
December 31, 1975.

Telecommunications - Future Finances
6.11      Forecast Income Statements and Balance Sheets for 1974-1980 for
the Telecommunications Department are given in Annexes 10 and 11 vith rela-
ted notes in Annex 13. As shown below, net income is forecast to grow at
a satisfactory rate throughout the period; thereafter, further imp.rovement
should occur follawing commissioning of new facilities.  Liquidity is
estimated to show significant improvement after 1975 and should reach a
satisfactory level by the end ôf FY 1978.

6.12      Major assumptions used in the forecasts are that in the five-year
period through 1978 telephone revenue would increase by about 12% annually;
telex service revenue by 12v;3 and because of improved telephone facilities
telegraph revenue increases would be liuited to 1% and 3%, respectively,
for 1975 and 1976. Salaries are projected to increase at 10-12'M per year
through 1978 and other operating expenses by 12½-15%.  On this basis the
operating ratio is expected to increase froin 64 in 1973 to 70 in 1978, after
which, with higher revenues the ratio should improve to 66 in 1980.
6.13      The rate of return on telecommunications net fixed assets in
operation is expected to fall from about 20% in 1973 to 12% in 1978 and then
rise to an estimated 14% in 1980 and to higher levels thereafter.  The tem-
porary downward trend is due to the time lag between the commissioning of
new plant and the build-up of related revenues. Returns during the project
construction period, which would average 15% on net fixed assets, would be
adequate to generate the cash needed for this period of heavy investment.
After 1978, assuming an annual growth of gross fixed plant investment of



- 21 -
about 10% and yearây surpluses, after meeting telecomunications :requiro-
ments, equivalent to the postal/financial services operational deficit
and investment requirements, a rate of return of not less than 10% would
be needed (see Annex 1h).  During negotiations the Government agreed
that, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank, APT would achieve a rate of
return of at least 10% per year after 1978.  On the basis of present
tariffs,projections indicate that the rate o return would exceed 10%
after 1978 and surpluses would be available for transfer to Government
or the reduction of tariffs.  Indicators which will help monitor APT's
performance are given in Annex 16.
6.14      Although throughout the program construction period debt service
coverage is expected to remain satisfactory, Government agreed during nego-
tiations that no new long-term debt for telecommunications would ke incurred
by APT without consulting with the Bank, unless the maximum future debt
service for telecommunications is covered by 1.5 times by net telecomiuni-
cations revenue before charging depreciation. Furthermore, Government
agreed that once APT establishes a satisfactory liquidity position, to
be defined in agreement with the Bank, short-term borrowing will be used
only for financing the normal working capital of telecommunications opera-
tions and will not exceed four monthst telecomnunications cash operating
expenses for the preceding fiscal year or for any 12-month period, which-
ever is the greater.
Fiscal Impact
6.15      Although during the five year period 1974-1978 APT's Telecom-
municatiqns Department would not pay customs duties on equipment imported
directly for the project it would contribute to Government revenues about
CFAF 405 (Us$1.6) million for local taxes related to construction works
of the project; in addition, it would contribute CFAF 2.0 billion (US$8
million) towards Postal/Financial Departxent deficits and investment
requirements.  Purthermore, by 1976 the telecommunications services would
no longer require short-term borrowing from the Treasury. Taking into
account the settlement of overdue Goverment debts, it is estimated that
between 1974 and 1978 there would be a net inflow to the Treasury of about
CFAF 2.7 billion (US$10.8 million) and the telecommunications services
would finance about 49% of a major progrun without recourse to the national
budget.

7.01      During negotiations, Government agreed that:
(i) qualified and experienced experts will be employed for the
detailed engineering of the project, and should the Govern-
ment and the Bank find it necessary, an experienced engineer
will be employed to assist in the coordination and implementa-
tion of the project (para. 3.08);
(ii)  a review will be made by qualified and experienced consul-
tants of any institutional changes required for the telecom-
munication services (para. 5.02);

when those fbmds are surplus to telecoemunications require-
ments; in the event of insufficient funds being available
for any of APT's operations and investment steps wll be taken
to cover the deficit (para. 6.06);
(xiii)  Treasury overdraft facilities vill continue to be made avail-
able to APT's telecommunication service until a satisfactory
cash position has been established and during implementation
of the project no additional capital expenditure above
US$40o,000 will be lncurred without a financing plan agreed
with the Bank (para. 6.09);

(xiv)  a decision on the construction of an administration building
will only be taken after consultation with the Bank and a
financing plan wvuld be presented to the Bank if construction
is to be undertaken before December 31, 1975 (para 6.10);
(xv) unless otherwise agreed, a rate of return of 10% per year
will be achieved after 1978 (para. 6.13); and
(xvi) limitation on long and short-term borrowings for tele<sommu-
nications operations will be observed (para. 6.14).
7.02      On the basis of the above arrangements, the project would be
suitable for a Bank loan of US$25.0 million.

*The following switching equipment is to be added in 1973:
Lines
Plateau II             1,500
Cocody                    350
Adjamd                    300
Koumassi                  500
2,650
(iii) The Abidjan Plateau I exchange is of the old French R6 system,
and because of its low traffic capacity, not more than 4,000 of the
6,500 installed lines will be connected in the future. This equip-
ment, which is of a type no longer manufactured, will probably be sub-
stituted in APT's next development program (after 1978). The urban
exchanges, Abidjan Plateau II and its satellite Canebière, KM4 and its
two satellites EM9 and Koumassi, Adjamé and Cocody use the Pentaconta
common control system. The suburban exchanges Bingerville, Bonoua,
Dabou and Grand Bassam are of rural type and have been installed in
recent years. The Pentaconta exchanges which were installed between
1962 and 1972 are in good order. The satellite exchanges, although
adequate for the earlier stages of APT's development, are unsuitable
for present traffic conditions and are the cause of switching diff'i-
culties in the Abidjan region.  Traffic per line is higher than that
for which the equipment has been designed, exchanges are overloaded,
and consequently service is poor, particularly during the busy hours.
The present facilities are insufficient to meet the requirements of
the expanding capital city particularly because of the poor condition
and insufficient capacity of the urban cable distribution network.
(iv)   The provincial automatic exchanges are all of the common control
system and have been installed within the past ten years. In accordance
with Ivory Coast Telecommunications Plan, the provincial exchanges at
Abengourou, Agboville, Dimbokro, Korhogo, Man and y-amassoukro should be
equipped as transit exchanges. However, at the time of procurement, and
mainly to reduce costs, APT ordered local exchanges with limited functions
for long distance traffic and without transit facilities.  This solution
is now seen to be inadequate and regular exchanges including transit
facilities must be installed to provide long distance dialling and to
permit the development of traffic with adjacent areas. Existing switch-
ing will be redeployed to other exchanges (see Annex 5).
(v)    Manual telephone service is offered in the provinces as follows:
Number of    Exchange       Total     Connected

Yearly growth of connected main lines in the Abidjan area averaged about
13% between 1963 and 1973. However, owing to the saturation of the
local distribution network and to delays in the execution of development
works growth fell to only 5% in 1972. In suburban Abidjan and in the
provinces annual growth of connected lines has averaged about 11%
since 1968.
2. Long Distance Service
(i)   The following large-capacity microwave links are in service:
Abidjan - Agboville
Abidjan - Digo - Gagnoa,
Digo - Dotenzia (Bouafle) - Bouaké'
Dotenzia (Bouaflé) - Daloa
Man - Odienne
(ii) The undermentioned large-capacity microwave links are under
construction and should be brought into service early in 1974:
Digo - San Pedro
Bouake - Kohrogo - Upper Volta Border
Agboville - Abengourou
Agboville - Bouaké
Abidjan - Dabou - Jaqueville
(iii) The transhorizon link Daloa - Man which provides inadequate
transmission quality will be reinstalled on a shorter distance after
completion of the proposed project.
(iv)  Present long distance facilities (see Map IBRD 10684R)consist of:
Microwave links                      - 58,000 channel-km
Carrier equipment on overhead lines - 43,200 channel-km
VHF links                            -  6,,60o channel-km
Long distance cables                 -  2,200 channel-km

pared with tariffs for similar services in other developing
coumtries.  Local calls are charged at about US¢12 in Ivory
Coast as compared with US02-6 in most countries.
(ii)  Billing to subscribers îs on a two months' cycle.  Automatic

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
1 . General
APT's accounting arrangements are unsatisfactory. The financial
accounts, which are delayed, are incorrect and incomplete.  The accounts
do not show the operating results and financial position for the respective
postal/financial and telecommunication services. The financial statements
in the report have been drawn up on a pro-forma basis from existing finan-
cial data supplemented and amended by information received from seniôr staff.
The following data relates to the main items of the Telecommuni-
cations Department's accounts shown in Annexes 10 and 11.
2. Statements of Ichome - Annex 10
(i) Telephone revenue
(a)  Forecasts of revenue from domestic services in the period
1974-1980 have been prepared after taking into account
(i) the average number of telephone lines estimated to be
put into service, and (ii) the estimated effect on revenue,
in the related regions, of the new long distance facilities
to be brought into service.
(b) International call revenue relates to terminal fees received
from INtTEICI. In general, APT receives 20% of the total
revenue from international calls made over the INTEIX
network.
(ii)  Telegraph revenue is expected to remain relatively stable during
the next four years and small overall increases of 1% and 3%
have been provided for in 1975 and 1976, respectively.
(iii)  Telex revenue has been forecast to increase at the following rates:
1974 - 1975     -     10%
1976 - 1978     -     15%
1979 - 1980     -     10%
(iv)  Salaries have on average been estimated to increase at about
10-12A per year through 1980.



ANNEX 1 3
Page 2 of 3 pages
(v)  Other Expenses are expected to increase  i  - 15% per year
through 1960.
(vi)  Depreciation - a composite rate of 41&  per annum on average
gross fixed assets has been assumed.
(vii)  Interest - charges i:clude interest on contracted loans and
supplier  credits together with the estimted interest charges
on the proposed Bank loan. A provision has also been included
for interest on further borewiçin    1972 and 1980. APT does
not capita ize interest during câstruction.
(viii) Non-operatila revenue relates mainly to license revenues.
(ix)  Contribution to Postal/Pinancial Department - the estimated
profits from telecommiunicatiÏos operations from 1970 through
1980 have been charged with thie estiznated deficits from postal
operations in those years.
3. Balance Sheets - Armex 11
(i)  Work in progress at the end of each year during the construction
period of the project has been related to the construction sehedule.
(ii)  Inventories have been gradually brought to a higier and more
reasonable level to moet the requireuents of expanded operations.
(iii) Government receivables - long-term - relate to the rescheduled
Government receivables (see para. 6.08).
(iv)  Treasury balance relates to the funds deposited by APT with the
National Treasury.
(v)  Receivables - Waeff ic          Mt-relate to teleconmunications
services rendered to the Goeenwrnnt by APT's Telecommunications
Department.  From 1973 to 1976 the figures iacnlude the current
portion of rescheduled long-tern GoverTiment receivables.
(vi)  Receivables - Trai  - Pvatrelate to telecommunications
services rendered to private subscribers. *n estimating the
figures it has been assvmed that APT will upd.ate its subscriber
billing by mid-1974 and that considerable imnprovement wibl be
made in private subscriber collections during 1974.
(vii) Receivables - Other-aiclude paymonts in advance, dowri payments
on contracts, and othee imiscellaneous debts such as those for
sale of materials.
(viii)  Reserve for Bd Debte - a provision of CPAF 1 billion (US$5
million) has been set up in 1971 to cover estimated collection
losses arising from delayed billing. It is expected that the
greater part of the sum wil-l be applied in 1975 to writing-off
bad debts.



ÂNk'EX 13.
Page 3 of 3 pages
(ix)  Subsidies relate mainly to contributions from FAC and the
Ivory Coast Government towards capital equipment purchases.
(x) Long-term debt - details of APT's long-term debt are given
in Annex 15.
(xi)  Treasury overdraft - COing to delayed billing and lack of
financial and budgetary control, APT has in recent years
incurred substantial overdrafts with the National Treasury
for its telecommunication services. It is expected that
with updated billing, an improved collection effort and the
settlement of Government debts, the overdrafts will be
eliminated by 1976.
(xii) Sbundry Creditors include accounts payable and receipts in
advance; the forecast figures provide for an increase of 5%
per year on these items.
(xiii) Subscriber deposits relate to deposits payable by private
subscribers as security for the payment of biU s. The
deposits are refundable on termination of service.

Financial Rate of Return - 1979-1983
1. *Based on available information and on present tariffs and after
making reasonable assumptions for APT's financial requirements during the
period 1979-1983, it is estimated that a rate of return of 10% on net
telecommunications fixed assets in operation would be required after 1978.
2.        In making these calculations it has been assumed that:
(i)  development over the five-year period 1979-1983 would provide
for an average growth of about 10% per year on gross fixed
plant in operation as of December 31, 1978;
(ii)  further borrowing of CFAP « .7 billion (US$23.0 million) would
be available; this would be equivalent to about"'k4 of total
investment requirements for the period 1979-1983; and
(iii)  the annual surplus, after meeting telecommunications require-
ments, would be equivalent to the Postal/Financial Department s
deficit and investment.
3.        On this basis a 10% rate of return would yield about CFAP 9,1400
billion (US$47 million) during the five-year period 1979-1983. The
estimated financing plan for the period would be as follows:
cFAF          CFAF
Rec~uiements~    roen(1979-983)   ---(millions)---
Requirements
Construction progrm  (1979-1983)         13,1400
t;ew program (19814-1988)                   200
Working capital                             500       14,100
Debt service                                           5,100
Surplus                                                2,500
Total requirements                          21.700
Sources
Future borrowings (US$23 million)                      5,700
Depreciation                                           6,100
Vet income after depreciation (10% rate of return)    9,900
Total sources                               21 * 700
APT would be financing about 60% of its program requirements, which compares
with 49% of the 1974-1978 program.
I4.       Present indications are that the net income would be in excess of
the above-mentioned requireuents after 1978; the rate of return would be
about 12% in 1979 and  14% in 1980. It would therefore remain for the
Government to decide whether to withdraw funds frorn APT or to reduce the
present high tariff level.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT
Telecommunications Billing and Collection
In 1969, following delays and inaccuracies in APT's manual
billing system, the then Director-General decided to undertake an imme-
diate computerization of telecommunications billing.  The changeover,
which lacked adequate study, planning and preparation, was a failure
and a reversion to manual billing was made; as a result, billing delays
increased. Subsequently, the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications
asked INTELCI, the entity responsible for international communications
in the Ivory Coast (see para. 2.02) to provide a special computer unit
to deal with APT's telecommunications billing. A new building was
constructed and the hardware was installed in April 1972; after the study
and planning stage, INTELCI commenced to bill APT's subscribers in
January 1973. At that time billing was one year in arrears. By dispatch-
ing to the subscribers each month a two-monthly bill for past services
it was hoped to update billing by September 1973. INTELCI and APT have
been unable to meet that date and a revised date of end-March 1974 has
now been extended to July 1974.  Various reasons have been put forward
for the present delay; they inulude poor computer programming and lack
of accuracy in the data supplied by APT to the INTELCI computer unit.
Sound telecommunications billing depends above all on a good subscriber
order system operated by qualified staff havi.ng a good knowledge of ope-
rations and tariffs.  APT's ordgr system is acceptable, but the group of
employees responsible for supplying the information to the computer unit
needs to be considerableâstr-engthened.  The idéI-ôolutiôiYwouild be-for
APT to create a new group, much smaller in number but of better quality
and with higher remuneration; most of the present staff could be assigned
to other duties. This unsatisfactory telecommunications billing is the
most serious problem facing the APT management at the present time and is
the main reasons for the heavy borrowing of Treasury funds. -Fbrthermore,
until billing and collection are normalized APT will continue to suffer
heavy collection losses (see para. 6.03). During negotiations, the Govern-
ment agreed that APT would:
(i) within six months of loan signing qmploy experts
satisfactory to the Bank to review the computer program
for APT's billing operations to ensure correct and efficient
billing and accurate revenue accounting;
(ii)  within six months of loan signing  employ an
expert, satisfactory to the Bank, to (a) supervise and
improve bilhing, collection, and revenue accounting at

APT's headquarters, and (b) prepare for agreement vith
the Bank a timetable for effecting the required improve-
ments in APT's revenue operations; and
(iii)  within one year of loan signing take measures, satis-
factory to the Bank,, to strezgthen and maintain qualified
staff in charge a£ APT's billing, collection, and revenue
accounting operations.

POSTAL/FINANCIAL DEPARIMENT
Financial Aspects
1.        Following the pattern adopted in France and in other countries
in French-speaking West Africa, APT's Postal/Financial Department carries
on the usual postal services, including the quasi-banlking service of
domestic and international money orders and a public checking account
service; in addition it administers the National Savings Bank.
2.        Separate accounts are not kept for the department.  However, it
is estimated that the postal/financial operations have been, and continue
to be., careied on at a loss. Operational losses since 1969 are estimated
to have been as follows:
Fiscal Year:              1970  1971  1972  1973
CFA francs (millions)          237   278   141   395
Postal/Financial Department's losses, together with its investment require-
ments, have in the past been met from telecommunication surpluses.  It is
estimated that during the 14 years since the country's independence, annual
postal/financial investment has averaged CFAF 60 million.
3.        As regards the financial position of the postal/financial ser-
vices, the estimated balance sheets show an unusually large amount of
unpaid receivables; working capital requirements, in particular the cash
cover for suns due public-cheeking account depositors and foreign entities
for money order transactions require to be examined. A review of the
Postal/Financial Department's services is therefore an immediate require-
ment. The review should be comprehensive and cover not only operations
but also financing arrangements, in particular the use and deposit of funds
and settlement of receivables.  To ensure the maximum efficiency of APT's
postal/financial services, during negotiations the Government agreed that
APT would employ qualified and experienced consultants to complete a review
by December 31, 1976, and then after consultation with the Bank, implement
the mwasures necessary for improving the operations and finances of the
postal/financial services. Given the interrelationship between telecommuni-
cations and postal/financial. services in the Ivory Coast, US$50,000 has been
included in the proposed loan to cover the foreign coste of the review.
4.        Although the Government is entitled to withdraw surplus telecom-
munications funds from APT over and above those required for operations and
development, it should not continue the practice of automatically charging



ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 2 pages
Joses and investment requirements of the Postal/Financial Department
against telecommunication surpluses. For reasons of operational and de-
velopment efficiency and good financial management the postal/financial
and telecomunmication services should be considered as separate. Therefore,
in addition to APT maintaining separate accounts for postal/financial and
telecommunications operations, during negotiations the Government agreed
that before applying any surplus telecommunications funds for other pur-
poses APT will ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet the opera-
tional, debt service and investment requirements of APT's telecomnunication
services* Fhrthermore, the Government also agreed that in the event of in-
sufficient funds being available for APT's operations and investment it will
take such steps, satisfactory to the Bank, as may be necessary to cover the
deficit.
