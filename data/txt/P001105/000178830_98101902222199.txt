REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Loan to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of $25.0 million
to help finance a project for the extension and improvement of the country's
local and long distance telecommunications services. The loan would have a
term of twenty years including five years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report
N° 296-IVC "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory Coast",
April 11, 1974 which is based on an economic mission in April of 1973,
confirmed the country's creditworthiness. The report analyzed the country's
economic growth record, which has been favorable by international standards.
It concluded that prospects for further development remain good and that the
Government's development efforts require and deserve continued external
support. 'While the recent developments in oil and other export and import
commodity prices will require substantial quantitative changes in the Balance
of Payments estimates from those made when the report was prepared,
preliminary calculations show that the conclusions of the report are still
valid. Tentative estimates of the impact of the price increases on the
economy of the Ivory Coast have been included in this Report. Annex I
contains basic country data.
3.        Throughout the 1960's, the Ivory Coast's economic growth has
been rapid. GDP has grown at a rate of 7.5 percent in real terms and in
1972 per capita income reached US$350. Although the growth could not be
fully sustained in the early 1970's due to deteriorating terms of trade and
adverse weather conditions, growth in 1971-73 still averaged 6 percent in
real terms. Factors contributing to rapid growth were the Government's
liberal and pragmatic economic policies resulting in a continuous inflow of
foreign capital and know-how, the availability of ample land and timber
resources, the existence of a large pool of labor including immigration from
neighboring countries and, dur_rxg the late sixties, rising commodity export
prices. Recognizing the country's vulnerability in its dependence on three
export commodities (cocoa, coffee and mood constitute 80 percent of total
exports), the Government began after 1965 to diversify agriculture by intro-
ducing or expanding oil palm, zoconut, pLieapple. rice, rubber and sugar
cultivation - an6 by placing more emphasis on other economic sectors such
as industry, mining and tourism. Although the full results of these diversi-
fication efforts are still some years off, the prospects are that the Ivory
Coast will gradually become less dependent on a few major exports.



4.        The Government's development objectives include, in addition to
broadening the production base, the extension of economic infrastructure in
such fields as transport and power, the improvement of urban facilities,
regional diversification in agricultural production, the development of
secondary industrial centers and the development of education. These objec-
tives correspond well to the needs and the possibilities of the country.
Past and ongoing development has laid a solid foundation for further growth.
Moreover, Government and private investment activities indicate that the
country's growth possibilities are being recognized and exploited.
5.        The Government's awareness of social problems is expressed in the
current Plan (1971-1975) and its emphasis on the income effects of development,
regional balance and education is much stronger than in the past.   The
Government has adopted a policy of developing regional alternatives to the
concentration of investments in Abidjan and of improving the quality of life
in rural areas as a tool to neutralize certain imbalances in the Ivorian
economy. In spite of these policies the Ivorian Plan will, however, need
to focus more sharply on problems of urbanization, prospects of employment
in both rural and urban areas and income distribution. To assist the
Government in the process of preparing the next Five-Year Plan (1976-80),
a special Bank employment mission, which received assistance from ILO staff,
visited the Ivory Coast in April 1973. The mission report has been discussed
with the Government and is expected to be issued shortly. The mission
identified the employment problem as one of growing imbalances: while the
overall increase in labor demand was about equal to supply including immigra-
tion, there is likely to be a continuing shortage in rural areas and a surplus
in urban labor markets. The mission also singled out a number of issues for
further study, including the costs and benefits of infrastructure development
and industrialization in secondary centers and suggested changes in educational
and training systems.
6.        This element of balanced regional development - an objective of the
current Plan - is consistent with and in fact one of the essential elements
of the Government's development strategy towards further diversification of
the economy. Until recently, growth of production took place predominantly
within the triangle Abidjan-Man-Bondoukou in the country's forest zone. To
ease the pressure on this development area and to implement its diversifica-
tion policy - both essential elements in sustaining the momentum of economic
growth - the Government realized that new land should be made accessible.
Consequently, substantial investments have been allocated to open up and
equip with a basic infrastructure new areas in the south-west (the San Pedro-
Man area) and the center-north (the Kossou-Bouak6-Ferkessedougou area). This
basically sound policy of diversification and decentralization, however,
clearly makes a great demand upon internal transport and communications which
is essential to its success. Therefore, in the current Plan period, the
Government has allocated about 22 percent of public investment to transport
and communications, compared with some 18-20 percent in previous plan periods.



-3-
7.        In the short run (1974-75) most export products of the Ivory Coast
are expected to remain in strong demand and export receipts will therefore
grow rapidly. However, imports will probably rise even more because of high
inflation rates in supplier countries and higher prices for food, fertilizer
and oil in particular. The net oil import bill is expected to go up from
US$18 million in 1972 to US$93 million in 1974 and US$112 million in 1975
or from 4 percent of 1972 imports to 10 percent of forecast 1975 imports.
The resulting resource gap will be about US$60 million in 1974 and US$110
million in 1975, the equivalent of 6 percent of total exports of goods and
non-factor services.  In the past, the Ivory Coast had known resource sur-
pluses: US$55 million a year during 1968-1970 and US$3 million during
1970-73.
M.       Based on past experience, Ivory  Coast's economy may be expected to
respond vigorously to the new challenges in the longer run (1976- 1980).
Good growth prospects in several sectors will facilitate the necessary
structural adjustments to be induced by the Government. The Ivory Coast
has a substantial potential to increase its electricity generation from
hydro sources. Sites additional to the two in operation now were already
under investigation before the oil prices went up and it is quite conceivable
that under the new circumstances the program for hydro electric development
could be speeded up. The possibility to use wood as fuel in the wood proces-
sing industries may accelerate the implementation of the Government's policy
to process raw materials locally rather than exporting them in unprocessed
form as is still the general practice. The Governzent's policy of establish-
ing processing industries for locally grown cotton, rubber and palm oil is
expected to benefit from higher prices for these products. On balance,
there is no firm reason for a major downward revision of the earlier
established long-term growth prospects of 6 percent per year in real terms.
9.        Current Bank forecasts indicate however that prices in current
terms of coffee and cocoa, products which constitute 45 percent of Ivory
Coast's total exports, will remain at their 1974-75 level till 1980. As
prices for imported goods are expected to continue to rise substantially,
this would mean a deterioration of the terms of trade. Preliminary calcula-
tions show that a resource gap might result in the order of US$250 million
in the early 1980's as against an earlier projection of an equilibrium in
the goods and non-factor services account. Although our projections must
be refined and confirmed and may have a rather high degree of uncertainty,
these preliminary indications point to a substantial increase in the need
for external funds. A basic economic mission scheduled for next year will
evaluate the country's long-term prospects in the context of the draft
1976-80 development plan. This evaluation would include a thorough reexami-
nation of our projections, the underlying assumptions and especially the
consequences for Ivory Coast's external borrowing requirements.



- 4 -
10.       Based on the situation before the price increases, it was estimated
that financing of a reasonable public investment program of around US$300 million
in 1974-75 would require a large increase in external aid. It was calculated
for 1974-75 that, assuming a continuation of Government revenues well over
20 percent of GDP, about US$170 million per year would have to be financed
by disbursement of grant and loan funds and increased mobilization of
private domestic savings. Based on the pattern of disbursement in recent
years - US$125 million in 1971, US$105 million in 1972 and an estimated
US$150 million in 1973 - those funds were consiLdered to be obtainable fron
the Ivory Coast's traditional aid donors: France, Germany, Italy, the
European Community - and from more recent sources of funds - the United
States, Canada, Denmark, the African Development Bank and the World Bank
Group. Most of the increase in the inflow was to be financed by interna-
tional organizations in order to allow a decline in borrowing from more
expensive private sources. Under certain assumptions regarding loan terms,
the debt service ratio would rise from its presently rather low level of
some 6 percent (7.9% in 1972) to about 15 percent by 1980. Total external
public debt stood at US$698 million on December 31, 1972.
11.       The recent acceleration in price increases implies an increase in
the need for foreign capital of as much as US$100-150 million in 1974 and
1975. Since about 60 percent of investments in the Ivory Coast take place
in the public sector, a substantial part of the increased needs for finan-
cing from abroad may be expected to occur in the public sector. The aborp-
tive capacity in terms of projects is substantial, particularly since there
is scope to accelerate the implementation of hydro electric projects and
the establishment of processing industries based on local raw materials.
12.       The impressive economic and fiscal performance of the Ivory Coast
justifies the assumption that additional funds required will be kept at a
reasonable level and that the country will be able to obtain those funds.
However, with the increase in capital requirements, the terms are becoming
increasingly important. If for instance an increasing amount of future
capital needs would be covered on terms offered in the Eurodollar market -
to which the Ivory Coast has access - the debt service could substantially
surpass the level of 15 percent projected above for 1980. To keep the
debt service manageable and to enable the Government to implement its
basically sound and successful economic policy, it is important that foreign
capital be made available on soft or concessionary terms, including long
repayment and grace periods. In view of the still low debt service ratio,
the good future growth potential of the economy and the expected increase
in export earnings, the Ivory Coast remains, however, creditworthy for
substantial additional borrowing from the Bank.



-5-
PART II - BANK CaOUP OPERATEONS IN THE IVORY COAST
13.       Since 1968, the Bank's lending to the Ivory Coast has
expanded rapidly, and now includes eleven loans totalling _US%94.8 million
and an IDA credit of US$7.5 million. Four of these twelve operations have
been for roads; five were to the member companies of the SODEPAIM Group
for the development of oil palm and coconut plantations and the construction
of two oil mills; the remaining three loans were for education, cocoa and a
rubber plantation. The IFC also has a small (US$200C,000) participation in the
Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank Group operations and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects with particular reference to those which are;encountering problems
in execution and giving rise to delay in disbursement.
14.       The principal foreign exchange earner and domestic employer remains
the agricultural sector. It continues to provide close to 90 percent of
exports, to create job opportunities, to help stabilize an increasingly
mobile population, and to bring development to remote areas of the country;
therefore, our principal effort is in this sector. Me are currently financing
studies under Loan 686 (Cocoa Project) which should lead to presentation of a
Cocoa project to the Board in the near future, a Cotton project early next
year and an agricultural resettlement project by FY76. We are also partici-
pating with the Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique (CCCE) in preparing
a rice project in the West of the Ivory Coast. Two additional oil palm
projects have been appraised recently and should be presented to the Board in
the near future. The Government has also reauested our assistance in financing
additional oil palm and coconut development in the Ivory Coast's South-West,
and in providing agricultural credit. The European Development Fund (FED),
the European Investment Bank (EIB) and CCCE have sought our participation in
major and difficult agricultural projects; this tendency will probably be
reinforced.
15.       In support of agricultural development, we have placed considerable
emphasis on transportation and have become the principal lender for road
construction and maintenance. This is due largely to the fact that the Bank
was closely associated, as Executing Agency, with the 1968 UNDP Transport
Survey of the Ivory Coast. We expect that projects identified by this survey
will continue to be submitted to the Bank Group for financing in the next
few years, in particular the Abidjan-Agboville and Katiola-Badikaha roads.
The Government is also interested in obtaining our assistance in financing
the realignment of a section of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line. Other
sections of the rail line are being financed by the FED and the EIB.
16.       Urban infrastructure and education are two important social sectors
in which we are involved, although our financial participation should remain
relatively modest. The UNDP is financing a two-phase study of the sanitation
needs of Abidjan and this study VWf.L- provide the basis for an urban sanitation
project for Abidjan in the near future. A study of the development of a new
quarter of Abidjan is being financed with Bank funds. With regard to



- 6 -
education, we are closely associated with the Government"s efforts to
modernize its educational system principally at the secondary and vocational
levels. A Second Education Project is presently being prepared with the
assistance of UNESCO. Substantial investments are also foreseen, in the
later years, for industry and power, areas in which we have not previously
been involved, but in which the Government foresees the need for the Bank
Group's participation.
17.       We have recently begun work on two new and innovative projects in
which the Government has expressed considerable interest. One of them, a
small enterprise project, will carry forward the special effort inaugurated
in Western Africa through a recent Bank study on the developmernt of African
private enterprise. The second project concerns agricultural marketing and
was brought to us by the Government.   It should help us to come to grips with
the problems of food crop marketing, so important to t1he development of
modern agriculture.  It would also benefit rural producers and urban dwellers
alike by assuring a constant flow of food-stuffs to the cities at more stable
prices.
18.       Of total external lending to the public sector in the 1970-72
period,calculated on commitment basis,34 percent was provided by Governments,
25 percent by International Organizations (of which 72 percent by the Bank),
23 percent came from Private Banks and through bond issues while 18 percent
came in the form of suppliers' credits. The finance not supplied by Inter-
national Organizations came mainly from four countries, France (30 percent),
USA (30 percent), Italy (22 percent), and Germany (9 percent). France and
Italy each supplied 30 percent of the total of suppliers1 credits. France
and the European Economic Community remain the principal source of develop-
ment assistance in grant form.
19.       Bank Group lending to the Ivory Coast,which has averaged about US$20
million per year in the five years since we began operations in the Ivory Coast,
is expected to increase substantially over the next several years. The Bank
Group's share of the Ivory Coast's external debt is now approximately 14%
(including undisbursed) and may increase in the next five-year period to about
17h. The Bank's share of the Borrower's debt service is at present approxi-
mately 3$ and is expected to increase substantially in the coming years.
PART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
20.       The responsibility for Ivorian domestic telecomanunications rests
with the Administration des Postes et T6l6communications (,MPT), which opera-
tes as a branch of the Ministry of Post and Teleconmraunications. APT also
operates the usual postal services, a nationwide public checking account
service and the national savings bank, Its organizational structure
generally follows the pattern of postal/telecommunications entities in the



- 7 -
French speaking countries of Africa.  International telephone, telegraph,
telex and data transmission services are provided either through an earth
sateUite station or by HF radio circuits. These services are operated by
the Soci6t6 des T6lecommunications Internationales de Cote d'Ivoire (INTELCI),
a company jointly owned by the Ivorian Government and the French company,
France Cable et Radio (FCR), with the Goverrnment having 52% of the capital.
21.       As of January 1, 1973, the Ivory Coast had about 20,000 direct
exchange lines of which 15,000 were located in the greater Abidjan area;
60% of the lines were for business, 28% for residential and 12% for other
purposes including administration. The total number of telephones was
estimated at about 45,000; telephone density was 0.8 per 100 population.
There are 22 automatic exchanges - 12 in the greater Abidjan area and 10 in
provincial towns - and 79 small manual exchanges in the provinces. The
Abidjan area has an effective terminal exchange capacity of about 17,400
automatic lines of which 15,000 are connected. In the provinces the total
capacity is about 7,700 lines (4,500 automatic and 3,200 manual) and 5,100
connections. The long-distance telecommunications network consists of about
110,000 channels/km. Domestic telegraph service is provided through the
telex and telephone facilities. Telex service is provided by a 500-line
exchange located in Abidjan.
22.       Despite high charges, during the past ten years (1961-1972),
telephone demand in Abidjan has been increasing at about 13% per year; this
high growth rate which mainly stems from the rapid development of the city's
commercial activities is expected to increase to 14% through 1980. Demand in
the provincial areas has been growing at about 10-11% per year during the
1969-1972 period; this growth rate is expected to increase to 12% in the
coming years. It is also estimated that demand for long distance service
will increase annually through 1980 by about 15%.
23.       In recent years the pace of domestic teleeonmnications development
in the Ivory Coast has fallen far behind that of general economic development.
Consequently, telecommunications facilities are now inadequate to meet the
country's current needs let alone those that will develop as a consequence of
new economic development projects and programs now being initiated or in the
planning phase. Telecommunications planning has been poor and development of
the sector, particularly that for local telephone service, has been on a short-
term piece-meal basis. Local telephone services are generally poor; local
exchanges in many areas are congested and have little or no margin for expan-
sion; local distribution networks, particularly in Abidjan, are inadequate.
Long distance service suffers from a lack of switching equipment and service
is only fair. APT now faces a situation where it must considerably increase
telecommunications investment if it is to make up the backlog of development
from past years and also to provide the facilities for the new Government
development schemes about to be realized. APT has not only lagged in the
development of its physical facilities, but has also failed to develop the
support services for telecommunications operations. The internal organization
of APT, so far as it concerns telecommunications is unsuited to meet present
operational demands. APT needs considerable help in strengthening its management
and improving its policy formulation capacity; its problems and deficierncies are
such, however, that to be effective this assistance will have to be provided on
a continuing long-term basis.

240       Construction works for domestic telecommunications during the
1970-73 period totalled an estimated CFAF 406 billion (Us$18 million). The
1974-78 telecommunications development progrem provides for investmant
totalling CFAF 13 billion (Us$53306 million). The principal objectives of this
program are the following: to adequately equip the main areas of service in
order to provide an adequate level of services and demand until 1980; to
improve the facilities in rural communities and provide necessary support
for the Government's regional development efforts; to improve the quality of
speech and speed of connection in both the local and long-distance services;
and to establish the telecommmnication services on a technically and finan-
cially sound basis for future operations and development.
PART IV - THE PEROJECT
25.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Telecommunications Project"
(335 IVc, dated February 20, 1974), is being distributed separately. A
loan and project summary is in Annex III The project will provide auto-
matic switching equipment for about 39,000 exchange lines in Abidjan and
provincial towns, the extension and rehabilitation of existing local distri-
bution networks, the expansion of long-distance and telex serrices, related
buildings, equipment and vehicles and technical assistance and training
necessary to execute the project and improve management of the telecomuni-
cations service.
26.       In 1971 a Bank mission discussed with the Government the financing
of a part of its 1971=1975 program of telecommunications development. The
program had been prepared by the Administration des Postes et T6lecommunica-
tions (APT) following studies by the Consultants - Soci6t, Frangaise
d'Etudes et de Realisation d'Equipements de T616communications (SOFRECOM)
and Societa Finanziaria Telefonica (STET)o  Subsequently, the Government
requested the Bank to finance the second phase of telecommunications develop-
ment covering the period 1972-75. However, due to delays in the implementa-
tion of the first phase, the Government decided to revise its requirements,
and a new 197h-78 program, covering demand until 1980, was established. The
appraisal mission which visited the Ivory Coast in July-August 1973 was
requested by the Government to consider the financing of this revised program.
Negotiation of the project, which corresponds to the Governmentgs 1974-78
telecommunications program, took place March 25 to 28, 1974v TLhe Ivorian
delegation was led by Mr. Hovine, Director General of the Caisse Autoneme
d'Amortissement and included Hr. Apete, Director of Telecomaunications,
Mr. Make, Director of the CAM, Kr. Kpatchibo, Director of BS.E, Mr0 Anoh,
Director of APT Budget and Mrs. Achy, Ministry of Planning.
27.       The project, which includes some works not financed by the Bank, is
expected to cost approximately US$53.6 million and provides for the installa-
tion of switching equipment for about 39,000 automatic exchange lines in
Abidjan and in some 23 provincial towns; a further 4,700 lines of switching
equipment will be redeployed from existing locations in Abidjan arLd 6
provincial towns; the local distribution and inter-exchange networks in



-9-
Abidjan aind the provincial towns will be rehabilitated and extended; various
long-distance services to be provided under the project include the completion
of six 960 channel capacity micro-wave links and the construction of three
additional links of the same capacity; two VHF links will also be added along
with a small capacity microwave link; a total of approximately 1,250 km of
open wire line routes will be constructed to provide new service to rural
areas and carrier equipment will be installed on existing open wire routes.
The program also includes additional telex services, buildings required to
house equipment, power plants, vehicles and other equipment, consultant
services, engineering and training.
28.       Costs for items proposed for Bank financing are based on prices
currently obtained under international competitive bidding.   In the case of
switching equipment, these prices relate to equipment purchases in West Africa
and for other items to purchases outside West Africa. The cost of civil works
and supplies is based on prices obtainable in the Ivory Coast. The breakdown
of the capital cost of the project is shown in Annex III.   The Bank loan would
finance 63% of the foreign cost and 47% of the total cost of the project. The
project would also be financed by loans and grants of US$2.8 million from
French Government Agencies and the Ivory Coast Government and by US$2.9 million
in suppliers' credits. The APT will finance approximately 43% of the project,
or US$22.9 million from internal cash generation.
29.       The proposed Bank loan of US$25.0 million would finance a major part
of the project equipment to be installed in the period 1974-78. In particular,
the Bank would finance about 21,000 lines of automatic telephone exchange
equipment, local networks and subscriber plant at a cost of approximately
US$12.5 million. From the long-distance service items, the Bank loan would
finance 3 micro-wave and 2 VHF links, trunk switching equipment, carrier
systems and long-distance overhead lines totalling US$i4.7 million. The
balance of the Bank loan, excluding contingencies of US$i4.3 million, would be
applied to additional telex services, power plantg vehicles, tools, etc.,
consultant services and training.
30.       All the Bank financed equipment would be procured in accordance
with the Bank guide-lines for international competitive bidding and would be
exempted from the payment of customs duties and other import taxes. Part of
the equipment for the project financed from other sources has either already
been ordered under suppliers' or bilateral financing or for reasons of
standardization will be ordered from known sources on a negotiated contract
basis. The equipment to be procured in this manner includes 17,000 lines of
automatic switching equipment of which 7,100 lines have been ordered. Contracts
for buildings and civil works would not be financed by the Bank; these would
be awarded under the Government's standard tendering procedures which are
acceptable. It is expected that the introduction of international competitive
bidding into the procurement of equipment will result in substantial savings.
31.       The proposed loan would be disbur Ad against the CIF cost of
imported equipment and the fo>   n cost of services and training.    It is
proposed that subject to subsu   at agreement, any unused balance of the loan
could be made available for the pu;chase of additional goods or services,
similar to those already procured urnder the loan, which may be needed for
APT's program.



- 10 -
32.       Detailed engineering and supervision of equipment installation will
be carried out by APT, assisted by experts employed directly or through
consulting firms. The suppliers would be responsible for installing the main
equipment. Smaller works and buildings would be constructed by APT's build-
ing division. Cable laying would be undertaken by local contractors and
APT's staff.
33.       The project is designed to assist the Government in putting the
APT on a sound financial basis by the end of the project period. Although
profits on its telecommunications services should enable APT to ecrn a subs-
tantial surplus, it is experiencing a serious liquidity problem and has had
to take up large overdrafts from the Government to maintain operations and
carry out only modest development; this situation has been mainly due to a
breakdown in the billing system caused in large part by an unsuccessful
computerization program undertaken in 1969. The difficulties and delays
resulting from this experience are gradually being overcome and it is expec-
ted that billing to both private users and Government will be put on a current
basis by the summer of this year. The Government is APT's principal debtor
due both to billing delays and failure to pay fully the bills submitted for
settlement. Outstanding government debts to APT for telecommunications servi-
ces will be paid by the Government in four equal annual installments extending
from 1974 to 1977.
34.       APT has also fallen behind in the preparation of its annual
accounts; separate operating accounts for telecommunications and postal/
financial services-have not been kept. Financial control is weak; internal
audit is unsatisfactory and an external audit of the accounts has never been
made.  To remedy these deficiencies, consultants were hired with French
bilateral assistance to update the accounts and to institute a newT system of
cost analysis and accounting for APT's telecommunication and postal/financial
services. As a condition of a Bank loan, the Government has agreed that APT
will reinforce its accounting staff and further improve its systems; outside
consultants will be hired to assist in this task. Furthermore, APT will
improve internal audit procedures and in the near future will have its
accounts audited axnually by independent auditors.
35.       Integration of the postal/financial services with the highly
technical telecommunications service in the Ivory Coast is not entirely
satisfactory. The domestic telecommunications service promises to become a
larger enterprise which, to obtain the maximum benefits, should as far as
possible be operated on commercial principles; for this, the service needs
considerable expertise in telecommunications management and a greater degree
of financial autonomy than at present.   It was therefore agreed that a study
be undertaken to determine whether any institutional changes are cesirable
for the national telecommunications service.



36.       In the past, operational problems affecting postal/financial
services have aggravated the financial problems of the telecormunications
service. With the object of improving APT's postal/financial services the
Bank has agreed to finance a study of these services. Second, the Government
has agreed to undertake an internal study of the grading and promotion
policies for the telecommunications service in order to help the service
attract and retain qualified local staff. A plan will also be drawn up ana
implemented for the training of Ivorian superv-lsory staff to eventually
replace expatriate personnel.
37.       The Government has agreed not to use telecommunications funds for
other purposes unless such funds are surplus to telecommunications operational,
investment and debt service requirements; furthermore, in the event of insuffi-
cient funds being available for APT's operational, investment and debt service
requirements, the Government will take steps to cover the deficit. The
Governrent agreed to continue to provide Treasury overdraft facilities as it
has in t-ie past until APT has established a satisfactory cash position. The
Government has also undertaken to seek the Bank's approval for any additional
investment for telecommunications in excess of US$4OO,OOO during the project
construction period and over a longer term to observe limitations on both
short and long-term borrowing.
38.       Net income from telecommunications is expected to grow at a
satisfactory rate through 1980. Due to the heavy investments to be made in
the 197'4-78 period, the rate of return on net fixed assets would fall from
about 20% in 1973 to 12% in 1978. This rate of return will, however, start
to rise again once the new facilities are realized. It has been agreed that
APT will earn a rate of return on its telecommunications services after 1978
of at least 10%; this rate will be sufficient to enable APT to finance a
substantial share of its future telecommunications investments and cover the
operational and investment needs of its postal services. On the basis of
present tariffs which are high, but comparable to rates in other francophone
West African countries, surpluses should be available for transfer to the
Government or for the reduction of tariffs after 1978. At the end of the
investment period, the APT's financial position should be satisfactory.
Liquidity is estimated to show significant improvements after 1975 and should
reach a satisfactory level at the end of 1978. Debt/equity ratio which is
presently 15/85 would rise to 35/65 in 1978; the latter would still provide
a margin for further borrowing.
39.       Based on APT's expected net revenues from the project, the capital
invested in the project, excluding taxes and duties, shows an internal rate
of return of 22%. This may be accepted as a reasonable proxy for the economic
rate of return of the project-. However, the full economic return would clearly
be higher because (i) the prices charged, although high, do not measure
the full benefits to the economy, and (ii) the costs include the full cost of
extending service to new areas even though the full benefits of those exten-
siona will be reaped in the future when additional lines are connected in
those areas. The proposed project will help meet anticipated demand through
1980 and allow APT to overcome a substantial backlog of work that has been

accumulated due to under-investment in the last four years. The majority of
the increased demand in the Abidjan region would be for industrial and
commercial use. This is equally true for the rural areas where the improve-
ment of telecommunications facilities should make a substantial contribution
to regional development. Additional benefits should accrue to the Government
and to the public generally from the improvement in APT's management due to
reforms to be instituted in the course of project execution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Ivory Coast
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section h (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
41.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions to reflect the various
arrangements described in Part IV above and conforms substantially to the
pattern of previous agreements for telecommunications projects.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take
full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices.
However, available information indicates that the proposed Loan remains
fully justified.
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.

of the Loan to take account of modified architectural'standards. These changes
were notified to the Executive Directors (See Memorandum to the Executive
Directors R71-2h6 of November 3, 1971). The project has now enter-ed the
construction phase with awards for seven of the schools having been made

of farmers who used project inputs to treat non-project cocoa. The Ooverirment
agreed that the rehabilitation program should be discontinued. (See Memorandum
to the Executive Directors R73-74 of April 13, 1973). The project is proceed-
ing satisfactorily except for disbursements. Administrative problems have
delayed the submission of requests for reimbursement.
/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, anid in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to Temedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
