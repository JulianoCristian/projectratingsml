These indicators might include an\n            evaluation of the use of scholarship funds, tracer studies\n            on the deployment of returning scholars in teaching,\n            research and industry, an assessment of the impact of\n            improved laboratories and equipment on the quality of\n            graduates, and quantitative data on private sector\n            participation in science and technology education and\n            research. The impact of investments in capacity building\n            should also be assessed and reflected in the design of\n            future operations. 2) The role of the resident mission\n            should be strengthened with more emphasis on accounting and\n            financial management, which received insufficient attention\n            under this project. 3) If future investments in science and\n            technology education aim to improve industrial production\n            and research, follow-up operations should pay attention to a\n            more effective and substantive participation of employers in\n            developing, delivering, and financing S&T education and research."}, "docdt": "1998-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
