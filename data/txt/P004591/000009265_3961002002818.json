To address the main issues\n            in engineering and science education, the project's\n            specific objectives are to : a) improve institutional\n            mechanisms and criteria for funding and monitoring\n            engineering and science education; b) strengthen colleges of\n            engineering and science; c) improve science and math\n            instruction in secondary schools; and d) increase\n            institutional capacities to plan and coordinate S&T\n            manpower development programs.  The project will have a\n            policy action plan and six investment components : 1)\n            engineering education including funds for faculty\n            development and initial costs for university-industry\n            linkages; 2) science education and research including funds\n            for expert services and laboratory equipment; 3) management\n            of technology including funding for books and journals; 4)\n            library networks which will include renovation and expansion\n            of current facilities; 5) secondary school science and math\n            in-service teacher training; and 6) S&T manpower\n            planning and monitoring."}, "docdt": "1991-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
