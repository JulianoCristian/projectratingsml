REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 3435-PH)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Engineering and
Science Education Project in the Republic of the Philippines, for which Loan 3435-PH in
the amount of US$ 85.0 million was approved on January 28, 1992 and made effective on
June 3, 1992. The loan amount was reduced to US$ 61.0 million on October 10, 1993,
following the Government of Japan's (OECF) agreement to cofinance the project in the
amount of US 24.0 million equivalent.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1998, one year after the original closing date of
June 30, 1997. Final disbursement took place on November 10, 1998, at which time a
balance of US$ 5.69 million was canceled. The OECF grant is not scheduled to close
until year 2000.
The ICR was prepared by William D. Cooper (Consultant) and reviewed by Ms
Omporn Regel (Task Manager, EASED) and Mr. Alan Ruby (Manager, EASED), Ms.
Maureen Law (Acting Manager, EASED), and Mr. Vinay Bhargava (Country Director,
EACPF).
Preparation of the ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission in June 1998. It is based on information gathered during that mission and on
material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by
commenting on the draft and by conducting its own evaluation of the project's execution
and achievements. A summary of the Borrower's contribution is appended as Annex A.



REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 3435-PH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
1.    The Bank's involvement in the education sector in the Philippines since 1965
consists of 14 education and training projects, for a total financing of US$ 767.5 million.
Bank support covered primary and secondary education, higher education (including the
project under review), technical and vocational training, industrial skills development,
and teacher training. Two projects are still active: the Second Vocational Training
Project (Cr. 2392-PH) and the Third Elementary Education Project (Ln. 4108-PH).
PROJECT OBJECTIVES.
2.    Objectives.  The project's overall objective was to upgrade the country's
industrial and technological capability by increasing the supply of high-level science and
technology (S&T) manpower. Specifically, the project aimed to: (a) strengthen the
institutional framework and the criteria for funding and monitoring engineering and
science education; (b) enhance financial and resource management, improve the quality
and relevance of S&T teaching, and promote scientific research and development; (c)
improve science and mathematics education in secondary schools; and (d) strengthen
S&T manpower planning, monitoring and evaluation.
3.    Project description. Project objectives were supported by a policy action plan
and an investment program. The policy action plan focused on improving the institutional
framework of engineering and science education, strengthening financial and resource
management, matching enrollments to S&T manpower needs, and improving
accreditation. The investment program financed qualitative improvements in six areas: (i)
engineering education; (ii) science education and research; (iii) the management of
technology; (iv) library networks; (v) secondary school science and mathematics, and (vi)
S&T manpower planning, monitoring and evaluation. The entire program involved 19
engineering schools, 10 science colleges, 110 secondary schools and 22 teacher training
institutions (Annex C).
4.    Evaluation of objectives. Project objectives were realistic and clearly stated.
They were important for the development of science and technology education in the
Philippines, and in line with the Bank's country assistance strategy and the Borrower's
education sector development plans. Project support was limited to a small number of
institutions considered to have the capacity and potential to achieve the objectives.
Nonetheless, the project was quite demanding for the Borrower and its implementing
agency, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and some delays did occur.
Main risks identified during appraisal were: (i) social pressures to expand low-quality



- v -
programs; (ii) inadequate financing for O&M of laboratories; (iii) loss of trained faculty
to the private sector; and (iv) limited experience in project implementation. Measures
taken to counter them were effective, and risks were minimized. The project wab well
defined and responsive to changes in Borrower circumstances and priorities.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
5.    Achievement of objectives. The project's impact on the institutionalframeuork
of engineering and science education is substantial.  A collaborative network of
institutions was established, quality monitoring groups for engineering and science
education were strengthened, the accreditation system was improved, and a networked
library and information system was set up. Internal efficiency measures were largely
implemented as planned, and resources are beginning to be used more efficiently. User
funds were set up to help pay for capital investments and O&M of engineering and
science laboratories.   Links with industry, research institutes and professional
associations were effectively strengthened.
6.    The project's impact on the quality of engineering and science education is more
difficult to assess because the faculty development program, which was successfully
launched, has not yet been completed. However, all inputs were supplied as planned,
curricula were updated, laboratory facilities upgraded and new equipment installed.
Engineering and Science capabilities were strengthened in seven and two institutions,
respectively, through faculty training and the acquisition of equipment. Programs in the
management of technology (MOT) were introduced at three tertiary institutions. The
overall impact is considered substantial.
7.    The project's impact on science and math teaching in secondary schools is
substantial. Conditions for good quality science teaching were significantly improved
through construction or renovation of laboratories at 1 10 secondary schools, the provision
of science equipment, and the upgrading of curriculum content and teacher qualifications.
Capacities for science and math teacher training at 22 teacher training institutions were
strengthened by improving science laboratories and upgrading staff qualifications.
8.    The Borrower's capacity for S&T manpower planning, monitoring and evaluation
was significantly strengthened. A comprehensive management information system
(MIS) has been set up, staff has been trained, data collection and processing has started,
and the system is expected to be fully functional within about a year.
9.    Costs and financing. After effectiveness, the Bank loan was reduced from US$
85 million to US$ 61 million when the Government obtained OECF cofinancing of US$
24 million equivalent. The OECF grant was used to finance the secondary school science
and mathematics component. Total project costs of US$ 130 million were within
appraisal estimates.
10.   Key factors. Factors that positively impacted on project outcomes include a high
level of Borrower commitment, effective arrangements for project coordination and



- vi -
quality monitoring, and good relations between the Bank and the Borrower. The
Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory. The Borrower actively participated in
project preparation, competently executed the project and effectively coordinated the
various inputs with the beneficiary institutions. The Bank's perforrnance is also rated
satisfactory. Project preparation and appraisal were competently carried out, with
significant Bank input into the design of institutional requirements and implementation
arrangements. The quality of supervision was satisfactory, although more attention
should have been paid to financial management which was a weak point during
implementation. The Bank's Resident Mission in the Philippines (RMP) played an
increasingly important role in resolving implementation issues, particularly during the
latter half of the project period. Despite these satisfactory ratings, two factors negatively
affected project performance: (i) inadequate budget allocations by the Department of
Budget and Management (DBM) in 1992 and 1993 which caused a one year delay in
project completion; and (ii) initial weaknesses in the project's financial management and
accounting systems. These problems were resolved and implementation was smooth in
later years.
11.   Overall rating. Based on the timely delivery of all planned project inputs, the
effective collaboration between participating institutions, and the more efficient use of
limited resources, the outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. More time is
needed, however, to assess the project's long-term impact, when investments become
fully utilized and performance can be more accurately measured.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS, AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
12.   Findings. This was a well-designed, well-executed operation with good potential
for significant benefits in the long term. To achieve those benefits, it is important to
ensure that the initial achievements are sustained and extended to the remainder of the
science and technology education sub-sector.
13.   Future Operations.  Plans for the future operation of the project include
provisions for funding of O&M of project-supported laboratories, completion of the
ongoing faculty development program, and development and implementation of a follow-
up project (ESEP II). Initial proposals for ESEP II indicate that its focus would be on: (a)
improving DOST's capability in management of technology; (b) strengthening private
sector participation in scientific research and development; and (c) upgrading the human
resources capacities in science and technology.
14.   Key lessons. Key lessons learned from this project include:
Assessing Project Outcomes: As confirmed by the performance indicators
used for this project, this was an input and process focused operation that did
not lend itself easily to the assessment of long-term improvements in the
quality of science and engineering education and the management of limited
sector resources. A future operation would do well to develop a different set



- vii -
of indicators, designed to measure these internal and external efficiencies.
These might include an evaluation of the use of scholarship funds, tracer
studies on the deployment of returning scholars in teaching, research and
industry, an assessment of the impact of improved laboratories and equipment
on the quality of graduates, and quantitative data on private sector
participation in science and technology education and research. The impact of
investments in capacity building should also be assessed and reflected in the
design of a future operation.
* Strengthening the Role of the Resident Mission. Staff of the Resident
Mission (RMP) provided effective support in the areas of procurement,
disbursement and contract administration, particularly during the second half
of the implementation period. In a future operation, this role could usefully be
strengthened with more emphasis on accounting and financial management
which received insufficient attention under this project.
E Expanding Private Sector Involvement in S&T Development.  The
institutional framework for this project was well designed. It provided for
policy advice, pedagogical support and implementation assistance through the
Project Advisory Group, and industry input through the Science and
Technology Coordinating Council. However, if the thrust of future
investments in S&T education is the improvement of industrial production and
research (key objectives of ESEP II), follow-up operations should pay
attention to a more effective and substantive participation of employers in
developing, delivering and financing S&T education and research.



REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 3435-PH)
PART 1: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
1.    Project objectives. The project's overall objective was to upgrade the country's
industrial and technological capability by increasing the supply of qualified high-level
science and technology (S&T) manpower. Specifically, the project aimed to: (a)
strengthen the institutional framework and the criteria for funding and monitoring the
quality of engineering and science education; (b) strengthen engineering and science
education in priority fields at selected institutions; (c) improve science and mathematics
education at selected secondary schools; and (d) strengthen DOST's capacity to plan and
coordinate S&T manpower development programs.
2.    Project description: Project objectives were supported by a policy action plan
and an investment program. The policy action plan focused on improving the institutional
framework for funding and monitoring the quality of engineering and science education,
strengthening financial and resource management, matching enrollments to S&T
manpower needs, and improving accreditation. The investment program financed
qualitative improvements in six areas:
v  Engineering Education: (i) improve undergraduate and graduate programs in
priority fields at 19 colleges of engineering through faculty development,
laboratory equipment and facilities upgrading; (ii) develop research capacities
in leading universities; and (iii) upgrade the quality of engineering graduates
and practicing engineers in priority fields.
*  Science Education and Research: (i) improve undergraduate and graduate
programs in priority fields at 10 colleges of science through faculty upgrading
and improved laboratory facilities; (ii) strengthen science research capacities
in two leading universities: and (iii) upgrade the quality of science graduates
and scientists in industry and R&D.
*  Management of Technology: develop programs and faculty to introduce
masters programiis and short courses in the maniagement of tcchlnology (MOT)
at three universities.



* Library networks: Upgrade library staff, collections and facilities at three
engineering and seven science colleges, and develop a system of networking
among those libraries.
*  Secondary  School Science and  Mathematics:   Improve  science and
mathematics instruction through in-service teacher training, the provision of
books and laboratory equipment, and the upgrading of laboratory facilities at
110 secondary schools and 22 teacher training institutions.
*  S&T Manpower Planning and Monitoring: (i) improve the monitoring roles
of the technical panels for engineering education and science education; (ii)
develop a management information system (MIS) to help plan and coordinate
national S&T manpower programs; and (iii) improve DOST's capacity to
coordinate project implementation.
3.    Evaluation of objectives. Project objectives were realistic and clearly stated.
They were important for the development of science and technology education in the
Philippines, and in line with the Bank's country assistance strategy and the Borrower's
education sector policies. Project interventions were correctly limited to a relatively
small number of institutions considered to have the capacity and potential to achieve the
objectives. Nonetheless, the project was quite demanding for the Borrower and its
implementing agency (DOST), and some delays did occur. The main risks identified
during appraisal were: (i) social pressures to expand low-quality programs; (ii)
inadequate recurrent cost financing for O&M of laboratories; (iii) loss of trained faculty
to the private sector; and (iv) limited experience in project implementation. Measures
taken to counter them were effective, and risks were minimized. The project was well
designed and sufficiently flexible to respond to changes in Borrower circumstances and
priorities.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.    The project substantially achieved its immediate objectives. Provided these are
sustained, the project is likely to have a substantial positive impact on the quality of
scientific and technological manpower in the Philippines.  However, an accurate
assessment of the project's impact is difficult to make at this time because: (a)
insufficient time has elapsed for some investments to be put to full use (institutional
measures are still maturing, a significant number of teaching staff have not yet returned
from overseas training, laboratory equipment has only recently been installed and is not
yet fully used); and (b) information gaps make it difficult to assess progress and track
performance. Within these limitations, the achievement of objectives is summarized as
follows:



- 3 -
5.   Improving the institutional framework. This objective has largely been met.
The policy action has for the most part been implemented as planned. Collaborative
networks of leading institutions have been established, monitoring mechanisms for
engineering programs have been set up, and the accreditation system has been improved.
Internal efficiency measures to improve institutional performance (rationalizing teaching
loads and class sizes, improving facility utilization) are being implemented as agreed.
Laboratory tuition and user fees have been introduced to finance new investments in
equipment and operational and maintenance costs. Collaboration with employers, trade
associations and other professional bodies has been strengthened.
6.   Improving the quality of engineering and science education. The quality and
relevance of engineering and science education has been enhanced through faculty and
program upgrading, investments in facilities and equipment, and improved linkages with
industry. Engineering and science capabilities have been strengthened through faculty
development and the acquisition of research equipment. Programs in the management of
technology (MOT) have been successfully introduced.  Availability of scientific
information has been enhanced through improved library facilities in ten participating
universities.
7.   Improving science and mathematics teaching in secondary schools. Science
laboratories at 110 secondary schools have been upgraded and equipped, curricula have
been revised, and over 1,000 teachers have been trained. Local capacities for science and
mathematics teacher training have been strengthened by upgrading science laboratories at
22 teacher training institutions and improving the qualifications of teacher trainers.
8.    Strengthening capacity for S&T manpower planning and coordination. A
comprehensive management information system (MIS) has been put in place and staff
have been trained in its use.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Implementation Record
9.    Table 5 of Part II - Key Indicators for Project Implementation - confirms that the
output targets as defined in the SAR have been generally met. Some long-term programs
(e.g. overseas fellowships) extend beyond the project's closing date but arrangements
have been made to complete them. The following paragraphs summarize the project's
status at closing.
10.   Engineering Education. Undergraduate enrollments (BS) at the 19 intermediate
engineering colleges (Annex C) in the priority fields targeted under the project (electrical
engineering, electronics engineering, mechanical engineering, materials engineering,
industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, computer engineering and chemical



-4-
engineering) increased from 19,267 (1990/91, baseline) to 21,600 (1997/98, project
completion), an increase of 12% which is still within the targeted rate of increase of not
more than 20%. MS/PhD enrollments almost doubled from 200 to 380 over the same
period, or almost 2 percent of undergraduate enrollment, as planned. As regards quality
improvements, an aggressive faculty development program (PhD and MS/MEng)
covering about 800 faculty is expected to be completed in 2000 (with Government
financing beyond June 30, 1998). So far, 82 PhD graduates and 292 MS graduates have
resumed their teaching duties at the sponsoring institutions. The percentage of faculty
with MS/Ph.D. degrees are close to targets and will most likely reach targeted levels once
the 41 scholars return to complement the current teaching force by SY1999-2000. In
addition, about 1,355 staff (BS level, generally) have received short-term skills
upgrading, about 6% below SAR target.
11.   Teaching facilities have been upgraded as planned. Laboratories at 19 engineering
schools have been upgraded and laboratory equipment has been supplied. The issue of
financing operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of laboratories has been satisfactorily
dealt with (i) in public institutions through the creation of science and engineering
laboratory funds, and (ii) in private institutions (which are financially autonomous)
through earmarked funds in their regular budgets.
12.   Thirteen network schools have established formal linkages with industry under
the project; two schools had existing linkages and are preparing to develop them further;
and the remaining four schools have not established linkages. This program needs to be
more vigorously pursued in the future.
13.   Science Education and Research. Undergraduate enrollments in priority fields
(biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, earth science and computer science) in the ten
project-supported science colleges have more than doubled to about 15,500 (1997 data).
Graduate enrollments doubled to 1,698 (1997). There was, however, no discernible shift
toward the newer disciplines (earth sciences, computer science). The number of faculty
increased from about 590 in 1991 to about 835 in 1997 and over 40% now have graduate
degrees, in line with SAR targets. The fellowship program is continuing with
Government financing, and is expected to further improve faculty qualifications. Staff
resources were also more effectively used: statistically, the average staff/student ratio
decreased from about 1/11 in 1990 to 1/20 in 1997. Teaching laboratories were upgraded
and equipped, as planned. Science research facilities have been established and improved
at two leading universities. The volume and quality of scientific research is increasing,
helped by a program of research grants.
14.   Management of Technology. Graduate programs and short-term courses in the
management of technology (MOT) have been introduced as options at three flagship
institutions (Asian Institute of Management, De La Salle University and University of the
Philippines-Diliman), as planned. About 40 elective and seminar courses, supported by
MOT case studies, have been developed; reference materials, books and journals have
been acquired; five staff have been awarded fellowships for graduate-level training in



-5-
MOT specializations (two have completed); and a Technology Management Center has
been established at the University of the Philippines, Diliman.
15.   Library Networks. Libraries at seven science and three engineering colleges
have been improved as planned. About 72,000 reference books and 570 journal
subscriptions have been procured, computer systems have been set up and networked, and
more than 330 staff have been trained in library science and information technology. The
ten participating institutions have committed to providing continued funding for journal
subscriptions beyond project closing.
16.   Science and Mathematics in Secondary Schools. Science laboratories (physics,
chemistry and biology) at 110 S&T-oriented secondary schools in NCR and 12 regions
were improved as planned, through the construction of new science blocks at 104
schools, the rehabilitation of existing science labs at six schools, and the provision of
laboratory equipment for all of them (equipment was financed by OECF). At project
closing, these new or upgraded laboratories were fully operational. An in-service teacher
training program, conducted at teacher training facilities in the regions in which the
schools are located, was successfully completed: 1,077 teachers obtained diplomas or
certificates versus 837 planned, 35% over target. In addition, about 880 teachers were
trained in the use of laboratory equipment. Science teacher training facilities were
improved by constructing and equipping laboratories at 22 Regional Science Teaching
Centers and tertiary node institutions (Annex C), and teaching staff were upgraded
through a fellowship program for 46 teachers who successfully completed a Master of
Arts in Teaching program.
17.   Manpower Planning and Monitoring.  DOST's management information
system has been strengthened through the acquisition of computer equipment, staff
training and software development. Unfortunately, implementation of this component
was delayed by about three years and the MIS was only fully installed just prior to project
closing. As planned, the MIS has the following components: scholarship monitoring and
graduate information database, library materials procurement, procurement financing,
staff appraisal reporting, payroll and financial management. The various systems are
networked and staff have been trained to operate them. Data collection and encoding is
underway, but due to the delays DOST has not been in a position to use the MIS as a
planning and monitoring tool.
18.   Project Management and Coordination. Implementation during the first two
years was quite slow, mainly because of DOST's unfamiliarity with Bank procedures,
inadequate budgetary allocations to the project, logistical problems with procurement and
constraints in setting up the fellowship programs. After the second year, the pace of
implementation improved as qualified staff were recruited, procedures were established
and experience was gained. At project completion, DOST's project implementation and
coordination office (PICO) had established itself as a competent unit capable of
effectively coordinating the various project components, handling project funds, keeping



adequate records, and producing progress reports. Bank supervision reports attest to the
good performance of PICO during the last four years of implementation.
Major factors affecting the project
19.   As mentioned above, inadequate budget allocations by Government during the
first two years of project implementation (24% of the budget request in 1992, and 37% in
1993) seriously delayed project start-up and deferred some activities to later years. This
eventually resulted in an extension of the project closing date by one year. Factors which
impacted positively on the project include the high level of Government commitment to
the project's objectives, the large degree of delegation of responsibility to participating
institutions, and the well-conceived structure for project management and coordination.
The Steering Committee, the Project Advisory Group (PAG) and the Science and
Technology Coordinating Council (STCC) were particularly effective elements of the
institutional setup. The COA played a positive role in helping to improve the project's
financial management and control, while the PAG successfully helped maintain quality
control over the educational aspects of the project, nurtured university-industry linkages
and broadened the international ambit of the operation.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.   There are good prospects for sustaining the project's preliminary outcomes. At
the policy level, the Government remains strongly committed to its vision of making the
industrial sector competitive and innovative through high-quality, relevant scientific and
technological education and research. A number of initiatives have been launched or are
planned to help achieve this goal. One of these is a proposal to the Bank for a follow-up
project, designed to consolidate and expand the achievements obtained under the current
project.
21.   Prospects for sustainability are also good at the institutional level. The technical
groups initially set up for project preparation, the quality control panels that deal with
academic standards and accreditation, the council of engineering deans that links a
number of engineering colleges, and the Project Advisory Group, are institutionalized
entities that are expected to remain in place. With the right kind of support, scientific
research is expected to expand through better linkages with industry and more research
funds. Access to scientific information for teaching and research is expected to be
sustained through improved availability of reference materials and scientific journals, as
well as Internet access.

E. BANK PERFORMANCE
22.   The Bank's performance overall is rated as satisfactory. The identification
mission produced a solid, comprehensive investment proposal that did not change much
during subsequent stages of processing. Preparation missions paid particular attention to
the project's institutional setup and quality control measures. Interestingly, a considerable
amount of detailed preparatory work was done after appraisal through a post-appraisal
mission and three supervision missions during the first project year. The Bank team
provided a significant level of detailed assistance to get the project off the ground, from
setting up the project management structure, to developing terms of reference for the
PAG, assisting with procurement and disbursement procedures and advising on record
keeping and reporting requirements. Despite the high turnover of task managers,
supervision was of consistently high quality. Missions were adequately staffed, regularly
spaced and constructive in resolving implementation issues. A mid-term review was
conducted, with excellent input from the Borrower and only very minor changes were
made to the project. Relations with the Borrower were excellent throughout the project
period.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
23.   The Borrower's performance was satisfactory.  The Borrower participated
actively in the project's design and preparation, and made a significant contribution to the
soundness of its concept and scope. As noted above, there were some early delays in
project implementation, mainly because of lack of experience of the newly-established
project implementation office, inadequate budget allocations for the first two project
years, and the time needed to set up the necessary systems and procedures. In retrospect,
these delays were unavoidable. The management and coordination of this complex
project, involving a large number of institutions and a wide range of activities, was well
handled by DOST/PICO. Continuity of staffing was excellent, commitment to the job
was evident at all levels, initial weaknesses in procurement, disbursement and financial
management were addressed, and a great deal of experience was built up. It is therefore
fully expected that DOST will be quite capable of continuing the operation of this project
and implementing a follow-up operation.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
24.   Based on the timely delivery of all planned project inputs, the effective
collaboration between participating institutions, and the more efficient use of limited
resources, the outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. More time is needed,
however, to assess the project's long-term impact, when investments become fully
utilized and performance can be more accurately measured. Provided the project's



- 8 -
achievements are sustained, through the continued operation of this project and the
support of a follow-up project, it is reasonable to assume that the quality and relevance of
S&T education in the Philippines will be significantly improved.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
25.   Plans for the future operation of the project include provisions for funding of
O&M of project-supported laboratories, completion of the ongoing faculty development
program, and development and implementation of a follow-up project (ESEP II). Initial
proposals for ESEP II indicate that its focus would be on: (a) improving DOST's
capability in management of technology; (b) strengthening private sector participation in
scientific research and development; and (c) upgrading the human resources capacities in
science and technology. Project preparation is underway and detailed proposals are
expected to be submitted to NEDA and ICC by end-1998. ESEP II is in the Bank's FY00
lending program.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.   Key lessons leamed from this project include:
Assessing Project Outcomes: As confirmed by the performance indicators
used for this project, this was an input and process focused operation that did
not lend itself easily to the assessment of long-term improvements in the
quality of science and engineering education and the management of limited
sector resources. A future operation would do well to develop a different set
of indicators, designed to measure these internal and external efficiencies.
These might include an evaluation of the use of scholarship funds, tracer
studies on the deployment of returning scholars in teaching, research and
industry, an assessment of the impact of improved laboratories and equipment
on the quality of graduates, and quantitative data on private sector
participation in science and technology education and research. The impact of
investments in capacity building should also be assessed and reflected in the
design of a future operation.
* Strengthening the Role of the Resident Mission. Staff of the Resident
Mission (RMP) provided effective support in the areas of procurement,
disbursement and contract administration, particularly during the second half
of the implementation period. In a future operation, this role could usefully be
strengthened with more emphasis on accounting and financial management
which received insufficient attention under this project.
* Expanding Private Sector Involvement in S&T Development. The
institutional framework for this project was well designed. It provided for



policy advice, pedagogical support and implementation assistance through the
Project Advisory Group, and industry input through the Science and
Technology Coordinating Council. However, if the thrust of future
investments in S&T education is the improvement of industrial production and
research (key objectives of ESEP II), follow-up operations should pay
attention to a more effective and substantive participation of employers in
developing, delivering and financing S&T education and research.

ANNEX A: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
The Engineering and Science Education Project (ESEP) of the Department of Science
and Technology (DOST) is an important component of DOST's Science and Technology
(S&T) Manpower Development Program. It was implemented in cooperation with the
Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) and the Commission on Higher
Education (CHED). The project was financed by the Philippine Government with support
from the World Bank and the Japanese Government.
Its main objective was to increase the supply of well-trained S&T manpower in support of
technology development for industrialization.  Its specific objectives were; (i) to
strengthen engineering and science education in priority fields at selected institutions, (ii)
to improve science and mathematics education at selected secondary schools, and (iii)
to strengthen DOST's capacity to plan, manage and coordinate S&T manpower
development programs.
Project components included (i) faculty development through local and foreign MSs,
PhDs, sandwich programs, post-MS/PhD fellowships, and visiting professorships; (ii)
acquisition of books and journals, libraries development and library networking; (iii)
acquisition of laboratory equipment; and (iv) upgrading of research laboratories in public
and private universities including the construction and upgrading of 110 high school
science laboratories.
One hundred and fifty four (154) pilot colleges of science and engineering participated in
the project. These consisted of 19 colleges of engineering (5 public and 14 private), 10
colleges of science (4 public and 6 private), 110 S&T-oriented public high schools
located nationwide, and 22 teacher training institutions. Of the 19 selected engineering
colleges, three were developed into flagship engineering institutions. These were the
colleges of engineering at the University of the Philippines atDiliman (UPD), De La Salle
University (DLSU) and the University of San Carlos (USC). The other 16 colleges were
developed into lead institutions in the National Capital Region (NCR) and in Regions I,
IV, VI, VIl, X, Xl, and XII.
The project was jointly financed by the Philippine Government, the World Bank, and the
Japanese Government through the OECF. The Philippine Government financed the
local currency components of equipment and construction and part of the local operating
costs of the project. The World Bank took care of the foreign currency portions of
various project components up to an amount of US$ 61 million while the Japanese
Government financed the foreign currency component of equipment procurement and
consultancy up to US$ 24 million equivalent. Project institutions provided counterpart
funds for the following: salaries of substitute teachers, the cost of installation and or
extension of power and water utilities for upgraded laboratories, and other operating costs.



-24 -                         ANNEX A
The project was originally planned for implementation over a five-year period that
commenced in February 1992. It was agreed at the start of the project that a project
mid-term review would be undertaken sometime in the third year of the project, in year
1995, during which proposed reallocations or rescheduling were considered and a
revised workplan for the remaining years was agreed upon.
A total of 5,891 or 114% of the 5,157 target scholarship slots were filled up, exceeding its
target slots by 734. As of June 30, 1998, the project produced a total of 5151 graduates,
4947 of which were in-country while 248 were overseas. Of these, 51 are PhDs, 513
have Masters degrees, 211 are Post-MS/PhDs, 1077 are Certificate/Diploma in
Education holders, while 3299 already completed their short-term training programs.
There are 81 overseas scholars and 65 in-country scholars or a total of 740 who have
yet to complete their studies.
A total of 319 staff-months of consultancy and visiting professorships were earmarked for
the project. Some 247.75 staff-months or approximately 78% of the target had been
used.
The project earmarked 1,268 items of equipment for both World Bank-funded and
OECF-funded equipment. A total of 1,231 items or 97.8% have been delivered and
installed in laboratories all over the country.
Books and library materials totaling 72,296 titles and 569 journal titles or 100% of the
target were delivered to the institutions concerned. Eight (8) libraries of seven (7)
flagship universities for both science and engineering are now electronically linked.
To assist management in the monitoring and implementation of ESEP, six (6) various
database systems were developed, networked, and the staff concerned were trained on
their operation and usage. These were: 1) Scholarship Monitoring System (SCOLM), 2)
Graduate Information System (GIS), 3) Staff Appraisal Report System (SARS), 4)
Financial Management Information System (FMIS), 5) Library Materials Procurement
System (LIBPC), and 6) Bidder's Module (SUM96). All systems were developed by the
ESEP-MIS Unit except for the FMIS and SUM96 which were procured from Development
Bank of the Philippines - Data Center Inc. (DBP-DCI) and Linesman, Ltd., respectively.
All 110 targeted high school laboratories were established and all the 23 laboratories in
tertiary institutions were upgraded representing 100% of targets met. These are all
funded by World Bank Loan 3435-PH. In addition, 6 of 7 laboratories in tertiary
institutions (SUCs) funded through the GOP were upgraded. The remaining laboratory
(UPLB) is 30% complete as of June 1998 and will be completed by the end of
September 1998.

School Performance
1.0   Engineering Education
Among the objectives of ESEP were to increase enrollment in the priority fields
but not to exceed 20 percent, increase survival and completion rates, reduce
dropout rates, increase faculty-student ratio, improve faculty profile, reduce
teaching loads, reduce the number of years needed to graduate, and develop
academe linkages with industry.
Overall engineering enrollments were expected to remain unchanged as the
projected increase would be offset by a decline in enrollments in both civil and
geodetic engineering, fields with an oversupply of graduates. It was projected
that the percentage of engineering faculty with graduate degrees would be about
forty percent (40%) by the end of the Project.
Enrollment
The overall undergraduate enrollment in the priority fields supported by ESEP in
the 19 network schools for SY 1997-1998 of 21,614 represented a 12.18 percent
increase over that of the SY 1991-1992 enrollment data of 19,267 before ESEP
implementation. The BS total enrollment at the end of the project is still within the
targeted rate of increase of not more than 20 percent.
The MS/PhD total enrollment of 381 in SY 1997-1998 in the flagship schools (UP
& DLSU) exceeded the targeted 250 by 52.40 percent at the end of the project.
An increase was noted in SY 1997-1998 for all fields of specialization ranging
from 78.3 percent (ME/MfgE) to 720.0 percent (MatE), except in EE which
registered a decrease of 18.03 percent.
Dropout Rate
The freshmen dropout rate in all fields in SY 1991-1992 ranged from 0.88 (EE) to
as high as 16.48 (ECE/CompE). Freshmen dropout rates for SY 1996-1997 in all
fields ranged from 4.21 (ECE) to 7.55 (MatE). In the fields ofChE (0.69) and ME
(8.89), however, negative dropout rates were obtained, signifying an increase in
the size of the batch that started schooling in SY 1996-1997. The increase was
due to the lateral entry of students into these two fields. The average freshmen
dropout rate for SY 1996-1997 was recorded at 2.29 percent while that of SY 1991-
1992 was at 11.02 or a reduction of 8.73 percent.
No. of Years Taken for Graduation (MS, PhD)
The ideal length of time that should be spent in finishing the MS program is two
(2) years while the PhD program is four (4) years. At the end of the project the
no. of years taken for graduation for MS registered an average of 3 years. An



-26-                          ANNEX A
improvement was noted as the base data is 4 years. For thePhD there was no
change, still for 5 years.
Size of Faculty
There was an increase in the number of full time equivalent (FTE) faculty in the
19 network schools in four fields and a decrease in two from SY 1991-1992 to SY
1997-1998. The increase in faculty in the four fields ranged from 2.00 percent
(MatE) to 28.46 percent (Comp/ECE). There was a slight decrease of 2.06 percent
in ChE faculty and a much higher decrease of 20.09 percent in the EE faculty.
All fields exceeded the targeted number of FTE faculty except EE which could be
attributed to faculty who are still on study leave. It should be noted that a total of
forty-one faculty members from the network schools are on study leave and are
expected to be back in their teaching posts before the end of SY 1998-1999. The
distribution of these faculty on study leave by field of specialization are 41 inChE,
7 in EE, 6 in ME, 4 in IE, 2 in MatE (Ceramics), and 1 in ECE.
Faculty-Student Ratio
All fields showed an improved total average faculty-student ratio from SY 1991-1992
to SY 1997-1998 except in the fields of EE and MatE.
EE decreased from 1:23 in SY 1991-1992 to 1:27 in SY 1997-1998 but was still
within the targeted 1:30 ratio. All fields met their respective targets except for IE
and MatE. Although there was an increases in the number of FTE faculty in
these fields, the increases of 12.57 percent (IE) and 2.00 percent (MatE) did not
correspond with the increase of enrollment in SY 1997-1998.
Educational Qualifications
The percentage of faculty with MS/PhD degrees who were actively teaching
increased in all fields ranging from 6.33 percent (ECE/CompE) to a high of 61.29
percent (IE) except for EE which registered a decrease of 7.84 percent. The
decrease in percentage of EE faculty may be attributed to the sending of scholars
to pursue their PhDs.
The fields of ChE and IE exceeded their targets by 2 percent and 9 percent,
respectively. While the rest of the fields did not meet their respective targets, the
percentages of faculty with MS/PhD degrees are close to targets, and will most
likely reach targeted levels once the 41 scholars return to complement the current
teaching force by SY 1999-2000.
It should be noted that the data submitted by the 19 network schools on their
faculty with MS/PhD units (minimum of 3-9 units) show that 90 have completed
their coursework (74 FT, 16 PT), 39 are scheduled to take the comprehensive
examinations, while 51 are working on thesis leading to their MS degrees. Fifty-
four (54) have completed more than 24 units, 33 have completed 12-21 units while
26 have completed 3-9 units leading to heir MS degrees. Also, 36 faculty



-27-                         ANNEX A
members currently teaching have units credited to their PhD programs (9 working
on dissertation, 12 completed more than 24 units, 8 completed 12-21 units while 7
have completed 3-9 units).
Weekly Hours of Instruction
Seven (7) out of the 19 network schools reported that the teaching load of most of
their full-time faculty ranged from 24 to 27, six at 18-21 hours, three at 12-15, and
three at 30 hours per week. At the two flagship schools (UP & DLSU), the regular
faculty loading was 12 hours per week.
Establishment of the Industry-Academe Linkage Program in the
Nineteen (19) ESEP Network Member Schools
Thirteen network schools namely: UPD, USC, XU, AdU, DLSU, RTC, UE, TUP, UST,
MIT, PBMIT, AdDU and CPU have established formal linkages with industry, while the
six (MSU-IIT, DBTC, UNOR, SLU, UM, SU) have existing but informal linkages
with industry.
2.0 Science Education
Enrollment
The BS enrolment for SY 1997-98 was 6,897, higher that the baseline figure of
5,327.  Notably, enrolment for each field increased. Biology registered a
significant increase with a total of 1,798 compared to the enrolment in SY 1991-
92 (1,317). Student population in Chemistry (1,357) almost doubled in size
compared to that in SY 1991-92 which was 798. However, current enrolment in
Physics decreased to half at 196 against that in SY 1991-92 which registered
431. The enrolment for Math/Statistics did not change much but there was a
dramatic increase in Earth Science, enrolment from 51 in SY 1991-92 to 226 in
SY 1997-98. Among the six fields, Computer Science had registered the highest
enrolment at 2,181 constituting 32% of the BS enrollees.
M.S./Ph.D. enrolment for all fields increased to 1,698, as of SY 1997-98, almost
two-fold of what is was in 1991-92. Biology registered the highest enrolment at
459, or 27% of MS enrollees in 1997-98.
Current enrolment figures in Computer Science (270) and Earth Science (185)
are more than double the baseline data of 112 and 61, respectively.
Drop-out Rate
Freshmen drop-out rate in SY 1991-92 ranged from 0 (Biology) to 0.22

(Math/Statistics). Current data shows that only Physics marked a negative drop-
out rate at (0.46). This means a greater number of students entering the program
laterally, compared to those leaving the first year.
No. of Years Taken for Graduation (MS and Ph.D.)
The ideal length of time that should be spent in completing the MS program is two
(2) years while the Ph.D. program is four (4) years (as submitted by each network
school for science). However, as of 30 June 1998 only two Ph.D. scholars from
Batch 1994 and another scholar from Batch 1995 completed their degree on time
while most MS scholars completed the program in three years.
SIZE OF FACULTY
Only faculty members currently/actively teaching were included in the survey.
The full time equivalent used for part time faculty members is 0.5. The number of
faculty increase from 593 in 1991-92 to 834.5 in 1997-98, an increase of 40%
As of SY 1997-98 the total number of faculty with MS and Ph.D. degrees has
reached 574.0, higher than the baseline of 393, but less than the target of 712.
Those with MS/Ph.D. degrees comprise 67.5% of the faculty, not much higher
than what is was in 1991-92 (66.4%), and definitely falls short of 78.5%.
However, the faculty profile is expected to improve significantly when those
pursuing MS/Ph.D degrees will go back to their teaching posts in the next two
years. There are fields, however, where there have been two to five-fold
increase in the number of faculty with MS/Ph.D. degrees, notably: Physics (from
28 to 77.5) Math/Stat (from 37 to 168.5) and Earth Science (from 10 to 51).
Faculty-Student Ratio
All fields showed an improved total average faculty-student ratio from SY 1991
through 1997 in the six network schools. Only Earth Science has to improve on
its FS ratio of 1:07 against a target of 1:05. Biology and Computer Science
showed remarkable improvements of 1:15 against a target of 1:24 and 1:28 vs. a
target of 1:55, respectively.
Weekly Hours of Instruction
Five (5) of the flagship schools (MSU-IIT, UPD, UPLB, UPM and UST) reported
that the regular teaching load of their full-time faculty ranges from 9 to 12 units at
15-18 hours, while two (ADMU, DLSU) reported faculty loads of 12-21 units
requiring 15-18 hours of classes per week.

3.0   Secondary Science Education
Enrollment
The BSE/BSEEd total enrolment in the 20 node institutions increased annually
from SY 1991-1992 to SY 1997-1998. There is also a positive growth rate noted
in the MSTIMAT/ and Ph.D enrolment.
Drop-out Rate
The drop-out rate was based on the total enrolment of the 3rd and 4h year
students in SY 1991-1992 to SY 1997-1998 and not in first and second year as
indicated in the SAR. There was no drop-out noted for all batches.
Size of Faculty
There was a gradual increase in the number of full time equivalent faculty in the
20 node institutions from SY 1991-992 to SY 1997-1998. Only in SY 1993-1994
showed a negative growth rate of -1.66%.
Out of the total faculty, an average of 5.55% are on study leave from SY 1991-
1992 to SY 1996-1997.
Faculty Student Ratio
All fields need to improve its Faculty Student Ratio with an average of !:40
against the targeted FSR of 1:33.
Linkages
The SEI has maintained linkages with the DECS-Bureau of Secondary Education
(DECS-BSE) and principals of the 110 S & T-oriented High Schools and tertiary
institutions. SEI and BSE-DECS jointly spearheaded the Annual Conference of
Principals. This activity served as a venue for presenting the status of each of
the components of the project. Problems encountered during the implementation
phase were also discussed. For proper implementation of the program, several
DECS Memoranda were issued and disseminated to these schools.
Project Cost, Financing and Disbursements
Actual disbursements made by the World Bank were US$ 55.62 million or 91.2% of the
US$ 61 million loan. Actual disbursements made by OECF were Yen 2,903.22 million or
95.03% of the Yen 3,055 million loan. Overall, the project has accomplished 98.12% of
its target.



- 30-                         ANNEX A
Lessons Learned and Recommendations
Except for delayed implementation of some of the components in the early phase of the
project, the overall accomplishment was very satisfactory.  Minor implementation
setbacks were traced as follows:
*        The basic problem during the first two years of implementation was
budgetary constraints. The project was not given an adequate budget in the
first two years of implementation that resulted to delayed implementation of
some of the components. It was only during the third year of implementation
when the project started receiving full appropriations from the national
government.
*        The second reason had to do with difficulty of filling up the targeted
scholarship slots. Institutions could not send the planned number of faculty to
be trained within the five-year period for the simple reason that too many
faculty members on leave at the same time period would pose
insurmountable difficulties such as overloading of remaining faculty members,
which could lead to a general deterioration in the quality of instruction.
*        A third reason was related to the organizational and logistical
requirements of implementing the first DOST manpower development project
of this magnitude.
Because of the above-mentioned difficulties encountered during the first two years of
implementation, a proposed rescheduling of implementation of project components,
proposed reallocations of government and World Bank loan funding, and the proposed
extension of implementation period was submitted to concerned Philippine government
agencies (NEDA, DOF, and DBM) and the World Bank. It should be noted that the
reallocation and rescheduling of scholarship slots did not increase or decrease funding
for the loan category. The proposed reallocation and rescheduling of scholarship slots
had been approved, but not the proposed two-year extension. The Bank only approved a
one-year extension. The Project was carried out well inspite of these constraints.
Another basic lesson learned involved the management of the Project at the participating
institutions level. Constant turnover of administrators and staff in-charge of the Project at
the participating institutions affected the fluidity of operations. Future project designs
should provide for continuity of Project Management Staff. If this could not be avoided,
proper turnover would be necessary to spare the implementing agency the unnecessary
hassle of orienting new staff. The availability of systematic records at their level would
be very useful in case there are sudden changes in the project staff.
With regards to project implementation at the secondary science education level, the
following points were raised:
* DECS standard operating procedures usually delayed the processing of papers for
implementation of the project. Papers should therefore be given to DECS as early as
possible to provide enough lead time for the processing of papers
* The many steps that communications take to reach its ultimate recipient (i.e. school



- 31-                         ANNEX A
principals or teachers) slows down the flow and pace of communication by which the
number of 'steps" a communication goes through be lessened or minimized.
Decisions in the field would always require the approval of DECS top officials, e.g.,
the issuance of DECS Memoranda. A mechanism to fast-trackissuances like these
(i.e. signing and releasing) should be set in place to minimize delays in the
implementation of projects.
Finally, an important lesson has been learned from the monitoring of scholars at the
training institutions. As a counterpart of the training institutions, a coordinating office
should be created to handle the monitoring of the scholars. The coordinating office
should be capable of providing updates and regular feedback on the scholars.

REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
Engineering and Science Education Project
Loan 3435-PH
IBRD PROJECT COMPLETION  MISSION
June 7-19, 1998
Review Period Number 13
AIDE-MEMOIRE '/
1.    A World Bank mission conducted by Mr. William Cooper (Technical Educator), assisted
by Ms. M. Bilicario (Consultant), visited the Republic of the Philippines from June 7 to 19, 1998.
Ms. Omporn Regel, Task Manager, on mission in Manila on other business, participated in the
mission's work and attended the wrap-up meeting, which was held on June 17, 1998, with
participation of members of the Project Advisory Group and representatives of the participating
universities. The purpose of the mission was to conduct a final review of the status of
implementation of the Engineering and Science Education Project (Loan 3435-PH) before the
scheduled loan closing date of June 30, 1998, and to collect the documentation needed to prepare
the Bank's Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
2.    The mission is pleased to acknowledge receipt of up-to-date progress reports and related
documents from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). and wishes to express its
appreciation for the kind assistance and hospitality provided by DOST.
A.    Status of Implementation
3.    Implementation progress through this final review period has been satisfactory. As
reported by DOST, the rate of project completion by major invesunent activitv as of May 31, 1998,
is as follows:
Equipment                              98.2%
Books, journals, library materials     99.9%
Civil works                            97.3%
Training                               113.0%
Visiting professors and consultants    78.0%
Management and supervision             100%
4.    Procurement. With all equipment procurement completed and a few minor construction
works nearing completion, no ICB or NCB tenders were reviewed by the mission. Some
equipment deliveries made in 1995 need minor rectifications which the suppliers have committed
to undertake.
I/    This aide memoire is subject to review and modification by the management of the World Bank.

5.    Disbursements. Disbursements from the loan account as of May 31, 1998, were US 55.54
million, in line with projections made during the previous review mission. It is expected that, when
the loan account is finally closed, total disbursements will reach about USS58.5 million or 96% of
the US$ 61.0 million loan. Some underspending is expected in the training category (US$1.8
million) and the visiting professors category (US$ 1.1 million), while some minor overspending
may occur in other disbursement categories. The final undisbursed loan balance is estimated to be
about US$2.5 million, and would be canceled. Given the small amounts involved, there is no need
to reallocate funds from one category to another: minor over- or under-runs will be adjusted by the
Bank in the final reconciliation of the loan account.
6.    The tax issue raised in the previous aide-memoire needs to be tackled and resolved before
the loan accounts can be closed. At the wrap-up meeting. it was a,greed that DOST will examine all
withdrawal applications submitted to the Bank in order to determine the extent of the Government's
tax liability, essentially following the format used in the random sample submitted earlier. The data
would be verified by COA and a final audited statement would be submitted to the World Bank's
Resident Mission. Manila. no later than Julv 31. 1998. Once the final figures are available. the
mechanism of reimbursement to the Bank (deductions from fiuture withdrawai applications. or
refund bv the Govemnent) wvill be decided. in consuitation with the Resident Mtission which
remains available for advice and assistance in this matter
7.    OECF cofinancing of 3.055 million Yen (about US$24 million: an equivalent amount was
canceled from the Bank loan), used mainly to finance the purchase of laboratorv equipment for the
110 project-supported secondarv schools is almost fully disbursed (94%).
8.    Grace Period. The World Bank has agreed to a four-month grace period to October 31,
1998, to allow for the processing of disbursement applications for 'eligible expenditures" (i.e.
expenditures for goods and services delivered before the June 30. 1998 closing date). It is noted
that expenditures for goods and/or services delivered after the June 30. 1998 closing date do not
qualifv as eligible expenditures.
9.    Audits. The mission was informed that the Commission on Audits (COA) is in the process
of completing the FY97 audit of project records and accounts. This audit should be submitted to
the Bank no later than September 30, 1998. Even though the project will be closed on June 30,
1998. a final audit covering FY98 is due no later than September 30, 1999.
10.   Compliance with Credit Covenants. The mission reviewed the status of covenants in
the Credit Agreement and found that the Government was in compliance.
11.   Project Management. The project implementation and coordination office (PICO) in
DOST continues to be adequatelv staffed and budgeted to complete the implementation of the
project. As in the past, the project is being implemented in a satisfactorv to highly satisfactory
manner.

B.    Preliminary Assessment of Project Outcomes
12.   Performance Indicators.  The project's performance indicators, revised during the
previous review mission from those contained in the SAR, were updated as of May 31, 1998. They
confirm that the main objectives of the project will have been achieved by the loan closing date.
Some specific programs such as overseas fellowships will extend bevond the closing date but this
delay will have little impact on the overall achievement of objectives.
13.   Engineering and Science Education. The objectives of this component were to strengthen
engineering and science education at 19 engineering colleges and 10 colleges of science,
respectively; adjust enrollment structures to better respond to manpower needs; improve the
curricula and upgrade educational quality; and strengthen financial and resource management.
Available data suggest that these objectives have been largely achieved.
14.   Engineering Education. Enrollments in priority engineering fields (those supported by the
project) at the undergraduate level appear to have increased approximately as planned (20% over
1990/91 base line enrollments). v,ith final data still being collected.  Total underaraduate
enrollment in the 19 engineering colleges has reached about 64.000. with about 18.000 in the fields
supported by the project. This is in line with SAR targets. At the graduate level, enrollments have
increased to about 2%  of undergraduate enrollment, as planned.  An aggressive faculty
development program of both graduate and non-degree courses is still underway. To date, about
350 staff out of 800 planned have completed graduate training and the program is expected to be
fully completed by the year 2000 (with Government financing bevond June 30. 1998). At the
certificate level, 1,300 staff have completed short-term in-country training programs, as planned.
Industry-academe linkages have been established in 13 of the 19 member schools: the remaining
schools are in the process of setting them up. Laboratory facilities at all 19 institutions have been
upgraded as planned. These are all operational; their maintenance and operating costs are being
financed. in part, by laboratory use fees.
15.   Science Education and Research. Similar progress has been made in the colleges of
science. Enrollments have increased, with final data still being collected and processed. Partial
data indicate there is a definite shift toward the applied sciences. information technology and
environmental sciences, as envisaged. More than 500 facultv have attended (some still are
attending) graduate programs in-country, of whom about 175 have obtained MS or PhD degrees.
The entire programn is expected to be completed in 1999. The target of 70% of faculty with
graduate degrees is being approached. As for teaching facilities, laboratories have been renovated
and equipped as planned.
16.   Management of Technology. The objective of this component was to introduce graduate-
level and short-term courses in the management of technology in three flagship institutions (Asian
Institute of Management DeLaSalle University and Universitv of the Philippines). This objective
appears close to being fully achieved. About 40 elective and seminar courses in five areas of MOT
specialization have been developed and introduced in the three institutions; MOT-related case
studies have been developed; books and joumals have been acquired; five staff have received
fellowships for graduate-level trining in MOT specializations (two have completed); eight staff



- 36 -
have attended short-term MOT training programs; and a Technology Management Center has been
established at the University of the Philippines.
17.   Library Networks. This component was designed to expand the reference book and
joumal collections of seven science and three engineering colleges; to network the expanded
libraries; and to train staff in the application of information technologv. To date, over 72,000
reference books and about 570 titles of journals have been procured and distributed; computer
systems have been set up in the participating institutions and networked: and more than 330 staff
have been trained. In addition, librarv facilities have been upgraded as required. The participating
colleges have committed to making provision in their operating budgets to continue the journal
subscriptions beyond June 30, 1998.
18.   Science and Mathematics in Secondary Schools. The objective of this component was to
improve the quality of instruction in physics. chemistry and biology through the construction or
upgrading of science laboratories at 110 selected schools. the provision of laboratory equipment
(financed by OECF). and the upgrading of science teachers. To date. 107 secondary school science
facilities have been constructed. equipped and placed into operation. while the three remaining
laboratorv buildings are in the final stages of completion. The science teacher upgrading program,
started in 1992. has been quite successful. About 1.077 teachers went through the certificate
program versus 837 planned at appraisal, about 35% over target. Also as agreed at appraisal, a
longitudinal study to measure the impact of the science and math enrichment courses introduced in
the participating high schools was launched in 1994. Preliminary results indicate a marked
improvement in examination results for mathematics and sciences (as well as English). The impact
study will be continued for a few more years to validate the results obtained so far.
19.   In-service Science Teacher Training. Associated with the above program, the project
provided science teaching facilities at so-called "nodal" institutions for the in-service training of
secondarv school science and math teachers, as well as fellowships for teacher trainers associated
with these institutions. This program has been implemented as planned. About 30 science teaching
labs were set up at 12 regional science teaching centers and 10 teacher training colleges, and 47
teacher trainers obtained Master's degrees in mathematics and science teaching (versus 50 as per
SAR).
20.   Manpower Planning and Monitoring (MIS).  This component's objective was to
strengthen DOST's management information system (MIS) so as to improve its planning and
administration of S&T manpower and R&D development programs. Most of the originally planned
activities have been completed and the following MIS components have been developed and put
into operation: a scholarship monitoring system, a library materials procurement system, a
procurement financial system, a graduate information svstem. a staff appraisal reporting system and
a payroll system. These systems are fully networked. The installation of a financial management
system is nearing completion. Associated hardware and software has been upgraded as needed and
staff have been trained in the use of the upgraded MIS system. There are no remaining issues with
this component which is expected to be fully implemented by the loan closing date.
