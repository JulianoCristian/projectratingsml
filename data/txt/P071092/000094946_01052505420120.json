through increased agricultural production, and\n            increased farm incomes. The components will cover aspects of\n            both the NWFP and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas\n            (FATA) as follows. 1) The community development and support\n            program, will cover essential aspects of irrigation\n            management, namely, through the operation of the system;\n            collection of water charges; system maintenance; and,\n            rehabilitation, and improvement works. 2) The distributary\n            level improvement program, includes the establishment of\n            offices, supported by technical assistance (TA) to improve\n            the canal system, and, by the repair of distributary gates,\n            rehabilitation of diversion structures, and, improvement of\n            critical sections of the canal, which includes discharges,\n            water measuring structures, and gauges. 3) The watercourse,\n            and on-farm improvements program will allocate investments,\n            focusing on the realignment of irrigation water to improve\n            conveyance of the canal water, and reduce channel\n            deterioration, and water losses. Storage tanks will be\n            constructed; irrigated land will undergo precision land\n            leveling in the canal command, and barani area; and,\n            demonstration centers will be in place to expose sustainable\n            soil, and water management practices. 4) Improvements in\n            branch, and distributary canal systems will support farmer\n            organizations, and the Federation of Water User Association,\n            to include cross regulators, falls, and embankments\n            rehabilitation. 5) The local/minor irrigation schemes\n            development program will improve intermittent, non-perennial\n            streams through appropriate engineering designs, and\n            rehabilitation; and, 6) Project management support will be\n            provided for supervision, monitoring/evaluation, and TA, and\n            training support."}, "docdt": "2001-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
