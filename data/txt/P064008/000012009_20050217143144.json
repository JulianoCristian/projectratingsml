Several lessons are drawn from the project,\n            namely, that interventions should be geographically limited,\n            i.e., location impacts supervision, and therefore\n            implementation. The Bank needs to limit its interventions\n            geographically so that adequate supervision (and adequate\n            supervision funds) be physically possible, and a substantial\n            impact made. Any intervention over a wide spatial\n            distribution will challenge the quality of supervision, and\n            dilute the impact. The states in the country, being\n            responsible for water supply and sanitation (WSS) provision,\n            should therefore be the implementing entities for water\n            supply and sanitation projects. The federal\n            government's role should be limited to monitoring and\n            evaluation. In addition, given the local government's\n            relationship with the communities, they should be involved\n            in implementing community based projects, under the proviso\n            of understanding and leveraging communities'\n            capabilities. Although the project was not negatively\n            impacted by a lack of donor coordination, it is evident that\n            other donors are likely to repeat the experiences of this\n            Bank funded project. Despite the Bank's efforts, other\n            programs have thus far, not incorporated these lessons into\n            ongoing activities. It does not help that the recipient\n            federal ministries differ depending upon whether the support\n            is a credit or a grant, the Federal Government and donors\n            need to coordinate their activities so as to ensure more\n            effective implementation. Furthermore, lessons also suggest\n            encouraging 'self-supervision' by project\n            executers, enhancing independent monitoring and evaluation\n            capacity, and, focusing on sustainability - not asset\n            building. It is recommended to scale-up the\n            Government's Small Towns (STWSS) program, based on\n            criteria where States are the implementers; geographic space\n            is limited in accordance to project design and\n            pre-determined capabilities; the Government's\n            commitment to sustainable STWSS, is supported by the\n            communities in their contribution to costs, not undermining\n            through parallel schemes dispensing free WSS services. But\n            most importantly, the Federal Government should establish a\n            formal mechanism to coordinate the support it is receiving\n            from donors in the water sector."}, "docdt": "2004-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
