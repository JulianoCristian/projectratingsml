The project consists of three parts: 1)\n            The first component is to promote ownership and community\n            participation in the provision of water supply and\n            sanitation facilities by carrying out extension activities\n            aimed at sensitizing water users to foster the development\n            of appropriate facilities. 2) The second component will\n            finance the design and construction of pilot water supply\n            and sanitation facilities. 3) The third component will\n            support project management and project monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2000-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
