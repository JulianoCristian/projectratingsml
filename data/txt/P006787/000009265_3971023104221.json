prior\n            Bank loans with several DFCs and complementing the\n            Bank's work on financial sector issues, the proposed\n            project has the two-fold objective of:  (a) making available\n            medium-term loans to DFCs; and (b) assisting the Government\n            in strengthening the financial sector reforms already\n            undertaken.  (A) US$89.8 million of the loan would be\n            allocated to the credit component.  This would cover the\n            foreign exchange costs of subloans and equity investments\n            made by DFCs for investment projects involving increases in,\n            or rationalization of, productive capacity of enterprises,\n            industrial pollution control or technology development, and\n            for technical assistance required to undertake those\n            projects.  (B) The remaining US$0.2 million would be used\n            for capitalizing the front-end fee of the loan. A related\n            program of technical assistance for the staff of BR and the\n            DFCs would be financed by BR with its own resources."}, "docdt": "1984-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
