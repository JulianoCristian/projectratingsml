The\n            aim of the program is to raise the present production of\n            maize and groundnuts while maintaining the output of\n            tobacco. The growth in production will be achieved by\n            increasing yields per acre and by making effective use of\n            all suitable land. Yield increases are expected to result\n            from the application of fertilizers, together with improved\n            cultivation and weeding practices. The introduction of these\n            techniques through extension will be supported by the\n            closely integrated development of rural infrastructure, the\n            provision of supervised farm credit service, reorganization\n            of holdings and registration of titles to land. About\n            one-third of the proposed credit would be directed towards\n            the financing of extension staff."}, "docdt": "1968-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
