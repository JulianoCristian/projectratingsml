      development projects. .since 1968/69, the projee:t• s _Evaluation
      Unit ·:has collected an enormous range of data in an ambitious
      program of ~nnual and special-purpose surveys! The greatest
      part of the project's evaluation effort has been directed
      toward ascertaining the levels of crop yields obtained each
      season, since yields were the performance criterion given
      greatest stress in the first two appraisal reports. Even with
      t~is- strong focus, however, data were collecteu'i>oth through
      the yielci surveys and the other surveys which _app·eared to have-
      the potential of providing insights into projectimpact in
      areas not inUnedi.ately related to crop yields~ but the initial
      anal'ysis had not explored much of this peripheral-data in ~l'lY

                   survey, problems of a different nature were                                      encountered~                        · The
                   data received from Malawi contained fairly large numbers' of
                   invalid cases, and it proved impossible to identify some of·

                  cards had been physically damaged in such a manner that the
                  data ·On them could not-be rescued. The magnitude of the
                   losses in these two .cases is clearly enough to influence the

                   DETERMINANTS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF. SEASONAL CREDIT


                                                                   .                   .

            26.        Previous analysis of the LLDP credit program
             (reported in the ARDS review of LLDP) had revealed that there
            appeared to be a distinct geographical pattern a~sociated with
            the use of s~asonal credit in the project area, and a nwnber
            of hypotheses relating to this pattern were generated for
            testing in the follow-up study. In addition, there are other.
            factors, s~ch as income and farm size, which one would expect
            to be related to seasonal credit and·for which hypotheses were
            tested. Because of problems with the data, certain of the
            hypotheses: identified could not be tested and these are
            discussed at the erid of this· section.

              27.            The principal determinant of the distribution·of
             seasonal credit was meant.to be the system of rating farmers•

             would expect to find· a fairly strong correlation between the
I.
i            credit rating and crop yields since a higher rating implies
             better management and better management implies higher yields.
             This expectation was. exami_ned using data from the 1970/71 and
             1971/-~2 seasons.

          rated maize yields. All in all, the ratings are weakly and
          inconclusively correlated with yields. In the case of credit
          ratings, this may be because the rating system was never
          applied as it was meant to be. The results for crop ratings
          suggest that visual assessment of yield$ would be a very poor
          substitute for actual yield sampling. The bottc.. m hm lines
          of the correlation matrix give the coefficients relating
          physical yields of maize to those of groundnuts; for both
          seasons the,re is a. positive hut weak association between
          yields of the two crops.

          31.        Holding Size in the Low-Credit Areas --As noted
          earli'er, there is a distinct geographical pattern associated
          with the use of seasonal credit. Those program units lying·
          adjacent to the city of Lilongwe receive less-than-average
          credit on a per-farmer basis while all other unit.s receive
          greater-than-average credit. One hypothesis advanced to
          explain this difference is that farmers in the peri-urban
          area have smaller holdings as a result of hiyher population
I
,.        densities caused by population spillover from the city. One
          criterion farmers must meet in order to receive credit is
          that-they must have at least one acre under crops. If,with
          normal distributions, the mean holding size is smaller for
          samp~e ~ than for sample ~, this suggests that a greater

          proportion of farmers in sample- ~ than in b will be inelig':"'"·
          ible ,fo~ credit on the acteage crit~rion.

          32.        The hypothesis was tested by stre~:tifyingthe
          entire project area into two groups: those units. lying.
          adjacent to Lilongwe (nos. 1, 2, 6, 9, 16) and all other
          units. Originally "holding" was defined in two ways:
          (1) as cropped area and (2) . as cropped area plus fallow; but
          as the size obt~ined using the second definition was on
          average only one-tenth of an acre larger than the cropped
               . this second measure . .was subsequently dropped
          area,.                      .                     .    .
                                                                   from the
          analysis. Hereafter, unless "holding" is clearly_differen-
          tiated from "cropp-ed area", the term is used Cis a synonym

43.                   These results are not surprising. since the major ·
objective of assessing creditworthiness in 1969/70 was to
identify those ~armers who were likely to make the'best ·
economic use of inputs and who were most likely to repay
the ~oan. The evidence suggests, how.ever, that the farmers .
who met these criteria were also those with the least need
for· institutional credit. It is the dilemma of. almost .all
institutional credit programs that the viability of the
program in a commercial sense must be balanced against the

difference. with respect to these variables among farmers
 taking different credit packages.


 45.            The two variables of interest were defined as
 follows.       First; holding size was measured as· the actual
number of, acres planted to crops.         Second, available labor
 force was measured in terms of the number of adult depend-
. ents residing on th~ farm in relatibn to the area cropped,
and this measure is referred to as the labor-land (LL)
ratio.       Data from the 1970/71 and 1971/72 seasons were used
to test the hypothesis but, as the definition of a resident
adult dependent differs somewhat for each year, comparisons
of the LL ratio between the two seasons cannot be made. The
sample used was obtained by collecting data from credit
records on those farmers who, during the annual yield surveys,
clai~ed      to have received credit for the season in question.
In fact the names of many of those who stated that they had
received LLDP credit could not be located in program credit
records.        The sample, therefore, contains only those farmers
who we1.·e confirmed as having received credit.                The sample
was stratified by type of credit package received and the
    . two variables were then crosstabulated against this

to permit detailed statistical testing for all                              pack~ges      and
combinations of packages, but certain interesting patterns do
emerge from the analysis.                         The first of these is that in both

higher and cropped areas lower than both the mean values and
·the values for all other packages.·                         These differences in

area-z           =   3.89, P    =   0.001; 1971/72- LL ratio z              =   0.82,
P   = 0 . .206;       cropped area z          =    2.37, P   = 0.009.      The highly
significant results for cropped area indicate that farmers
taking groundnut packages cultivate on average an area some
22 per cent smaller than that cropped by the average credit
recipient.             Those taking groundnut packages also have LL
ratios some 27 per cent above the mean, though the statistical
significance of this                     re~ult    is considerably less than that
for     ~rapped         area.


47.                  A second pattern, associated with that                     alr~ady

discussed, is that hybrid maize growers have LI. ratios
which are lower than the means for both years and also lower
than the LL ratios for groundnuts. · In the case of hybrid
maize, however, the difference between the LL. ratio of those
taking this package and the mean ratio is more significa11t
~han      in the case of groundnut~ (1970/71: z                       =    2.4li P   =   0.008;
1971/72: z             =   1.23, P       = 0.092).     It is particularly interesting
to note that groundnut growers have mean LL ratios on average
50 per cent greater than hybrid maize growers; the signifi-
cance level for the difference between means is 2.5 per cent
in 1970/71 (t              = 2.22)        and 10 per cent in 1971/72 (t = 1.41).
For one of the years,
                .
                      1970/71, hybrid maize growers have
                                     .


holdings larger than the total mean, but in the following
year ._those growing hybrid maize have holdingS! smaller than
the mean and a third smaller than in 1970/71.                               This reduction
in holding.size is perhaps a reflection of the more lenient
policies regarding creaitworthiness which were in force in
1 0., 1 ,., .,
                             - 2'1 -




 48.       A third pattern that emerges from the data is to be
 expected, i.e. that those farmers taking more than one
 package have in general larger holdings than those taking
only a single package.


 49.       The results of this part of the analysis suggest
quite strongly that those farmers.who take only groundnut
packages on credit differ significantly from those who take
other packages or combinations of packages.     The smaller
cropped area for these groundnut growers is associated with
higher LL ratios, which suggests that the smaller holdings
may be supporting the same number of people as those with
relatively much larger cropped areas.     Does this fact imply
that farmers growing groundnuts on credit are closer to a
subsistence margin than other farmers?     If so, are such
 "subsistence" farmers less capable managers, i.e. to what
extent is their performance in terms of crop yields and
credit repayment less satisfactory than the performance of
other farmers?   Answers to these questions are sought in
later discussions bf other analyses.


 50.       The Relationship Between Credit and Extension Visits--
If farmers are to make efficient and effective use of new and
possibly unfamiliar inputs, it is essential that they receive
instruction in the correct use of these inputs.       The most
relevant instruction is that given on the farm where the
 farmer is.actually employing the inputs, and   t~e   most common
delivery system for such instruction is by visits of extension
staff.   Consequently an effort was made to ascertain to what
extent extension staff concentrated their efforts, in terms
of numbers of visits, on farmers who in a given season had
. received program credit.   As an undue concentration of
extension effort on credit farmers could have unfavorable
results in terms of income distribution, attention was also
directed to the extent to which noncredit farmers were system-
atically excluded from the extension program.

              hypothesis, .i.e. the frequency of extension;visits is unrelated
              to whether'or not a farmer has·credit. This hypothesis was
              tested for two years·by comparing the mean code for the number
              of ~xtension visits (0 = non~, 1 = 1-5, ~ ~ 6-10, ·3 = 11-20,
              4 =· 20+) for those with credit with the mean code for the

              then used to estimate the number of actual extension visits

              reflection of the number of visits received, but the codes
           · for the entire sample are biased upward by the inclusion of
              the credit.recipients. Thus the codes for·the sample will,
              overstate the number ot extension visits the noncredit farmer.
              can expect to receive relative to the number the credit
              farmer .CC).n expect to receive. The code for extens.ton visits.
              was also crosstabulated by type of credit package to

               the dramatic. decline in the mean number of·visits received
               ~ro~ 1970/71 to 1971/72.   For ~he credit sub~an~le this
               decline was 38 per cent, while for the total sample it was
               35 per cent. For both g:toups the decline is un-doubtedly
               related to the fact that, for the .average program unit, the
               number ofcredit·recipients virtually doubled between the two
               ye~rs, so that on this basis a.fixed number of extension staff

               were required to deal with twice as many cr~dit farm~rs~

            53.          This interpretation, however, needs to be suppl-.
            emented with other data from the two seasons. For example,
i'
            the proportion of the total samples above riot receiving any
            v;tsits from extension staff rose from 24 per cent in 1970/71
            to 38 per cent in 1971/72. Also the proportion of growers_

            over the two seasons. Thus the rapid ·expansion of the credit
            program is associated both witl;l an increase in the number of
            f'arx,ners,who receive' no extension visits and.witha decrease
            in.the a"erage number of visits received by farmers'who are

               A~ noted earlier, though, these pe~centages understate the
               rel~tiv~ ~ositions of credit and nOncredit f~rmers becau~e

               sample in 1970/71 and 1971/7~ respectively.

               55.          Where credit packages for the two years arE!
               COf!lf>arable, it can be seenthat only hybrid maize growers
               hav~ not experienced an appreciable decliJ:le ir. the_ mean

               by well over half. ·Farmers taking packages other than'ttiese

two experienced intermediate declines in the number of visits.


56.          In regard to declining groundnut yields in LLDP,
it is particularly interesting to note the decreasing number
of extension visits being made to groundnut growers and the
fairly constant number of visits being made to hybrid maize
growers.     In 1970/71, the code for number of visits for both
groups of growers is not significantly different from the mean
code, and the difference between the two groups is signifi-
cant only at the 25 per cent level (t = 0.79).        In 1971/72,
however, all the levels of significance rise; groundnuts
(z = 1.36, P = 0.087) and hybrid maize (z = 1.16, P = 0.123)
have roughly the same levels of significance respectively
below and above the mean, while the level of significance of
the    ~ifference   between the two groups rises to 10   ~er   cent
(t=l~56).


57.         A concluding remark stems from the fact that,
though for the two seasons examined some 30 percent of
farmers received no visits from extension staff, 70 per cent
did receive visits and this represents a very significant
improvement over the performance in areas outside the project,
where 80 per cent of farmers receive no visits.       The fact
that the. average project farmer receives some eight to nine
visits a year is also commendable, though       ~onsideration   of
the distribution of these visits across the farming population
would temper the commendation somewhat.        Nevertheless, there
is no evidence to suggest that extension staff concentrate
exclusively on credit     growers~   although they do appear to
                                                                      :.

the sample index will be biased upward and there will be a_
tendency_ to understate the differ-ence between credit growers
and noncredit growers. Comparison is also made of the

on'th~ use and effect of production credit.                This is a point
that is elaborated at several other places in this report.


68.           A general comment is that perhaps too much attention
has been given to the concern that the survey process will
alter the sample in      a   significant way, and a totally new
sample is still drawn for every season's surveys.                Such
                                                       '
concern .is no doubt valid where surveying is carried out in
a larget~ static socioeconomic system, but surely in a
dynamic situation such as that existing at Lilongwe, where
fa,;rmers are subjected to barrages of change stimuli, the
il'l:f luence of s.everal hours' interviewing a year could be

               CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND DEFAULTS



69.         Having looked at the apparent determinants of the
distribution of seasonal credit in Section II, this section
wilL go on to attempt an evaluation of credit performance.
The criterion for judging credit performance of farmers is
whether or not they default on seasonal loans.              There are
other, arguably more valid criteria by which 'credit perform-
a~ce might be assessed~ and looking at default rate~ rather
tends to accentuate aspects related to the financial
viability of the credit program.           To a degree this emphasis
has been avoided in the analysis by examining the factors
which appear to influence defaulting, in an effort to get
c~oser to a more meaningful interpretation of credit perform-
ance.


70. .       Defaults and Size of Holding-- For purposes of· the
analysis a borrower becomes a defaulter if,. on August 31st
of a given year, he has not repaid the total amount due on
his loan from the preceding growing season.              This date was.
chbs'en because LLDP uses it to determine arrears and because
penalty charges are meant to be imposed          a~ter    August 31st
(though such charges are frequently not made in practice).
Technically, then, the analysis is identifying farmers in
arrears   ia~her   than   defaulters~   though a proportion of the
former will eventually become defaulters.           For purposes of .
deriving project policy, the analysis is ·most usefully
regarded as an examination of factors associated with late

    is highly significantly different from the mean (z = 2.19,
    P ~·0.014)~ Ther~fore, ~hile default per se is not~affected ·
    by holding size, the proportion of the loan·not·repaid by

    size. Further comment wili be made on this:phenomenon later.

     73.        Default Rate in Relation to Type of Credit Package~-
      It was thought to be particularly important to test the
      hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the
      default rate among fa~mers growing maize, groundnuts or
      tobacco on credit. Such testing, it was felt, could be
      indicative as to whether certain types of credit packages
      are used more efficiently.than others and .whether the .
                                                               returns
      to use of a given package are high enough to permit full
    . repayment of the loan while maintaining previous·Ieyels of.
      consumption. The v_ariables employed are.tlle.typE;!:of credit
      package taken--maize, ·groundnuts, some combination of maize
      and groundnuts, and other (principally ft;!rtilizer, thought
                                                  .               .

      total amount due repaid on August 31st. The hypothes·is was
      tested for the two seasonsl970/71 and 1~71/72.

    74.       One component of the analysis was the .construction·
    of correlation matrices ·relating the perce'ntage repaid to a
    number of other variables, for each .season separat.ely and
    for both
         .
             seasons together. Iri all matrices, t,he percentage

    of'credit pac:kages taken,.with the value of the pac:kage, and
    withthe complexity of the packages. The last is measured

    five packages are taken and all are for the same kind of
    maize, this is considered a one-trait package;' ~f 'two or mor'e
    packages are taken, all of which are either.maize or ground-
    nuts, this is a two-trait package. Similarly I. e~ch additional .
    crop or technology represented in a. given combination of.·
    packages.is another distinctive.trait. The percentage of the
                   i'
    amount due repaid is'also positively but weakly correlated
    with both cropped area and total holding size. Because of
    the. low absolute values of all the correlation coefficients~ ..

 hav~ the.highest.repaym~nt rates for both seasons.


    77.     A further breakdown of the 1971/72 data on maize
 packages reveals that farmers taking hybrid packages only
 (n = 34) repaid on average 81 per cent of the.l,.r loans,
 farmers taking synthetic packages only (n =. 8l).repaid 87

 synthetic (n = 9) repaid on average 93 per.cent. Signifi-
 cance levels have not been calculated for this preakdown.

    78.       In summary~ . the results indicate that for.· each
    season considered separately repayment rat.es are ·highest·
    for maize and other--mainly fertilizer--packages and lowest
    for combinations of packages containing ma.ize and groundnuts...

    79,~   . Defaults Related to Crop Yields and Productiori--
 On .a priori grounds, . .it would be logical t~ assume·. that
.agriCultural performance measured in terms of crop yields
 and total production "{OUld be the single most important
 determinant of credit repayment rates. Accordingly the
 nypothesis was formulated that default rates.are'independent
 of yields of maize and groundnuts, of total proc1uction of .
 each .of th.es~
              .
                 crops. and
                        .
                             of combined

 Productio~ of each crop was estimated.by m\,lltiplying the·

 total area planted to the crop.            While this method is.not
 necessarily completely reliable, it is the only way an
 estimate of production could be obtained.               The hypothesis
 was tested using the credit subsamples for 1970/71 and
 1971/72, and the results are given in Table 1.


 80.          The results obtained are generally disappointing
 for, although apparently important differences are detected'
 in the variables used, none of the differences is significant
 at even the 10 per cent level.             Thus the hypothesis cannot
 be rejected, even though intuitively one would think that it
 should be.


 81.          Some broad patterns are revealed by the analysis,
 but in the absence of significance their interpretation is · ·
 largely a matter of guesswork and thus all the more hazardous.
 For example, in both seasons farmers repaying 100 per cent
 of their loans have lower yields and           prod~ction    of both crops
 than farmers repaying less than 100 per cent.               One possible
 reason for this phenomenon is that farmers·with higher yields
   .     .                                           .        .
 and production make greater use of illicit marketing channels
 and thus escape repaying all or part of their loans, or that
 these farmers store surplus production to sell locally when
 prices rise after the post-harvest period and are thus late
 in repaying their loans.     The fact that fairly large numbers
 of farmers repay their loans in cash, presumably obtained
 through nonofficial sales, tends to support the latter part
 of this conjecture.


 82.          Anothermteresting observation comes from the data
 in Table 1.    Comparing the total samples for the two seasons,
 it will be noted that while the average maize yield rose by
 15 per cent from the one year to the other, average total
. production rose by le.ss than one per cent.            This fact is
 consistent with two interpretations:             first--farmers tend to
 reduce their maize acre~ge as yields rise, possibl~ to plant
 a more lucrative crop, i.e. tobacco; and second--the credit

          the marketing channels utilized. Data were available for the
 !
          1971/72 season which indicated the marketing channeis farm~~s
          intended-to use for their maize and grouridri.utc!:'ops. In the

          a~d ~our, for malzeand gtouhdnuts respectively, if all sales
          were to be made to ADMARC, with intermediate codes represent-
          ing barter and other local and private sa].es. As the codes
          can l;le employed as a crude hierarchy with the higher.nuinbers
          signifying a greater orientation towa~d co~erc.ial and

remove from the core of the issue, since in using extension
visits as·the independent variables one is already using
proxies for what is more immediately interesting, i.e. how
extension visits and yields are linked thtough:±he adoption
or nonadoption. of yield-increasing inputs and practices.
This chain of causality will be considered explicitly below.


92.       Adoption, Yields and Extension Visits--Tables 3 and
4 relate extension visits to groundnut yields through explicit
inputs and practices, while Tables 5 and 6 do the same for
maize.   Each input/practice is considered separately by crop
below.


          A. Groundnuts
              (1) Sulphur. Sulphur is recommended to control
          leafspqt disease in groundnuts.  In 1970/71 five per
          cent of a sample of 759 used sulphur; nine per cent
          of those visited used it, while less than one per
          cent of those not visited used it. ~orne 95 per
          cent of users had visits, while only 50 per cent of
          nonusers had visits.   In 1971/72 seven per cent of
          a sample of 725 used sulphur; 13 per cent of those
          visited used it, while less than one pei cent of
          those not visited used it. Some 92 per cent of
          users had visits, while only 43 per cent ·of nonusers
          had visits. There is nb significant difference
          between yields of sulphur-users and nonusers, though
          this fact may stern from either the relatively small
          size of the samples or from a level of application
          lower than that suggested by research result~.

               (2) Variety. Chalimbana is the.variety included
           in LLDP groundnut credit packages. The proportion
           of those growing each variety and receiving extension
           visits is as follows: 1970/71--Kalisere 50,
           Chalimbana 57 and mixtures 49 per c~nt;_ 1971/72--
          ·Kalisere 27, Chalimbana 48 and mixtures 46 per cent.
           Kalisere, with fewer extension visits, yields
           consistently less than the average in both seasons.
            (P = 0.004 and 0.001). In 1970/71, neither Chali~-
           bana nor mixtures have yields significantly different
           from the mean; however, in 1971/72 Chalimbana yields
           more than the mean (P = 0.013) and mixtures yield
           less than the mean (P = 0.056). It is interesting
           to note that, on average for all varieties· in 1970/
           71, those farmers with no extension visits had .the
           highest yields.

             (3) Tobacco growing.   The growing- of tobacco has
         been inciuded here because ot the belief that
         tobacco-gro~ers constitute a very special subset ·
·- ·.    of the LLDP population. - The evidence shown in
         Tables 3 and 4 strongly supports thi~ belief for,-
         although they do not receive a disproportionately
         large share of extension visits, toba~co-growers
         nonetheless obtain groundnut yields substantially
         greater than nongrowers. The difference in the
         ~ean yield obtained by growers and nongrowers is
         significant at a probability level of 0.005 (1~70/
         71: t =. 5.88; 1971/72: ·_t = 3.99). Not only is
         the niean yield of grourtdnuts .obtained by tobacco-.
         growers greater but also for every level of exten-_.
         sion visits for both years growers achieve higher
         yields than nongrowers.

              (1) Fertilizer. In 1970/71, 16 per cent of a
          sample of 856 used fertilizer; 21 per·cent of
          those visited used it, while 10 per cent of those
          not visited used it. Some 69 per cent of users
          were visited, but only SO per cent- of nonus'ers
          received visits. In 1~11/72, there was a cons{d-
          erable increase in fertilizer use and-there is
          !?tronger evidence of an extension irepa,ct. In this
          season, 26 per cent of a sample of 8R6 used
          fertilizer; 52 per cent of those: visited used it,_
          while nine per cent of those not visifed used it.
          Among all fertilizer-users, 84 per cerit'were
          visited but only 34 per cent of nonusers.received
          visits. Using the chi-square tef:!t indicates that
          the relationship between fertilizer-use and        .
          extension visits is significant at a probability
        . level of 0.001. for both seasons.. The maize yields
          achieved by fe~tilizer-users are significantly
          higher (P

             (2) Manure. The use of manure 'appears to_ be
         declining as the use of chemical fel:'tilizer is ·
         increasing. Seven per cent of growers used manure·
         in 1970/71 and attained anaverage yield 56 per
         cent above that of nonusers (significant at a
         probability level of o.oo5). Only five per eent

     groundnut yields obtained by the two groups are virtually            I

     does not indicate what credit package they received.            Enough
     maize packages were issued in 1970/71 to plant an area 10
     times as large as could be planted with the groundnut packages
                                                                          '

     credit program would be greater on maize than on groundnutsl.


     96.          Analysis using a chi-square test indicates, as would
     be expected, that credit recipients receive extension visit~
     in significantly greater numbers than would be expected on           a
     simple proportional basis.     The expected and observed        numbe~s

     of credit recipients in each extension category are shown
     below:

     What is most surprising about the observed number of visits
     is that 18 per cent of credit recipients received not even
     a· single extension visit.   It would be extremely interesting
     to know to what extent, since 1970/71, the expansion of the

    97.              Extension Visits Related to FarmSize--As many
    extension programs have been criticized on the grounds·that
    staff tend to concentrate their efforts on the larger .farms,
    it was thought worthwhile to examine the extent to which a
    bias in favor of large farms exists within LLDP~ Farm size
    (measured as cropped area) was arrayed with the number of . ·
    e:?Ctension visits received in the 1970/71 and 1971/72 seasons,
    and the results are shown below:

        large and may be more significant than simple magnitudes
        alone would suggest.


        100.      To summarize the findings of this section, there
        is strong evidence of a positive extension impact on crop
        yields, though most of the available evidence indicates
        association rather than causation.      The principal extension
        impact appears to derive from an interaction amung seasonal
        credit, adoption of practices and inputs, and extension staff
        visits.   Extension staff concentrate their efforts most
        strongly on the relatively larger holdings and on holdings
        where the farmer is a credit recipient.     Evidence is presented
        which suppotts the belief that tobacco-growers constitude a
        distinct subgroup of the.prograrn's target population, for
        they consistently outperform in yield terms other program
        farmers; yet they attain their superior performance levels
        without the benefit of   an~   more assistance from extension
        staff than .that received by other farmers.

                      DETERMINANTS OF CROP YIELDS



       lOL        The Lilongwe project was originally conceived with
      objectives which differ considerably from those which sub-.
       seq~ently came to be espoused by project management and by

       Ban.k staff. The original· goal was essentially that of
       increasing production of three crops~-maize, groundnuts and
       tobacco; and increased production was to be achieved by
       raising yields, by expanding acre~ge and by relying upon
      market incentives to stimulate a positive supply response.
     'The most important of these three factors was the project's
       intended impact on crop yields, and yields became the weather-
       vane that indicated the project's degree of success or
       failure. The bulk of the project's evaluation work is still
       directed toward asbertaining seasonal yields through ~ long-
       continuing series of annual yie_ld surveys; this emphasis on .
      .physical yields persists despite the embodiment of a broader
       coridept of rciral (rather than purely agricultural) develop-
       ment in the design of the second and third phases of the
       project •

     . 102.       Since yields have·already received a great ~eal of
       attention in the project's annual yield reports, in the ARCS
       review Of·LLDP and in the Bank's performance audit of the
       first phase, there is little point in duplicating these
       earlier results here. The approach taken, therefore, is to
       try to broaden the perspective on yields by viewing the data
       in. a slightly d,ifferent context than that of the previous·
       work and by approachin,g the ana~ysls with a different set of
       questions.

103.      Comparison of Project and Nonproject Yields-~The

administered by LLDP and those outside it. ·The hypothesis

significance levels for the differences in the means, are

 104.     Maize yields are consistently higher within the·
project than outside it, and the difference is significant
two years out of three. For groundnut yields, only the higher
yield outside the project in 1970/71 is signific~nt. The
figures above should be interpreted bearing in mind the fact
that the area covered by LLDP expanded in each of the three
seasons shown, so that mean yields reflect differences in
area productivity as well as seasonal differences. Unfortu-
nately the method of sampling used by the LLDP evaluation

           105. ·      Growers' Opinions of Crop Yield_s--In each ~:~eason
           farmers ·were asked how their overall yield of maize ang
           groundnuts compared with previous seasons. If yields within
           LLDP are improving, it is important that they be improving _
           quickly enough, or on a scale of magnitude great enough to be
           perceived by the farmers concerned.- Hence, as a matter                  of
           iriteres.t, growers' opinions of' their :crop ·yields were arrayed

106•        Though differences in sample size make valid
. comparisons. somewhat difficult, for LLDP growers the subjec-
  tive assessment as to what is a bad maize yield seems to
  indicate increasing expectations over time. In contrast, with
  the exception of the seasonal dip in 1970/71, there does not
  seem to be much change in the notion of what an average or
above average yield is. The pattern is reversed in the case
  of groundnuts, for farmers' notions as to what is an average
  yield have declined every year, paralleling the decline in
  physical yields. Opinions as to what is a bad and an above~-.
  average groundnut yield also reflect a downwardtrend.

107.       On average, for both maize and groundnuts, an
average yield is some 68 to 82 per cent above a bad yield,
and an a.bove-average yield is 24 to 32 per cent greater than
an av~rage _yield. A bad yield is only 48 per .cent of-an
abov·e_-average one.

108.       Yields Related to Factors Beyond the ·proj"eet·• s
Control--A number of economic and other factors cannot be
influenced direct!~ by project activities and thus cannot be
manipulated
       '   .
             so as to improve crop yields.
                                       .
                                             Among the most
obvious factors which are beyond the control of the project
are weather and soils. Analysis carried out for the ARDS
rev_iew of LLDP. attempted to relate rainfall to crop yields
                                        .   ,.


through several functional forms but the results obtained
were not significant. Attempts to use soil type as an.
explanatory variable were thwarted by~a lack of disaggregated
data.

109.       Ultimately it proved possible to examine only two
of the factors outside the project's control~-labour force
size and cropped area. Physical yields of malze and ground<:'
nuts were regressed on these two variables for the seasons
1969/70.and 1970/71. Results of these regressions, as well
as the ~esults of all other regression equations in thi~
section, are set out in full in the Annex. As a rule, only
the. major implications of the results will be discussed in
                           - 56 -




 110.      The results are consistent in indicating that yields
of both maize.and groundnuts are higher ori holdings with
·larger.cropped areas, though this finding is more significant
 in·the case of groundnuts'than for maize. As would be
 expected~ the two independent variables are quite strongly

c6r~elated (coefficients range from 0.248 to 0.496), so that
yields are also positively related to increments in the labor
 force (with the exception of groundnuts in 1969/70).

111.      These results are important because they provide
additional evidence relating to the problematical groundnut
yields. An. inc::rease in per-unit yields with an increase in
cropped area is in general the oppo.si te of what one would ..
expect to find in most situations. This phenomenon is thought
to.occur with groundnuts in the Lilongwe area because the.
smaller holdings lack adequate land .on which to rotate ground-
nuts with other crops or with a fallow. Short rotations or
th~ complete absence of rotations is thought to contribute
to a build-up·of .the pests and diseases which attack.ground-
nuts. For comparasion purposes, a holding with five acres
of cropped land can expect on average to achieve groundnut
yields some 130 lb/acre greater than a holding with only two
acres, assuming situations regarding labor availability
remain fixed.

  112.        Yields Related to Specific Practices--Among the
  practices which the project could influence, and which would
  inyolve no direct financial outlay for farmers, are the time
  of planting and the per-acre planting density. Time of
  planting (with fiv.e different periods defined from "before
  the first rains" through "well after the main rains" and per-
  acre plant population (at time of harvest) were employed as
. ind.ependent variables· to examine their :l:mpact on yields.
  Again, as would be expected," the two independent variables
  are highly correlated, though with a seasonal effect in·
  evidence; and the correlation coefficients range from -0.836
  to +0_. 780, with no absolute value less than o. 500. Results

              plant population are, of course, all positive and also highly
              significant, with the coefficients for maize being larger
              than those for groundnuts. The equations for groundnuts
              explain on average about twice as much of the variation in
              yield as the comparable equations for maize.

                113.       Another factor which could be influenced by project
                extension staff with no direct financial outlay by farmers
              . is crop rotations. Crop rotations, and cropping practices,
                are·aspects of cultivation that have been little examined.
                by LLDP.- The follow-up study obtained results which indicate
                that rotations and intercropping have important consequences
                in terms ·of c.rop yields. The results are set out below:

     114.       The most consistent result is that poor yields are
     obtained following·a fallow, regardless of crop. On average,
     groundnuts yieid better when they·· are planted f'ollowing a maize
     crop, as is the most common practice. Particularly striking
     are the very highmaize yields obtained when this crop follows
     tobacco; the total mean maize yield W<?uld be much lower if
     the yields of tobacco-gr~wers were excluded~ The high maize
     yields ~f tobacco-growers are thought to ste~ from residual

     ~~ain,. tobacco~growers are· singl~d out as being di~ferent in
     an important respect from other project farmers.

       115.      With. regard to intercropping, groundnuts yield .
       significantly better either planted in pure stand or inter-
       planted with crops other than maize. In 1970/71, maize in
       pure stand or interplanted.with crops other than groundnuts
      _yiel~ed more than the mean (though not ~ignificantly)7 whil~·
       in 1971/72, maize interplanted with crops other than ground-
       nuts yielded significantly less than the mean, but ali' other
       mixtures and pure stand maize yielded more than the mean (not
     . significant).

       116.. ···    As the regression results for time of planting were

     117.      For the two seasons, the average yield for medium-
     planted maize is just seven per cent less than that for early-
     planted maize, although the difference between early and
     medium-planted maize is statistically significant only in
     1970/71 (t = 2. 41, P = 0.01}. .The most dramatic decline in
     maize Yields occuts with late planting, which results in yield~
     onaverage 26 per cent lower than with medium planting.· Maize
     planting in 1971/72 appears to be generally later than in the
     pr~vious year.



     118.      .Groundnuts are not generally planted early, as the .
     figures above clearly show. The average yield loss from late
     planting as compared with the normal medium planting is so~e
        .                                  .
     19 per cent, b~t only the figure for late planting in 1971/72
     is statistically different from the mean.

     119.      Looking at the average coefficients of variation for
     yields for each of the three planting times reveals that·
     maize yields are most reliable with medium planting; both
     early and late planting result in somewhat more variable yields.
     For groundnuts the coefficient of variation for yields rises
     continuously from early through medium to late planting. The .
     average cioefficierits are:

120.       As the coefficient of variation is defined as the
standard <leviation divided by the mean (times 100), it can be·
reduced either by decreasing the variance of the yields or by
increasing the mean yield, or both. The figures above, then,
suggest that when both the mean yield and its varianc~ are
considered together maize should be medium-planted and ground-
nuts early-planted. The small samples for groundnuts.are
somewhat suspect, so that medium planting for groundnuts is
pro~ably a safer recommendation.   Medium~planting of ground-

nuts, however, encounters an immediate bottleneck; which is
caused by the planting of m~ize--the staple foodstuff-~in the
same period.. As a consequence, the planting of groundnuts
terids·~o be'delayed until even later~



121.       A note of caution should be injected here regarding
the making of recommendations on the strength of results
derived from analysis of yield data in isolation froin other
types of data. It is now widely recognized that time of
planting, .for example, is of crucial importance in determining
yields in rainfed agricultural systems, and the results here
corroborate this importance. It would be naive, however, .to
recommend any particular time of planting without additional
information on such factors as the existence of labour bottle-
necks or the extent to which a trade-off exists for the.
farmers between the level and the.reliability of yields.
Where management decisions need to be made regarding the ·
adoption of cropping practices to be recommended for the
project farming .system, this is the point where it becomes
essential for the yield data to be supplemented by data based
on farm management studies. Without this latter type of

      a given target has beert achieved and tell nothing as to why
      or how the· achievement .was accomplished.

      122.      Yields Related to Crop Variety--A variable on which
      the project has exert~d considerable inf1uende is the variety
      of crop--particularly maize--planted, though in this case the
      innovation is made only with some financial cost to the farmer~
      The results of the regression models for crop variety.are
      given ~n the Annex, while the figures following below show
      the mean yields over three seasons-for maize and groundnuts.

        123.       Maize yields have been grouped by type .rather. than
      . by individual variety since in certain ins-tances one vartety
        of· a certain type has been phased out to be replaced by ·
      · another var.iety •. The yields shown relate. only to the project
        area.

       from results such as these. - It is possible to say that hybrids

       consistently outyield local maize~ but only the superiority
       of the hybrid is significant (at. P = 0.01) in every year,
       while the synthetics yield significantly more than local maize
       in· only one year (1971/72 at P  =0.01) ~ Aside from these

             126.      Because zero yields have been separated out from
             the 1969/70 variety data but included in the total for that
             year, it is possible to see what good yields at least some
             farmers.achieve. Due to the method of treatment, of course,
             all 1969/70 yields are significantly greater than the mean
             yield. The yields for 1969/70 should be contrasted with
             those for the other two years, .where zero yields are taken
             into account in the mean yield figures for varieties and··
             mixtures. None of the individual results for 1970/71 is
            .significantly different from the mean yield, but in l971/72

     127.        Treating the data in the manner used for 1969/70
     results in an interesting hypothesis: LLDP is not experiencing
     a general decline in groundnut yields but' rather the devedop-
     ment of a bimodal pattern of yields in which substantial
     nuffibers of farmers receive excellent yields while large
     ·numbers of others suffer near or complete crop failures.
     For reasons explained in the introduction; this was another
      hypothesis where exploration of validity could be taken no
      further. If _the hypothesis is valid, however, it. should ma~e

                  DETERMINANTS OF INCOME DISTRIBUTION



       12 9.     As noted in the introductory paragraph to Section V,
       LLDP was conceived fundamentally as a crop productivity
       project. That Lilongwe is now regarded as a model for the
       Bank's "new style" projects is recognition of the far;_reaching
       evolutionary changes .that hav~ occured during some seven yea~s
       of implementation. It is interesting to note, however, that
       evolution has occurred at a faster rate in some areas of
       prbject operations than in others; despite changing priorities
       on the part of project management and the Bank, the evaluation
       effort does not yet reflect these changes in'direction and in
       general far more attention is directed toward questions
       relating to crop productivity than to issues relating to rural
       development in a much broader sense. Doubtless, though, the
       operations of the evaluation unit at LLDP will evolve as have
       the activities of other project sections (though the needed
       changes might take place faster and more efficiently with the
       assistance of external direction and manpower resources).
       What is of concern here is that the analysis of income distri-
       bution is further from the original purposes· of the data than
       any other subject examined in this report; as a consequence,
       f.ewer aspects of this subject can be ana.lyzed and the results
       of the. analysis need to be interpreted with more than the
       usual caution.

       130.      The data on income reported in this section derive
       from the socioeconomic survey carried out in 1969/70, a s~ason
       when LLDP operations covered a relatively small area. It is
       possible that over subsequent years LLDP's operations and
..

     programs have resulted in substantial changes both ih absolute
     arid relative income levels, hence t~e resuits obtained here
     should perhaps best be. regarded as benchmarks.both to be
     verified and against which to assess the magnitude and
     direction of change in possible future survey work.

     131.      Agricultural Income and Social Status--Social.
     status could obviously be defined in many dimensions and
     using many different variables, but the variable used in the
     analysis was a composite one indicating {1) whether_or not a
     farmer held a position of traditional or nontraditional
     responsibility (with these positions ranked in a crude
     hierarchy and weighted) , {2) the highest level of formal
     education attained, and (3) the number of gardens for which
     ~n individual held cultivation rights.   The mea~ of the
     status scores was 3.27 with a range of 15 {1-16). Two strata
     were defined: one for farmers with a status score of 10 or
     less and one for those with a score of more than 10. The
     results ofthis stratificatiori·are as follows:



               Status score                  Mean agricultural income

      The t value for the difference between the means of the two
      strata is significant at the 10 per cent level, which
      suggests that the definition of social status employed is
      reasonably useful in detecting differences in agricultural
      income. Only two per cent of the total sample falls within
      the upper stratum. The r_ange of individual agricultural
     -incomes is enormous, and the sample mean income ('at the-99.

              fourth place, after livestock. The ARDS review of LLDP
           · shows that recorded cash receipts from maize and groundnuts
             as a proportion of total cash receipts have risen from some
             22 per cent in 1969/70 to about 40 per cent in 1971/72, and
              this· can be taken as evidence that the dominant position of
              tobacco as the principal cash crop has been weakened.

               133.      Agricultural Incomes and-Migration--It was
               hypothesized that farmers with limited agricultural opport~
               unities and low farm incomes would be more inclined to take
               advantage of the possibility of migrating to work temporarily
               outside Malawi, a practice common both in the LLDP area and
               elsewhere in the country. The hypothesis could not be
               ;:
               directly tested in the farm stated above wifh the available
               data, hence an ex post approach was taken instead. It is
               the pr~ctice for migrants to send part of their earhings ·
               back.to their families who have remained in Malawi, therefore
               receipt of such remittances is the surest indication that a
                               - 67 -




    .member of the·farnily is actually in paid.ernployrnent outside
     the country. Receipt of remittances then should be negatively
     asspciated with agricultural income if the hypothesis holds.
     A second, and also indirect, test was employed which consisted
     of comparing the current agricultural incomes of those
     Jarmers who had in the past worked outside Malawi with the
     incomes of farmers who had never worked outside.the country.
     Both sets of results are shown below:

     134.      The confidence intervals and range for the total
     mean agricultural ~ncome of Kll7 are identical to those shown
     with.the results reported under social status; as these
     parameters are also identical for other .results in this section, ·
     they will not. be reported again.

     135.       The results of both tests are the opposite of those
     hypothesized, i.e. former migrants and current migrants'
     families appear to have agricultural incomes well above those
     of nonmigrants or those who are not receiving remittances
     from a family member abroad. These differences have magni-
     tudes of 43 per cent (Test ·Il and 20 per cent (Test II) , but
     the. t values for the differences· between mean incomes· are
     significant onli at the 25 per cent level in both cases. ·
     Th'e results, therefore, are not consistent with the inter-

pretation .that in the Lilongwe area it is farmers in the lower
income groups who emigrate for employment. On the contrary,
the findings suggest that there is some positive· link between
emigration and agricultural income, possibly that income
earned abroad is reinvested in the farming enterprise. The
ana1y$is of this data carried out by LLDP concludes, however,
tha.t .the most popular expenditure categories for repatriated
earnings are,.in order of importance, consumer nondurables
and durables, livestock, and gifts~ only five pet cent of
recently returned migrants reported m~king on-farm investments.
The nature of the link,. then, between emigration and higher
agricultural incomes remains obscure~ it would, however, be
of interest in future work to examine th~ hypothesis that
re~urned migr~nts have higher innovation adoption rates,

possible reflecting a sophistication acquired through the
migration experience.

136.       Agricultur·al In·comes and Wage· Earnings--A rough
comparison between e~timated agricultural incomes in the
Lilongwe rural areas and the earnings possible working at the
statutory minimum wage level in the city of Lilongwe suggested.
that on average gross incomes were higher in ·the rural areas.
Estimated minimum cash earnings ·from urban employment were
approximately K95 per annum while mean agricultural incomes,
as shown earlier, were Kll7. It was hypothesized, therefore,
that "farmers" who·have regular paid employment seek out such
work because they have only limited opportunities in agric-
ulture and that agricultural income would be negatively
associated with wage income. This hypothesis was tested by
again 'using a. simple two-way stratification of 'the sample:



                                       Mean agricultural income
·No wage employment during preceding
  ·year (625)                                   Kl22
 Regular· paid employment during
   preceding year (57)                            70
                            -   69 -




 137~      Full~time   farmers with no outside employment had
  agricultural incomes 74 per cent greater than "farmers" with
  regular wage employment; the ·K70 agricultural income of the
. latter is significantly lower than the total mean income
   (z ~ 2.27, P = 0.012). Such a result is not really surprising,
  however, as an individual in wage employment would have less.
  time to devote to farming. Indeed, what is surprising.is_that
  the agricultural income of wage-earners is as high as it is,
  though this fact is probably explained by the practice of wage
  earners' leaving their families behind to cultivate the
  family holding. More than eight per cent of the sample had
  been in regular wage employment during 1969/70; summing their
  agricultural income with their estimated wage earnings
  results in an estimate of total gross earnings of Kl65 per
  annum, 41 per cent above the total. mean agricultural income.
  Thus, rather than seeking wage employment because their
  farming opportunities are limited, wage-earners may simply
  be taking.advantage of an additional opportunity to increase
 :their total income. ·

138.        Agricultural Incomes and Nonagricultural Incomes--
It was expected that agricultural incomes would be strongly
related to nonagricultural income (excluding wages) because
of . the tendency for wealthier farmers to diversify by invest-
ing in nonagriculturai enterprises. Data were avail~ble
which indicated which farmers received income from maize
grinding mills, grocery stores or small shops, brewing or
distilling local alcohOlic beverages or oth~r sources. The
sample was divided into two strata: those who had suc.h a
nonagricultural income and those who did not. The. mean
agricultural-income for each stratum is shown below:



                                       Mean agricultural income
 No nonagricultural investment
  ··income (418)                                Kl08
 Income from mill,· shop, brewing,
    other (264)                                  131
·.                                   - 70 .:.




       139.     Though farmers with non.agricul tural investment
      income have agricultural incomes 21 per cent greater than
      those with no suc;h income, the former group's mean income is
      nof highly significantly greater than the total mean (z = 0.64,
      p   =    0.~61).


     .. 140.     This relatively low level of significance-probably
      stems from inclusion of those with brewing or distilling as
      a source of nonagricultural income. The making of "hoine
      brew" is a very widespread activity ·which can be expected to
      indrease wben maize yields and produetion.rise even further.
      This type of activity could be expected to exhibit a positive .
      but weak correlation with agricultural income since the
      principal participants will be farmers (or farmers' wives)
      who have a surplus of maize. It is also quite likely that
      brewing and distilling are among the first nonagricultural
           . .                               .                 .
      investments made by farmers since the techniques are known
      to all and the capital requirements.are small. Almost 40 per
      cent of the sample farmers have some source of nonagricultural
      income,· and it is thought that for most this source is
      brewing and/or distilling.

       141.       Agricultural. rn·c·ome·s and Gift·s· i"n Cash ·and in Kind--
       The role of gifts in the Lilongwe area is an interesting one,
       for the. giving of gifts appears on. the one hand to be a
       manifestation of a built-in social welfare system and on. the
       other a device used to create a debt-bondage that is repaid
       by the recipients' supplying labour to the givers. The first
       hypoth~sis tested was that gifts of cash were in fact soci~l

       trans~er" payments, i.e. that such gifts were made by the
       relatively better-off farmers to those less well off. The
       1969/70 SES sample was stratified according to whether or not
       farmers had received gifts of cash during the previous year.
       The mean agricultural income of·each stratum is shown below:
                                          - 71 -

            142.      The income of those receiving gifts is sig~ifi-
            cantly lower than the mean ·cz = 1.49, p· = 0.068) while the
            income of those not receiving gifts does not differ signifi-
            cantly from the mean (z = 0.25, P = 0.401). The evidence,
            therefore, supports the belief that it is the relatively less-
            well-off who receive gifts of cash but unfortunately provides
            little information as to the economic well-being of the
            givers. It would not be unreasonable to assume, however,
            even w~thout supporting data, that such gifts of cash come
            from donors with relatively larger cash incomes and therefore
            amount to a redistribution of cash income (provided no
                                  '           '

            repayment is implied or understood) •
.·~
             14 3.      The term ''gift" is somewhat ambig~ous in the ·
            Lilongwe context, as it is not known to what extent strings
            may be attached to what appears to the outsider to be a
             straightforward present. rt     isknown, for example, that the
             relatively wealthy and those who are rapidly on the way to
             becoming relatively wealthy will make gifts in order to avoid
            recrimination and possibly retribution from relatives and
             others who do not enjoy equally high levels of prosperity.
             In this context "gift" should perhaps be read as "bribe"~
             It is also known, though, that farmers frequently make gifts
            to members of their extended families, but even in these·
             cases the gifts may not be made entirely willingly. At any
             rate, there is almost certainly a reciprocity mechanism at
            work and, should there be a reversal in the relative
             fortunes of the better-off and the worse-off, there would
             likely be a reversal ·also in the roles of donor and recipient.

            1~4.      The   discus~ion   above relates primarily to one

  of monetary wealth, for whatever motivation, from the
  relatively wealthy to the relatively poor. Work carried out
  as part of the ARDS generated a hypothesis regarding gift-
  giving less benign than that tested above. This hypothesis
. is that the giving of gifts in the form of produce to
  distressed farmers perpetuates their poverty by obliging the·
  recipients to work for the giver at a time when their
  opportunity cost on their own holdings is highest. In order
  to obtain data relating to this hypothesis, a subsample of
  117 farmers was drawn from the 1972/73 LLDP sample selected
  for yield studies, and interviews were carried out in October
  1973. Information was collected on whether farmers had given
  or received gifts of maize or groundnuts, how much produce .
  was receiyed or given, and whether work--and how much and
.what.kind--had·been or would·be done as aconsequence of the
  gift.

 145.        ·Thirteen per cent of the. sample had received gifts.
 in kind and 30 per cent had given them. Whether or not there
·is an obligation to work stemming from receipt of a gift in.
 kind varies somewhat depending upon whether one asks the
 donot or the recipient. Of those who received gifts, 5~ per
 cent stated that they had worked or w6uld work for the person
 who gave the produce to them. On the other hand, only 23_per
 cent of those giving away produce claimed that the recipient
 would work for them in return. While these different
 perspectives_on the obligations accruing from gifts may
 arise from an individual's,position as a giver or as a
 reci.~ient 1. they are alSO COnSiStent With the interpretatiOn.
 that the donors who expect work in return give produce to.
 more than one individual or family. The proportion of growers
 making gifts in the 1973 sample generally coincides with the
 results of a 1971/72 LLDP survey (using a sample. four times
 as l~tge), in which 23 per cent 6£ ·farmers made gifts of
 maiz.e and ·13 per cent made gifts of groundnuts.

          146.      Those who received gifts and worked put in an
          average of slightly more than 10 labor-days on behalf of
          those who·gave them·the gift; and most of this work was
          related to preparing land for planting, and thus came at the
         'time of year when the opportunity cost of labor is at its
          highest. In Central Africa, it is not uncommon to find that
          maiz~ yields decline by up to 100 lbs/acre with each day'~
          delay in planting. To the extent, then, that time spent
          preparing another's land for planting results in a compara-
          bl~ delay in preparing _and planting one's own .land, the

          average loss in yield could be as great as 1,000 lbs/acre.·
          Losses of this .magnitude would certainly tend to. weaken the
          economic position of· those supplying labor, and the labor
          supplied would strengthen the position of those for whom
          the work was done. Thus there would appear to be_ a self-
          perpetuating element in this system of debt-bondage.

          147.       What is uncertain is the extent to which debt-
          bond~ge amounts to a "system" or how pervasive it is._·

          Extrapolating the results discussed above suggests that
          some seven'per cent of project growers receive "gift~" in
          return for which tbey are "obliged" to work for the "donor".
          This percentage was equivalent to some 3,750 farmers in_
          mid-:1973. If this extrapolation from a small s~mple is
          valid, does this seven per cent of farmer-s constitute the
          poorest stratum of Lilongwe rural society? If so, is this
          also the group which fails to receive visits from extension
          staff and which has not made use of LLDP-supplied credit?
          These_ are interesting questions, particularly in view of
          the Bank's increasing concern with income distribution, but
          it i~ beyond the bounds of the available data to seek
          further here for possible answers. This analysis does,
          however, indicate the problems which may exist and suggest
          directions for further research.

          148 ..    It was also postulated that gifts in kind on a
          large scale would result in a more equitable distribution
                          ... 74




of project benefits but would reduce marketed surplus. The
average "gift-wage" from the 1973 survey was 0.24 baskets of
unshelled maize per labor-day, or a total of 2.5 baskets per
person-working. The amount of maize disposed of in the form
of such gifts may be in the neighborhood of 482 tons, or
three per cent of total sales through the maize-shelling
prog~am in 1973.   Grourtdnrits are also g~ven as wage-gifts,.
with one basket of unshelled groundnuts being given for each
day's labor, though groundnuts are a less common form of gift
than maize. Some 525 bags of shelled-equivalent groundnuts
may have been disposed of in this manner in 1973. This.amount
is an insignificant proportion of the tota~ quantity. of
groundnut.s marketed in Lilongwe District in 1972.

149.      The 1971/72 LLDP survey reported the average qift
of maize as 1.67 bagst.Or 334 lbs. Using the figures reported
above·of 23 per cent of growers making gifts· of maize, some
1,960 tons of maize--four times the 1973 estimate--may have
been disposed ot as gifts in 1971/72. This level is equal
to approximat·ely 25 per cent of maize sales to ADMARC and the
LLDP shelling program in 1971/72; thus gifts of maize .do in
certain seasons at least have the potential to reduce sign~­
ficantly the marke~ed output of sUrplua production.



150.       It was hoped to be able to test also the important
hypothesis that incomes within the pr6ject area are positively
related to active participation in LLDP-sponsored programs,
but such testing proved in fact impossible to carry out. No
difficulty was encountered in identifying a useful and·
powerful definition of "active participation", for the annual
list's of farmers receiving LLDP credit provide samples of
participants who may be expected to benefit most in income
terms from involvement in project activities. The problem
was rather that no income data have been collected which can
be related to participation in the credit program. Inferences
about changes in income arising.from the use of credit could
                          - 75 -




possibly be drawn by making comparisons between crop yields
or credit and noncredit farmers; the value of such an approach
is diluted, however, because no data are available on tobacco
yields and tobacco cultivation is strongly associated with
cash income.   (See related discussion. in Sections II and V.)

                              CONCLUSIONS



         151.      The conclusions arising from this study are
         presented under two headings:   (1) empirical findings,
     . · particularly where these reveal hitherto unknown or unapprec-
         iated relation·ships among important project variables, and
         (2) conclusions regarding evaluation procedures and operations.
         A final subsection as.sesses the possible utility of follow-up
         studies based upon data collected for other, often completely
         different purposes.

       152 ..     Principal Empirical Findings--Not all the hypotheses
      relating to the project's credit program could be tested, in
      part because the necessary records had not been maintained.
      It was found, for example, that no record was kept of farmers
      who had applied for credit but who had been denied it. · This
        . .
         .          :

      gro..up would be well worth identifying.for a number of obvious
      reasons, one of which is that thos~ who are denied credit may
      be among the poorest of the poor. If this were the case,. it
      would be necessary to formulate an approach which could mean-
      ingfully ameliorate their position. The. analysis does suggest
      that some 17 per cent of project farmers are probably ineligible
      for credit on the grounds that they .crop insufficient land;
      this is a sizeable group to exclude from the projectis only
      program capable of dramatically affecting productivity and
      incomes.

       153.      Other findings relating to credit include the
       revelation that farmers taking groundnut credit packages have
                           - 77




holding~·signif~cantly smaller than the mean for the area.
These same farmers also have holdings with land-labor ratios
smaller than average. .The implications of these findings are
discussed in a later paragraph.

154·.        There is evidence that the very ra-pid expansion of
the. season.~tl credit program between 1970/71 and 1971/72
substantially curtailed the number of farmers receiving v:i,.sits
from extension staff and also reduced the average number of
visits made to farmers who were visited. The net result has
been to increase the concentration of exte~sion visits among
credit farmers, and this group can expect to receive 80-100_
per cent more visits than farmers.who do not have project
credit. It_ should be emphasized, however, that ·a very large
proportion of project farmers are visited by extension staff
at least once a year: In fact, the proportion of farmers not
visited within LLDP is similar to the proportion of farmers
outside the project who· a·re visited.

155.      Whether or not a farmer defaults on a loan. appears
to·be unrelated to the size of his holding but, once a farmer
has defaulted, then the proportion of the loan not repaid is
inversely related to farm size. That is, among all defaulting
farmers, those with smaller holdings pay back a· smaller
proportion of the amount due. The analysis also confirms that
the credit repayment rate is lower for farmers taking packages
containing groundnuts than for those taking other credit
packages. -The reason why the repayment rate is lower for
groundnuts is not clear, for no obvious relationships emerge
from the attempt to relate credit repayment to crop yields
and production. Intuitively it would be thought that yields
and production are significantly related to repayment of
credit, but the small samples available for credit farmers
make obtaining significant results difficult in several
different parts of the analysis.
                          -   78 -




156.       The analysis reveals a posi~ive respons~ in terms
of yield to the first few extension visits for both maize and
groundnu~s and for maize a generally positive response to any

number of visits. Beyond the first few visits made by
extension staff, there is no conclusive evidence of an increase
in groundnut yields; indeed, there is some indication of a
negative g~oundnut yield response to more than five extension
visits. This pattern is possibly not as illogical as it at
first glance appears. Extension staff tend to concentrate
their .visits on farmers who are growing improved varieties of
maize;.hybrid maize growers probably receive more visits than
any other group in the project area. If a· farmer who is
growing hybrid maiz·e also grows groundnuts, the groundnuts are
probably less important to him as a cash crop than they were
before h~ adopted hybrid maize •.. Thus he will tend to neglect .
the groundnuts somewhat and devote relatively more time and
attention to his maize crop. In addition~ most of .the extension
advice_rece;ved likely relates to the hybrid maize.

157.      Evidence is also.found which indicates that extension
staff concentrate a significantly greater proportion of their
ef~ort on the larger farms, though to an unknown degree this

observation corresponds with the fact that the smallest hold-
ings are ineligible for project credit. A somewhat _surprising
finding is that roughly one-fifth of all farmers using project
credit'are never visited by. an extension field worker.

158.      An  examination of some of the determinants of c~op
yields reveals that groundnut yields are significan~ly lower
on. the smaller holdings in the project area. The exp~anation
for· this phenomenon is thought to lie in the fact that the
smaller holdings are subject to a land constraint and carinot
therefore avoid replc3nting the same land to · groundnuts at.
fairly short intervals, or even in successive seasons. This
lack.of an adequate rotation, or rotation and fallow, results
in the build-up in the soil of a number of pests and diseases
which adversely affect groundnuts.
                               -   79 -
·-


     159..     There.is also evidence which suggests that the decline
     in mean groundnut yields in the project·area over the past
     several seasons may not be a decline in general·yields as
     previously.thought but rather the consequence of the develop-
     ment of a bimodal pattern in yields. Certainly many farmers
     continue to achieve· excellent yields on a par with the.best
     yield~ observed in the area eight or nine years ago._    But
     many other farmers manage to get only miserable yields if they
     get a yield at all; a disheartening aspect of the LLDP yield
     data on groundnuts is the frequency with which farmers abandon
     plots of groundnuts, earning no return for all the labor and
     seed invested. Overall some 22-23 per cent of groundn~t plots
     are complet.e ·failures,· while the comparable figure for maize
     is·only about four per cent.

     160.      Another interesting finding relating to yields is
     that, when either maize or groundnuts are planted in a plot
     which was under fallow the previoqs season, the yields will
..   be dismally low. The explanation for such low yields is thought
     to.lie in poor preparation of these fields for planting.
     Fallow land is more difficult to prepare for planting using
     hand tools than is land which has been under cropping the:
     previous season.   The result   is   that fields take longer to
     :till, so that crops are planted late, and often the fields
     are preP,ared badly so that they yield a luxuriant crop of
     :weeds but little else.

     161.    - Regarding cropping patterns and rotations, maize
     is found to yield significantly much more when it is planted
     on land which had been planted to tobacco the previous season.
     This pattern of response probably stems from the effects of
     residual fertilizer left in_the soil from the tobacco crop.
     The highest groundnut yields are obtained when this crop is
     plan~ed on land which has grown a maize crop in the previous

     season. Groundnuts also yield best either when grown in_pure
     stand or when grown interplanted with some crop other than
     ma~ze.  The yield results for maize are at least consistent

      very. high prices for nitrogenous ·fertilize.rs, a greater
      research effort might be directed toward establishing the
      agronomic advantages of intercropping, with reduced levels-
      of fertilizer application, versus the present recommended
      practice of planting maize in pure stands with fairly high
      levels of fertilizer use.

      162 •.       Incomes in the· LLDP area are found to be positively
        related to social status as measured on a scale which includes
        both-traditional and modern attributes of status. Further
        work could perhaps determine which set of attributes--tradi-
      . ticmal. qr modern--is the more strongly related to incomes.
        Somewhat surprising was the discovery that-migration to South
        Africa, Rhodesia or Zambia for wage employment is positively
        associated with agricultural incomes in the Lilongwe ~rea.
        Tpis finding tends to refute the argument sometimes put
        forward that it is only those with limited opportunities in
        agriculture who emigrate, however the causal link between.
        migr.ation and agricultural -incomes remains unclear. The link
        doe~ not appear to be the obvious one that migrants reinvest

        their repatriated earnings in agricultural enterprises, for
        most returning migrants spend their savings on a range·qf
        consumer durables and nondurables.

      163.        The phenomenon of gift-giving in the project area
      raises a nwnber of complex issues which are difficult to
      resolve, ··particularly since .there has never been a tho_rough
      anthropological study of the Chewa people. On the one hand,
      gift-giving·clearly serves as an income redistribution
      mechanism transferring cash from those relatively better off
      to those who are relatively worse off; how this mechanism is
      activated and .what demands may be made.on-both sides are .
      unknowns. On the other hand, gift-giving, particularly when
      the:~ gift is in the form of produce given to distressed families,

     appears in some cases to create a debt-bondage. In these

     instances the recipient is obliged to work on the donot.
     holding at a time when the opportUnity cost of the recipient's
     labor is greatest on his own.holding. It is easy to.see how
     a system like this could become self-perpetuating.

       l64.        The recipients of.gifts are part of Lilongwe•s·
       rural poor. To a very considerable extent the institution
       of gift-giving helps them over times of hardship~ but there
       are at least two kinds of costs attached to this assistan,ce.
       The first, as already suggested, is that the result is a
       cyqle beginning.with need and going through gift, debt repay-
       ment with labor, shortfall in own crop production, and ending
       up .again with need. LLDP's standardized approach to increasing
       incomes through productivity gains achieved with credit..:.
       supplied inputs does not seem to be affecting this group of
       poor; indeed, it cannot affect them if they crop only very
                                                                                . vr«'.J. ',.

       out of a low-income trap through the device· of a rural· public 1
       works program. The second kind of cost attached to the
       institution of gift-giving is that it can, in certain se~son~
       at least, reduce substanti~lly the marketed output of food
       crops from the project area. In certain circumstances., such
                                                       .                 .

       as·an adverse season, gift-giving may help to circumvent the
       need for famine relief or food charity programs; in more
       normal seasons, gift-giving where a labor. repayment· is· demanded
       may only ensure that those farmers near. the borderline of
     · sel.f-sufficd.ency do not rise above it.·

     165.      Evaluation Proce·dures and Data Requirements--
     Discussion iri this section centers on proposals for making
     project evaluation both more useful in terms of improving
     project management.and more meaningful in terms of permitting
     valid assessment's of project impact. Discussion and proposals
     are divided into two sections, one dealing with sampling and

         evaluation procedures •.

         166~       (1) Sampling and Data Collection. Where a project
         is to have its major. impact through changes in agricul t.ural
         productivity, there appears to be no alternative to sampling
         crop yields~ Analysis of the LLDP experience of having
         evaluation staff visually assess yields indicates that even
         well-trained staff.are incapable of providing acceptable·
         estimates of yields using this method. Having accepted the
         inevitability of yield sampling, the question then arises as
         to how this. samplil)g can. most usefully be done ..

          16 7 ·     At :LLDP, the annual yield surveys have been based
          on a new sample every.year and none of the farmers selected
          for .one season '.s sample is included in that for the following
          season. The· reasons for drawing· .a completely new. sample
          every year are not altogether clear; they may be based on.a.
          desire to minimize possible resentment on the part of farmers
          at being subjected to a battery of interviews year after year,
          and·theymay have their origins in the belief.that continuous
                      .          .

          use.of the same sample alters the sample to such an extent
         'that it is no longer representative of the population from.
          which it was drawn.·

          168.          This report recommends that a certain proportion
          of .the sample selected for yield studies be retained from one
          year to another. This part of the . sample would constitute
          in ef;ect a panel which would be resurveyed annually in-order
         :to be. able. to assess some of the dynamic elements of the
          project. With present sampling procedures, there is simply
          no way to relate what happens to. a farmer in one season with
          what 'happe~s in the next, though the two are obviously not.
          independent. It had been hoped, for example; to test the
          hypothesis that the receipt· of cre'dit by a farmer in one.
          sea13on ;f:.s unrelated to whether or not he had credit in the

           previous season, or to his · leve.l of performance in terms of
           yi~lds and. production the year before.    Because each season's
          'sample is independent of that of.the previous season, the
            testing could not be done. A time series of data on the same
            farmers would also permit one to begin to make inferences
            about rates of improvement in yields and changes in input use,
            etc.

           169.        The above recommendation, then, is leading toward
           a second, ·i.e. that a limited amount of farm management data
           be collected in the annual surveys. Farm management surveys
           are notoriously expensive in terms of manpower, funds and
           time,.and the results are often not available until long after
           the data were collected. tncluding in the annual yield
           surveys ~;i few simple but informative questions could yield
           useful results in a much shorter period of time. Evaluation
           staff might' consider recording, in addition to yields, the
           use o;f selected inputs, sources of seaso~al finance, farmers'
           opinions as to their major problems, etc. Changes in variables
           such as these could then be monitored for that part of the
           sample which ~s resurveyed every year,

           170.       The method of selecting samples for the annual
           sm:yeys appears to need reconsideration. The present method
           makes use of aerial photographs to identify villages from
           which the sample is randomly selected. The major criticism
           is.that while the population sample is random the sample of
           villages is.not, because the technique selects villages with
           a J;>robability proportional to the amount of land the village
           controls. Thus there is ~n inherent tendency to oversample
           certain types of viilages. The LLDP Evaluation unit     has.
           been aware of this problem for some time and is engaged in
           trYing to develop a more satisfactory approach.

           171.          A £urther recommendation is that part of the
           J;>rOJ;>Ortion o~ the sample which is to be replaced every year
           be drawn on a nonrandom basis·. The objective here is to

        sample' explicitly those farmers who are participating in
        project programs and who.~an therefore be expected'to benefit
       ·most. It is s~ggested,· for LLDP, that the most appropriate
        sampling.frame to use would be the annual lists of project
        farmers who receive seasonal credit. Actual selection of
        farmers could be random but the population, of course, . is
        deliberately selected. With the present sampling technique.,
        it· is difficult to make any sort:. of systematic evaluation of
        the effectiveness of the credit program because so many
        features of interest are underrepresented in the samples.

       a factor. Only continuously measured variables can be used
        in .analysis· in such a way as to 9enerate recommendations on
        changes.in practices, levels of application, etc . . By way of
       illustration, the analysis had hoped to make use of data on·
        fertilizer use to ascertain what· sorts of responses Lilongwe
        farmers were getting in comparison to those achieved on the·
        research station whi·ch serves .the area~ the data on quanti ties
        of.fertilizerused·are, however,· known. to be inaccur~te so
        that the analysis couid only make use of a dummy variable
        indicating whether or not fertilizer was used. As would be
        expected, the ·variable employed indicates a positive .and·
        powerful response to the use of fertilizer, ·but· it is incapable
       .of. revealing whethe.r farmers wer~ ·using too much.· fertilizer,
        too little, or the right amount. R9ughly comparal:)le.re~ul:ts
        are ·achieved with . variables ·defining weed infestations
                       '                                        ·····,
                                                                       and·
       ·attacks by pest~ and diseases .(see. the various regress~on
        results in the. Annex). Ideally,· one would ·also like to know·
        the precise date when a given plot.was planted sothat time
        of p~antirig could be systematically related to rainfall and
        possibly other climatic factors, but·this information cannot

be,: considered reliable when collected in e·x post surveys.

 17 3..     The second· recommendation specifically· relating·
 to-yield studies is that where evaluation staff find there
 has been a complete crop failure on a sample plpt, additional
 information should be collected. A plot·· where there has been
·a crop failure should be considered just as important asone
 where there is a standing crop, though for somewhat different
 reasons. · Evaluation staff should make some ·attempt to
 ascertain why the crop failed or why the farmer abandoned,
 the plot. Staff should also try to find outhow much the
 farmer was relying for subsistence or cash income on the crop.
 that failed and whether the farmer has experienced crop
 .failures on other plots .as well.

174.          An additional comment relating to yield studies is
in. 'the forin of a question: are the sample sizes employed for
yi~ld surveys, now ~nvolving more than 1,200 farmers annually,
really essential in order to obtain acceptable levels of
accuracy. It is known that the .LLDP yield data are highly
variable, so that fairly large samples are required to provide
a reasonably reliable estimate of mean yields_; nevertheless,
large-sample theory and common sense suggest that, unless
highly det~iled analysis is going to be done for small geog-
            .                                           .
raphical areas (.i.e . project units) , the sample sizes
currently used are larger than they have to be. Statistical
tests are available which can indicate how small a sample one
can get away with to obtain given levels of confidenc~ in the
results, and these could usefully be employed to ascertain
whether and to what extent sample sizes in the yield surveys_
canbe reduced. If some of this extremely time-consuming
type of sampling could be eliminated, then data. analysis
could perhaps be speeded up and other less-demanding,· ·ad hoc
types of surveys could be mounted.

175.      As a final remark under this subject, it was
noticed that LLD? evaluation staff allow interviews to become
.-------~--~----




                                   - 86 -




         social·occasions, with friends and neighbors--and possibly
         strangers--gathering around the farmer being interviewed and
         listening to all ·the questions and responses. There can be
         no objection to this at tim~~ and the atmosphere of a social.
         event may actually assist in removing any latent suspicions
         about the motives of evaluation staff. In certain cases,
         however,. such open interviewing is almost bound to distort ·
         the·answers received. Examples would include a whole range
         of questions relating to income, sales, capital, cattle,
         future intentions, etc. In cases where information is sought
         on matters which are not normally publicly discussed or
         wil~ingly revealed, it would be extremely valuable if some

         way could be foUnd of preserving the confidentiality o( the
         answers.

         176.       (2)  Data Processing and Evaluation Procedures·.
         An absolutely essential part of any evaluation effort is the
         documentation of work in progress. This means the·thorough
         recording 1 at every stage. of the process 1 of objectives 1 ·
         definitions, methodology, criteria, etc.--vl.rtually ·every
         aspect of the evaluation effort, from recognition of the need
         for a survey. to printing of the final report. There are .·
         principally two justifications for the recording of the
         minutia of evaluation work. The ftrst of these is to·ensure
         tha.t a particular piece of work 1 once begun I can continue
         regardless of changes in personnel or other mishaps which
         sometimes befall data collection and processing exercises.
         The other justification is to permit the secondary use of
         the data collected should further analysis be deemed
         desirable at any time after the original purposes of survey
         work have been served.  On   no account. should survey. and
         evaluation work be allowed to develop so that successful·
         completion of a given project is contingent upon the
         involvement of a particular individual. To a certain extent
         the evaluation effort at LLDP has been hampered by the
         failure to observe this precaution.
                            - 87 -




 177.       LLDP.suffered for some time from not having staff
in the Evaluation Unit with the relevant statistical training
for the work which was. being undertaken. This gap was filled,
 albeit not completely.satisfactorily, by consulting with
~taff of the National Statistical Office and personnel in.
 various ministries andin   the university~ Particularly weak
was the use of statistics in reporting the results of survey
work, and for a good· number of years the only statisti.c used
was the arithmetic mean. This selection was unfortunate
 because it t~nded to obscure the unreliability of the mean
 as a measure of many of the variables for which it was calcu-
 lated, e~g. crop yields, farm sizes, incomes, etc. Improve-
 ments have been made in this regard at LLDP, and it.is now
 common practice to indicate with one or more measures the
 inherent variability in the data employed. A useful amend.;...
 men~ would be to include with means, where relevant, the
          .    .

 confidence intervals for given levels of probability. There
 is still, moreover, a need to make far greater use of modal
 and median values for certa.tn categories. of variables where
 use of the mean conceals the nature of the distribution·.
 Modes and medians, however, are not always available options
 in canned computer programs( indeed, they were not available
 in the program used for analysis in the follow-up ·study.
 The ideal program for the analysis carried out would have ·
.been the Statistical Package for the.social Scienc~s (SPSS),
 an extremely useful and e;fficient set of techniques .for
 dealing with a wide range of data-handling problems.

178.       It would also be valuab,le if more results could be
accompanied :by graphical representation, such as scatter
dia,grams or bar charts,. d~pictinc;y expecially significant or
informative relationships.

179.       There appears to be a need as well for less simple
reporting of results and more rigorous testing of hypotheses
and· exploration of relationships. Much more use needs to be.
made of tests of signtficance,·both of a parametric and
                          - 88·-
                                                                ·I

                                                                 '




nonparamet.tic nature. It should.be stressed here that one
is not striving simply for more sophistication in the
evaluation effort but rather for more meaningful ~valuation.
The .common practice of reporting results·in the form of
complex crosstabulation. tables with no indication. as to
whether.the numerous relationships shown are significant or
not. is extremely confusing, and if these results are used
at all, they are q~ite likely to be misused.

180.        For most projects, if evaluation is to j~stify·
the very substantial investment of resources required to run
a gqod program, there should be a well-defined link between
evaluation output and management input. During the first
few years of.a project's life, there will be a need for· a
considerable amourit of positive analysis, particularly if
little.basic information was available before the project
was launched. As a project matures, however, a need is
likely. to devel()p for relatively· more analysis capable of
Yielding· n.ormati ve implications. To take an example from
this analysis, it was discovered that yields are very'low
when crops are planted in a field that had been allowed tq
lie·fallow the previous season. This finding contradicts
the experience in many other part's of· Africa, and signifi~
cant benefits could result from identifying the factors
which result in the low yields. Identification of the
f~ctors responsible would then permit management to design

an extension program aimed at correcting the situation.
Another example would be the· analysis of crop response· to
fertilizer in actual farming situations as contrasted w~.th
research conditions1 such analysis could be .used by rnanage-
ment.·to modi£¥ the blanket recommendations for levels of
fer1=-ilizer application often made by resea·rch stations •.

181.       As a general point, there seems to be a need to
include in evaluation work at LLDP more in the nature of
performance checks.on various project components. Why,
fo'r. example, do extension staff not visit one-fifth of
·.                                - 89 ...




     project farmers who have taken seasonal credit packages?
     To the extent that LLDP is regarded in the Bank as a proto-
     type for a certain approach to rural development, there should
     be rather more evaluation of the effectiveness of various
     project components.

     182.       Some of the recommendations made above will be
     fairly easy to implement, while others will be quite difficult.
     But one_ implication all share is that greater _rather than
     fewer resources need to be devoted to e.valuation if the
     necessary work is to be done and done in such a manner as to.
     be worthwhile.

     183.       ·Many aspects of evaluation are highly technical,
      and it is impossible to treat them in detail here. There
      remain also many open questions as to what are appropriate
      approaches to the on-going and ·ex po·st evaluation of rural
      development projects. Much experimentation needs to be done,
      for example, into the relative merits of alternative
      techniques. of surveying to acquire the different kinds of
      information required for various:evaluation purposes. Such
     experimentation could profitably focus as a starting point
     on such issues as costs, scale, accuracy and precision vs.
      speed, each of which might be expected to have a quite
      different importance from.one project·to another. This kind
      of experimentation, however, seems urilikely to take place in
      existing projects such as LLDP, where large investments have
      al:ready been made ;in designing systems and training staff.· to
      use them and where staff are alre_ady overburdened with the
     -existing evaluation load. It seems probable, therefore,
      that no experimentation .will take place and that there will
      be no consolidated effort to improve evaluation procedures
      and techniques unless external resources can be provided.

     184.      The· ut·i'li'ty of ·a· F'O'llow-up ·Study--How useful has
     it been to attempt to answer a wide range of questions on
     the basis of data collected often.for wholly different
                             - 90 _;




  purposes? What kinds of data would be needed to answer ·
  satisfactorily the questions posed? These questions and
' others which are at the core of the follow-up study are
  discussed below.

 185.      The essence.. of this type of evaluation effort is
 that one is examining a socioeconomic system that has bee~
 exposed to planned intervention in the form of a project,
 and one wants· to know (1) what has changed, (2) how much of
 a change there has. been and (3) why and how change has
 occurred. The particular thrust of this effort has been to
 determine to what extent the existing data are useful in
 assessing the impact in specific areas of the Lilongwe
 pr~gram, i.e. in providing useful additional· knowledge of
 the type specified in the three points above.

 186.      Broadly speaking, attention has been focused on
 finding out what has happened at Lilongwe; and why,_ insofar
 as the data available might be expected to provide some
 indications as to where and in what magnitudes change has
 taken place. Unfortunately the data do not encapsulate
 many of the changes that are known to have occurre·d, so that
 on~   can say very little in this respect • . Even less can; be
 said with regard to explanatory· factors, the "why" of ch_ange.,
 even where changes are reflected in the data.

 187.      LLDP was conceived with objectives which differ
 somewhat from those currently stressed in Bank thinking on
 rural development.    As a consequence, the evaluation effort
 has always concentrated the bulk of its effort on finding
 out what has happened to crop yields, particularly those of
      .                         .
 maize and groundriuts. What consensus emerges from the
 efforts made by the LLDP Evaluation_Unit and the other
 researchers who have examined the Lilongwe yield data? The·
 first point on which all agree is that crop yields aresubject
 to very considerable seasonal variations due to a whole range
 of factors, many of. whiqh are not subject to project influence.

                  Even allowing for these seasonal variations, there· seems to
                   be general agreement that groundnut yields experienced a
                 . declining trend for several years, ·though more recent indica-
                   tions are that this downward trend may have been reversed.
                   The reasons for this decline have yet to be convincingly
                   documented, and the explanations ventured include, with
                   varying emphasis, agronomic factors, such.as unfayourable
                   rainfall and pests and diseases, inadequate price incentives,
                   social factors such as groundnuts• being a woman's crop, and
                   the· relatively greater importance and attractiveness of maize.
                   This study adds to existing knowledge about what has happened
                   to groundnuts.by showing that the drop in yields has not been
                   general_but rather that the most adverse effects have been
                  experienced by a distinct, identifiable group of farmers.
                  Additional information has also been forthcoming regarding
                   cropping practices which appear to have·importanteffects on
                   grqundnut yields~

                 18.8.        Somewhat more controversial is the matter of maize
                  yields. In this case, there appears to be no discernable
                  trend in average yields, though this point is not universally
                  accepted and is open to varying interpretation where it is
                  acknowledged. Perhaps the st.rongest point of agreement here
                  is .that the technology and extension package appears to be
                  the. right one for the area and the cropping system; every.
 I      .         study of LLDP concurs that the improved seed-fertilizer
                  package. together with the practices promoted by extension staff'
                  can and have ·raised maize productivity dramatically where

                  they have. been used. The studies seem to agree also that the
 I
 I
 '                biggest proplem is maintaining a satisfactory rate of expan-
                  sion in the use of improved inputs. Virtually every document
                  rel~ting to developments at LLDP cites the need to review

                  pricing policy for the project's principal crops.     (Price
                 ..policy has been outside the scope of this report but it sho~ld
                  be stated, even if only parenthetically, that there is full
                  agreement on the necessity to maintain a notional parity
                  between crop prices and production costs and world market
·.                               - 92 -




     prices~.) This need has become all the more urgent because
     of sharp increases in the costs of seed and fertilizer .

     .189.       The principal source of disagreement is the question
      of what has happened to maize yields as a result of the
      project. It is known that many farmers have been able to ·
      increase their yields to very high levels, but the problem-.
      atical point is what has happened to overall yields in the
      areas developed by the project. The problem appears to stem
      first from the various methodologies-used to assess average
      yields and second from the interpretations given to the
      various sets of results. As yet, no two assessmen~of yield
      levels·appear to have employed consistently the same approach
      throughout..· Several fundamental points should be borne·in
      mind in any re-examination of the LLDP yield data. First,
      the Lilongwe Plain is far from being homogeneous, either in
      terms of soils, rainfall, population density, crop producti-
      vity or a number of other features: thus the project can };)e
      expected to have a relatively greater or lesser impact in
      different areas.

     190~        ·second, the project has expanded annually by some
     20-100,000 acres and has taken in·each year areas of often
      widely different productive potential. For the first few
     'years, this expansion appears to have been into areas of
      relatively high potential; currently, expansion seems to be
      into areas of relatively lower potential. The consequence
      of this pattern of development is that
       '                                 .
                                              comparisons across
                                                   '        . .
                                                             '


      time between _crop yields in "developed" and. "undeveloped"
      areas are invalid if they also attempt to attribute any
      observed difference in yields to. the project • s impact •.

     191.       Third, there have been several changes in bounda- ·
     ries and composition of some of the higher-numbered
     evaluation areas used by LLDP staff as the basic land unit·
     for yield· assessment work. As a result, yields cannot be
     compared across seasons for all evaluation areas with the
                          - 93 -




same number; what is required is f~rst to disaggregate part
of the data by project units and then to recombine them into
new conglomerates which are·fully comparable with those for
other seasons.

192.      Fourth, and related to the point above, what is
required for a valid assessment of the project's yield impact
is physically comparabie areas for which good baseline data
exist prior, to inclusion in the project and for which data
are available for a series of seasons after inclusion.
Since representative and reliable baseline data do not exist
for the earliest evaluation areas taken into the project, it
will be some time yet before this condition can be fulfilled.

193.       Finally, there are obstacles to obtaining fully
indicative results even from the above approach. The
"undeveloped" areas outside the project do not exist in a
static and pristine state. Among the least mentioned benefits
of the project are two types of spread effects. The first
of these is generated by what might be called a combination
of extension and demonstration effects around the periphery
of the developed area. LLDP extension staff not infrequently
visit areas outside the project boundaries and give advice
to farmers in these areas. There is, moreover, a constant
to-and-fro stream of farmers visiting within the project who
take home with them new knowledge based on what they have
seen and heard. The second type of effect stems from the
fact that the Regional Agricultural Office has extension
staff worki~g in these undeveloped areas, though at a staffing
intensity lower than that within LLDP. The regional staff
liaise prote~sionally and socially with LLDP staff and many
of the former acquire new knowledge, an increased interest
in farming communities and a_greater sense of pride in their
work from these interchanges. All of these factors impinge
so a.s to be9in increasing yields before the project takes
over a, new area.

194~         . This study has·not attempted a full reassessment
  of actual yield levels in relation to the targets spelled out.
  in ·prbject appraisal reports. Data were available from ~nly
.three seasons, which differed markedly in natural conditions,
·SO it was planned originally to concentrate on identifying

  factors whichappear to have an important influence on crop
  yields rather than devoting additional effort where so much
  work has already been done. It is felt, however, that an
  appropriate time to attempt an in-depth reassessment will be
. when yield data are available covering the full period 1969/
  70 through 1974/75~ examination of these data should permit
  a fairly .gooci evaluation of yields during the years covered
  by ·the. first two project phases. ·

195.       The approach taken has yielded·useful results in
                                      '             .

te:rms of technical factors influencing.yields, with. the
principal factor identified being crop variety. In the LLDP
area, crop variety--particularly maize--is a reasonably good
proxy for the use of fertilizer, so for most purposes the
one factor can be said to encompass the other. Some attention
was also given to the use of sulphur on groundriuts, but the
data available come from the early stages of the sulphur
promotion campaign and include only small samples of users.
Further useful work could be done on sulphur using .the data
frqm seasons subsequent to 1971/72.

196.       The influence of natural factors was also examined,

most important of these factors--rainfall. These .disappointing
results are .attributed to the fact that recorded rainfall data
are little if at all related to the amount of rain which falls
on·plots where yields are sampled. A complete lack of specific

             and·amount of fertilizer used, been quantified or quantified
             more. accurately. For example, LLDP' s former eval~ation
             offlcer.advised against attempting to use the data indicating
             amoWlt of fertilizer used because these were known to be
             extremely unreliable •

           . 198.      A thoroughly comprehensive study of yields at LLDP
            should attempt to take account of a range of economic
            variables which were outside the terms of reference· of this
            study. Certain socioeconomic variables, such as farm size
            and labor force, were considered but other important
            variables, particularly crop·prices and input costs,·were
            not. Such a compFehensive study would be beyond the capacity
            ofthe LLDP Evaluation Unit with present maripower.and
            financial constraint~.

            199.       In summary, then, the. sections of this study
            relating to yields differ from previous work in concentrating
            on why particular yields are what they are rather than on
           ·defining precisely what average level of yields has been
            attained. · The i;ormer should be of more immediate value in
            terms of project management no matter what conclusions are
            ultimately reached regarding the latter. More useful work
            could also be done on the "why" of yields if the recommenda-
            tions made in the earlier part of this section are adopted.
            rn· its original conception, crop yields are the essence of
            success or failure at LLDP, yet the data available for

               ;fundamental problem, however, is that much useful data.
               relating to aspects of the credit program never gets rec;:orded
               in project records (e.g~ who applies for credit). The major
            · difficulty in this part of the study arose because the
              ·samples were so. small that, though the expected relationships
              oft:en . emerged from the analysis, the results not infr'equently
               fai.led to reach acceptable levels of significance. In large
              measure, the small sample sizes are a consequence of (1) the·
               sea:;:;ons

               and. another of which they give to evaluation staff. In many
               instances it simply proved impossible to determine that t'wo
               or more names belonged to the same person. The suggestion
               al~eady made of using project credit lists to construct a

               sampling ;frame would largely overcome problems of this type.
               JU1 .alte;rnative possibility would be to issue all project

       201.       .While the Evaiuation Unit carried out a broadly
       socioeconomic survey early in the life of the project, LLDP
       has never hadthe benefit of a competent sociological or
       an.thropological study. The need for such a study assumes
       considerable. importance because so much basic in·forrnation on
       the Chewa, the·principal .ethnic group_in this part of Malawi,
       does not exist~ A number of well.,..qualified researchers have

       there must be concern that lack of the latter type of know-
     ledge can 'lead to serious misinterpretation, to-underemphasis

      the Bank's.change of emphasis and for the·purpose of
      ide.ntifying creditworthy farmers. To the extent that there
     wa~ any bias, it was in favor of. selecting a relati~ely
      higher income group in the belief that its members would be ·
      more likely to repay a loan. The data were nevertheless
      useful as a first approximation in permiting an examination
      of ~ range of factor' associ•ted with both agricultural and
      nonagricultural incomes. The·original analysis done at LLDP
•. ·had not stressed incomes nor had it sought to examine the
      correspondence between income from different sources and
     other. factors. A second al)alysis was therefore able to
   . ext·ract meaningful relationships from the .data which had .
    .·simply not been of high priority in the original analysis.

  203.        Perhaps the most important outcome of re-examining
  the income'data is that we are able to begin to identify the
  rur.al poor in the Lilongwe area and to learn some of th~ir
· cha.racteristics. The greatest deficiency ·in this part of·
  the· analysis is not the unsuitability of the data but rather
  the.· fact that the data are so old. The survey work was done

           205.          In conclusion, the follow-up study could have ,had .
           . Potentially greater utility and have been completed much
             sooner had certain organizational problems been anticipated
'!
             and avoided. As these problems have·implications for other
           ·similar studies, it is. worthw.hile indicating their nature •.
             The initial problem was that the time required to complete
             data. editing and analysis was severely underestimated. In
             large measure, this was because the team responsible for the
             anCJ.lysis had not also been. involved in .the collection of the .
             data and consequently had to devote much time to basic
             familiarization work. Additionally, the data were. in much
           .Poorer condition.than expected, so that more editing and
             checking of validity had to be done than was expected. The
                     .                                                 .

             ti:me. taken in this basic groundwork then meant that .discon-
             tinuities inevitably resulted in phasing the work of the
              "                                                        ·.
             st.aff involved with the. analysis, a problem which had b_een
             paralleled in earlier experience at LLDP. Finally, the
             testing of the original set of hypotheses generated new ·
             hypotheses, only a few of which could be explored iri_depth.
             because of the time c::onstraint.

            206.      The experience acqui~ed in carrying out this study
           suggests some guidelines for.similar efforts in the future.
           First,· it appears ·to be absolutely essential to have some
           participation on the part of the staff who were concerned
           with the original design and execution of the survey work
           and who have some experience with analyzing the data •.
           Secondly, in general no large~scale 'analysis of. data such
           as that reported here should be initiated unless it is'
           possible to ensure (1) that facilities for analysis, whether
           computers or otherwise, are adequate and (2) that there

     ~i~l be no ~erious discontinuities in the p~rsonnel invdlved
     :with the .study. These guidelines are equally as applicable
       to relatively smet.ll-scale primary sttidies carried :out in .·
       projects ·or. reseet.rch units as to larger secondary studies
       performed at the·Bank or in other centralized facilities.
       There is a very powerful learning· curve asso.ciated with a
       $t.udy such. as this one; delays--whether avoidable or not, ·
       inadequate pr~cessing facilities or access to facilities,and
       changes in Staff involved with the study weaken the learning
     .·curve and .dilute the value of. the final product. · It is
     . suggested,. therefore; that the best appr.oach to .a large-:-scale . ·
       study is to assemble a team or task force which is to have

                 Summarized briefly, the implications of these
    correlation coefficients are as follows:         For both seasons,
    the relationship between late planting of maize and plant
    population was negative and. equal.        For groundnuts, late
    planting was negatively associated with plant population in
    1970/71 but positively associated in 1971/72.         The association
    between time of planting and plant population is stronger for
    groundnuts than for maize.         There is a positive association
    between late planting of maize and the use of fertilizer,
    though the degree of association is weaker in 1971/72 than
    in   1970/71~
