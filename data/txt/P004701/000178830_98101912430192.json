secondary\n            education by creating 12 centralized workshop complexes to\n            provide practical instruction to students from nearby\n            academic secondary schools and by providing 42 community\n            (lower) secondary schools in disadvantaged rural areas with\n            practical facilities; (b) to equalize the quality of school\n            education and expand the coverage of out-of school education\n            through educational radio by strengthening the Center for\n            Educational Technology and by establishing a national radio\n            network with eleven transmitter stations to be used for\n            educational broadcasting; and (c) to improve government\n            management and planning by creating one center each for\n            in-service training of civil service officers and for\n            educational administrators and by implementing a\n            comprehensive program of school location planning."}, "docdt":
