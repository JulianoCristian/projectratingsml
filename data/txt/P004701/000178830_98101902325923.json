workshop complexes to\n            provide practical instruction to students from nearby\n            academic secondary schools and by providing 42 community\n            (lower) secondary schools in disadvantaged rural areas with\n            practical facilities; (b) to equalize the quality of school\n            education and expand the coverage of out-of school education\n            through educational radio by strengthening the Center for\n            Educational Technology and by establishing a national radio\n            network with eleven transmitter stations to be used for\n            educational broadcasting; and (c) to improve government\n            management and planning by creating one center each for\n            in-service training of civil service officers and for\n            educational administrators and by implementing a\n            comprehensive program of school location planning."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
