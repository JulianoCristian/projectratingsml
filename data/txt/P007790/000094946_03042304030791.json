"The assessment of outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, and the institutional\n            development impact is substantial, with both performances by\n            the Bank, and Borrower, rated satisfactory. Among the\n            lessons learned, an interesting point is raised: the gradual\n            - though dramatic - changes the development agenda continues\n            to experience, conduces also to changes in the composition\n            of the Bank's preparation team, or others, not\n            necessarily being documented, nor sufficiently explicit so\n            as to allow a broader debate on other support options. This\n            situation is reflected in this operation's disconnect\n            between expectations and accountabilities actually\n            negotiated, with those that appeared in the credit\n            agreement. Currently, the use of the Logframe format as a\n            tool for project summary to assure consistency, would have\n            improved the project's rationale, regrettably not in\n            existence at the time of project inception. The\n            implementation readiness adopted by the project (even in\n            light of risks associated with new institutional\n            arrangements) - experienced through a phased approach in\n            resources utilization, followed by a staged increase in\n            municipal management and subproject investments - fostered\n            ownership by municipalities, focused on reform, though, the\n            subsequent adoption by the Bank of the adaptable lending\n            instruments, proved less subject to classical preparation\n            prior to implementation as a means of managing risks, than\n            traditionally. Consequently, the adoption of the pilot\n            project approach (requiring preparation on project criteria)\n            could have explicitly planned the necessary benchmarks ex\n            ante. This said, the Midterm Review conducted an ex-post\n            review, from which lessons were incorporated in a follow-up operation."}, "docdt": "2002-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
