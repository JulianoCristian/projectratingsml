Excellency:
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Rural Municipalities Project) 
dated October 1, 1996 between the Republic of Nicaragua (the Borrower) and the 
International Development Association (the Association).  We are pleased to inform you 
that, pursuant to your request and our recent discussions on the subject, the 
Association agrees to amend the Development Credit Agreement as follows:
1.
Schedule 1:
The table in paragraph 1 is deleted and replaced by the one in the Attachment to 
this Amendment Letter.
3.
Schedule 4:
Paragraph 1 (d) is amended to read as follows in its entirety:  “the term 
“Authorized Allocation” means, in respect of the INIFOM Special Account, an amount 
equivalent to $2,700,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited in the 
INIFOM Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, 
however, that unless the Association shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation 
shall be limited to an amount equivalent to $1,000,000 until the aggregate amount of 
withdrawals from the Credit Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of SDR 2,776,000.”
Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing this 
letter in the space provided and returning it to us.  This amendment shall be executed 
in two counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original.  The amendment shall
