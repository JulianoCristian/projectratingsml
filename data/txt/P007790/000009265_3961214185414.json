Municipalities Project are to reduce rural poverty and to\n            improve natural resources management. These objectives can\n            be narrowed down more specifically to the following: 1) to\n            establish a mechanism based on municipal governments and\n            community organizations for reducing rural poverty through\n            rural investment in economic infrastructure, improved\n            natural resource management and small-scale communal\n            productive activities; 2) to ensure that central government\n            institutions acquire the capacity to provide a coherent\n            overall framework for natural resource policy making and\n            enforcement, accounting for global, national and regional\n            environmental priorities; and 3) to promote the long-term\n            integrity of a biological corridor along the Atlantic slope\n            of Nicaragua, conserving key global biodiversity values. To\n            meet these objectives, the project will have the following\n            three components: 1) rural municipalities development,\n            including institutional development, information,\n            participation, training and grants; 2) natural resources\n            policies and institutions involving institutional\n            development and an inter-institutional technical assistance\n            program; and 3) Atlantic biodiversity corridor (GEF), which\n            will include land use and biodiversity planning, monitoring\n            and evaluation and a financial mechanism to promote the\n            sustainability of the corridor."}, "docdt": "1996-08-14T00:00:00Z"}
