The\n            main lessons learned from this project include: 1) Better\n            coordination is needed among and within Government agencies.\n            2) Volunteers played a key role in mobilizing efforts to\n            process applications for the various allowances. 3) The cash\n            allowances were viewed as an important step in helping\n            people cope with the effects of the earthquake, and to\n            overcome the trauma and to reintegrate into normal life. 4)\n            The management information system in the Social Solidarity\n            Fund should be strengthened, so that it would be easier to\n            check centrally against duplicate applications and other\n            errors. 5) The amount of the World Bank EERL was not\n            sufficient to cover all the payments made, and the SSF had\n            to use its own resources to cover the cost of the rental and\n            repair allowances. 6) Teamwork among the SSF staff, the\n            volunteers, other Government agencies, and in some areas,\n            non-governmental organizations was critical to successfully\n            set up and implement the payment of the allowances. 7)\n            One-stop shop was an especially effective way of processing\n            the benefits. 8) On the Bank side, the fast disbursing\n            nature of the loan was helpful in facilitating the timely\n            delivery of allowances to earthquake victims."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
