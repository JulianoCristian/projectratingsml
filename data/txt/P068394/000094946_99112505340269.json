           Turkey to respond quickly and effectively to the impact of\n            the devastating earthquake which hit the Marmara region on\n            August 17, 1999. The benefits will be to provide financing\n            for incremental private sector import needs resulting from\n            the earthquake and for budgetary expenditures related to the\n            recovery effort including social protection priorities. A\n            key objective is to ensure that displaced persons and other\n            groups made vulnerable by the earthquake receive adequate\n            assistance particularly during the upcoming winter months,\n            while longer-term reconstruction efforts get underway. The\n            quick disbursing loan will provide: a) financing for a broad\n            range of specified imports; b) financing of priority\n            components for the earthquake recovery program (by the\n            Government's use of the Lira counterpart of the foreign\n            exchange proceeds); and c) limited funding for technical\n            assistance. The loan is part of a larger assistance package\n            from the Bank designed to complement project financing for\n            reconstruction and disaster mitigation from the\n            restructuring of existing projects and preparation of the\n            Marmara Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction Project."}, "docdt": "1999-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
