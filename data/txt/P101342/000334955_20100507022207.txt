I   IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.                     1
    About this Report
           The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
    first, to ensure the integrity of the Banks selfevaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
    expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
    dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
    the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
    that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
    which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
    important lessons.
           To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
    documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
    and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
    in local offices as appropriate.
            Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
    internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
    relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
    the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
    the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

    About the IEGWB Rating System
         IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
    lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
    arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
    (additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank,org/ieg).
         Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
    be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
    relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
    objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
    sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
    Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
    the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
    were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
    extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
    and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
    operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
         Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
    expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
    Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
         Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
    operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
    transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loadcredit closing, toward the
    achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
    Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
         Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
    agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
    agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
    performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
    Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
    Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for four operations in Mexico. They
included: (i) the Fund for Housing Operation and Finance (FOVI) Restructuring Project
(Ln4443), for which the World Bank approved a Loan of US$500.0 million on March 4, 1999-
the Loan was closed on June 30,2005, two years later than planned, when it was fully disbursed;
(ii) the Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln7229), for which the
World Bank approved a Loan of US$lOO million on June 8,2004-the Loan was closed on
December 3 1,2004, as planned, when US$O.5 million was cancelled; (iii) the Second Affordable
Housing and Urban Poverty Reduction Development Policy Loan (Ln7340), for which the World
Bank approved a Loan of US$200.5 million on November 29,2005-the Loan was closed on
December 2 1, 2005, as planned, when it was fully disbursed; and (iv) the Third Affordable
Housing and Urban Poverty Reduction Development Policy Loan (Ln7491), for which the World
Bank approved a Loan of US$200.5 million on November 27,2007-the Loan was closed on
June 30,2008, as planned, when it was fully disbursed.

The report is based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation Completion
Reports, Appraisal Reports, Program Documents, legal documents and project files, and on
discussions held with Bank staff involved in the project. An IEG mission visited Mexico in
February 2009 to review project results and met with nearly 50 interlocutors including officials of
housing and urban development agencies at the federal, state and municipal levels. The IEG
mission also traveled to Guanajuato State to visit local housing sites and property registry
projects. IEG gratefully acknowledges the courtesies and attention given by all these
interlocutors, as well as mission planning and logistical support provided by the Federal
Mortgage Corporation (Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal, SHF) and the World Bank office in
Mexico City.

IEG selected these operations for PPAR field assessments, as recommended following its review
of their Implementation Completion Reports, to verify the performance of this important series of
housing and urban development projects and to provide an input into a future IEG special study
of housing.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to government officials
and agencies for their review and comments. IEG received one communication (from the
National Housing Commission (Comisih Nacional de Vivienda, CONAVI), which is attached as
Annex C.

Summary
BACKGROUND
This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the performance of four completed
housing and urban development operations in Mexico, together involving US$l .O billion
in Bank lending over the 1999-2008 period. The first operation reviewed, the FOVI
(Fund for Housing Operation and Finance) Restructuring Project (Ln4443), used US$500
million in investment lending to develop Mexico's social-interest housing that provided
housing units for moderate income households from 1999 to 2005. The other three
operations comprised adjustment and policy loans totaling US$500 million also. The
Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector Adjustment Loan (HUSAL-I, Ln7229),
approved in 2004, aimed to help low and moderate income households improve their
living conditions. The Second and Third Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty
Reduction Development Policy Loans (HUDPL-I1 and 111, approved in 2005 and 2007,
respectively) both sought to improve national policies and institutions for housing and
urban development. One billion US dollars was a large amount by the standards of Bank
lending, but perhaps not when measured against the scale of Mexico's housing sector. It
amounted to just two weeks' revenues of the country's largest housing sector player,
INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for Private Sector Workers), for instance. In other
respects, too, Mexico is a big country. In its two million square kilometer territory live
105 million people, 77 percent in urban areas. With a GDP of US$878 billion, upper
middle income Mexico has the 14`hlargest economy in the world.
The country's stock of 24.7 million occupied units, one of the world's largest, is close to
the 24.8 million households in the population, but 4.6 million of these dwellings (18.6
percent of the total) are substandard or overcrowded. In Mexico 17.6 percent of the total
population lives in poverty and cannot afford formal housing solutions like those offered
by the operations reviewed here. The government relies on other programs to help the
poor, such as the Hdbitat program that the three development policy loans (DPLs) aimed
to support for upgrading low income areas and the Oportunidades conditional cash
transfers program.
Mexico's principal housing policy aim today is to produce one million housing
solutions-ranging from the provision of new dwellings to minor improvements to
existing ones-a year to meet growing demand and tackle some of the deficit. Moderate
and higher income households at or above the 40' percentile of the income distribution
can afford the formal housing solutions currently on offer in Mexico. Key constraints
challenge housing reform. One is the large and complex institutional framework for
housing and urban development, involving at least ten agencies with sometimes
overlapping and conflicting agendas, with the direct involvement of the Congress and the
Presidency. Another is the financial shallowness of the Mexican economy itself, where
the share of people having access to financial services is only half that of Chile or Brazil,
for example. Financial markets in Mexico have expanded and handle sophisticated
lending products, but housing finance has yet to reach more low-income households.
Today, it is better understood for Mexico and other emerging economies that households
below the 40* percentile (who include the poor) may not be able afford to buy formal
housing through mortgage loans without subsidies. Below this level, other sector
                                           xii

programs, such as rental housing and slum upgrading, could help lower-income and
poorer households who could have benefited a lot more from the operations under review
here. But the three DPLs did not succeed in stimulating such programs. IEG found little
evidence that assistance for the urban poor increased as a result of these operations.

OPERATION DESIGNS RELEVANCE
                AND
Although the lending instruments they used-a specific investment loan, a sector
adjustment loan, and two development policy loans-differed, all four operations
appropriately took aim at fundamental reforms of the sector. The objectives of the FOVI
Project were modestly relevant to government and Bank priorities for the sector-
especially while still focused upon social-interest housing. HUSAL-I had eight
objectives covering many different areas of housing and urban development, setting out
an ambitious scope for a 4-5 year program. These objectives were modestly relevant to
government and Bank priorities for the sector, especially poverty targeting. HUDPL-I1
and I11 had excessive scope and similar objectives that remained modestly relevant,
despite a continued lack of realism and a shift away from priority targeting of poorer
beneficiaries.
The FOVI Project dealt with housing finance only. Its design was substantially relevant
for including the necessary components, particularly institution building and funding for
mortgages, to achieve the objectives. The three DPLs covered both housing and urban
development. Their designs were pragmatic but did not provide the instruments needed to
achieve the ambitious outcomes intended. For instance, they were pragmatic in leaving
out INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for Private Sector Workers), Mexico's most
powerful and wealthy housing finance agency, over which the operations could be
expected to exert little leverage. But ambitious and needed housing reforms, such as
unifying housing subsidies through targeted up-front payments, are likely to be fiustrated
without the full engagement of this main sector player in charge of much larger interest
subsidies.
Affordable housing and urban poverty reduction were rightly at the heart of these
operations and figured in their titles. But the three DPLs were not explicit about the
income levels of their target beneficiaries. For that reason, IEG examined who could
afford the cheapest formal housing produced in Mexico's housing market, namely
dwellings in the Mxp200,000-Mxp300,000 price range (US$14.300-US$2 1,400), and
also who made up the urban poverty target roup. At these prices and with market-based
loans, IEG found that households in the 40tB 70' percentile of Mexico's income

distribution could afford the cheapest units on offer. Up-front lump-sum housing
subsidies-of up to Mxp 55,000 (US$3,900)--of the type encouraged by the three
DPLs-make housing more affordable one decile lower in the income distribution.
INFONAVIT's (National Housing Fund for Private Sector Workers') below-market
interest rates, a subsidy rightly questioned by the three DPLs, nevertheless moves
housing affordability three deciles further down the income distribution. These interest-
rate subsidies remain, by far, the most widely used in Mexico.
The political economy of their reform in a sophisticated middle income country such as
Mexico poses major challenges not directly addressed by the three DPLs. IEG therefore
assessed the affordability of the housing they supported across Mexico's household
                                           xiii

income distribution. It also looked more closely at the 17.6 percent of all Mexicans-
urban and rural-who live below the poverty line, who cannot afford formal housing
solutions, and could benefit from upgrading programs, for instance. Found within the 0-
20thpercentile range of the income distribution, these poor beneficiaries were to benefit
from DPL support to SEDESOL's (Ministry of Social Development's) Hdbitat program
of upgrading and community development in low-income urban areas. The earlier FOVI
Project did not explicitly target these poor households.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was weak under all four operations. The FOVI Project
M&E had indicators identified for the baseline and target endlines but the data were not
collected. The three DPLs lacked baseline data, program targets, and related performance
indicators, particularly indicators that could track changes in affordable housing supply
and demand, access by the poor to urban land, and the impact of the prior actions
identified on physical and social investments in poor neighborhoods.

IMPLEMENTATION
The FOVI Project, which became effective in early 2000, was not implemented as
planned. The incoming Fox administration decided to abolish FOVI itself in 2002,
replacing it with a new development bank, SHF (Federal Mortgage Corporation), that
later became the main implementing agency of the three subsequent DPLs. The
government evidently concluded that restructuring FOVI by itself, while important, was
not enough. Thirty-eight percent of the FOVI project loan had been disbursed before
FOVI was abolished. The three follow-on DPLs went ahead much as planned, although
the loan amounts for HUDPL-I1 and I11 were doubled during preparation, and HUDPL-
111's start-up was delayed one year until late 2007 to give the new Calder6n
administration time to take full charge of sector operations.
The restructured FOVI Project replaced the initial project focus on social interest housing
with broader attention to housing provision in general. Attention to low-income
beneficiaries also lessened when HUDPL-I1 succeeded HUSAL-I-the latter an operation
with a more explicit poverty focus. There were understandable reasons for these shifts.
SHF (Federal Mortgage Corporation) was a new agency and it needed to establish its
financial market credentials, something that it could not reasonably do by focusing on
lower income clients only.
On the housing policy and institutional fronts, CONAVI (National Housing Commission)
became an inter-ministerial coordinator for housing directly answerable to the
Presidency. Prior to June 2006, it had been under SEDESOL (Ministry of Social
Development). Transforming (National Housing Commission) from subordinate into
master led to overlapping and conflicting government responsibilities for the sector.
Creating a unified housing subsidy system at the federal level to be built around
transparent lump-sum grants to targeted lower income beneficiaries was a top aim of the
three DPLs, but the related prior actions, such as setting up a CONAVI (National
Housing Commission) working group to look at this, were only small steps in the
direction of subsidy reform. However, the DPLs did lay out clearly the high costs of the
continuing interest rate subsidies, still the main instrument in Mexico's housing sector
practiced by INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for Private Sector Workers) and also
on a smaller scale by a similar fund for public sector workers.
                                            xiv

The DPLs helped encourage housing credit through SHF (Federal Mortgage Corporation)
as a second-tier bank that refinanced mortgage lending by non-bank financial
intermediaries called Sofoles in Mexico. Sofoles also packaged loans into mortgage-
backed securities sold on local financial markets, where private pension funds were the
main buyers. Mortgage refinancing and securitization had begun in Mexico under the
FOVI Project and expanded under the three DPLs. Well structured packages were
launched, and securitization mobilized US$4.3 billion in financing from 2004 to 2008,
equivalent to nearly all of SHF/Sofoles mortgage funding over that period. Since the
2008-2009 global financial crisis, demand through these instruments in Mexico has
declined as has private penetration of the country's housing finance market.
The design of the three DPLs focused more on the housing side, giving less attention to
Mexico's urban development policy, despite their aim to strengthen this policy. However,
each successive DPL modernized and extended the reach of property registries to more
municipalities - an action aimed more at urban development than housing. SEDESOL's
(Ministry of Social Development's) dialogue with the Bank over other actions, namely
increasing urban land supply and improving living conditions through the Hhbitut
upgrading program, made little headway.

OUTCOMES
The FOVI Project succeeded in the institutional strengthening of the FOVI replacement,
SHF (Federal Mortgage Corporation), and also mobilized funding for housing in general.
This post-restructuring achievement became less relevant for the Bank, however, with the
loss of the lower-income household targeting.
Preparing and implementing Mexico's 2007-20 12 National Housing Program was an
important process for updating policy that the three DPLs stimulated. But the complex
institutional framework for housing in Mexico, which they had hoped to improve,
remains in place. The creation of CONAVI (National Housing Commission) has not
eased that complexity. The DPLs appropriately aimed to design and implement a unified
federal subsidy system for Mexico, but they did not identify appropriate prior actions or
recognize political economy constraints to achieving it. Mexico's major housing
subsidies, mainly through INFONAVIT's (National Housing Fund for Private Sector
Workers') below-market interest rates, remain in place and are used on an even larger
scale than before. Support for up-front lump-sum subsidies, was not initiated by the three
DPLs themselves. Such subsidies have existed in Mexico on a large scale at least since
2000, and currently account for 18 percent of all housing subsidies. Evidence that they
target lower-income families efficiently is thin, with less than adequate reporting on them
by CONAVI (National Housing Commission).
Strengthening the instruments of housing credit, especially through mortgage loan
origination and underwriting, and bundling the loans into securities, proceeded well
under the DPLs, but SHF/Sofoles primary mortgage lending did not grow over the 2004-
2008 period. Measured either by the number of loans or by their volume, the shares of all
lending going to affordable SHF (Federal Mortgage Corporation) mortgage lending
shrank during this time. This meant that mortgage lending did not go down-market during
2005-2008 as the DPLs intended. A recent Bank publication on housing reports that
Sofoles' mortgage lending has moved up-market along with their issuing mortgage-
                                           xv

backed securities. This trend is demonstrated by SHF's (Federal Mortgage Corporation's)
own data (provided to IEG).
The achievements of the three DPLs with respect to urban development were few. The
most important was modernizing and standardizing property registries in half the states of
Mexico. The preparation and approval of Mexico's Urban Development Sectoral
Program to accompany the 2007-20 12 National Development Plan were late. IEG could
find no evidence of the increased supply of urban land for the poor. DPL prior actions
had little impact upon the Hcibitut upgrading program that was to be the operations' main
tool for assisting the poor. Disaster mitigation achievements were limited.
Since 2007, however, short-term micro-credit for home improvements aimed at the 40-
70thpercentile range in Mexico's income distribution has increased. But it still accounts
for a small share of SHF (Federal Mortgage Corporation) lending operations, and has not
by itself brought housing finance down-market as the DPLs intended. But micro-credit's
role in housing, the number of its loans, and their volume should not be compared
directly to long-term mortgage lending. As recent Bank technical literature has argued,
micro-credits, while supportive, cannot assure access to housing by themselves. Also,
being very small and quickly repaid, their revolving funds drive up lending figures
rapidly over a short period. By contrast, larger mortgage loans that finance the complete
purchase of a house tie up funding for extended periods allowing aggregate lending
figures to accumulate only much more slowly.
Overall, housing assets in Mexico did not become more affordable and accessible to
lower and moderate income families as intended. The three DPLs did not explicitly
identify appropriate prior actions that would lead to such a result.

RATINGS
`Taking both the before and after-restructuring performance into account, the overall
 outcome of the FOVI Project was moderately satisfactory. It mobilized more resources
 for housing, but relevance was reduced when it moved away from its original focus on
 lower income beneficiaries. The risk to development outcome is significant given the
 present market constraints in Mexico on the project-supported model of housing finance.
 Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, following a re-design that lost the
 project's low-income focus. Borrower performance was satisfactory.
HUSAL-I only achieved two of its eight intended outcomes with substantial efficacy, so
that the overall outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. An up-market shift of
mortgage lending makes the risk to development outcome significant. Bank performance
is rated unsatisfactory because of the poor quality at entry of an operation that tried to
cover too many bases, lacking performance measures in its design. Borrower
performanck is rated satisfactory at both the levels of the government and the
implementing agencies.
HUDPL-I1 substantially achieved only one of its intended outcomes-strengthened
property registers and rights - so its overall outcome is rated unsatisfactory. The
weakening demand for the housing finance products supported by the operation makes
the risk to development outcome significant. Bank performance was unsatisfactory,
since it retained the excessive scope and ambition of its predecessor HUSAL-I, with only
minor adjustments to a weak design. Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory for
                                            xvi

the failure to take mortgage lending down-market and for not following through with the
radical housing subsidy reform envisioned.
HUDPL-I11 achieved nearly half its intended outcomes. Mortgage lending strengthened
a little as volume picked up despite weakening of the overall market, but the intended
down-market move did not occur. The overall outcome is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome is rated significant. Bank performance
is rated unsatisfactory; the operation's weak design was not improved. The government
took steps toward institutional reform through setting up CONAVI (National Housing
Commission), there was little progress with subsidy reform, housing finance did not
move down-market, and Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

LESSONS
       The expected outcomes and scope of an operation should be subject to several
       reality checks at appraisal. An important one is to ensure that essential partners-
       such as INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for Private Sector Workers) in this
       case-are fully on board and committed to the operation. If they are not, or cannot
       be engaged for reasons of political economy, then an operation's scope should be
       contained to cover the more modest outcomes that can reasonably be obtained
       without such partners.
       In large and sophisticated middle-income countries like Mexico, an operation
       should avoid promising sector-wide reforms when commensurate results cannot
       be realistically achieved in the short timeframe and with the relatively modest
       scale of assistance offered.
       Housing finance through mortgage lending encounters an affordability floor.
       Experience in Mexico shows that poorer households below the 40fhpercentile of
       the income distribution cannot afford the cheapest formal housing unit through a
       market-based mortgage loan without a subsidy. An affordability floor like this
       will vary from country to country, depending upon household income levels,
       house prices and interest rates.
       Operations aiming to support affordable housing and urban poverty reduction
       need to be explicit about their target beneficiary populations, with quantification
       of baselines and targets, and at completion, achievements.
       Contrary to down-market aims, establishing a sound reputation in financial
       markets and sustaining a high quality and expanding portfolio can lead a new
       mortgage financier up-market, by targeting higher income borrowers with larger
       loans. Markets perceive such loans as less risky. They are also less costly to
       manage and contribute more to business growth.

1. Background

1.1    The four operations reviewed here, a stand-alone investment project (SIL)
followed by a series of three adjustment/development policy loans (SAD/DPL),
represent significant Bank operational support to Mexico's housing and urban
development sector through US$l .O billion lending over the 1999-2008 period.

1.2     The first, an investment operation called the "FOVI Project" (Ln4443) in this
report, aimed to develop moderate-income housing, using a US$500 million loan for
FOVI (Fondo de Operacidn y Financiamiento Bancario a la Vivienda Fund for        -
Housing Operation and Finance) to re-finance more mortgage lending by private non-
bank financial intermediaries called "Sofoles" in Mexico (Sociedad Financiera de
Objetivo Limitado) and providing technical assistance to FOVI and its successor agency
SHF (Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal). during 1999-2005.

1.3     The series of three adjustment/development policy loans, all called the "DPLs" in
this report, were approved and implemented over the 2004-2008 period. The first of the
three, HUSAL-I (Ln7229) in 2004, was a single tranche sector adjustment loan (SAD) of
US$lOO million to help low and moderate income households in Mexico improve their
living conditions and access to real assets. It had seven intended outcomes, and to achieve
them, identified 14 prior actions by seven different agencies that ranged right across
Mexico's large and complex housing and urban development sector (details Box 2 and
Annex B). The second and third operations in the DPL series, HUDPL-I1 (Ln7340) and
HUDPL-I11 (Ln749 1), were single tranche development policy loans (DPLs) of
US$200.5 million each. Similarly to HUSAL-I, they set many ambitious intended
outcomes and actions spread right across the sector (details Box 2 and Annex B).

1.4      All four operations reviewed here had the following features in common: (i)
attention to housing and housing finance; (ii) the same principal implementing agency,
namely SHF (which replaced FOVI in 2002); (iii) all but HUDPL-I11 have been fully
repaid or prepaid by the Borrower.' These four operations followed long Bank experience
in this sector Mexico, derived from US$2.4 billion lending for seven urban development
and housing projects in the 1985-1999 period.

1.5    Although large by Bank standards, the US$1 .O billion Bank lending for the
operations reviewed here pales by comparison with the scale of local resource flows into
the housing sector in Mexico. What the Bank took ten years to disburse constitutes the
volume of revenues acquired every fortnight by INFONAVIT (Instituto del Fondo
Nacional de la Vivienda para 10s Trabajadores - National Housing Fund for Private
Sector Workers). INFONAVIT, a housing provident fund mandated to collect five
percent of workers' salaries withheld at source by employers, is Mexico's largest housing


I. The related US$7.7 million Housing and Urban Technical ,Assistance Project (HUTAL Ln7261-MX), is
not evaluated here, since it closed in December 2008 six months after HUDPL-111 when two-thirds of the
HUTAL loan were cancelled. The HUTAL ICR noted that: "Together with the Program HUTAL failed to
have measureable impact on the Mexican Housing Sector" (HUTAL ICR p. 19).
                                                     2

 sector player and the country's principal mortgage financier.* Bank project leverage
 within the housing sector of a sophisticated middle-income country such as Mexico,
 especially over such a large agency, can only be limited. In spite of that, a 2004 study did
 conclude that the Bank wielded significant influence over the country's housing and
 urban development policies (Zanetta 2004 p. 272).

 1.6    The scale of Mexico's housing and urban sector is indeed striking. More than 82
million people, 77 percent of the total population, lives in urban areas found across a 2.0
million square kilometer territory extending up to 2,000 kilometers from point to point.
The 22 million living in the capital region make Mexico City the second largest urban
agglomeration in the world. All this in a middle income country with a current GDP of
US$l .1 trillion, the 14* largest economy in the world. The housing stock-urban and
rural-of 24.7 million units is one of the world's largest, a similar number to the 24.8
million households in the 106 million total population. But this is not a perfect match.
Households at the top of the income distribution may occupy several dwellings. At the
bottom end, they may have to make do with 4.6 million poorly built, unserviced or
overcrowded unitse3Mexico's poor households cannot afford formal housing solutions
(World Bank 2006a p. 24), but are targeted by GOM (Government of Mexico) anti
poverty programs such as the Oportunidades conditional cash transfers, and the Piso
Firme program that has laid concrete floors in 2.5 million homes that did not have them.
The DPLs aimed to support SEDESOL's (Ministry of Social Development) Hhbitat slum
upgrading and community development program that also targeted poor families. These
poor urban households help make up 17.6 percent of the total population , within the 0-
20thpercentile range of the income distribution, that are well below the level of income
needed to pay for formal housing solutions on offer (Table 1).

 1.7    Today, the first priority of GOM's current housing policy is to provide one
million new housing solutions per annum (for all income groups), up from the previous
administration's annual target of 750,000 (CONAVI 2006 pp. 33-40). That itself had
been increased from prior levels of 350,000 units. A recent estimate puts the necessary
housing supply at 733,000 new units plus 483,000 home improvements per annum over
the 2007-2012 period of the National Development Plan (CIDOC 2009). Mortgage
finance and housing subsidies, both supported by the DPLs, can be important instruments
to achieve the one million goal. At the same time, GOM aims to increase the coverage of
families with lower incomes. Reaching down to "affordable" housing was central to the
operations reviewed here. In the absence of a precise definition of the income levels of
beneficiaries of affordable housing in the DPL project documentation, IEG's own
analysis shows that formal housing solutions in Mexico are affordable without subsidies


* In this way INFONAVIT collects US$24 billion revenues per annum from Mexico's 14 million formal
private sector workers, as well as the repayment of outstanding loans on its large portfolio. Its political
                           rm
autonomy GOM comes f o the important roles of trade unions and private developers in its governance
structure. Neither is a promising arena for the exercise of World Bank influence. "Since the late 1990s,
INFONAVIT had been under the control of powerful labor unions, which had resisted any attempts at
drastically reforming the housing agency." (Zanetta 2004 p. 286).
'.A recent Bank report entitled Mexico 2006-2012: Creating the Foundations for Equitable Growth
reported that 25 million households live in substandard housing. But this number represents all households
in Mexico and therefore cannot be correct (World Bank 2006a p. 37).

only to households with moderate incomes above the 40th percentile of the income
distribution. This floor of affordability would be higher still, without the conservative
assumptions and parameters of IEG's analysis, that include: (i) households spending 25
                                        and
percent of their income on housingY4 (ii) measuring household income from the top of
each decile in the income distribution. On the other hand, using 2006 household incomes
to assess affordability of 2009 house prices, may slightly underestimate affordability due
to the 10-11 percent inflation over the 2006-2009 period in Mexico. The present review
assumes that these positive and negative effects cancel each other out. The finding of the
40th percentile floor of affordability is important for the subsequent evaluation which is
why the detailed analysis is presented here at the beginning of this review (Table 1).

 1.8    The institutional framework for housing in Mexico, the target of reform sought by
the operations reviewed here is far-reaching and complex. Indeed, "framework" in the
singular may itself be an over-simplification, given the autonomy of several key housing
sector players and the simultaneous separation and yet overlap of housing and urban
policy. There may be several "frameworks". The range and status of housing agencies in
Mexico embraces two autonomous providentlpension funds, a federal ministry, a
development bank, an inter-ministerial commission and private non-bank financial
intermediaries, all with oversight by both the Congress and the Presidency.
Responsibilities and mandates can overlap, Conflict can arise in some cases. There is no
single ministry of housing. The ICR (implementation completion report) of the DPLs
noted that these complexities posed major challenges for the Bank-financed operations
(ICR p.6) involving at least eight housing agencies. But Mexico's two largest housing
finance agencies, INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE (Housing Fund for Public Sector
Workers) were not party to the operations reviewed here. On the urban side, SEDESOL
was involved in the DPLs, but contributed to the institutional framework reform to a
limited degree only. Housing finance, featured strongly in all four operations reviewed
here, has great potential and yet faces many constraints in Mexico. Not least of all is the
limited financial depth of Mexico's economy, evidenced by the relative lack of
development of the financial sector. In 2007, only 38 percent of Mexicans had access to
banking services, less than half Brazil's 96 percent and Chile's 90 percent. In 2006,
domestic credit to the private sector in Mexico was only 23 percent of GDP, against 80
percent in Brazil and 83 percent in Chile. The traumas of the "Tequilla" crisis of 1995
left commercial banks in Mexico wary of mortgage lending, leading them to cut it
altogether except for low-risk high-income clients. Housing finance in Mexico has since
expanded and now uses the most sophisticated of financial products, but it still reaches
few families in the lower deciles of the income distribution (World Bank 2006a p. 11).

1.9    Apart from the World Bank itself, other lenders have been active in the housing
and urban development sector in Mexico over the 1998-2008 period covered by the four
operations reviewed here. The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) has supported

  The 25 percent norm applied in this analysis is conventionally used worldwide, but may overstate
affordability in the case of Mexico, where a 2006 Household Expenditure by INEGI (Mexico's National
Statistical and Geographical Instithe) found that only 6.8 percent of all household spending went on
housing and utilities. Another 12.6 percent went on the imputed rental costs of housing, which, not
involving an actual monetary expenditure, may not readily translate into the explicit ftnancial payment by a
household that servicing a mortgage loan requires.

the sector in Mexico on a large scale for many years, often working in parallel with the
World Bank. It provided a US$500 million loan to FOVI for housing finance and lent a
similar amount to SEDESOL for the Hdbitat slum upgrading program. In 2008 IADB
approved a new loan for SHF (Federal Mortgage Corporation), the client of the DPLs
reviewed here, in an amount of US$500 million to finance housing credit for low-income
beneficiaries. This was part of a US$2.5 billion conditional line of credit. During 2006-
2008 the International Finance Corporation (IFC) financed credit and equity of private
mortgage finance institutions, the Sofoles mentioned earlierS5




2. Relevance to Mexico's Housing & Urban Reforms
OBJECTIVES

 2.1     FOW Project - Modestly relevant overall; substantially so when project
                                                                f
 objective wasfocused upon moderate income beneficiaries o social housing at the
 outset, but later negligible after broader objectives covering housing generally, lost the
focus on lower income beneficiaries (Box 1): By aiming to consolidate and restructure
 FOVI, created in 1963 as one of Banxico's (Mexico's Central Bank) several sectoral
 funds, the FOVI project supported much-needed post- 1995 reconstruction of Mexico's
 devastated housing finance system that commercial banks had quit. It helped re-tool
                                                                The
 mortgage finance and provide loans for housing once againS6 FOVI project's initial
 emphasis was upon what was called "social interest" housing in Mexico-dwellings for
moderate income households earnin 4-8MWs (minimum wages, Mxp. 6,400 - Mxp.
 12,800 per month, ') found in the 3 ' - 70thpercentile range of the income distribution
                                     0
 (Table 1). These original objectives remain substantially relevant to the latest 2008 CPS
 (Country Partnership Strategy) and its emphasis upon reducing poverty and inequality
 and strengthening institutions. With the abolition of FOVI and the creation of its
replacement SHF, however, the FOVI Restructuring Project was itself restructured by
the Bank. In the process, its poverty relevance was lost when a revised objective covered
 all housing, rather aiming at moderate-income families only. But a new SHF needed to
 gain credibility in the financial markets, something that could not be achieved by serving
the poorer segment only.




'.These included a warehouse line of credit of US$70 million to Su Carita to finance mortgages, a similar
 credit of US$20.6 million to Credit0 y Casu, and a U S 4 0 million revolving credit facility to Hiporecuria
 Vertice aimed particularly at mortgage loans for energy efficient housing.
`. Similar to today's housing crisis in the United States, booming real estate in pre-1995 Mexico was led by
 abundant securitized debt, poor credit screening and credit volume excesses. During 1989-1994, the
 volume o mortgage lending grew by 47 percent per annum in real terms, reaching 2.4 percent of GDP.
 Following the crisis, property values fell 63 percent between 1995 and 1998 GDP (Zanforlin 2008 p. 5).
', The minimum wage (salurio minimo) is set annually by GOM for three different regions covering all of

2.2     In 2002, the incoming Fox administration abolished FOVI altogether with its poor
mortgage origination practices and untargeted subsidies. The successor SHF, a newly
created development bank, took over FOVI and the FOVI Project and later became the
financial intermediary for the DPLs. As a Banxico fund, FOVI could not raise money in
financial markets, guarantee others' debts, nor could it securitize mortgages, constraints
considered too serious for a housing finance agency to be effective. FOVI had become
what today might be called a `bad bank' and its place was taken by a `good bank',
namely SHF. SHF inherited FOVI's management, staff and office building, and 15
percent of its assets, the best ones, to start up the balance sheet of the new agency well.
FOVI's annual financial statements are still kept and reported separately by SHF, but
they whittle down each year as old FOVI loans are paid off. IEG noted that its balance
sheet is not entirely dormant, however, since FOVI funds were used recently by SHF to
re-finance mortgage older loans denominated in MWs (minimum wages) to more
affordable UDI (Unidadde Inversi6n) through debt swaps.*

2.3     HUSAL-I Operation - Modestly relevant with objectives targeting poor and
moderate income households, but spread across many areas at once and the intended
outcomes were not always clearly articulated with DPL supported prior actions (Box
2): By itself, the overall program objective was substantially relevant to CPS priorities,
including poverty reduction through improvements to the living conditions of the poor
and broadening the access to housing by moderate-income households. Apart from
wanting to assist the poor directly, project documentation also aimed to move housing
finance systems "down-market", but without specifying the baseline or target parameters
of such a shift. From Table 1, this evaluation recognizes the 40thpercentile in the income
distribution as the floor of such a down-market move.



*. Since 1995 many mortgage loans in Mexico were denominated in "Investment Units" (Unidudes de
Znversidn -- UDZs)to prevent the erosion of the Mxp value of such contracts during inflation. UDI. values
are determined periodically by Banxico. Contracts in UDIs are more affordable than contracts denominated
 n
i multiples of MWs (minimum wages) whose value has increased more rapidly than UDIs.

2.4 As GOM's ministry with major responsibilities for policy toward the urban poor,
SEDESOL was closely involved in the early stages of project preparation, but less so as
Bank and GOM attention within the DPLs shifted from urban slum upgrading toward
housing. But what the DPLs intended to achieve remained extraordinarily ambitious and
wide-ranging, especially trying to achieve them in a housing and urban development
sector the size and complexity of Mexico's.

2.5     The expectation of establishing a unified housing subsidy system in a context
where ineficient and non-transparent interest rate subsidies prevailed on a huge scale,
was not realistic over the short-term covered by this series of DPLs. Strengthening
housing credit and savings systems and taking them down-market, too, was a tall order.
The shallowness and limited penetration of such finance was a challenge that the DPLs
could have appraised more fully through a market assessment. Rental housing as a policy
option was not considered for these DPLs. On natural disasters, HUSAL-I had the
ambitious objective "to better prevent and manage the impacts of natural disasters", later
more realistically downgraded under HUDPL-I1 and I11 to just "increasing the capacity"
to achieve the same thing. Although relevant to Mexico, a country vulnerable to natural
disasters of many kinds, the small scale of prior disaster mitigation actions identified by
                                                  8

the DPLs-45 community actions under Habitat9-were unlikely to deliver the intended
outcome, namely reducing Mexico's major cities' vulnerability to natural disasters.
Likewise, increasing the urban land supply for Mexico's 8.0 million urban poor was out
of scale and beyond the scope of the prior actions identified by the HUSAL-I to achieve.
Modernizing property registries was a more focused and realistic objective, and the one
that achieved the best results. HUSAL-1's detailed policy matrix with the expected
program outcomes is summarized in Annex B of this report. While it indicated the
ambitious direction the program intended to follow, without explicit baselines, targets
and performance indicators related to the objectives, it did not provide the basis for an
effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that the program needed.

2.6     HUSAL-I preparation started in early 2000 on a different platform, as a Federal
District Urban Development Project for Mexico City. In 200 1, that changed to become
preparation of a National Urban Upgrading Program with SEDESOL, that later chose to
pursue with IADB instead. Only in late 2003 did the preparation of the World Bank
operation begin to take the form of the Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector
Adjustment Loan (HUSAL-I) that was approved in mid-2004.

2.7     HUDPL-11 and HUDPL-111 Operations - Modestly relevant. While they did not
retain HUSAL-I's unduly,ambitious overall objective, HUDPL-11 and 111 retained
HUSAL-I's others spread across many policy areas. Those dealing with policy, poor
neighborhood upgrading and natural disaster mitigation were somewhat more
realistic. But another became more ambitious yet, promising greater efficiency through
the achievement of unified subsidies. The limited symbiosis between the housing and
urban development sides of the operations remained (Box 2): Through adding "urban
poverty reduction to their titles, both HUDPL-I1 and I11 highlighted a World Bank
                     "

priority. In the DPL designs, support for physical and social investment in poor urban
neighborhoods and poor people's greater access to urban land were the prior actions of
choice (Box 2). For these complex tasks, each DPL identified just one prior action that,
by itself, could contribute little to achieving the intended outcomes. For HUDPL-11, it
was SEDESOL's strengthening of the Habitat program through participatory planning at
the community level. For HUDPL-111, it was increasing the urban land supply for low
income beneficiaries by GOM's completing a pilot cost:benefit analysis of urban land
development. Thus the distance between the operations' intended outcomes and the
instruments that had been deployed to achieve them was greater under HUDPL-I1 and I11
than HUSAL-I. In other respects, the designs of all DPLs followed a similar format.

      DESIGN
OVERALL
2.8     The FOclgroject had more unity in its design, being focused exclusively upon
housing finance and dealing with one agency only. The DPLs, on the other hand, were
split evenly between housing and urban development, leaving them to deal with a
housing financier SHF; a housing policy coordinator, CONAVI; and federal ministry
responsible for urban development policy and programs-SEDESOL, These three key
partners did not always work in tandem. Today it is widely recognized in Mexico and


 The prior actions were SEDESOL carrying out at least 30 community-level risk analyses and 15
sensitization and mitigation projects under Habitat program.
                                              9

elsewhere that housing finance is an instrument of urban development that can affect the
spatial configuration of cities, how efficiently they function, as well as their contribution
to the environment and climate change. Overall coordination is crucial. The FOVI project
design was substantially relevant for focusing clearly upon the components needed to
achieve the project's stated objectives. The DPL operations' designs were twin-tracked,
split between housing finance on the one hand and urban upgrading and land
development investments in poor urban areas on the other. Each side, the housing and the
urban, had a similar number of objectives and prior actions related to it. Each successive
DPL, ranging from HUSAL-I to HUDPL-I11 had an almost identical design. Overall, that
design is rated to be modestly relevant for not making the link between the housing and
urban development sides clear, and for honing in on prior actions unlikely to achieve the
ambitious objectives set.

FOVI COMPONENTS
2.9     FO V I institutional strengthening: This was well conceived, initially in providing
technical assistance to help FOVI reform and adopt more rigorous loan origination and
credit assessment, as well as targeting its loans for moderate-income beneficiaries. After
project restructuring, TA continued but shifted toward helping the newly created SHF,
FOVI's replacement, adopt modem working practices, establish a sound financial
reputation and deepen the securitization of mortgages in Mexico. FOVI housing
subsidies: These were largely left to GOM, through its Ministry of Finance (SHCP) to
fund, using its own resources, while rightly giving attention to prioritizing up-front lump-
s u m subsidies. FOVI housingfinance: The project gave financial support to second-tier
mortgage lending initially by FOVI and then by SHF. Bank funding pooled some of
FOVIISHF mortgage operations, and was not directed at particular borrowers or a
particular income class of client.

DPL HOUSING
          ACTIONS
2.10 Stable macroeconomy f o r sectorpolicy): As demanded by OP 8.60 of all policy
loans, these DPLs required the maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic policy
framework-especially one achieving price stability, balanced public finances and steady
economic growth-in support of their housing and urban development policy framework.
While macroeconomic stability may indeed be a necessary condition for these DPLs to
succeed, the operations themselves did not provide instruments or incentives for
achieving this, nor were they required to. Nevertheless, this DPL requirement served as a
reminder of the Ministry of Finance's (SHCP) responsibility, as borrower, to keep its eye
on the macroeconomic ball during project implementation.

2.1 1 National housing policy and harmonization of institutional roles: While it lacks
a sectoral ministry specifically responsible for housing, Mexico consistently maintained
sector policy within the framework of the country's six year national development
planning process. The approval of the 2001 - 2006 housing sector policy under this plan
was appropriately identified as a prior action for the approval of HUSAL-I. Follow-on
HUDPL-II and 1 1 still retained the objective of developing a sound national policy, and
                 1
                                                  10

yet identified no prior actions at all", lessening the relevance of a design that could have
identified policy updates and implementation, and prior actions to keep policy moving
forward. DPL support in policy formulation and updating was substantially relevant,
especially for providing an opportunity for targeting lower income beneficiaries.
Harmonization through a weak CONAVI coordination role was not a realistic DPL
action, given the large scale and complexity of Mexico's housing institutions. The
relevance of HUSAL-I prior action of harmonizing the actions of CONAVI, SHF,
FONHAPO and FONAEVI was weakened by the absence from the list of INFONAVIT
and FOVISSTE, Mexico's main mortgage players. Harmonization requires careful
consideration of the political economy of the roles of the Congress, the Presidency,
INFONAVIT, FOVISSSTE, housing developers and contractors. In later comments on
this PPAR, the Country Department confirms that the direct participation of
INFONAVIT, as a large off-budget organization, was indeed beyond the scope of the
program. Leaving out INFONAVIT, the largest sectoral player in Mexico over which
DPLs like these could exert little leverage, was a realistic operational move, but it should
have led to adjusting the DPLs' objectives toward more modest aims that could be
achieved without these agencies.

2.12 Unifiedfederal subsidyfor housing: The DPL idea of unifying housing subsidies
in Mexico using a system of up-front lump-sum payments to beneficiaries was an
attractive one, but not realistic in a housing finance system where below-market interest
rate subsidies by mortgage giants like INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE prevail. The design                        '


of an operation aimed at subsidy reform needs to consider the political economy of the
subsidy systems in place, such as the targeted clients of both direct subsidies and hidden
off-budget subsidies in below-market interest rates and tax breaks. DPL criticism of the
hidden interest rate subsidies was harsh, but appropriate: "Traditionally, these [below-
market interest] loans have crowded out the private sector, hindered the mobilization of
private savings, reduced liquidity in the private housing market, and provided few
housing options for low-income households." (HUDPL-I1 PD p. 43). Despite the
criticism, DPL did not specify actions to reform them. HUSAL-1's prior actions such as
GOM's mandating that the FONHAPOFONAEVI subsidy program be efficient,
progressive and equitable, CONAVI setting up a working group to study subsidies, and
FONHAPO establishing a database of beneficiaries, could only be very small steps where
large strides were needed to move toward designing and implementing a unified subsidy
system for low and moderate income families.

2.13 HUDPL-111's prior action in this area was GOM's mandate of a unified housing
subsidy program that was efficient, progressive and equitable. It included preventing the
combination of subsidies from various GOM programs (called "double dipping");
establishing consistent rules for beneficiary selection, (by income group, for instance);
and linking the receipt of subsidies to household savings. HUDPL-I11 monitoring
indicators of the number of low-income beneficiaries receiving subsidies and the average


lo. Some "indicative" actions had been identified a priori for HUDPL-I1 and I11 under HUSAL-I, but they
were dropped and therefore did not become prior actions for the last two operations.
l 1 Prior to the appraisal of HUDPL-11, the Bank's Regional Operations Committee (ROC) decided to
exclude NFONAVIT as a target of the DPL supported housing reform, even though the HUDPL-I1 PD had
included a two-page annex on the "INFONAVIT's Reform Program".
                                            11

subsidy per household cannot by themselves show if the reform goal of unified subsidies
was achieved. One better indicator was HUDPL-111's ratio of up-front subsidies to
interest rate subsidies.

2.14 Strengthening mortgage lending, its legal framework and bringing it down-
market: Making credit more widely available to families wishing to buy a house remains
a high priority in Mexico's consolidating but still shallow financial system. The DPLs
focused upon improving the mortgage instrument itself and securitizing more of them.
Securitization had begun much earlier in Mexico, and had developed significantly under
the FOVI Project. The DPLs focused upon the instruments of mortgage lending, giving
less attention to the broader market of the likely supply and demand of housing finance,
and especially its lower income segment. In this, the DPLs fell short in not identifying
prior actions to help assure that the financing instruments would serve lower income
home buyers, thereby driving lending down-market. Instead, the DPLs relied on technical
assistance to help Mexico develop high quality financial products for mortgages, with
concern about their reaching a lower income market segment in second place.

DPL URBANACTIONS
2.15 Modernization of property registers: Ensuring that property rights are accurately
recorded and information readily available is essential for housing transactions and their
finance to take place and succeed. Prior to the DPLs, each state in Mexico had its own
system that was rarely compatible with the others', making standardization urgent. With
the support of Bank expertise in this area, GOM was expected to provide technical
assistance to states for this purpose. Prior actions for all DPLs were, appropriately, of
states having implemented modernization on a increasing scale with each operation. This
was a highly relevant action, but the chosen performance indicator, the time taken to
register a property, was only a partial one. It did not monitor the extent or impact of the
registration modernization, which would require other indicators not proposed by the
DPLs.

2.16 Urban development policy: The DPLs rightly highlighted the need for policy to
guide urban development, but highlighted only very partial prior actions to achieve it.
HUSAL-I foresaw that a national urban development and "territorial planning" policy
would be formulated by CONAVI, yet SEDESOL was still the ministry responsible.
Surprisingly, HUDPL-I1 and I11 specified no prior actions needed in this area,
undermining the design relevance of operations still committed to strengthening urban
development policy.

2.17    Coordinating and supporting investments in poor neighborhoods through slum
upgrading: This was the DPL action most directly concerned with the poverty reduction
announced in operations' titles. One prior action first identified by HUSAL-I, was using
poverty mapping to target GOM social programs such as Habitat. While work on DPL-
sponsored poverty mapping had been done by SEDESOL, evidence of how widespread it
was and how effectively it guided investments by Habitat and other social programs was
not systematically monitored. Another, recognized by all three DPLs, was greater
community participation in the design and implementation.of SEDESOL's Hcibitat
                                                       12

program to increase the program?s efficiency.?* But IEG did not find evidence of the
DPL-supported community participation making the giant US$ 1.O billion Habitat
program more efficient as intended. Earlier IEG evaluations have shown that elite capture
by some community leaders can undermine efficiency in targeting the poor. Furthermore,
protracted processes of participatory planning can delay service delivery and undermine
its efficiency. This may help explain why HUDPL-111, at the end of the series, did not
identify prior actions in this area, even while keeping the same objective.

2.18 Low and moderate-income land development: HUSAL-I sought to achieve more
of this through streamlining state and municipal land registration of newly developed
land. Prior actions of SEDESOL assessing state and municipal land regulations in two
regions, completing an inventory of developable land and analyzing the legal and
financial options for residential land development were necessary first steps. But such
actions and studies by themselves could not increase the supply of urban land for the
poor. HUDPL-I1 retained this objective specifying as a prior action the completion of a
cost-benefit analysis of land development. Due to contracting delays, the completion of
this study was waived as a requirement for HUDLP-11, and deferred until HUDPL-111.
But how can a study like this increase the supply of urban land for the poor? The 2007-
20 12 national development plan foresaw the need for 82,000 hectares of serviced urban
land over the planning period, approximately half of it for poor households. Other actions
are clearly needed. DPL preparation briefly considered land pooling through the Hcibitat
program as one solution, but it did not materialize. Increasing supply requires many
parallel actions across the urban land market-something not pursued by the DPLs.

2.19 Risk and mitigation analysis of natural disasters: Nztural disaster mitigation is
unavoidably an essential ingredient of all urban development and housing construction in
Mexico, a country vulnerable to an array of natural disaster risks. Nearly 80 percent of
the country?s areas prone to flooding are urban. City populations are the most at risk from
earthquakes. City governments therefore have an important role to play in disaster
mitigation through spatial planning and building regulation enforcement. Specific disaster
mitigation actions fall under municipal government responsibility and therefore cannot be
implemented by the federal government, the level of government responsible for the
DPLs. Thus, the DPLs could only approach disaster mitigation through the federal
Hcibitat program. But the DPLs held to the ambitious objective of better preventing and
managing the impacts of natural disasters (HUSAL-I) generally, or increasing the
capacity to do so (HUDPL-I1 and 111). Through identifying prior actions as being only the
preparation of 30 risk analyses, 15 sensitization projects, and 10 land-use proposals, all
for the Habitat program, HUSAL-I under-estimated the scale and scope of interventions
needed to begin to achieve its objective.

THEDESIGN HOUSING

                           AND
2.20 How relevant were the designs of these DPLs to affordable housing and urban
poverty itself? Issues behind this important evaluation question have been given much


?. The program officially measures GOM?s ?asset poverty? through: (i) income per capita; (ii) educational
shortfalls in the household; (iii) access to health care; (iv) access to social security; (v) housing quality and
space standards; (vi) access to basic housing services; (vii) access to food; (viii) degree of social cohesion.

attention by Bank country work in Mexico. The 2008 CPS (Country Partnership
Strategy), for instance, sees "two worlds" where poverty takes hold in the south of the
country, while in the north income per capita approaches the level of the southern United
States. It also noted that: "In the realm of housing, the spectacular expansion of recent
years has not reached the lowest deciles of the income distribution" (Banco Mundial
2007 p. 30) and furthermore: "a good part of the increased availability of housing has not
met the needs of the poor segments of the population (Ibid. p. 38).13 By aiming, initially
at least, at supporting "social interest" housing designed to be affordable by households
in the 4-8 MWs bracket (currently Mxp 6,400 - Mxp 12,800 per month), the FOVI
operation was more explicit about income level targeting, something less clear in the later
DPLs. Although designed to tackle "affordable housing" and "urban poverty", these
DPLs did not specify exactly which target beneficiary income groups they had in mind.
This was why IEG looked more closely at this question.

2.21 Using the most recently data available (for 2006) Table 1 (on page 3 of this
report) shows the distribution of income of all Mexican households (both urban and
rural). At the bottom end of the distribution is 17.6 percent of Mexico's population
officially reported as being poor, occupying nearly all of the first two decile ranges of the
distribution. Thus the 0-20' percentile accommodates poor urban families, the targeted
beneficiaries of the DPLs' prior actions on the urban poverty side of these operations. If
market-based parameters of mortgage lending were applied, they could not afford to buy
today's cheapest formal housing units, at around Mxp. 200,000 (US$14,300) each. The
DPLs did not plan to assist them with housing. They were to be helped through
SEDESOL's Hdbitat upgrading and community development program of poor urban
areas.

2.22 The next question is who would benefit from "affordable" housing programs
supported by the DPLs? An answer can be found by locating these beneficiaries of the on
Mexico's income distribution (details Table 1 p.3). From that analysis, IEG found that
households between the 40' to the 70* percentile can afford to buy with a mortgage loan
without subsidies the cheapest new units available today (in the Mxp 200,000 - Mxp
300,000 price range or US$14,300-US$21,400.14If a house buyer can obtain
INFONAVIT's most heavily subsidized loan with annual interest of 4 percent, then
affordability moves 30 percentiles down the income distribution to the 1O* percentile. A
CONAVI lump sum subsidy also makes housing more affordable, moving it 10
percentage points down to the 30thpercentile (Table 1)

2.23 These affordability findings are in line with other estimates. Thus an earlier
assessment by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of Mexico concluded that
"mortgage lending reaches only a very few households that earn less than the median
income" (IMF 2006 p. 4). A recent study of the sector in itself concluded that: "over 50
percent of the population still lacks the resources to gain access to a dwelling of the sort
currently offered by the formal market in the country" (Fundacih CIDOC 2008 p. 37).


l 3 Later comments by the Country Department on this PPAR confirmed that it was never the objective of
the DPLs to move mortgage finance, for instance, to the poorest quintiles of the population.
                                                                                       '

10. HUSAL-1's benchmark of the lowest cost of an affordable house at Mxp 224,000 (US$16,000) within
                                                                                                is
this range (HUSAL-I PD p. 3 footnote 5).
                                              14


HUSAL-1's appraisal, noteworthy for coming after the mortgage lending efforts of the
earlier FOVI Project, still concluded that Mexico's "mortgage institutions provide
virtually no credit for the lower-cost housing solutions suited to the low/moderate-income
                               )
majority" (HUSAL-I PD p. 5. The 40thpercentile affordability floor-well above the
poverty line-is well understood today, but HUDPL-I1 proposed that housing for low-
income families would be one of the "key aspects of poverty that the loan would address"
(HUSAL-PR p.2). HUDPL-I1 used the terms "low-income housing" and "affordable
housing interchangeably (HUDPL-I1 PD p. a footnote 2). Since households that can
afford the housing on offer are found in the 40th- 70thpercentile range that spans the
median income, it would be more appropriate to describe these beneficiaries as being
"moderate income", the term used throughout this report. HUDPL-111, the last in the
series, made no explicit reference to target beneficiary income levels.

                       -
2.24 FOWProject Negligible: M&E design was initially strong, and included a set
of quantifiable performance targets (e.g. increase of FOVI's market share; minimum
annual proceeds from FOVI securitization; number of low-income mortgages funded
etc.) to be achieved. But, after restructuring, they were replaced by a weaker set of
indicators that were more qualitative (e.g. improvements to information systems, and
completing a satisfactory design of an insurance product etc.). M&E could still include
targets for and indicators of basic financial ratios of the project's financial intermediaries.
In practice, neither set of indicators was monitored, so M&E could not be utilized as
feedback for guiding and improving the operation's performance.

2.25 DPLs -Negligible: The DPL ICR is correct to note that "The lack of PDO
indicators makes it very difficult to gauge the Program's progress in achieving its goals."
(ICR p. 8). Indeed, M&E design at the outset of HUSAL-I was weak to the point of
raising questions about whether there was an M&E system at all. Program targets to
achieve through the first loan were not laid out explicitly, nor were performance indica-
tors or other means of measuring the achievement of the overall or specific program
objectives spelled out. As noted earlier in this report, operations that had "affordable
housing" and "urban poverty" in its title and objectives, lacked criteria to identify the
targeted beneficiaries. This contrasts with earlier Bank-financed operations in Mexico
had typically positioned their beneficiaries on the income distribution. Still without
baselines and targets, M&E under HUDPL-I1 and HUDPL-I11 showed little improvement.
Without an effective M&E system in practice it could not be implemented or utilized.
The ready availability of good quality secondary data in Mexico on the housing and
urban development sector, and beneficiary incomes suggest that assembling a meaningful
M&E for operations such as these can be successful in the future.

3. Implementation
       GOOD
MEXICO'S             PERFORMANCE
           MACROECONOMIC
3.1     Throughout the decade the operations reviewed here were implemented, Mexico
turned in a strong macroeconomic performance (Table 2). Until the global financial crisis
of 2008-2009 GDP growth had been steady, recovering quickly from the impact of the
US economy slowdown of 2001-2002. By 2002, inflation fell to levels that did not
adversely affect affordability, enabling a financial market to function with confidence, as
reflected in a stable Mxp:US dollar exchange rate until 2008. During the 1998-2008
period under review interest rates fell, even more sharply than inflation. Recent years
have shown a significant growth of stocks traded, indicating an expansion of the local
securities market. The deepening of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, however, is
being felt in Mexico, through devaluation of the local currency, and inflation resulting in
higher country risk assessment. As elsewhere, this has made investors averse to debt
instruments such as the mortgage-backed securities supported by the operations reviewed
here. All this is a backdrop to the general slowing down of the housing and construction
sectors (Fundacibn CIDOC 2009). Nevertheless, Mexico did maintain macroeconomic
stability over the 2004-2008 DPL period, as intended (Table 2).

      DURING
CHANGES    IMPLEMENTATION
3.2    This assessment highlights three different ones. First, design moves lessened the
focus on low-income beneficiaries, through the revision of the FOVI Project objectives
mentioned earlier, and through HUDPL-I1 and HUDPL-I11 not retaining HUSAL-I
primary objective of improving the living conditions of the poor and strengthening low-
income access to housing. But all three DPLs kept "poverty reduction" in their titles.
Second, at the request of GOM, the loan amounts for HUDPL-I1 and I11 originally
planned for US$lOO million each both doubled to US$200.5 million. Third, the DPL
program was extended from four to five years with the 12 month launch delay of
HUDPL-I11 to give the incoming Calderon administration time to take the operation fully
on board. Apart fkom these changes, all operations were fully implemented, much
according to their respective plans.
                                           16

3.3    During 2007, with Mexico's public finances buoyed by rising crude oil prices,
GOM pre-paid all outstanding World Bank loans for housing and urban development,
with the exception of the most recent one, HUDPL-111.

           IMPLEMENTATION
FOVI PROJECT
3.4     Lending picked up quickly after the project was approved in 1999. Prior to the
abolition of FOVI itself, 38 percent of the loan had been disbursed. But, judging from
later remarks about FOVI's weaknesses, used to justify its abolition, reform of mortgage
loan origination and targeting had barely begun. Institutional strengthening really got
under way with the successor SHF after project restructuring at the end of 2002. It was
mostly financed by GOM counterpart funding. Only US$4.4 million of Bank loan
funding was used for institutional strengthening out of the US$23 million committed. The
difference was reassigned, with Bank agreement, to refinance more mortgage loans. After
restructuring, a much broader business plan for SHF was agreed with the Bank that
covered credit risk analysis, subsidies and the issuance of mortgage-backed securities
(MBS). The remaining 62 percent of disbursements were made under SHF. Given the
two-year interruption to implementation while the FOVI-SHF transformation took place,
the project closing date was extended two years later than planned.

          ACTIONS
DPL HOUSING
3.5     Formulating national housing policy and harmonization of institutional roles:
Within the framework of Mexico's six year national development plans, CONAVI
formulated the country's 2007-2012 National Housing Program. CONAVI itself was
established in June 2006 as an inter-ministerial commission responsible for coordinating
housing policy. Institutional strengthening of SHF in particular, enabled this development
bank to retain a (local) AAA credit rating. IEG learned that an explicit GOM guarantee
for SHF debt ,helped assure SHF's good creditworthiness. SHF's own guarantees and
lines of credit as a second-tier bank enabled non-bank private sector intermediaries,
Mexico's Sofoles, to prosper through lending for house construction and purchase.
Following the initial growth and consolidation of the SHF system, SHF retained an exit
strategy. SHF aimed to withdraw from mortgage lending altogether by 2009. This was to
allow more space to private financing of mortgage loans. By moving in this direction, the
asset value on SHF's balance sheet nearly halved between 2004 ind 2007. The complete
withdrawal envisioned did not take place, however, with the tightening of the housing
finance market. Sofoles still looked primarily to SHF to refinance their mortgage loans.
At the same time INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE continued to dominate housing finance
in Mexico, actually increasing their market shares during the 2004-2008 period.

3.6     Designing and implementing a unifiedfederal subsidy for housing and making
it more efficient. Bank supervision and its "fee for service" inputs led to a workshop in
Cuernavaca organized by CONAVI's working group on subsidies. A detailed study of the
present value of all housing subsidies in Mexico laid bare the high costs incurred by
INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE's below-market interest rate loan that continued to
proliferate. In an unusual role for a coordinating agency, CONAVI took charge itself of
providing lump-sum subsidies directly through its Esta es tu Casu program. This was an
update of the earlier PROSAVI (Special Program for Housing Loans and Subsidies)
program for families in the 2-4 minimum salary range begun under the FOVI project.
                                            17

3.7      Strengthening the housing credit and saving systems and move them down
market. This action received most attention from the Bank during implementation. More
fee for service contracts, enabled the Bank to deploy well qualified staff and consultants
who were highly appreciated by their Mexican counterparts. Special attention was given
to mortgage loan origination, borrower risk assessments, documentation of mortgage
loans, securitization and mortgage insurance. IEG learned that a private sector competitor
had bid three times the price of a Bank fee for service contract. The principal DPL target
was mortgage lending by Sofoles. Although such lending increased sharply during 2004-
2005, it fell back in subsequent years. INFONAVIT's and FOVISSSTE's continued to
grow, and on an ever larger scale.

DPL URBAN         ACTIONS
         DEVELOPMENT
3.8     Improved urban development policy. The Bank gave less attention to urban
policy than to housing policy. Differences in interpreting technical assistance contracts
led to difficulties in the dialogue between the Bank and SEDESOL, the operations'
principal urban sector interlocutor. Bank staff did not always find SEDESOL
representatives fully engaged in the program's objectives and actions. SEDESOL
officials found Bank support for its actions untimely and the advice given by different
Bank staff unclear and sometimes contradictory. Although with some delay, SEDESOL
did produce an update of the 2007-2012 National Urban Development and Territorial
Planning Program, a requirement of Mexico's national planning system.

3.9     Strengthening urban real property registries and rights. Successively under each
DPL, Mexico added two, five and then eleven more states to those modernizing their
registries, assisting altogether 18 out of Mexico's 32 states. HUTAL supervision fielded
technical expertise to the SHF and CONAVI. At the same time, the Inter-American
Development `Bank (IADB) provided inputs directly through its own state-level projects.

3.10 Increasing supply o and access to urban land for poor people. With only partial
                            f
and incomplete prior actions identified to achieve this, the DPLs paid little attention to
this aspect of the program. The Hhbitat program was under such severe spatial
constraints that it was unable to provide additional land needed, as intended.

3.1 1 Coordinating and supporting investments in poor neighborhoods. The relevant
prior action was through giving SEDESOL's Hhbitat upgrading and community
development program a stronger community participation and poverty focus. But a
HUTAL study of increased community participation in the program, and poverty
mapping of an unknown number of interventions in municipalities could not assure the
expected outcome of increased efficiency of slum upgrading through Habitat.

3.12 Increasing the capacity to prevent and manage the damage caused by natural
disasters. Only HUSAL-I among the three DPLs identified any prior actions to achieve
this ambitious goal, and these were small-scale and partial in the face of the major
disaster mitigation efforts needed in a large disaster vulnerable country like Mexico.

4. Outcomes

FOVI PROJECT
4.1     Developing social interest housing (before project restructuring) and then,
later, housing generally (after project restructuring) through restruct~ring~~  and
                                           -
institutional strengthening o FOW Substantially achieved: Prior to project
                              f
restructuring at the end of 2002 (with 38 percent of the loan disbursed) FOVI took steps
to begin tightening loan origination and underwriting processing and credit risk analysis.
The improvements were taken further by SHF, FOVI's replacement development bank.
SHF's administrative performance in developing housing finance, such as its lending per
employee, improved during 2002-2005.

4.2     Developing Social Interest Housing(bef0re project restructuring) and then,
developing housing generally (after project restructuring) through increasing thejlow
                    -
o funds to them Substantially achieved: Before project restructuring, outstanding
 f
mortgage loans on FOVI's balance sheet increased by 67 percent from Mxp 24.1 billion
in 1998 to Mxp 40.3 billion in 2001 when it formally ceased operations.'6 While this
shows greater FOVI support for housing finance in general, it does not demonstrate that
the support went to social interest housing in particular. Prior to project restructuring,
FOVI's social interest housing finance increased by 41 percent, but this was only half the
rate of expansion of all FOVI financed housing. After project restructuring, the
outstanding loan portfolio on SHF's balance sheet rose fivefold from Mxp 18.4 billion in
2002 (its first year of operation) to Mxp 94.9 billion in 2005, when the FOVI project
closed. Clearly, this financing helped develop housing generally. But without a social or
poverty focus, this objective had become less relevant.

          ACTIONS
DPL HOUSING
4.3                                                                 -
        Maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework Not rated: As already noted,
Mexico's performance throughout the 1999-2008 period was good (Table 2), earning the
country an investment grade rating in 2001 on its public debt for the first time. But these
results, several of which pre-dated the DPLs, cannot be attributed with confidence to
housing operations that did not focus upon incentives or specific actions in this area.

4.4     Developing and improving national housing policy and harmonizing
institutionalframework - (efficacy ratings: HUSAL-I, modest; HUDPL-11, modest;
HUDPL-111, modest): Through the formulation of the Programa Nacional de Vivienda
2007-2012 a national housing policy was established in Mexico by 2006 as HUSAL-I
had expected. But it difficult to identify later policy contributions by HUDPL-I1 and
HUDPL-I11 that did not indicate prior actions in this area. Results on the institutional side
were mixed and achievements somewhat less than on the policy side. As noted earlier in


15,The FOVI project with "restructuring" in its title, was itself restructured by the Bank in late.2002.
16.FOVI's balance sheet is still reported annually by SHF, and in 2008 showed outstanding "commercial
credits" of Mxp 18.1 billion, considerably below the 2001 peak. In its post-PPAR mission review of these
financial statements, IEG found that FOVI's outstanding mortgage loans more than doubled between 2004
and 2005, showing that, albeit defunct as an organization, FOVI is not defunct as a financial operation.
                                                  19

this report, the creation of CONAVI through the 2006 Ley de Vivienda was the principal
institutional innovation in the sector, but it does not seem to have clarified the roles of
key players in the housing sector or harmonized the interactions between them, the
intended results of the DPLs. On housing subsidies, for instance, it remains unclear where
the responsibilities of SEDESOL end and CONAVI's begin. CONAVI's policy and
coordination authority over INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE is not evident. The Congress
and Presidency, too, are key players in the country's housing sector. Unclear and
overlapping responsibilities have, at times, led to conflict among stakeholders. The
sought-for harmonized institutional framework remains an elusive goal. Nevertheless,
INFONAVIT's relationship with other housing sector players, notably SHF, was
harmonious. INFONAVIT officials also readily met with Bank missions, and
collaborated with HUTAL's subsidy study, even though it had not signed up to that
operation.l7 But IEG heard from several interlocutors Mexico City that effectively
harmonizing the sector requires a strong ministry of housing that the country still lacks.

4.5      The DPLs can be credited with helping the institutional strengthening of SHF,
allowing it to become one of Mexico's most profitable and efficiently run development
banks (Fitch Ratings 2007). SHF's move toward its "sunset" clause of complete
withdrawal from mortgage refinancing was halted in 2009 in response to the disruption of
financial markets. Finding buyers for mortgage-backed securities placed by Sofoles
became more difficult. With tightening cash flows, Sofoles had to continue to seek SHF
refinancing of their mortgage loans. But SHF's already reduced involvement is evident
from the Mxp. 5 1.5 billion of outstanding loans on its balance sheet in 2008, down from
Mxp. 83.8 billion at the start of the DPL series in 2004. In the short run,SHF's financial
situation was complicated by its sudden exposure in 2007 to short-term bank loans of
Mxpl1.7 billion (US$1.1 billion), some 15.5 percent of total liabilities. SHF took out
these loans from commercial banks to b d a spurt in the demand for mortgage lending, a
move that aggravated the term mismatch between its assets (18.1 years on average) and
liabilities (8.7 years on average). SHF's 2004 balance sheet showed only Mxp376 million
(US$33 million) in short-tem bank loans, or 0.4 percent of total liabilities. In response to
a GOM request, the Bank has provided a new 30-year US$1 .O billion loan to SHF, with a
GOM guarantee, to help shore up its balance sheet and resume mortgage lending, and
hopefully taking it down-market. l 8

4.6     A positive institutional result of the DPLs is that Mexico's banking regulator, the
CNBV (Comisidn Nacional Bancaria y de Valores - The National Banking and
Securities Commission) now plays an important role in the housing sector. Through
careful oversight and regulation of mortgage finance instruments and the debt issuers
themselves, CNBV has provided quality assurance for financial dealings in housing.


", IEG would like to be able to report more on FOVISSSTE (Fondo de la Vivienda del Instituto del Seguro
Social a1 Servicio de 10s Trabajadores del Estado - Housing Fund for Public Sector Workers), the public
sector equivalent to INFONAVIT and a major housing player in its own right, although also not signed up
to the DPLs. IEG requested a meeting with FOVISSSTE, but it did not take place.
    To finance the Mexico: Private Housing Finance Markets Strengthening Project (Ln7614) approved in
November 2008, and aiming to: (i) strengthen the financial capacity of SHF to develop and consolidate
markets for housing finance and to expand access to lower income groups over the medium-term, and (ii)
improve SHF's technical capacity to expand access to lower income groups over the medium-term.
                                                               20


4.7     Designing and implementing a unifiedfederal subsidy for housing and making
it more efficient (efficacy ratings: HUSAL-I, negligible; HUDPL-11, negligible;
HUDPL-111, negligible): Mexico is still very far from having designed and implemented
a unified system of up-front lump-sum housing subsidies for low and moderate income
families, the ambitious Program objective supported by the DPLs. Although the DPLs
focused upon housing subsidies financed directly by the federal budget, by any measure,
the most important housing subsidies in Mexico were and continue to be off-budget
interest rate subsidies in mortgage loans awarded by INFONAVIT. These charge interest
as low as 4 percent against market rates of the order of 12-14 percent. Apart from
criticizing them, the DPLs did not target initiating their reform during the program.
Currently, Mexico has no explicit strategy in place to reform them over the long-run.
They are popular among home buyers, because their present value is worth five or six
times more than the lump-sum subsidies presently offered by CONAVI or SEDESOL.
Table 3 shows how INFONAVIT's most heavily subsidized lending grew during 2004-
2008, while the share of lending with lighter subsidies shrank.lg INFONAVIT's total
lending, all subsidized continues to grow. In 2008, it was nearly twice the level of 2004.

4.8     DPL support of up-fiont subsidies was appropriate. They are more efficient,
transparent and accountable. But they are not new to Mexico. Most of the up-front lump-
s u m housing subsidies GOM provides today are updates or variants of older programs
such as VIVAH (Programa de Ahorro y Subsidios para la Vivienda Progresiva - Saving
and Subsidy Program for Progressive Housing) and PROSA VI that funded US$132
million already in 2000 (Zanetta 2004 p. 91). According to CONAVI's budget estimates,
some US$866 million will be spent on subsidies in 2009, a six fold increase over this
period, but accounting for only 18 percent of the total value of all housing subsidies in
Mexico. Generally these subsidies can be used by beneficiaries to help finance housing
construction or improvement, but they are not targeted or administered in a standardized
way as the DPLs had hoped. About half of them-some 200,000 per year at up to a
maximum of Mxp53,OOO (US$3,600) each, is provided through CONAVI's Esta es tu
Casa program, while the other half comes through the similarly named Tu Casa program
of SEDESOL's trust fund FONHAPO. IEG was unsuccessful in obtaining the latest
details of the numbers and income levels of the beneficiaries of these subsidies, and it
was not clear how records of these data are kept. IEG did not meet with FONHAPO and a
request for data from CONAVI did not yield the necessary information. IEG did learn,


19. This evidence does not support the HUDPL-I1 conclusion that INFONAVIT subsidies had fallen since
2004 (HUDPL-I1 PD p. 43).
                                                               21

however, that most CONAVI subsidies went to INFONAVIT loan borrowers, who
thereby benefited from two subsidies. This was the so-called "double dipping" that DPLs
had hoped to avoid (HUDP-I1 PD p. 40), but which had reached 72,804 cases by 2007.

4.9    The ICR of the DPL highlighted the success in CONAVI's setting up a working
group on subsidies as a prior action for HUSAL-I: The group functioned well and helped
highlight once more the constraints and challenges facing housing subsidy reform in
Mexico. But, while the working group deliberated, the objective of designing and
implementing the unified subsidy system has yet to be achieved.

Strengthening the housing credit and saving system and moving it down- market.
(efficacy ratings: HUSAL-I, substantial; HUDPL-11, negligible; HUDPL-111,
modest): Mexico's housing credit system strengthened through improved origination and
underwriting procedures over the 2004-2008 period. SHF helped establish standard
mortgage loan agreements among all Sofoles, enabling their loan underwriting to be more
timely and secure. Mainly through foreign insurers, SHF applied mortgage insurance, a
somewhat new instrument to Mexico, to 23 percent of loans in 2005. But the expansion
of mortgage finance was mostly on the INFONAVIT side of the market. The smaller
SHF/Sofoles side shrank. Over the 2004-2008 period SHF/Sofoles share of new mortgage
lending had fallen from 19.3 percent to 8.9 percent. But neither side saw the down-

market move intended by the DPLs, as their own data show (Table 4)20. The up-market
shift of SHF/Sofoles lending was confirmed by a new Bank publication: "In recent years,
the Sofoles have issued mortgage securities and moved more up market." (Chiquier et al.
p. 40). Under HUSAL-I during 2004-2005, SHF/Sofoles lending grew sharply and the
affordable housing share of the total rose, a strong efficacy performance. HUDPL-I1
during 2005-2006 saw the level of lending fall, and, moreover, the share going to
affordable housing shrink-the opposite result to that intended by the DPLs. During
2007-2008, HUDPL-I11 the volume of lending increased, but the affordable share
continued to fall-not a satisfactory outcome.

4.10 The IEG mission visited two housing schemes of the affordable type supported by
the DPLs that were completed in 2008 outside Mexico City. The Urbanizacibn Campo
Vina in Guanajuato State and the Urbi site in Mexico State were large developments of
houses sold to moderate income households who took out mortgage loans with
INFONAVIT, FOVISSSTE or one of the Sofoles. Both housing schemes were located far
from their respective regional urban centers. They consisted of two-floor 72 square meter
row-house modules to which one more floor could be added above and an extension built
at the back. Most units had been sold but some were still unoccupied. The sales prices
were in the Mxp 250,000-300,000 (US$17,000-20,000) range, affordable to the 50th -
70th percentile range of the income distribution (details: Table l), where households with
moderate income are found.

4.1 1 SHF has tried to move other lending down-market through micro-credit Mxp
5,000-Mxp 10,000 (US$350-US$700) loans, for home improvements and self-help
construction. Such loans are typically for terms from 6 months to two years with interest
of up to 53% per annum (3.6% monthly) driven by the high administrative costs of these
very small lending operations (DPL ICR p. 23)2'. SHF awarded its first micro-credits
experimentally in 2005 and 2006, with just 45 and 1,336 new loans respectively. By
2008, SHF approved 123,000 such loans for a total of Mxp 918 million (US$65
           but they still account for only 5 percent of SHF's total lending23,not enough to
bring to move housing finance down-market as the DPLs intended.24Clearly, a lot more


2o  The volume of INFONAVIT's annual mortgage lending in 2008 was Mxp 48 billion (approx USS4.4
billion) more than in 2004. Of the total increase, 63 percent went to financing housing affordable without
subsidies. The remainder, 37 percent went to funding higher income housing. Over the prior 2000-2004
period finance the growth of INFONAVIT funding was at a similar rate, but accounted for 98 percent of the
total increase. Higher income housing accounted for just 2 percent of that increase.
2 1 "It is unlikely that housing micro-finance interest rates will ever fall to the same level as those charged
for consumer or mortgage loans by banks." (Chiquier et al. p. 41 1).
22
    The number of micro-credits and the volume lent cannot be compared directly with the number of value
of mortgage loans because of the sharply different terms of each instrument. Since mortgage loans, on
average, are for terms that are 15 times longer than for a micro-credit, an amount of, say, US$25,000 could
finance only one mortgage loan over a 15 year period, whereas the same financing could fund up to 15
micro-credits in a total amount of US$375,000 over a 15 year period.
23 "Even in the most favorable circumstances it is difficult to envision more thatn 10 percent ofany
country's households to access housing micro-finance (HMF) loans. The small size of HMF loans implies
that even with deep market penetration, HMF loans will weight [sic] a small percentage of the total
financial sector." (Chiquier et al. p. 409).
24 Data cited here was provided by SHF to IEG and shows 123,023 micro-credits awarded in 2007-2008 in
an amount of Mxp 0.9 billion. Over the same period, 54,558 SHF-financed mortgage loans were awarded
                                                     23

has to be done. According to the DPL-ICR, "Compared to other middle income countries
in the region, housing microfinance products and market penetration in Mexico is in its
infant stages" (p. 22). In other respects, Mexico's experience with housing micro-credits
reflects what the Bank has found elsewhere.25 Moderate income clients-in the 40th-
      ~
7 0 percentile range of the income distribution-have been the main beneficiaries thus
far, according to the DPL ICR (p. 24).

4.12 Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by SHF/Sofoles and called Borhis in
Mexico mobilized Mxp. 48.4 billion (US$4.3 billion) resources for housing during 2004-
2008, the highest in Latin America, but still equivalent to only 1.4 percent of all housing
finance in Mexico over this period (Table 5 ) . But, so far, this has not translated more
SHF/Sofoles lending, whose volume declined as noted earlier (Table 4). Without this
secondary mortgage finance there could have been an even sharper decline. It came
through 44 auctions of MBS26over the 2004-2008 period, 77 percent of which were
rated AAA by credit rating agencies in Mexico. They were readily subscribed by pension
funds and insurance companies. INFONAVIT, too, issued its own MBS, called Cedevis
in Mexico raising Mxp28.1 billion (US$2.8 billion) through 16 auctions, again all rated
AAA and all fully subscribed. SHF/Sofoles' MBS helped mobilize the equivalent of
about 10 percent of all housing finance in Mexico over the 2004-2008 period, an
important contribution, but clearly not the main source of strengthening housing credit in
the country. Although detailed data is not available for this evaluation, MBS is unlikely
to have made housing more affordable, since securitization has taken mortgage finance
up market in Mexico as the Bank studies cited earlier found (Chiquier et al. p. 40). To be
attractive for securitization, mortgage loans need to be held by low-risk borrowers, more
likely to be less-leveraged higher-income household^.^' IEG learned from market
analysts in Mexico that MBS expansion of housing credit has probably reached its limit
given tight liquidity and averseness to investment in securities of any kind in current
financial markets. This constraint figured in the preparation of the most recent Bank loan
to SHF (Ln7614), that noted that foreign-owned banks in Mexico were receiving
instructions from their headquarters not to invest in MBS (PAD p. 4).




in an amount of Mxp 18.1 billion. The average individual micro-credit was for Mxp 7,460 (US$678), while
the average mortgage loan was for Mxp 331,501 (US$30,137). As well as requiring 40 times more funding
to initiate the loan, mortgage lending ties up the finding at least fifteen times longer. This means that the
same US$30,000 fbnding for a 15 year mortgage loan could instead fund 600 one-year micro-credits of
US$750 each over a 15 year period.
25 "Housing micro-finance (HMF) is not the "silver bullet" that will solve the challenge of universal access
to homes and is not a suitable solution for large-scale non-subsidized, new home constructions, the
provision of which remains the major challenge in many of the countries where housing micro-finance
thrives. Policy makers should therefore not promote HMF as the primary solution for filling quantitative
housing shortages. HMF is not a substitute for affordable long-term mortgages." (Chiquier 2009 p. 415).
16. Since INFONAVIT held 16 of the 60 auctions launched in this period, the remaining 44 are assumed to
be the responsibility of SHF/Sofoles (Fundacibn CIDOC 2009. p.124 and p.133).
17. The appraisal of Loan 7614 noted: "Securitized mortgage lending for low income households will wait
until portfolios are accumulated and additional analysis on the associated risks is undertaken" (PAD p. 14).

4.13 The DPLs identified few prior actions to strengthen savings for housing and to
bring these too down-market. BANSEFI (Bank of National Saving and Financial Services
- Banco de Ahorro Nacional y Servicios Financieros) created in 200 1 to stimulate
savings through savings plans, currently has Mxp6.3 billion of direct savings deposits
that have grown at about 7 percent per annum in recent years (www.bansefi.aob.mx ).
Since other Bank group projects28have supported BANSEFI operations directly, it is
difficult to attribute these results to the DPLs. In 2006, SHF sponsored the Ahorro
Voluntario (voluntary savings) program on a small scale to encourage more savings that
would enable workers to increase their pensions, but not necessarily to improve access to
housing credit too (DPL ICR p. 23).

        DEVELOPMENT
DPL URBAN        ACTIONS
4.14 Improved urban development policy: (efficacy ratings: HUSAL-I, negligible;
HUDPL-11, negligible; HUDPL-111, modest): Results thus far are disappointing, with
policymaking slow to incorporate sectoral reforms, and a growing dichotomy between
housing policy on one hand and urban development policy on the other. A National
Program for Urban Development, prepared by SEDESOL as part of Mexico's national
planning system, that had been delayed under HUSAL-I and HUDPL-11, was finalized
under HUDPL-111-hence the higher efficacy rating for this operation. But DPL
documentation did not include performance indicators to measure progress in this area. It
appears to have linked progress in urban policy with developments in the Hdbitat
upgrading program, a rather tenuous connection. Without a clear urban policy instrument,
the limited DPL policy dialogue with SEDESOL, where Bank-Borrower communications
were not always easy, could make little headway.

4.15 Strengthening urban real property registries and rights. (efficacy ratings:
HUSAL-I, substantial; HUDPL-11, substantial; HUDPL-111, substantial): This
expected outcome has been met today, through 18 of the most populous of Mexico's 32


28. Operations to support BANSEFI include: Mexico: Savings and Credit Sector Strengthening and Rural
Microfmance Capacity Building Project (PO70 108 FY02); Mexico Savings and Rural Finance (BANSEFI)
Project Phase I1 (PO87152 FY04); Mexico Savings and Rural Finance (BANSEFI) Additional Financing
Project (PI03491 FY07), as well as other operations financed by IFC.

states having modernized their property registries as recognized in successive DPL prior
actions. The Bank deployed expertise through HUTAL supervision missions that was
well received by SHF and CONAVI. CONAVI's active participation served to raise
property registration modernization as a national issue beyond just a concern of
individual states and municipalities. During its field visit to the state of Guanajuato, the
IEG mission was able to verify at first hand the excellent performance of property
registries there. Guanjuato's agreement with CONAVI under the umbrella of the DPLs
brought valuable technical assistance. This enabled the state authorities to extend the
service from just four municipalities in 2003 to all 23 municipalities across the entire
state by 2006. The well organized production line that IEG witnessed durirlg the
mission's visit to the property registry of the municipality of Leon showed that the public
was attended promptly and processing was accurate. Performance standards, such as the
maximum time allowed to deal with a particular request, were strictly adhered to. Having
set up one of the best systems in Mexico, the State of Guanajuato now provides technical
support in this area to the States of Tabasco and Chiapas. Recently, the registries continue
to strengthen by incorporating property tax collection into their work (Fundaci6n CIDOC
2009). Although the DPLs provided no baseline data, the time taken to register a property
in the 18 participating states continues to fall, from 16 days in 2006 to 7.9 days in 2008.

4.16 Increasing supply o and access to urban land for poor people: (efficacy
                             f
ratings: HUSAL-I, negligible; HUDPL-11, negligible; HUDPL-111, negligible): IEG
found little evidence of positive results in this area that could be attributed to DPL
support. The reported additional land supply fell from 2,600 hectares in 2005 to 456
hectares in the first semester of 2008. In addition to the decline, the absolute amounts are
small when compared with the 16,400 hectares per annum deemed necessary by the
2007- 2012 plan. While a cost:benefit study of urban land markets was a prior action, this
did not translate into the land supply needed to accommodate an estimated 800,000 more
people each year in Mexico's cities. Data on urban land supply, including for the
baseline, were scarce. The DPLs' exclusive reliance on the Habitat program to deliver
the increased land supply, proved unduly optimistic and realistic. Other mechanisms of
urban and spatial planning and densification involving the public and private sectors were
not contemplated.

4.17 Coordinating and supporting investments in poor neighborhoods: (efficacy
ratings: HUSAL-I, negligible; HUDPL-11, negligible; HUDPL-111, negligible): IEG
found no evidence of the DPLs helping to coordinate or support such investments that are
indeed important ones for poverty reduction. The chosen actions, poverty mapping and
community participation for some of SEDESOL's Hdbitat program had little impact
upon the program itself. Hdbitat is one Mexico's principal anti-poverty efforts, driven by
GOM investments of more than US$l .O billion between 2004 and 2006 alone, plus
US$0.5 billion of IADB funding. A quasi-experimental impact evaluation did find higher
service levels for sanitation in Hdbitat ZAPs than in similar unimproved areas, but no
significant difference for piped water and electricity (Campuzano 2007). Another recent
evaluation noted that service deficits in ZAPs (Le. baselines) were not always accurately
analyzed. The evaluation recommended that the program needed to be strengthened
through more community participation-precisely what the DPLs had considered as a
key prior action (CONEVAL 2008 pp. 176-177). As Hdbitat's principal unit of account is
the ZAP, reliable information on the number of beneficiaries within each ZAP is scarce.
                                             26

SEDESOL counts all residents of the ZAP as beneficiaries, a count that may include
people who did not directly benefit from program action, as well as the non-poor living
alongside the poor. DPL involvement in the Habitat program was limited and
performance indicators proposed by the DPLs-the number of slums incorporating
participatory methods of planning and investment-could not measure the intended result
of achieving better coordination and greater efficiency.

4.18 Increasing the capacity to prevent and manage the damage caused by natural
disasters. (efficacy ratings: HUSAL-I, negligible; HUDPL-11, negligible; HUDPL-111,
modest): DPL achievements were limited in scope, especially for a large country like
Mexico that is vulnerable to natural disasters of all kinds. Without specifying a particular
type of development needing protection from natural disasters, the disaster mitigation
objective should surely apply to all housing and urban development actions contemplated
by the DPLs. To achieve an ambitious objective, it would also have to identify all
necessary actions of disaster preparedness, ranging from early warning systems to land
use controls, and from disaster resistant building codes to emergency responses. The
DPLs were not equipped to address all areas of vulnerability in housing and urban
development, nor the populations most at risk. Instead, they focused narrowly upon
introducing disaster mitigation measures into the Hdbitat program only through
introducing disaster risk mapping to 30 ZAPS. The chosen performance indicator, the
number of cities adopting natural disaster risk atlases through Hdbitat rose from 38 in
2005 to 63 in 2008. But through this action identified by the DPLs, the Program achieved
only a very partial result that has reached fewer than 10 percent of Mexico's 650 cities,
nearly all of which are vulnerable to disasters.

HOUSING    ABILITY AND URBAN POVERTY REDUCTION RESULTS
      AFFORD
4.19 Evidence assembled for this evaluation does not point to the DPLs making
housing assets more affordable and accessible to moderate income families, as intended.
Housing and housing finance systems did not go down-market. These were major
shortcomings for a program for which benefiting lower income families was a corner
stone. The DPLs did not succeed for several reasons. First, their objectives were unduly
ambitious in seeking to reform such a large and complex housing and urban development
sector as Mexico's over a Short period. Second, the DPLs did not read Mexico's sector
priorities clearly when GOM placed increasing the supply of housing (for all income
levels) as the first priority, ahead of helping the poor. Third, in using the ambiguous term
"affordable", the DPLs did not make clear who precisely the intended beneficiaries, or
what their income levels were. In hindsight, a more thorough analysis of housing demand
across income groups in Mexico, and its shortfalls across the country might have better
guided the design of these operations.

4.20 It is now more widely understood that the poor-making up the first two deciles
of the income distribution in Mexico-cannot afford formal housing programs of the type
offered through the SHF/Sofoles system sponsored by these DPLs. The DPL sponsored
actions to support the urban poor were through the Hdbitat program. This was a good
choice of program, but IEG could find only scant evidence that the prior actions
sponsored by the DPLs, such as community participation and poverty mapping, made the
program more efficient and better targeted as expected. With or without the DPLs, the
                                                      27

Hdbitat went ahead, thanks to large GOM budget and significant financial support by the
IADB. The stalling of the World Bank's dialogue with the ministry responsible,
SEDESOL, challenged even the modest achievements that could have been expected.
Evidence of the urban poverty benefits of the DPLs is thin and poorly documented. With
its knowledge of poverty reduction worldwide, the Bank could have proposed
methodologies for evaluating the impact of such programs, for instance. Excellent
biannual data of household expenditure in Mexico could have been used to monitor the
progress of poverty reduction at the level of each ZAP, for example. But without a
productive working dialogue, the Bank was unable to bring its advice to the GOM table
through these successive DPLs.



5. Ratings

5.1     The ratings that follow point to a positive outcome of the FOVTProject but
substantial shortcomings of the DPLs when measured against the ambitious outcomes
they set out to achieve. At the same time, IEG recognizes some progress made on
different fronts in Mexico's housing and urban development sectors with the support of
the Bank. But such progress pales when set against the far-reaching objectives originally
formulated. As matters stand, the reported failure of these DPLs is the direct result of
overly ambitious and unrealistic objectives, without a proper appraisal at the outset of the
chances of achieving them.

OUTCOME AND RISK TO DEVELOPMENT
5.2     FOWProject: Prior to project restructuring-with 38 percent of the loan
disbursed-the substantially relevant objectives of institutional strengthening of the
housing fund FOVI and mobilizing resources for social interest housing were modestly
achieved, with two shortcomings: (i) the loss of some institutional results with the
abolition of FOVI (originally the target of project technical assistance); and (ii) resources
for housing other than social interest housing were mobilized more quickly and on a
larger scale. After project restructuring-when 62 percent of the loan was disbursed-the
project objectives became less relevant when they broadened project support to housing
in general, thereby losing their focus on lower income beneficiaries. With SHF as the
post-restructuring target, the relevant institutional objectives were substantially achieved.
Taking the before and after restructuring performance together, overall relevance is rated


". For the DPLs,this IEG assessment gives equal weight to all eight objectives formulated for each
operation. The ICR,on the other hand, gives most weight at closing to three objectives related to: (i)
housing subsidies; (ii) access to credit; and (iii) property registry reform, reporting that these are "the most
important in the eyes of stakeholders" (ICRp. 3 1). For evaluation purposes, a reassignment of weights like
this is most convincing when made explicitly prior to the evaluation itself. When done, ex post, at a time
when outcomes of each objective are already known, such an assignment could be misconstrued as
downplaying failed objectives by assigning them zero weight in the overall assessment. For this evaluation,
fulfilling prior actions itself is not a guarantee that the objectives have been achieved, especially when the
relevance of the design is undermined by prior actions unrelated to the scale or scope of the intended
outcomes set out by the objectives.
                                           28

modest, efficacy substantial. Efficiency is likely to be modest, however, given the large
disbursements made and limited results achieved prior to restructuring. The overall
outcome of the project is therefore rated moderately satisfactory. Given the policy and
market challenges to the housing finance model supported by the project, the risk to
development outcome is rated as significant.

5.3    HUSAL-I Only two of its intended outcomes were substantially achieved,
namely strengthening mortgage lending while moving it down-market and strengthening
property registries. Thus, the overall outcome rating for this operation is moderately
unsatisfactory. With the later move away fiom housing affordable to moderate income
families in Mexico, the risk to development outcome is rated significant.

5.4    HUDPL-II: The operation achieve only one of its intended outcomes
substantially, the strengthening property registries. The overall outcome rating is
therefore unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome is significant particularly in
view of the weakening demand for the type of housing finance supported by the
operation.

5.5    HUDPL-111: Three of the eight intended outcomes were achieved. Again, the
strongest achievement was with property registries. There was some recovery of
mortgage lending, but no down-market trend. Overall, the outcome rating is moderately
unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome is significant given the weakening
demand for the financial products supported by the operation.

BANKPERFORMANCE
5.6     FOW Project: The design included appropriate components for achieving the
operation's objectives. But clearly the Borrower was in the driver's seat, and the Bank in
reactive mode when GOM suddenly abolished FOVI, the heart of the project design, in
midstream implementation. Thus, for ensuring quality-at-entry, Bank performance in
designing an operation to strengthen an agency that GOM didn't want at all was not fully
satisfactory. Supervision was intense, costing US$677,000 (similar to the costs of
preparation and appraisal). With little achieved prior to the abolition of FOVI, Bank
supervision slowly led to a restructuring that, in hindsight, could have retained the
project's focus upon social interest housing for moderate income beneficiaries.
Nevertheless, with the successor SHF in FOVI's place, Bank supervision became more
effective, helping SHF develop strong mortgage origination procedures and assessments
of client risks. Thus, supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. Overall, Bank
performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.7     HUSAL-I: Preparation was protracted, as different directions were tried out over
a period of several years before finally settling with the DPL series. The final HUSAL-I
design covered too many tracks at once, leading to unrealistic and ambitious objectives
out of touch with the large scale and complexities of Mexico's housing and urban
development sector and GOM's own priorities for it. The operation also lacked a
systematic means of M&E. Thus, the rating for ensuring quality-at-entry is
unsatisfactory. This loan had very light supervision, although more would have allowed
continued oversight of dynamic prior conditions (e.g. the harmonization of housing
                                           29

agencies) to learn if they remained in force after approval. Thus supervision is rated
moderately satisfactory. But overall, Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory giving
due weight to preparation and appraisal, whose costs were nearly twenty times those of
supervision.

5.8     HUDPL-11: While this operation still harbored its predecessor's many ambitious
objectives, some small design improvements made a few objectives a little more realistic.
The actions supporting the achievement of the objectives were, however, not clearly
spelled out in the design. Thus, ensuring quality-at-entry is rated unsatisfactory. On
similar grounds to HUSAL-I above, supervision is rated moderately satisfactory, but the
resources devoted to supervision were not significant. Thus, overall, Bank performance is
rated unsatisfactory.

5.9     HUDPL-111: The design of this operation was almost identical to that of its
predecessor, with similar shortcomings. In repeating these, the Bank missed an
opportunity to redesign the third DPL, making its objectives and scope more realistic.
Thus, quality-at-entry is rated as unsatisfactory. As with HUSAL-I and HUDPL-I1 above
supervision is rated moderately satisfactory but was a much smaller element of Bank
activity than preparation and appraisal. Overall, Bank performance is therefore rated
unsatisfactory.

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER
5.10 FOKT Project: GOM's ownership of the project was strong at the outset. In one
way, it surpassed its commitment to the operation's goal of restructuring FOVI when it
decided to abolish the agency altogether and create a new development bank, SHF, in its
place. On the other hand, GOM's shift away from social interest housing after the project
was amended represents a weaker commitment to lower income housing beneficiaries.
The counterpoint was clear GOM support to strengthening the new SHF. On balance,
government performance was satisfactory. FOVI to a limited extent, and later SHF
considerably, made significant improvements to managing the mortgage portfolio. Thus
implementing agency performance was satisfactory. Overall, Borrower performance is
rated satisfactory.

5.1 1 HUSAL-I: The government bought into the operation's aims through its policy
commitment letter to the program as a whole. It was a good start to incorporating the
program's aims into GOM's policy framework for housing and urban development.
Government performance is therefore rated satisfactory. As the principal financial
intermediary for the operation, SHF made significant progress in strengthening the
management of its mortgage loan portfolio, especially in loan origination and
securitization. Under this first DPL, SHF succeeded in bringing such lending down-
market. Thus implementation agency performance is rated satisfactory. Overall,
Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

5.12 HUDPL-11: Although GOM's sector policy framework remained in place, and it
pursued the reformulation of housing policy, its reticence towards major reforms in key
areas such as housing subsidies was becoming more evident. At the same time, the urban
development side of the operation began to lose GOM attention to the housing side. Thus
the rating of government performance is unsatisfactory. While SHL continued to
                                            30

strengthen and modernize its financial management, assuring its creditworthiness in the
eyes of the market, it took its mortgage lending up-market, contrary to the program's
intent. For these reasons, implementing agency performance is rated unsatisfactory.
Overall, Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory.

5.13 HUDPL-III: A new administration meant a GOM update of sector policy, the.
creation of a new CONAVI, and a commitment to expand housing provision. But little
progress was made in important DPL policy areas, such as housing subsidies and in
measureable actions of urban poverty reduction through the Hdbitat program, upon which
the dialogue with the Bank ground to a halt. Thus, Government performance is rated
moderately satisfactory. Mortgage finance did not move down-market and DPL urban
development actions failed to take off-areas of responsibility of the respective executing
agencies. On balance, implementing agency performance i s rated moderately
unsatisfactory. Overall, Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.


6 . Lessons
6.1     The expected outcomes and scope of an operation should be subject to several
reality checks at appraisal. An important one is to ensure that essential partners-such as
INFONAVIT in this case-are fully on board and committed to the operation. If they are
not, or cannot be engaged for reasons of political economy, then an operation's scope
should be contained to cover more modest outcomes that'can reasonably be obtained
without such partners.

6.2      In large and sophisticated middle-income countries like Mexico, an operation
should avoid promising sector-wide reforms when commensurate results cannot be
realistically achieved in the short timefiame and with the relatively modest scale of
assistance offered.

6.3    Housing finance through mortgage lending encounters an affordability floor.
Experience in Mexico shows that poorer households below the 40th percentile of the
income distribution cannot afford the cheapest formal housing unit through a market-
based mortgage loan without a subsidy. An affordability floor like this will vary from
country to country depending upon household income levels, house prices and interest
rates.

6.4    Operations aiming to support affordable housing and urban poverty reduction
need to be explicit about their target beneficiary populations, with quantification of
baselines and targets, and at completion, achievements.

6.5     Contrary to down-market aims, establishing a sound reputation in financial
markets and sustaining a high quality and expanding portfolio can lead a new mortgage
financier up-market, by targeting higher income borrowers with larger loans. Markets
perceive such loans as less risky. They are also less costly to manage and contribute more
to business growth.
