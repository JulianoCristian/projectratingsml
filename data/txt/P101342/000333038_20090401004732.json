Housing and\n            Urban Poverty Sector Adjustment Loan Project for Mexico were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, sustainability was likely,\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            institutional development impact was substantial. Ratings\n            for the Second and Third Programmatic Affordable Housing and\n            Urban Poverty Development Policy Loan Projects for Mexico\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            a policy-based loan is not the best instrument to address\n            technical issues requiring considerable investment and which\n            are not backed by an adequate policy framework. Instead, a\n            combination of policy and investment loans might have been\n            more effective in meeting the Program's goals.\n            Inefficiencies and redundancies were produced due to the\n            involvement of too many institutions, which were often at\n            odds with each other over policy issues. This was largely\n            due to the large number of components and sectors under the\n            umbrella of the Program. A more focused approach, as\n            previously mentioned, could have reduced these\n            inefficiencies and redundancies. The comprehensive nature of\n            the Program required that adequate Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) provisions be written into the design of the\n            operation; however this was not done until preparation of\n            the second operation was well advanced. Housing and Urban\n            Technical Assistance Loan (HUTAL) should have played a role\n            in fixing the shortcomings of the Program and its\n            implementing institutions in this area. The timing of HUTAL\n            should have been better aligned with the Program in order to\n            provide added value to each component."}, "docdt": "2009-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
