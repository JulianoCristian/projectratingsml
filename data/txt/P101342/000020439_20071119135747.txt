Objectives,         The proposed operation is the third ina three-loan program to support housing and urban
Description, and    development reforms under the Government o f Mexico's National Housing Sector
Benefits            Programs 2001-2006 and 2007-20 12, and National Urban Development and Territorial
                    PlanningPrograms 2001-2006 and 2007-2012.
                    The overall objective is to support the Government's efforts to improve national policies
                    and institutions for housing and urban development; make the federal housing system
                    more efficient by designing and implementing a unified system o f subsidies to facilitate
                    access to housing by low- and moderate-income families; bolster systems for housing
                    loans and savings and move them down-market; strengthen urban real property registries
                    and rights; coordinate and support physical and social investments in poor
                    neighborhoods; increase the supply o f and access to urban land for poor people and
                    improve this market's functioning; and increase capacity to prevent and manage the
                    damage caused by natural disasters.
                    The program o f World Bank support includes 3 sector adjustment and development
                    policy loans and a US$7.7 million Housing and Urban Technical Assistance Loan
                    (HUTAL).
                    The first loan in the series (HUSAL I) approved by the World Bank's Board o f
                                                              was
                    Directors on April 27, 2004. That loan supported the design and implementation o f a
                    new national housing policy and accompanying institutional arrangements, establishment
                    o f programs to facilitate home loans for low- and moderate-income groups, and initial
                    steps to harmonize disparate housing subsidy systems and modernize urban title systems.
                    In parallel, a coordinated national urban development policy was developed and
                    implemented at the federal and local levels. Its focus was to strengthen institutions,
                    improve approaches to develop land for low-income housing, and introduce programs to
                    mainstream natural disaster risk management indevelopment plans.

                    The second loan, (HUDPL 11)-approved inNovember 2005- provided continued support
                    for the Government's program, in five main areas: reforming the operation and structure
                    o f federal housing subsidies; developing new financing mechanisms for home purchases,
                    improvements, and additions for low- and moderate-income populations; expanding the
                    program for modernizingproperty registries; strengthening the slum upgrading program;
                    and expanding low- and moderate-income land development.

                    All key actions inthe government's program which were anticipated before appraisal o f
                    the proposed Third Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Reduction Development
                    Policy Loan (HUDPL 111) have been completed (Section V). The loan will support a
                    number o f the new administration's priorities and initiatives in the housing and urban
                    sector. The loan consolidates and deepens the reforms undertaken under the first and

                       second loans (HUSAL and HUDPL I). loan's expected benefits include increased
                                                                  The
                       access to adequate housing and basic services for low-income households, higher sector
                       efficiency and competitiveness, greater income opportunities and promotion o f access to
                       physical capital, and better environmental conditions. The program has made better than
                       expected progress in some components, notably subsidy reform and mainstreaming
                       environmental concerns inthe housing sector.
Risks and Mitigation   The overall government reform program has two major risks. Institutional and
                       Sustainability

                       The institutionalrisk is related to the difficulty o f ensuringadequate coordination across
                       agencies. The program's        ambitious, multi-sectoral      approach requires constant
                       coordination between government agencies and ministries. A failure to do so would put
                       parts o f the program at risk. The new Housing Law considerably strengthens the
                       coordinating and policy-settingrole o f CONAVI. Accordingly, this risk i s rated as low.

                       There is also a sustainability risk to the entire reform program at the end o f the
                       HUSAL/HUDPL series. The significant reforms undertaken by GoM over the past
                       several years need to be sustained throughout the medium term to obtain the desired
                       outcomes. There is a considerable risk that INFONAVIT "captures" a major portion o f
                       the new subsidy program and effectively shuts out the still nascent private sector fiom
                       the lowest-income segments. It is worth reiterating that, as an institution, INFONAVIT
                       enjoys virtual autonomy fi-om the federal government in terms o f decision-making. The
                       Bank will remain engaged with GoM on subsidy reform through the HUTAL and, as in
                       the past, it is expected that GoM will seriously consider the Bank's recommendations in
                       this regard. This risk is ratedas moderate.


                       Overall project risk: Low.

                                             I.INTRODUCTION

1.         The Mexico housing and urban poverty reduction program continues to be robust with
strong ownershipfiom the Government of Mexico. The number of housing subsidies continuesto
increase while being better targeted to the poor (<3MW segment) and (for the first time in
Mexico) incentivizingthe used housing market. The housing microfinancepilot has made steady
progress and the number of microfinance loans is increasing. The number of plots allocatedto
beneficiariesof the programHabitatfor low-incomehousingalso has increased.

2.         The Calderdn administration has maintained the previous government's commitment to
address Mexico's critical housing and urban development needs.The NationalDevelopment Plan
(NDP) 2007-2012 aims to increase access to housingfor the poorest segments of the population
in an orderly, rational, and sustainable context.' The NDPemergedfrom the consultationsheldby
the federal government in 205 fora held in the second semester of 2006. The housingand sector
programs 2007-2012 are beingpreparedby the sector agencies.These programs will derive from
the NDP's mainstrategic objectivesdetailed below:

      0    Strengthen tenure securitythrough standardizing property registries, municipal cadastres,
           and rural registries as well as the mandatoryregistryof properties
      0    Increasecoverage and variety of availablehousing finance options
           Increasesupply of adequate land for housingconstructionand economic development
           Use existingurban infrastructuremore efficiently,
           Consolidatethe NationalHousingSystem
           Generate a dynamic usedhousing marketand assist the development of an efficient rental
           market
      0    Promote housing improvement and create conditions to foster progressive housing and
           social housing production through alternative financial products and support for the
           lower-incomepopulation.

3.         The proposed Third Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Reduction Development
Policy Loan (HUDPL IIJ will support a number of the new administration's priorities and
initiatives in the housing and construction sector. It consolidates and deepens the reforms
undertaken under the first and second loans, HUSAL-Iand HUDPL 11, which were approved in
April 2004 andNovember 2005, respectively.

4.         The Government of Mexico continues to demonstrate strong commitment and ownership
of the program. The Government has completed all key actions in its program which were
anticipatedbefore appraisal of the third loan.

5.      The components of the proposed loan drawPom strong technical analysis conducted by
the Bank and the Government of Mexico. Prior to HUSAL I,      two Bank reports-"A      Contribution
to an Urban Strategy for Mexico" (Report 22525-ME, July 2002), and "Low-Income Housing:
Issues   and Options"      (Report 22534-ME,        September 2002)-provided         the analytical
underpinnings of the initial design of the program. Since the approval of HUDPL 11, the program
has benefited from a number of analytical studies. These include "Decentralized Service Delivery
for the Poor" (Report No. 35692, 2006), "CGAP, Mexico: Country-level Savings Assessment"
(3d ed., March 2006), "Mexico Financial Sector Assessment Program Update" (Report No.
383 10, December 2006), and "Mexico 2006-2012: Creating the Foundations of Equitable
Growth" (Report No. 39993, 2007). These reports analyze the efficiency of public sector
programs and policies and stress the importance of housing and shelter as a key sector to help the
poor to access basic assets. The overall program has been designed based on the conclusions of
these studies.

6.      The proposed loan contributes to the objectives of the four pillars of the 200.5-2008
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), most recently discussed by the Board on February 6, 2007.
The CPS has four pillars designed to (i)reduce poverty and inequality, (ii)promote
environmental sustainability, (iii)increase Mexico's competitiveness, and (iv) strengthen the
country's institutions. The HUSAL/HUDPL series has resulted in better housing, basic services,
and access to real assets for low-and moderate-income households-key        aspects of poverty that
the loan would address by providing support for a national slum upgrading program and for new
land development and housing for low-income families. The project would enhance
competitiveness by increasingthe efficiency of housing and urban development, housing finance,
and property registries. In addition to providing shelter, many low- and moderate-income homes
contain microenterprises, and homeowners often build additional rooms to rent. Thus, housing
often serves as a key source of capital accumulation and is critical to build a strong middle class.
By supporting measures to reduce the housing system's reliance on inefficient public finance and
strengthenthe financial system, the loan would reducerisksto the federal government of bailouts
and would lower demand for Government support. Finally, the project would have a strong
environmental impact by improving conditions in slums and promoting formal development on
appropriate, well-designed sites.

                         Box 2. Good practiceconditionality principles

Principle 1:Reinforce ownership
The three-loan series was developed to support the National Housing and Urban Development
and Territorial Planning Sector Programs 2001-2006.These programs establishedclear priorities
derived from the National Development Plan 2001-2006, which took into account the results of
an extensive consultation process.The original program was designed as a three-loan series to be
completed in 2006. However, the Bank and GoM agreed to delay the third loan to 2007 to allow
sufficient flexibility and adapt to the priorities of the new administration, which took office in
December 2006. The proposed HUDPL I11 has a strong focus on housing subsidy reform,
increasing access to housing finance for the lower-income population, strengthening urban
property registries, and increasing the available options for adequate land for low-income
housing. These policy areas continue to be priorities for the new Government as defined by the
National Development Plan 2006-20 12 and have evolved from an important consultation process
held in2006.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other Jinancial partners on a
coordinatedaccountabilityframework
The reform program is summarized in the policy matrix, which includes clear objectives and
                                                  2

measurable key prior actions. During preparation of the second loan in the series, a set of
monitoring indicators agreed betweenthe Bank and GoM was included to improve the results
focus of the loan. Currently, boththe Bank andthe IADB support GoM in the housing and urban
sectors. In both cases, the programs have been derived from the national and sector programs,
thus providingconsistency of support. In particular, both institutions support the urban property
registries modernization scheme and the slum-upgrading program. The IFC also provides
important support to the housing sector reform program through expanding housingfinance for
the lower-incomesegments.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to
country circumstances
The entire reform program has been customized to the needs of a sophisticated middle-income
client like Mexico.The accompanying technical assistance loan (HUTAL) has provided cutting-
edge analytical work to GoM on issues includingthe design of a housing-price-riskdatabase and
the cost-benefit analysis of various modes of supply of urban land for low-income housing. The
politically sensitive issue of housing subsidy reform has been discussed through a subsidy
working group that consistsof all the principalstakeholders.The working group has beena useful
discussion forum for this gradual approach to generate consensus on operational efficiency
measuresapplicable inthe short term andto discuss medium-termstrategic options.

Principle4: Chooseonly actionscritical to achievingresults as conditionsfor disbursement
The original matrix contained a relatively large number of benchmarks and key prior actions in
the government's program (23 prior actions for HUSAL, 16 benchmarks and 6 prior actions for
HUDPL 11, and 19 benchmarks and 4 prior actions for HUDPL 111). During preparation of the
second operation, to improve its focus on results, this number was substantially reduced. The
remainingprior actions (5 of 6) are critical elements of the GoM's reformprogram. These actions
focus on reformingthe subsidy system, expanding the populationcoveredby the public registries
modernization scheme, expanding the options of housing finance available to the lower-income
population, and increasingthe available modesof landdevelopment for low-incomehousing.

Principle5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictable andpeflormance-
basedfinancial support
As agreed with GoM, this programmatic DPL series consists of three single-tranche operations
timed to the country's budget cycle, with each operation monitored for results. This process
enables a predictable release of the tranche during each fiscal year, allowing incorporation of
financing into the subsequentyear's budget. Startingwith HUDPL 11, the policy matrix includes a
set of indicatorsto closelymonitor results.


                                    11.COUNTRY CONTEXT

7.       The Mexican economy experienced a recovery of economic growth over the past three
years (2004-06). The growth accelerationwas supported by a favorable external environment in
terms of strong global economic growth, strong demand for Mexican manufactured goods,
internationalliquidity and access to external finance, and high internationaloil prices. Vigorous
economic activity has been broad-based and, as a result of clearly defined and consistently
implemented monetary and fiscal policies, has not led to the emergence of macroeconomic
imbalances. A deceleration in the pace of the global expansion and a slowdown of economic
activity in the United States have already weakened Mexico's recent growth performance. These
two factors should provide Mexicowith a major motivationto press ahead with more ambitious
effortsto tackle its own structural challenges and impedimentsto enhancedeconomic growth.

8.      Afer a highly contestedpresidential election, a new administration headed by President
Calderdn assumed office in December 2006 for a 6-year term and has begun to implement
reforms. Without a single party commanding an absolute majority in Congress, to secure
enactment of its legislative proposals, the administration must build a coalition among 2 of the 3
largest political parties. The federal public sector workers pension reform passed in March 2007
and the recently approved tax reform indicate the willingness and ability of the current
administration to create the necessary political support for its legislative agenda and reform
proposals.

Recent EconomicDevelopments

9.      The Mexican economy has experienced a period of a balanced and broad-based
expansion of economic activity. The average annual rate of economic growth over the past three
years, 2004-06, has been 3.8 percent. A vigorous global economic expansion contributed to the
enhanced growth performanceofthe Mexican economy. The nominal dollar value of total exports
increased at an annual rate of 15 percent during this period, in sharp contrast to the stagnation of
exports observed throughout the preceding 2001-03 recession. Economic growth accelerated in
2006 to 4.8 percent, even though seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter growth rates signal a
deceleration of the growth dynamics as of the second half of last year.

10.     Domestic credit is boostedby enhancedprice stability and a series of reforms in the legal
pamework of the financial sector. The financial savings held in domestic instruments (M4)
increased from 41.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to 54.9 percent in 2006. This upward trend has
enabled an important credit expansionto the private sector, in particular to households inthe form
of consumer credit and housing finance. The portfolio of credit to households increasedfrom 9.3
percent of GDP in 2000 to 14.1 percent in 2006. More recently, after an extended period of
decline, credit to private sector firms also has started to increase. Annual consumer price inflation
i s moving between 3 percent and 4 percent, the upper band of the medium-term inflation target
interval set by the monetary authorities. This enhanced price stability is deepening the financial
sector. Easing monetary policy conditions as of mid-2005 brought down short-term nominal
interest rates to 7.0 percent for most of 2006, with rates on longer term government paper at
approximately 8.0 percent. More recently, inflationary pressures stemming from international
price increases in grains and basic foodstuffs have caused monetary authorities to raise the short-
term ratesto 7.25 percent.

11.     Higher-than-budgeted oil and tax revenues allowed thepublic sector to increase current
and capital expenditures and, at the same time, post a modest fiscal surplus in 2006. Public
expenditure increased by approximately 1.2 percent of GDP, providing an additional impulse to
aggregate demand in 2006. At the same time, the public sector posted a fiscal surplus of 0.1
percent of GDP as fiscal deficit reduction continued to be a driving element of Mexico's budget
formulation and implementation. A balanced budget requirement is part of a federal budget and
fiscal responsibility law adopted in 2006. Regarding broader "public sector borrowing
requirements" that include off-budget spending, the Mexican public sector also has managed to
restrain its debt-financing requirements to approximately 1.O percent of GDP. The Mexican
public sector remains heavily dependent on oil revenue, which in 2006 made up 38 percent of
total public sector revenue. By comparison, non-oil-tax revenue remains at a modest 10 percent of
GDP.

Medium-TermMacroeconomicProspectsand Debt Sustainability

12.   Economic growth is slowing down to about 3-3.5 percent per year. Weaker external
demand, with the growth of export falling back to single digit rates, already slowed down GDP
                                                   4

growth as of the second half of 2006. A sharper-than-expected slowing of economic activity in
the U.S.is likely to hit Mexicoharderthan other countries and is an importantriskto the Mexican
economy. Despite a more generalized re-pricing of risk that has already been reflected in
Mexicanasset prices, there has beenno major issuewith Mexicanfinancial intermediariesgetting
introuble duringthe recent internationalliquidity and sub-prime mortgage crisis. The major risk
to Mexico in the wake of this financial crisis is the possibilityof a sharper downturn in the US.
businesscycle.

 13,   Tax reform has the potential to structurally enhancepublic finance, provide the resources
for additional public spending and reduce the dependence on oil revenue. Congress recently
adopted a tax reform that introduces an additional business tax levied on gross sales minus
purchase of inputs (including investments). The tax is aimed at closinga series of loopholes and
exemptions in the business tax legislation. At a rate of 16.5 percent initially, the tax is fully
creditable against the income tax at a rate of 28 percent but with a considerably smaller net
incometax base.Congressalso adoptedan increase inthe excisetax on gasoline and diesel by 5.5
percent of the final consumer priceover an 18-monthperiod.The additionalrevenuegeneratedby
the tax reform is currently estimated at 1.1percent of GDP in 2008 and 2.1 percent of GDP by
2013 compared to the current, total non-oil tax revenue of 10 percent of GDP. The additional
revenue should allow the public sector to maintain a balanced budget while facing additional
spending pressures in areas such as infrastructure investment needs, pensions and social
expenditures. Additional tax revenue should also reduce the vulnerability of public finance to a
suddendrop in oil revenuedue to falling oil prices or oil production.

 14.   Inflation is hovering around the upper limit of the medium-term inflation target.
Internationalprimary goods price increases (basic grains and dairy) have already moved annual
consumer price inflation towards the upper limit of the medium-terminflation target interval and
 led the monetary authorities to tighten monetary policy through a modest increase in short-term
 interest rates. Persistence in these external price pressures raises the possibility of higher short-
term interest rates which could have an adverse impact on investment demand and economic
activity with sectors such as constructionand housingparticularlysensitive to changes in interest
rates.

 15.   Despite a substantial increase in (explicit) public debt as of 2008 following the public
sector pension reform, the reform should enhance Mexico'sfiscal sustainability and commitment
to stay on a sustainable public debtpath. The reformto the federal civil service pension scheme,
adopted last March, will movethe scheme to a fully-fundeddefinedcontributionpension system,
a transitionaimed at rebalancingthe actuarialfairness of the benefits and strengthening long-term
fiscal sustainability. In order to accelerate the transition, the current generation of workers is
given the option to fully shift to the new system with a recognitionbond for their past services
turning the implicit pension debt into explicit public debt. Workers may opt for such a change
duringthe first halfof 2008. The amount of recognitionbondsto be emittedifall workers opt for
the new system is estimated at 18 percent of GDP. Even though the switching behavior of the
current generation of workers is unknown, the amount of (explicit) public debt and the public
debt-to-GDP ratio will increase significantlyby 2008. The temporary hike in the public debt-to-
GDP ratio shouldthus be perceived as a strengthening instead of a deviationof the government's
commitment to a decliningpublicdebt path.

16.      The construction industry and housing sector outperformed overall economic growth
throughout the recent period of economic expansion. The construction industry has shown a
vigorous expansion over the past few years,
outperforming overall economic growth. The                     Figure 1:GDP Total and Construction sector

expansion in 2004 and 2006, confirming its
strong     pro-cyclical       character.      Private
construction, which includes the housing
sector, makes up approximately 55 percent of
the total construction sector and has been the
driving force of the sector's performance.
However, in the first half of 2007, the
construction sector showed a moderation in
its rate of expansion. This slowdown is                                                                             I

17.      The domestic credit expansion and increased housing finance provide important and
                                                             continued impulses to housing construction.

managed to reduce their restructured mortgages so once again they are extending new housing
loans. The renewed interest of commercial banks in housing finance also led to the acquisition of
some SOFOLs by banks. These acquisitions further strengthened the rapid growth in the banks'
portfolios of non-restructuredhousing finance over the past two years.

18.      The efect of the US subprime mortgage crisis has so far been limited in Mexico. No
direct contagion effects have been visible so far. Indeed on September 25, 2007, the Government
of Mexico returned to the international capital markets for the first time since the subprime
problems started in July. GoM reopened its 2017 and 2034 sovereign bonds. The GoM raised
US$5OOm reopening of the UMS 2017 at a yield of 5.687 percent, a spread of 105bp over the
comparable U S Treasury. A simultaneous US$5OOm tap of the 2034s came at a yield of 6.122
percent, or a spread of 122bpover the 30-year UST.

19.      Within Mexico, the market for residential mortgage backed securities continues to be
robust. Mexico now has the largest RMBS market in Latin America with 42 deals since 2003

                                                        6

valued at US$4.4 billion. The latest issuance was done by GMAC Financiera for about MXNl.31
billion on July 27. In a recent report dated September 11, 2007, Standard & Poors'commented
that Mexico's RMBS market seems to be bucking the global trend of increasedvolatility. This is
due to a number of factors including: all securitized mortgage loans in Mexico now carry a fixed
rate, a valuable lesson the country took away from its Tequila Crisis in 1995, sound servicing
practices, improvements in federal and local regulations, and a solid mortgage product portfolio
that includes several features aimed at protecting borrowers from inflation and interest rate
volatility. Over-collateralization and external credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance
and full bond insurance are protecting investors againstthe credit risk involved.

20.       Nonetheless, the Mexican mortgage industry could derive some important policy lessons
JEom the subprime crisis. These would include the need for better appraisal norms, a
comprehensive supervisory network for mortgage originators, and effective regulations on
consumer information and disclosure.

        Box 3. Summary of the housing sector in Mexico and the HUDPL support
 The 2001-2006 National Housing programestimatedthe demand for housing - defined as the sum of
 new housingneeds from householdformation and the existing housingdeficit - as 1.129 million units
 per year. As much as 72 percent of this new housing corresponds to low-income housing for the
 population earning up to 5 M W (around US$ 680 per month), which represents around 65 percent of
 the total employedpopulationinMexico.

 The programacknowledgedthe low level of housing production during the recent past in Mexico (in
 2000 less than 300,000 housing units were producedin the formal market) and set a realistic goal to
 produce 750,000 housingsolutions (including acquisition and improvement) each year during the six-
 year period in order to avoid an increase in the housing deficit. The Fox administration met this goal.
 The new administrationhas expressed its intention of continuing support to the housingsector and has
 set an annual target of 1 million housingsolutions per year for the next six-year period.

 Since 2001 the GoM has made efforts to expand the housingoptions through: pure subsidy programs
 for the lower-income segment with income below -3 M W (Le. TU CASA), credit-linked subsidy
 programs(INFONAVIT, FOVISSSTE, PROSAVI and the new CONAVI's programEsta es tu Casa )
 for the population earningbetween-2.5 to 7 MW, and through programs to increase access to housing
 finance for the middle-income population (FOVI and SHF second -tier loans) for households with
 income between -3.5 to 8 MW. As a result of the latter the private sector has increased its share inthe
 housing market; although the sector is still dominated by public funding (INFONAVIT has a 65
 percent market share). The housing finance expansion has also been accompanied by improvements
 inthe loan portfolio; INFONAVIT has today a default rate of 4.8 percent and a coverage ratio of 322
 percent, FOVISSSTE recovered around US$ 300 million between January and June 2007 and
 FONHAPO has modified its mandate to include only subsidy provision (Le. no new lending) and has
 launchedasignificant recovery campaign.

 The proposed HUDPL I11 supports reforms to increase access to housing for the lower-income
 population in the formal and informal sectors. In particular the new Esta es tu Casa programtargets
 the populationearningbetween 1.5 to 5 MW and reformsto the existing up-front subsidy programare
 intended for the households earning up to 3MW. The new housing microfinance schemes, the
 ongoing slum upgradingprogram Hibitat and the pilot schemes for land development are intendedto
 address the housingconditions of the population between2 and 6 MW. Overall the key actions under
 the Governmentprogramsupportedunder the HUDPL I11target the populationmarkedinthe diagram

21.        The housing sector has seen a major expansion during the last six years. The number of
loans for housing and housing improvements more than doubled in this period, from 293,000 in
2001 to 689,000 in 2006. Although ,
housing loans are still dominated by the                          Figure 3: Number of new loansfor housing

increased its share gradually from 1
percent to 13 percent during the same
period. Between 2000 and 2005, the
system-wide mortgage portfolio grew 55
percent in pesos to reach 8.8 percent of
GDP.        This       was     an     important
achievement for Mexico, albeit still
small compared to comparator countries                        100  .............................................................

(for example, 15 percent in Chile, 65
percent in the US, and 45 percent in
Portugal). (Figure3 source: CONAVI)

22.        The institutional set-up also has improved. Until 2001, the federal government lackedan
effective vision of reform of the housing sector. Similarly, the federal agencies involved in
housing operated with neither an overall strategy nor coordination, and no agency had
responsibility for sector policy. Since 2001, GoM has graduallyconstructed a housing system in
which CONAVI acts as policy agency and main coordinator of the housingpolicy between the
other national housing agencies and the state governments. In June 2006, Congress approved a
new Housing Law that defines the National Housing System, strengthens CONAVI's role, and
incorporates other relevant sectors such as environment, transport, and finance in the policy
discussions.

Developments under the New MexicanAdministration

23.        The new administration continues to recognize the housing and urban development
sectors as a priority, with a strong emphasis on accessible housing finance for the poor and
sustainable city growth. The National Development Plan 2007-20 12 (NDP)3 includes several
strategic objectives for the housing and urban sectors. Those directly related to the issues
discussed are highlighted below. The housing and urban sector programs in which the specific
targets and instruments are defined are beingpreparedby CONAVI and SEDESOL, respectively,
and are expectedto be ready by the first week of December.

24.        Forthe housingsector, the main strategies defined inthe NDP are to:

      0    Strengthen tenure security through the standardization of property registries, municipal
           cadastres, andruralregistries as well as the mandatory registryof properties
      0    Increasethe coverage andvariety of housingfinance options available

Areas of Bank Support for the Government's Program

26.     The first loan of the three HUSAL/HUDPL series was approved in April 2004 and
supportedthe National Housing Sector Program 2001-2006 and the National Urban Development
and Territorial Planning Program 2001-2006. The program was complemented by the parallel
Housing and Urban Technical Assistance Loan (HUTAL) approved in November 2004. The
second loan of the series (HUDPL 11) was approved in October 2005. It was agreed with GoM
that the third loan, originally scheduled for 2006, would be delayed until 2007 to allow a policy
dialogue with the new administration, which came into office in December 2006.

27.     The proposed HUDPL I11 supports seven policy areas within the Government program.
The following paragraphsdescribe the HUSALand HUDPL I1 support to Government actions as
well as recent developments under the program ineach ofthese areas.

Policy Area 1: Macroeconomic Framework

28.      The GoMhas maintained a sound macroeconomicframework consistent with the policy
objectives of the program. As mentioned previously, during 2004-06, the Mexican economy
experienced a recovery of economic growth. The growth acceleration was supported by a
favorable external environment of strong global economic growth and strong demand for
Mexican manufactured goods, international liquidity and access to external finance, and high
international oil prices. A subsequent deceleration in global expansion and in US economic
activity has weakened Mexico's recent growth performance. Yet, these outside forces have
motivated Mexico to press ahead with more ambitious efforts to tackle structural challenges and
impediments to enhanced economic growth. Mexico's recent public pension and tax reform
should enhance the country's fiscal sustainability and commitment to stay on a sustainablepublic
debt path.

Policy Area 2: NationalHousingPoliciesand Institutions

Activities under the Government'sProgram Supportedby HUSAL and HUDPL II

29.      HUSAL sought to improve institutional coordination and increase transparency. One of
the programs supportedby the programmatic series primary objectives was to set a medium-term
strategy and develop the institutional coordination needed to address the challenges facing the
housing sector. Previously, several agencies had been responsible for various housing policies
and programs, with no clear strategic vision of who was responsible for coordinatingthem. With
Bank support through HUSAL I,the Government harmonized and defined the roles of federal
housing agencies by creatingthe NationalHousingCommission of CONAFOVI (now CONAVI)
to be responsible to define the sector policy and coordinateGovernment efforts.CONAFOVIwas
to coordinate the Federal Mortgage Corporation (SHF); the Low-Income Housing Fund
(FONHAPO); and, to some extent, INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE, the two Housing Funds
serving the private and the public sector employees, respectively.In addition, the Government
created the Consejo Nacional de Vivienda, a permanent consultation forum, to promote the
dialogue between private and public stakeholders. Of equal importance was improving
transparency in the sector-a        responsibility also assigned to CONAVI in the national housing
plan-through annual reports on policy implementationand informationon related programs that
would be available to the public on Internet4 HUSAL Ialso supported an Environmental
Assessment ofthe housingsector.

30.      CONAVI has made clear efforts to decentralize housing policy. Together with the state
governments,the commissiondesigned an instrumentto define annual new housingrequirements,
investment amounts, and policy goals for federal housing f~nding.~These agreements, together
with strengthening state housing institutes, will contributeto effective decentralizationof housing
programs. HUTAL is supporting the development of a modelto modernize and strengthen state
and local housing institutesand that later can be usedto design a comprehensive modernization
programthat will be partlyco-fundedwith the States.

3 1.     HUDPL 11supported CONAV I Sprogress in creating state housing councils. CONAVI
has been establishing state housing councilsto strengthen the housing sector throughout Mexico
and to alignhousingpoliciesat different levels of government. The agency helpedcreate 27 State
housing councils (today 31 state councils have been created). The loan also supported
implementation of the environmental action plan derived partly as a result from the
environmental assessment preparedunder HUSAL. For housingthis planincludeddevelopingthe
sector's first "Green Guidelines" - a set of guidelines on water, solidwaste, and energy resources
management establishing alliances among agencies working on sustainable housingdevelopment.
CONAVI initiated a pilot program for green housing design and signed an accord with the
National Water Commission, Trust Fund for Electrical Energy Savings, National Forest
Commission, Mexican Construction Industry Association, and National Industry Association of
HousingDevelopmentandPromotion.

Recentprogress under theProgram and Prospectsfor the Sustainabilityof Reforms

32.      Since the approval of HUDPL 11 GoM has made signiJicant improvements in the
institutionalfiamework of the sector. Startingin 2004, INFONAVIT has taken steps to reform its
operations and increasetheir financial sustainability. It has improvedtheir corporate governance

and financial management, targeting lower-middle-incomehouseholds, increasing the portability
of beneficiaries' savings, and allowing those savings to leverage other available funds.
FOVISSSTE, although lagging behind relativeto INFONAVIT, has also made important efforts
regardingloanrecovery.

33.         A new Housing Law was approved in June 2006.6 It renamedCONAFOVI as CONAVI
(Comisidn Nacional de Vivienda). The new law strengthened CONAVI's mandate as policy
coordinator, clarified its role relativeto other federal agencies, and increasedits coordinationand
policymakingpowers. The law promotes community and private sector participation in housing
and allows for better coordination between housing and urban issues.' The new law contains two
important changes from the previous law. It "institutionalizes" and strengthens CONAVI by
incorporatingits role and responsibilities in the law, which cannot be easily changed or revoked
as a mandate; and grants it autonomy from SEDESOL.

34.         At the same time the new Housing Law provides a more comprehensive institutional
setting for the sector. It incorporates a governing body within CONAVI in which the Energy,
Economy, Water, Transport, Environment,and Finance Secretariats all participate in formulating
the sector programs. This joint planning is important since the rapid expansion in the sector in
some cases has occurred without consideration of infrastructure-provision or access to job
centers. In addition, the new law incorporates mechanisms for subsidy targeting in line with the
Social Development Law issued by the Fox administration.8The new law includes mandatory
considerations of environmental best practice for the sector as well as access to informationand a
monitoring indicators system. In accordance with the new law, CONAVI will prepare the
National Sector Program 2007-2012, which is expected to be ready in December 2007 This
programwill providethe mainlines of actionsupportingthe above-describedprioritiesof the new
administrationfor the housingsector (See Box 4 below).

35.         Direct lending by FONHAPO has been stopped. In the past, FONHAPO acted as the
primary Government institution providingfunds for low-incomehousing. After it recovered from
near bankruptcy, its role as a lendinginstitutionwas revised. As an importantfirst step, inAugust
2004, FONHAPOeliminated direct lendingbut continued its second-tier lendingto state housing
finance agencies (OREVIs) which could jeopardize its hard-won financial independence and
undermine the Government's strategy of promoting market-rate lending.' In January 2007,
FONHAPO's finances were revisedby the fund trustees, and a new mandate was approved that
eliminated all lending activities. FONHAPO is now mandated to focus solely on operating the
non-credit-linked,up-frontsubsidy program, Tu Casu.

        latter component is a major departure from the Federal Housing Law of 1984, which focuses on the state's role in housing
construction, management, and distribution.
  i.e. subsidies have to be targeted to the poor as defined by SEDESOL, have to differentiate between income levels, should be
establishedwith equity criteria, procedures for their operationshouldbetransparent and with afixed time for execution
  FONHAPO lends at an interest rate of 8 percent to OREVIS and other intermediaries such as Cajas. OREVIS can provide
government transfers as guarantees.FONHAPO's loan portfolio is relatively small and shrinkingfast in real value. In addition, most
of the revenuefrom its loanportfolio goes to support its administrativecosts, leaving little for below-market-rateloans.

36.       Other important efforts to improve the institutionalpamework are thepreparation of the
Strategic Environmental Assessment of the Sector and the development of a Construction Code.
In January 2007, CONAVI started the process of conducting a strategic environmental

assessment (SEA) that would serve as a master plan that would include environmental
considerations in its policies and programs in coordination with SENER ( Ministry of Energy),
CONAGUA (NationalWater Commission), IMTA (MexicanInstitutefor Water Technology) and
SEMARNAT (Environment and Natural Resources Secretariat). In addition, CONAVI
announced that CONAVI would finance the SEA and that the contributions of SENER,
CONAGUA, IMTA, and SEMARNAT would be requested. Additionally, CONAVI is
developinga federal constructioncode that will provide a framework for the standardization and
continuous update of the existing local constructioncodes. These efforts are expected to translate
to a decrease in the exposure to natural disasters and to foster the housing insurance market in
Mexico. CONAVI has requested HUTAL support for the stages of the preparation and
implementationofthe code.

37.     Important challenges lie ahead. Most important is to create effective linkages between
the housing sector and urban planningto avoidthe expected continuous expansion of the housing
sector. These linkages should translate to sustainable city growth and increasedquality of life for
the population. The GoM is already exploring which institutional changes will be necessary to
move to this direction and has requested Bank support in the form of an in-depth institutional
analysis of the sector to better address the needs of the poor in both housing and urban issues
throughthe HUTAL.

38.     The housing sector in Mexico continued to expand in 2006. The GoM's efforts to
increasethe housing solutions (including subsidies and loans) to the populationearning4 MW or
less are reflected in the 35 percent increase in the number of solutions for this income segment.
Relative to the overall sector, this figure remains below 50 percent. The new subsidy program
was launched in 2007. The continued efforts from the ONAVIs to address the lower-income
populationshould increasethe proportionof unitstargeted for the lower-incomesegment.

Policy Area 3: Improvingthe Housing Subsidy System

Activities under the Government'sProgramSupportedby HUSAL andHUDPL II

39.     Mexico's housing subsidy system has been fragmented into different agencies and
programs.Overalltwo importantgroups of programscan be identified:

    0   On-budgetsubsidies. Over the last 5 years, Mexicohas operatedthroughFONHAPOtwo
        small-scale housing subsidy programs-PROSAVI and Tu Casu-with a total budget in
        2006 of US$270million.

    0   Off-budget indirect interest-rate subsidies.The bulk of Mexico's housing subsidies come
        in the form of below-market interest rates provided primarily by INFONAVIT. In May
        2005, the subsidy working group agreed on a methodology to measure the implicit
        subsidy levels of INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE loans. In 2006 this type of subsidy
                                                 14

           providedby INFONAVIT amounted to approximately US$2billion." INFONAVIT and
           FOVISSSTE grantedthe highest subsidies on a per-creditbasis, approximately US$8,000
           andUS$l1,000 per borrower, respectively. Although all formal employees pay intothese
           pension funds, subsidies had gone mainly to the moderate-income households that can
           afford the mortgage payments associatedwith the purchase of a finished, commercially-
           built unit until INFONAVIT started important efforts to address the below-4MW
           affiliates.

40.        HUSAL supported Government efforts to unifr housing subsidies. The National Housing
Program 2001-2006 defined FONHAPO as the operating agency for the main federally funded
subsidy programs, Tu Casa and PROSAVI. With the goal of consolidating housing subsidy
policies, HUSAL Ialso supportedthe creation of FONAEVI. In addition, the loan helped create
and supportedthe multi-agencyworking group under CONAFOVIthat was formed to consolidate
subsidy objectives and programs and continuously refine them. The loan also helped create and
support a database within FONHAPO that contains beneficiaries of Tu Casa and PROSAVI-a
first step toward achievinga more equitable system in which no recipientreceives more than one
housingsubsidy.

41.        A key action in the Government's program that was implemented before HUDPL 111was
completion of a comparative analysis of the housing subsidies received by different income
groups from all the major subsidy programs-both                          on-budget federal programs and implicit
subsidy programs.'* This study raised important concerns about the objectives of different
programs, their beneficiary groups, the methods used to determine subsidies, and the need to
adjust subsidies over time. It also showed how limited are the data on the different programs and
on local contributions, and the negative effect that the lack of data has on their targeting,
coordination, and adjustment. The study identified several procedural bottlenecks that limit the
availabilityof both federal subsidy programsto reachtheir target populations. The working group
reached agreement on key procedural reforms to address these, which were applied starting
2006.13Basedon the findings of the study, more detailed assessments of Tu Casa and PROSAVI
are needed to determine how they can improve their interactions with private actors and
subnational governments, leverage household contributions, and reach low-income groups and
informalsector workers. CONAFOVI hastaken steps to conduct such assessments.

42.        As part of the efforts to reform the subsidy system, the subsidy working group was
reconvened and expanded to discuss thefindings of the study and made some key decisions. The
working group met in May and June 2005 and reached important agreements on adjusting
calculations of amounts of implicit housing subsidies and reducinginequities in current subsidy
programs.The group agreed on a methodologytoI4:

      0    Align the subsidy amounts received by the households with recipients' income across
           programs



11The estimateof total subsidies is calculatedas the sum of the net presentvalue of the implicit interestrate subsidy for the life of
all INFONAVIT loans originated in 2000 (using the Governmentbond rate as discount rate). The implicit interest rate subsidy was
estimated as the difference between the rate offered on a standard mortgage and the interest rate offered by MFONAVIT by income
segment.,
'IConductedby Grupode Economistasy Asociados (GEA)
'IChanges include simplified procedures for approval of subsidies, new provisions to share electronic information on beneficiaries
and loans with SHF, and incorporatingways to better promotethe program, includingefforts to make financial institutions other than
SOFOLs (such as banksand cajas-credit unions) participatein the PROSAVIprogram.
  It is worth notingthat INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE are among the institutions committed to these agreements.This is important
since these institutions are the largest market players and subsidy providers, and so set the pace and direction for other market
participants-particularly with respectto the housingproductsdeliveredby private developers.

                                                                 15

Recentprogress under theProgram andprospectsfor the sustainabilityof reforms

43.       In September 2006, the transition team prepared a discussion paper on affordable
housing called Programa de Vivienda para Hogares Desatendidos. The paper set out a
comprehensive package of subsidy programs focused on the below-median (5MW) income
groups inbothurbanandruralareas. The GoM wanted to establish a clear distinctionbetween:

          Subsidies linked to mortgage- and microcredit for housing, whether issued by private/
          nonprofit lenders, by INFONAVIT or FOVISSSTE, or by other public lenders

          Subsidies not linked to credit but rather tied to local Government contributions for land
          and infrastructure(or, as is beingdiscussed, to localgovernment credit).

44.       Subsidies will be conditional upon regulatory and institutional improvements at the local
government level (densiJication, modernization of property registration). Programa de Vivenda
includes programs for bothrural and urban housing, new and used housing, home improvement,
andprogressive construction. The program includesbothprivateandpublic 1e11ders.l~

45.       The new administration sets as a main priority to improve housing conditions for the
lower-income population by expanding access to housing finance through a new subsidy
program. The National DevelopmentPlan sets the goal of 6 million loans for housing acquisition
and improvement during 2007-2012. To this end, GoM recognizedthe need to expand access to
housing finance for the population earning 5MW or less, emphasizing those not served by the
nationalhousing funds. With this in mind, the Government launched a new credit-linkedsubsidy
program with a drastically expanded budget allocation of US$380 million for 2007.16 The new

The operational rulespublishedby CONAVI describe the specific objectives ofEsta es tu Casa:

    0   Increase access to (mortgage- and housing micro) credit and co-financing to lower-
        income population
    0   Support capacity of low-incomehouseholdsto builduphousingequity

        ways for them to usetheir accumulatedwealth or savings,

    0   Improve quality of life of the people by enhancing housing conditions and urban
        environment
    0   Promote production of social housing, and self-constructiordproduction of housing in
        sustainable urbanandrural conditions.

46.     As expected, INFONAVIT brought the program on line fast. It could qualify a larger
proportionof its below 2.6MW individual/4MWhouseholdmemberswith the combinationof up-
front subsidy and interest rate subsidy. It already had a pipeline of developer projects for its
"economic house. Through June 2007, the housingfund disbursedmore than 20,000 subsidies (of
which 8,000 had already been approved in 2006 as part of the credit-linked subsidy program
operatedby FONHAPO).

47.      The response of theprivate mortgage sector has been slower. It disbursedjust over 250
subsidies through June 2007, including loans under the cojnanciamento arrangement with
INFONAVIT. Most private lenders did not have a pipeline of low-incomehousing developments
that they could tap. During the last few years, the old PROSAVI subsidy program had seen
sharply reduced allocations, and lenders had moved to other market segments. Additionally,
several lenders hadexperiencedhigher defaults onthe portfolio of first-time credit users andwere
cautious to expandtheir exposure to this market segment. More important, however, some major
SOFOLs voiced concerns about program parameters (for example, relative to MFONAVIT's
potential for market expansion under the program) and program profitability. They had this
responsedespite several concessionson pricingof SHF financial products available to the private
lenders, includingits mortgage insurance, liquidity lending, and financialguarantees.

48.     Additional concerns are the lack of incentivesfor the development of formal lower-cost
housing solutions for INFONAVIT and hence the other developers, and the inequity between
formal and informal sector low-incomeworkers under the program. Last, the microcredit for the
housing sector is new and still has to develop the systems for responsible subsidy allocation
linkedto home-improvementcredit. InAugust 2007, CONAVI and SHF revisitedand fine-tuned
the Esta es tu Casa program to balancethe differentdemands for program change by private and
non-privatelenders.

49.     The mortgage-linked subsidies to private lenders rightfully focus on down-market
expansion of private mortgage providers (includingthroughthe mortgage insurance program), in
particular,for informallyemployed/noninsuredworkers. Inaddition, the cofinanciamento subsidy
arrangement expands access to formal sector lowedmiddle income customers. The mortgage-

                                               17

linked component certainly has a distributional objective. However, the goal of private market
strengtheningand expansionis of equal importanceto reduce future needs for such deep subsidies
at this middleAower middle income level. A detailed descriptionof the Esta es tu Casu scheme is
included inappendix 3 along with an assessment preparedby the Bank.

50.      The Esta es tu Casu scheme incorporates targetingmechanisms to increase transparency
and reduce the possibility of benefitingthe higher income population. The scheme's operational
rules mandate that the entity operating the program- SHF - implements a beneficiary's database
against which all applications are validatedto avoid duplicating benefitsto the same household.
The originalprogram rules gavethe financial intermediary providingthe loan the responsibilityto
check payment capacity with respect to income level and did not cap the household income
directly. Instead, they set amaximumhouse value to be supported by the program. However, this
was deemed as leavingsome space for non-poor households benefitingfrom the subsidy program.
To minimize this risk, a revisionof the rules was published in August 2007 which includes a cap
on individual (or household) income of the potential beneficiaries:5 MW for informal workers
and2.6 MW for ONAVIS's affiliates.

5 1.     The program rules of the non-credit-linked subsidy program-Tu                                Casu-have been
revised to better align with the Esta es tu Casu scheme and to gradually incorporate the lessons
learnedfrom the impact evaluation. SEDESOL, through FONHAPOwill continue to implement
the non-credit-linkedsubsidy programs, Tu Casu and Vivienda Rural, with local governments.
SEDESOL and FONHAPOmodifiedthe operational rules for the Tu Casu programto better align
with the new Esta es tu Casu program. The main modifications include (a) lowering the
maximum house value eligible to be su ported by the program, which now is intended as
progressive housing to MXP lOO,0OO1' and (b) increasing the allocated subsidies for
improvement to 70 percent from their average of previous years of 30 percent. The latter is a
direct response to the mixed results obtained from the impact evaluation by the Bank of the
finishedhousingandthe positive impact onthe home improvement modalities.

52.      An important evaluation of the subsidy system is beingprepared withparticular focus on
implementation of subsidy policy at local level and should serve as the first evaluation of the
reforms to the subsidy system. An additional subsidy evaluationto the one developed in 2005 is
beingconducted by a consultant contracted by CONAVI. This study will include an analysis of
the Esta es tu Casu program launched this year with a strong emphasis on the implementation
issuesat local level.

53.      Looking ahead, the two main concerns about the sustainability and deepening of subsidy
reforms relate to the design of Esta es tu Casu. First, the housing funds may not have an
incentive to provide a lower-costhousing option than the MX180,000 "economic" house, which,
with the additionalup-frontsubsidy, can be acquiredby households earning as low as 1.5MW.As
it has done inthe past, this will effectively put a floor in the formal low-incomehousing market.
Second, there remains a major equity discrepancy between informalworkers and insuredworkers
of the same income group. The Bank team has recommendedto GoM that, moving ahead, the
housing funds use this additional up-front subsidy for their lowest-income workers to decrease
the internalhigh cross-subsidy on interest rates, increase the savings rate on members' accounts,
and focus on lower-costhousing solutions. The Esta es tu Casu program could trigger a gradual
levelingofthe mortgage market across the housingfunds and privatelenders.

54.       Given the macroeconomic situation, a slight increase in interest rates (25-50 bp) is likely
as a result of recent increases in food-stufs                  and gas. The exact impact on long-termmortgage
rates is relatedto inflationaryexpectations. Since the new subsidy program is operatedthrough an
up-front grant linked to a loan (at market-rate interest rates), a possible consequencecould be a
reductionin the number of subsidies delivered as a result of the increase in the average monthly
paymentsfor the same housingunit.

55.       The number and amount of subsidies have increased yearly since 2004. In contrast, the
market interest rates have decreased substantially. (See figure 5). More importantly, the ratio of
subsidies for the lower-incomepopulationhas increaseddue to INFONAVIT's explicit policy of
financing low-incomehouseholds andto operational improvementsinthe Tu Casu program made
in 2005. Although the market is 'still
dominated by the implicit subsidies grantedby                           Figure 6: Reference Interest Fates, 2004--2006
the ONAVIS, the number of up-frontsubsidies
has increased to 13 percent. Although still                          20 1 -
low, this figure is up from the previous level.                     77.5 .........\.
The GoM expects this ratio to increase                                                  - -
substantially as Esta es tu Cam progresses.
The number of beneficiaries who receive more
than 1 subsidy has increased due to the
INFONAVIT beneficiaries (earning below 2                                                     2005 -t-2006          2004

MW) who in 2006 also received an up-front
grant from the PROSAVIprogram. This issue
remains a challenge for the new subsidy
system due to strong pressure from the ONAVIS to access budget resources for housing
subsidies. Looking ahead, CONAVI can use the new subsidy scheme to request a gradual shift
from implicit toward up-frontgrants from ONAVIS. (Figure 5, source: CONAVI)

PolicyArea 4: HousingFinance

Activities under the Government'sProgram Supported by HUSAL I and HUDPL 11

 56.    HUSAL Isupported Congressionalapproval of mortgage-related reforms. These reforms
strengthened the legal framework for mortgages (cre`dito hipotecario). The reforms allowed
adjudication of defaulted mortgage liens in federal courts, simplified documentation requiredto
prove the existence of a lien, and allowed extrajudicial foreclosure of collateral trusts. They also
 increasedtransparency by providingstandardized, clear, comparative informationand contracts to
borrowers.Inaddition, SHF issuedrules for licensingpropertyappraisers.

 57.     The loan also supported the expansion of housing credit tools and products. HUSAL I
supported SHF efforts to design and implement a database for mortgage risk assessment and to
expand its products to includerefinancingand guarantees in both UDIs2'and pesos. In addition,
the first loan included actions to launch new savings programs by BANSEFI for low- and
moderate-incomehouseholds linkedto loans from INFONAVIT and subsidies from Tu Casa.

 58.     Under HUDPL I,SHF launched apilot program providing housing microjinance (HMF).
In January 2005, SHF's board of directors approved up to 150,000,000 pesos (approximately
US$14 million) for a pilot projectto providemicrofinancefor home improvementsthrough 2 or 3
 SOFOLs. Under the home improvement program, SHF offered short-term funds to a few
financial intermediaries for credits of up to MXP 30,000 with tenors of 24 months. The program
did not have a great impact due to four reasons:

              a)    The selectedintermediaries did not needthe SHF subsidy.
              b) The selectedintermediaries were concentratedon other tasks. (Compartamoswas
                    inthe processof transformingitself into a bank).
              c)    Ignoranceofthe market.
              d) Lackof a full range of products.

Recentprogress under the Program andprospectsfor the sustainability of reforms

59.     SHF has radically altered its business model by focusing on the affordability challenge:
for the close to 46 percent of the households in semi-urban areas can not afford to pay a
mortgage. SHF's new strategy focuses on (i)operating the federal subsidy programs to provide
loans for the lower-incomesegments, (ii) expanding the affordability solutions by expanding the
microfinance market, (iii)promotingefficiency in the market, and (iv) promoting the supply of
social housingin a sustainable urban environment. These new priorities represented an important
shift from SHF's traditional operations as a mortgage lending fund provider. Entering the
microfinance market has required a fundamental shift in SHF's business model, operating
mechanismsand financial structure to accommodatethe new risk structure associatedwith micro-
lendingand a much larger and varied set of clients with different institutionalcapacity (including
microfinance institutions, local governments, NGO's as well as SOFOLs and Banks). SHF is
successfully moving into this new model as evidenced by its recent institutional restructure and
by the agreements signed by its Board of Directors to work with micro-lending institutions
movingforward from the originalpilot scheme into a more streamlinedapproach.

60.     Since mid-2006, SHF has mainstreamed different approaches to housing microfinance
with a number of different intermediaries, such as Entidades de Ahorro y Cre`dito Popular



"Mexico'sinflation-adjustedunitofaccount.
                                                 20

(EACPs such as Sociedades Financieras Populares, or SOFIPOS) and Cajas Populares. The
institutional market for housing microfinance (HMF) can be considered to include the Banca
Popular (BP) institutions, that is, the Cajas and the deposit-takingMFIs, or SOFIPOs. Over the
past few years, the HMF sector in Mexico has seen a trend of migrating away from offering a
single product to offering multiple products. The market leaders (such as Credit0 y Casu or
Finpatria) are all developingproducts for home improvement with greater amounts and lower
rates than traditional microfinance products. In addition, selected SOFOLs that are expanding
their mortgage lending(or consumer SOFOLs that are entering mortgage lending) down-market
relative to their current target clientele also show interest in these products. Compartamos, a
microfinance bank, is testing an HMF product. A recent survey of 112 BP entities found that
approximately one-third offered some type of housing product. Two-thirds of all housin loans
hadterms between36 and 60 months, andthe average annual interestrate was 23 percent.                                   8

61.        From the perspective of SHF's product line, the HMF financial intermediaries can be
divided intwo groups:

     a)    Those that offer products of short-term consumption loans, such as SOFIPOS and
           SOFOLs. This group is interested in (i) (ii)portfolio guarantees for microcredit,
                                                                 funds,
           (iii)subsidies,and(iv)technicalassistance.

     b) Those that are focused primarily on long-term capacity building of their members and
           provide credit for a maximum of 5 years. Examples are Cajas Populares and SCAPS
           (Sociedades Cooperativas de Ahorro y Prkstamo). This group is interested in (i) long-
           term funds, (ii)technicalassistancefor product development, and (iii)subsidies for home
           acquisition.

62.        SHF Housing Microjnance Products: SHF now has four distinct product lines either
under implementationor under development:

     a) Short-termfunds: The standardproduct is for up to 24 months. The main challenge is the
           verificationofthe final-use of funds.

     b) Long-term funds: Cajas Populares are interested in long-term funds but require
           assistance in product development. Additionally, small cajas would find it difficult to
           come up with their 20 percentshare ofthe credits (under the scheme of sharedrisks).

     c) Portfolio guarantee for housing microjnance: SHF is working with the Bank (under a
           fee-for-servicecontract) to set up a portfolio guarantee scheme for HMF. These models
           are fairly popular in microfinance and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)
           financing for two reasons. They reduce the administrative costs of the guarantee
           mechanism, and induce expansionof portfoliosthat otherwise would be limited by access
           to funding or perceived risk in new market segments. The main feature of portfolio
           guarantee models is that they reduce the participation of the guarantor in the loan
           approval process and defer to the lender the choice of individual loans to include in the
           portfolioto be guaranteed.




22 BANSEFI, Strategic Planning. Unpublished, 2007. On the (ultimate) demand side, a survey ofjust over 2,000 households/clients
of the BP sector indicated that approximately 17 percent of the households had applied for some type of housing loan (building,
expansion, remodeling). Ofthese applicants, alargemajority had appliedto BP institutions, while only about 5 percent hadsubmitted
applicationsto banksor SOFOLs.
                                                              21

     d) Card-based housing microjhance payment platform. A card-based platform is a
         technology-driven system that connects borrowers who wish to use funds obtained for
         home improvement and extension to suppliers o f the necessary building materials. This
         platform has the potential to help scale up the provision o f housing microfinance in
         Mexico. The platform also could sustainably reduce the interest rates charged on housing
         micro-loans through reducing certain costs and by standardizing key elements o f the
         current micro or consumer lendingprocess.

63.      Tofully scale up and mainstream housing microjnance in Mexico, two main challenges
remain. First, microfinance interest rates in Mexico are generally much higher compared to
poorer countries such as Bolivia and Peru. Mexico's higher rates can be attributed to a lack o f
viable competition inthe sector. Despite the existence o f many institutions, microfinance services
only reach a very small number o f clients. The estimated market penetration is less than 10
percent overall: demand far exceeds supply. Switching to a broad-based, card-based payment
system would lessen administrative expenses so should impact lending rates. Nonetheless,
clearly, the focus o f public policy in this context over the medium term should be to encourage
and facilitate a larger number o f private players to enter the market while ensuring prudential
regulation o f the sector. Second, HMF needs to be tightly integrated with the general housing
subsidy policy. For example, through its Home Improvement Program, SHF could develop a
network o f suppliers and incentivize the organizations to give micro-loans in clusters, using a
common technological platform. Similarly, inthe program o f subsidies for acquisition o f serviced
lots, private developers could be linked through one microfinance institution. SHF could develop
a competitive allocation system for subsidies tied to microfinance loans (MFLs) based on rates
and credit risk performance.

64.      SHF continues to increase the amount o f mortgage financing to the low- and middle-
income population as shown in the table. This figure takes into account only those SOFOLs that
receive SHF funding. However, since 2003, the strong growth o f banks and SOFOLs has been
funded by diverse sources other than SHF. As mentioned, the SHF-financed micro-loans have yet
to increase to rates comparable to the mortgage loans. SHF expects to foster this segment by
introducingnew products, such as guarantees.

Policy Area 5: Urban Property Registriesand Rights

Activities under the Government'sProgram Supportedby HUSAL and HUDPL 11

65.     Since 2001, the Government of Mexico has prioritized the importance of property rights
in market development and social stability. In 2003 GoM launched a project to strengthen
property registries. Under it, CONAVI provides matching funds (to the states' contribution) to
analyze and reform its institutional and legal frameworks for property registries and rights;
reengineer the processes and work flows of its property registries to reduce approval time,
increase efficiency and accuracy, and reduce costs; shift from manual entry of transactions to
electronic folios of properties; digitize historical data for electronic storage; permit remote
consultation ofthe registries; and link state registries to municipalcadastresto unify information.

66.      Thefirst loan supported the consensus on the content of the modernization model and its
implementation in two states. CONAVI and SHF developed an integral and dynamic model
defining the characteristics that property registries must implement to develop a modern
organization and deliver adequate services. The adopted model makes use of best international
practices, including the main elements for a modern legal framework, efficient and effective
managerial tools, simplified procedures, and a modern information technology platform. The
model represents a consensus on the main characteristics of property registries modernization
agreed among the main public and private stakeholders. They include CONAVI, SHF, SOFOLs,
the national property registries association, the national notaries association, and the banks
association. The Property RegistryModernizationProgramwas implementedinthe states of Baja
CaliforniaandColima.

67.     As implementation of the model in other states continued, CONAVIand SHF continued to
develop tools to evaluate property registries. Two additional tools have been developed by
CONAVI and SHF. A baselinemethodology to identifythe characteristicsof propertyregistries in
terms of the model determines the gap between the baseline and the model, and monitors the
advances to adopt the model. In addition, a methodology to digitalize property records has been
defined.

68.      HUDPL IIpromoted the implementation of modernization agreements infive additional
states. By October 2005, CONAVI had signed agreements with San Luis Potosi, Hidalgo,
Michoacan, Sonora, and Distrito Federal-one morethan agreedinthe policy matrix.

69.     As part of CONAVI'Sefforts, modernization agreements continued with more states.
During initial program preparation, it was envisaged that by the time of the third operation under
the program all 32 states would have entered into agreements with CONAVI to modernize their
property registries. Given the speed at which negotiations occur and the voluntary nature of the
program, in 2005 the Bank andthe GoMjointly decidedthat it was unlikely that this target would
be met before HUDPL 111.A more feasible approachwould focus on the most populatedstates to
impact the largest share of the population.The milestone of modernizationof property registries
in all states was modified to at least 18 states covering at least 80 percent of Mexico's urban
populationwho could take advantage of the program benefits. Section V describes how this key
prior action has beenmet andthe additional activities undertakenby GoMto expand the scope of
the modernization program.

70.         CONAVI continues the expansion of the public registries modernization program.
Overall, 18 states coverin                74 percent o f the urban population have signed modernization
agreements with CONAVI.23

71.         The new administration fully supports the advances made through the modernization
program operated by CONAVI and SHF, and has decided to expand the efforts to incorporate
cadastre and rural registries. To achieve the important objective put forward in the National
Development Plan to bring "certainty to property rights through the homologation o f public
registries," in March 2007, the new administration launched a new program. It is called
Lineamientos para la aplicacion del Programa de Modernizacion de Registros Publicos 2007
and has an allocated budget o f US$40 million. This program builds on the model developed by
CONAVI and SHF and supported by the DPL series as the standard institutional arrangements
that all property registries in Mexico should attain. The new program assigns federal funds to co-
finance modernization plans and gives the leading role to the Secretaria de Gobernacih and
technical participation o f CONAVI and SHF. Access to federal funds provides the necessary
incentives to the states as well as necessary technical support. At the same time, it fosters the
adoption o f internationally recognized good practices for adequate property registries'
institutional organization and service delivery.

72.          Monitoring indicators. It was agreed that CONAVI would periodically track the time
required to register a property in each state that has signed a property registry modernization
agreement. However the methodology to estimate this indicator has changed several times so is
not comparable over time. SHF has developed baseline indicators that will measure progress in
each state. This information will identify useful indicators to systematically measure progress.

PolicyArea 6: National Urban Policy, Slum Upgrading, and Institutional Strengthening

Activities under the Government'sProgram Supported by HUSAL and HUDPL 11

73.        HUSAL I supported several activities to improve the institutional set-up to alleviate
urban poverty. First, information on urban development became more widely available. One o f
the key prior actions for HUSAL Iwas the approval o f the National Urban Development and
Territorial Planning Policy 2001-2006. As part o f its commitment to transparency, GoM
mandated the publication o f an annual report on policy implementation and provision o f
information on related programs through the internet. Second, the new urban development
program established that all social programs be targeted to poor areas. Third, SEDESOL prepared
poverty maps for this purpose, and to improve the sustainability o f urban policies, conducted an
environmental assessment o f urban areas.

74.        In 2003 the Government combined various physical and social interventions in slums
under an umbrellaprogram called Habitat approved andfunded by Congress and operated by
SEDESOL. Habitat became the Government's flagship program to address slum-upgrading needs
in an integrated manner. Habitat provides grants for slum-upgrading projects in predefined areas
(Poligonos) that are matched by counterpart funds from local government^.^^ Habitat finances the
development o f self-diagnosis and action plans for comprehensive medium-term barrio (slum)


'' The   States are: Sonora, Baja California, Colima, Michoacan, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, Tamaulipas, Distrito Federal,
Guanajuato, Estadode Mexico, Sinaloa, Morelos, Quintana Roo, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Queretaro, Zacatecas and Guerrero.
*`Poligonosarepredefined      by SEDESOL as geographical areas where more than SO percent of the population is below the poverty
line. In almost all cases,poiigonos are smaller than the political boundariesof a municipality.
                                                                    24

upgrading. On the physical side, Habitat finances detailed engineering plans for infrastructure
projects; and invests in urban infrastructure including water, sewerage, storm drainage, paved
access roads, electricity, street lighting, community facilities, and solid waste management.

75.       A key Government action that HUDPL 11 supported was to strengthen community
participation within the Habitat Program to avoid the program's being transformed into one
more federal transfer to be allocated by the municipal government. SEDESOL providedtraining
on participatory planning and self-diagnosis of neighborhood needs and priorities to local
authoritiesand communitymembers at barrioscoveredby Habitat.

Recentprogress under the Program andprospectsfor the sustainability of reforms

76.       Habitat has continued to expand. Since its inception, Habitat has moved rapidly up to
scale, supporting818 barrios with US$170 million in financing in 2004, 972 barrios in 2005 with
US$200million and 972 barrios with US$193 million in 2006. Monitoring and evaluation(M&E)
efforts for the programbegan in 2005 supported by an InstitutionalDevelopment Fundgrant from
the World Bank. One of the main recommendations derived from the evaluation has been the
need to reduce the number of available spending categories to increase the program's impact.
This has beenpartially addressedinthe program's operational rules.

77.       In 2007 Habitats operational rules were revised to incorporate several changes that
increase the coordination with other programs, simplifL the program's operation, and better
align the projects with the city and municipality boundaries. As a result, funding for improving
public spaces in large cities has been eliminated.25In addition, the number of categories and
modalities of the program has been reduced from 13 (5 geographical modalities and 8 types of
interventions) to 5 (2 geographical modalities and 3 types of intervention).The new rules also
permit certain projects(notably, infrastructurefor low-incomehousing) a wider geographic area
of intervention than the pre-definedpoligono. This wider range is particularly important for
projects that support the preparation of urban development plans and those related to
infrastructurefor new low-incomesettlements.

78.       In March 2007, SEDESOL issued a new program, Rescate de Espacios Ptiblicos, with an
allocated annual budget of US$l00 million tofinance the redevelopment and recovery of public
spaces. Similar to Habitat, the program co-finances with local governments social and physical
interventions destined to foster the rehabilitation, maintenance, and social cohesion of public
spaces in large (> 50,000 inhabitants) cities. The aim is to increase social cohesion, promote
community identity, and prevent violence and antisocial behavior.26SEDESOL's target is to
finance 550 projects in 2007. As of June 2007, 200 cities received funding from the program, in
most cases to co-financerecreationalspaces (parks, plazas) or sports facilities.

79.       Habitat continued to make progress in the community participation activities that it
supports. The numbers are not expected to increase sharply from year to year since both the
budget allocation to the program and the average fund allocation by beneficiary have remained
relatively stable since 2003. Notably, some qualitative aspects are improving the social auditing
projects. Accessibility to basic technology is more widespread, and the program has launched a
special fund for social auditing projects through online and multimedia technology implemented
by the young pop~lation.~'

PolicyArea 7: Low- and Moderate-IncomeLandDevelopment

Activities under the Government'sProgramSupportedby HUSAL andHUDPL 11

80.       Under this component, HUSAL I supported two studies to address the lack of systematic
data on land availability. The first study provided an inventory of developable urban land. The
second analyzed the legal and financial options for residential land development. To rationalize
and simplify the land development process, SEDESOL also completed a full assessment of state
and municipal land regulations intwo regions.28

8 1.      The original policy matrix for HUDPL 11included the preparation of an analysis of the
costs and benefits of land developmentfor low-income households, which was shifted to HUDPL
III.SEDESOL hasbeenseekingto enlargethe menuoflandpolicy instrumentsthrough Habitat
or other mechanisms. The policy matrix originally included the completion of a cost-benefit
analysis of different modes of land development as well as the design of an action plan to
implement selected alternatives. The analysiswill be finished by December 2007.

82.       To increase the options for local governments, Hcibitat rules were modified in 2005 to
allow the financing of serviced lots. This was a significant advance as previously such funds
could be used only to purchase land reserves, the most common form of land development for the
poor. Despite the large demand for land for low-income housing, local governments seem not to
find Habitat a good alternative for serviced lot provisions. The number of serviced lots financed
through the program remains low at 2,900 and 2,500 for 2005 and 2006, respectively. This is
partially explained by the low amount received by local governments under the program for this
purpose and the relatively small number of beneficiaries compared to other types of expenditures
also financed by the program. The serviced lots modality was cancelled in2007.

Recentprogress under theProgram andprospectsfor the sustainability of reforms

83.       The Governmenthas completedan importantstudy on costs and benefits analysis of land
development. The aim of the study is to obtain and analyze data on the price determinants of land
destined for formal and informal settlements. Understandingthe relative importance of each of
the legal, economic, and spatial variables to the price o f landwill clarify the main constraints that
drive the prices of landto higher levels, makinglandunaffordablefor low-incomehousing. The
study makes a set of importantpolicyrecommendationsand instruments(subsidies and regulatory
reforms) to increase the supply of land for low-income housing. The analytical methodology
incorporates economic, legal, and spatial analyses to be conducted in eight selected cities
throughout the country. Cities were selectedbasedon size, populationgrowth, ercentage of poor
population, barriersto city growth, andchange inlanduses inthe last 20 years.                 Pg

84.       A first draft of the study including results and recommendations is currently being
revised by SEDESOL. Given the scope of the study it is likely that several iterations and
discussions of the document will continue after October. In parallel, SEDESOL will prepare a
pilot land diagnostic, assessment, and action plan in the city of Mexicali, Baja California. The
plan will have the dual purpose to pilot this scheme in the city and to prepare a systematic
operational guide to landassessment that will be applied in additional cities. The main objectives
of this operational guide are to provide local governments a practical tool to prepare land
assessments in their respective cities and to increasethe informationon land demand and supply
in the middle and large cities. Accomplishing these objectives will enable a more effective
launch, at a later stage, ofthe policy instruments recommendedby the landstudy beingprepared.

85.       Led by SHF,four pilots on land developmentfor housing are being implemented in the
States of Michoaccin, Yucatcin, San Luis Potosi, and Quintana Roo. The Macro-lotes Para
Viviendaprojecthas been designedto provide a new alternative to the provision of adequate land
for affordable housing. The project intends to leverage private sector resources to improve the
quality and sustainabilityof the housingdevelopments.Essentiallythe pilot consists of setting up
an adequate institutional framework to foster public-privateparticipation in land development.
This includes the creation of a trust fund mechanism, and preparation of generic partial urban
development planswith the consensusofthe relevantgovernment agencies.

86.       It is important to note that at this stage nofunds are being invested in land or housing.
Rather, SHF is coordinatingefforts from state and municipalgovernments, nationaldevelopment
banks, private banking institutions, and other federal government agencies to develop four pilot
macro-lotes projects; The specific objectives of the pilots are to (i)set an adequate institutional
and administrative framework in which development of suitable land for housing in a
sustainable environment can occur ,(ii) strengthen the local government capacity to strategically
plan the areas of city growth, and (iii)develop a sustainable financing structure for land
developmentfor low-incomehousing.The projects incorporatefour innovations:


     a) The generic partial developmentplans will be subjectto public consultation, approvedby
          the State Congress, and published in the state's official gazette with a transparent
          modificationprocess.

     b) The macro-lotes include mixed land-use for housing (residential, middle, and low-
          income), commercial, and service uses. In effect, the macro-lotes are implementing a

         cross-subsidy between the higher-income land uses to the lower-income uses, making
         affordable housing feasible and sustainable.

    c) At least 60 percent o f the housing built in the macro-lote must be low-income housing
         (MXP 180,000-225,000).

    d) The operational vehicle (a trust fund in all cases) integrated by public and private
         stakeholders is responsible to implement the project under a strict timing schedule to
         minimize speculation.

 87.     At a later stage it is expected that private sector investments will happen that incorporate
mixed land use and that take advantage o f cross-subsidies among different land uses to fund
access to infrastructure services for the low-income housing.

        Table 5: Low- and moderate-income land development:Monitoring indicators
                                  Indicator                     2005     -  2006

                 beneficiaries
                 Source: SEDESOL

88.      The decrease in the number o f serviced lots financed through Habitat is explained by the
large advance investments that local governments have to make to service the land for housing
and the relatively low level o f Habitat financing that they receive. The pilots being implemented
by SHF address this issue by establishing a partnership with the private sector to provide the
necessary funds for land development for low-income housing.


Policy Area 8: DisasterPreventionand Management

Activities under the Government's Program Supportedby HUSAL andHUDPL 11

89.      The Hdbitat slum upgrading program focuses on disaster prevention to mitigate the
vulnerability ofpoor neighborhoods. The Mexican population, particularlythe poor, is vulnerable
to natural disasters. The Government has decided to use the Habitat slum-upgrading program to
improve the effectiveness o f prevention activities and reduce the vulnerability o f poor
neighborhoods. Habitat's Territorial Development and Environmental Improvement (TDEI)
program incorporates disaster prevention and mitigation actions. First, by addressing the risks
resulting from unplanned urbanization in vulnerable areas. Second, TDEI provides federal
funding for planning and for preventive works such as retaining walls and storm drainage. Most
importantly, third, TDEI will support the preparation o f risk atlases and,fourth, provide resources
for vulnerability assessments at the neighborhood level, identifying risk areas and suggesting
structural and nonstructural mitigation measures.

90.      HUSAL I Hdbitat implement three important types of projects to reduce disaster
                   helped
vulnerability. Habitat co-financed 30 community-level risk analyses and 15 sensitization and
mitigation projects, and prepared 10 proposals to organize land use to prevent natural disasters.

91 I     The Government achieved signijkant benchmarks under this component in preparation
for HUDPL II.Habitat helped local governments and communities prevent and manage natural
disasters. It has also helped to increase the sustainability o f their efforts. In 2004 Habitat

                                                  28

incorporated disaster prevention and environmental improvements in disaster management
practices. To promote a medium-term vision for disaster prevention, Habitat's operational rules
for 2005 were strengthened to allow co-financing of land and urban development plans that
incorporate disaster prevention criteria. The operational rules for 2005 also increased co-
financing for risk atlases and risk maps from 50 percent to 66 percent-the                  highest of any Habitat
program-to       encourage local governments to invest in disaster prevention. To widen its scope
beyond slums and taking advantage of the methodology already developed, Habitat will enable
riskatlases and risk studies to be preparedfor cities, metropolitan areas, and municipalities.

92.       During the Fox administration, an inter-ministerial group supported the inclusion of
disaster prevention in Governmentpolicies. Two working groups were formed at the federal level
under the leadership of SEDESOL. One, comprising representatives from a disaster risk-related
institution-the      National Center for Disaster Prevention of the Ministry of the Interior-focuses
on the exchange of technical information among ministries. The other group, with members from
various ministries, is devoted to building capacity for disaster risk management as a component
of long-term institutional strengthening.

93.       SEDESOL's progress on disaster prevention and management is ahead of the schedule
developedfor theprogram. Habitat is responsiblefor creating incentives for local governmentsto
invest in disaster prevention and management, a sector not usually an investment priority for
those governments. Thus it is impressive that most of the risk maps and related work have been
undertakenin the urban areas of Chiapas and Oaxaca, two of the poorest states in Mexico.

Recentprogress under theProgram andprospectsfor the sustainability of reforms

94.        Thefederal government continues its efforts topromote andfinance disaster prevention
and mitigation with local governments. The Habitat program helped local governments and
communities prevent and manage natural disasters, and have taken steps to increase the
sustainability of these efforts. Since 2003, a total of 1,200 risk prevention projects have been
supported. To date, 105 risk atlases have been prepared and 200 training courses on risk
mitigation have been c~nducted.~'Habitat also finances prevention and mitigation works such as
alert systems, community resettlement, and stabilization of risk areas. Close to 650 such projects
have been financed to date. Nine cities have incorporated, or are in the process of doing so, the
informationfrom the risk atlases intheir planning in~truments.~'

   IV. THE BANK-SUPPORTED AFFORDABLE HOUSINGAND URBANPOVERTY
                                                PROGRAM

96.      The proposed loan is consistent with the four pillars of the 2005-2008 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) Progress Report discussed by the Board on February 6, 200732.The
four pillars are designed to (i)reduce poverty and inequality, (ii)promote environmental
sustainability, (iii)increase Mexico's competitiveness, and (iv) strengthen the country's
institutions. HUDPL I11 has a strong focus on increasing access to real assets for low- and
moderate-income households and improvingthe existing living conditions of the poor. The loan
would address these key aspects of poverty by providing support for a comprehensive reform in
housing subsidies, expanding the property registries modernizationprogram, and fostering new
land development and housing for low-income families. The project would enhance
competitiveness by increasingthe efficiency of housingand urban development, housingfinance,
and property registries. Many low- and moderate-income homes contain microenterprises in
additionto providingshelter, and home owners often build additionalrooms to rent or for family
members. Thus housing often serves as a key source of capital accumulation and is critical to
buildinga strong middle class. Finally, the projectwould have a strong environmentalimpact by
improvingconditions in slums and promotingformal development on appropriate, well-designed
sites.

Relationshipwith Other BankOperations

97.      The proposed program has been prepared in close coordination with other Bank
operations in Mexico. The associated Housing and Urban Technical Assistance Loan (HUTAL)
supportsthe design and implementationofthe policiesand reforms under HUDPL 111, and fosters
continuity between the operations. The overall program draws on the experience and results of
the now-closed FOVVSHF operation. That operation was designed to provide liquidity and
technical assistance to reform SHF in its role to lead the development of primary and secondary
mortgage markets for middle-income households. The three-loan program has deepened these
efforts by targeting low-income households through broader sector reforms that provide housing
subsidies, move housing finance and savings programs down-market, upgrade slums, and foster
low- and moderate-income landdevelopment.

98.      The Bank is currently advising GoM on policies that willfoster competition in the local
Jnancial markets through an ongoing economic and sector work (ESW). This study can
complementthe efforts supported under the proposedHUDPL I11to develop new models of low-
income landdevelopmentwith the participationof BANOBRAS.

99.      Additionally, the HUDPL 111 has drawn upon the analysis, particularly regarding
housing subsidies and microJnance, derived @om the second advisory project on Housing
Finance signed between the Bank and SHF. The proposed loan also has benefited from close
coordination with the Environmental DPL series. The main objectives of the latter are to
mainstream environmental considerations in sectoral policy-making and to increase
SEMARNAT's capacity to collaborate with other agencies. The housing SEA supported by the

proposed HUDPL I11 will follow the methodology used for the tourism sector SEA under the
ENVDPL series.

100.       Similarly, the program complements housing reforms at the local level supported by the
Decentralized Inpastructure Reform and Development (DIRD) Loan. The decentralized
infrastructure loan is helping the State of Guanajuato strengthen the capacity of its housing
institute, implement a coordinated housing strategy at the local level, and improve the
sustainability of its housing sector.33The DIRDprojectwill also support a small pilot project for
progressive housing development. This pilot will follow the new federal subsidy scheme
launched by CONAVI to increase access to housing for the lower-incomepopulation and foster
private sector participationinthis market.

101,        The loan involves collaboration with other donors. The proposedloan would complement
the program financed by the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IADB) to support CONAVI in
the modernizationof property registries; (ii)facilitate access to housing finance for recipients of
remittances through SHF, and (iii)support the d B I T A T program through a multiphase
program,

102.       HUDPL I11 is complemented by several IFC operations that support the expansion of
housing finance for the middle-income sector through the provision of funding for important
SOFOLs operatingthroughout the country.

LessonsLearned

103.       The working group on housing subsidy reform within CONAVIcontinues to be efSecti~e.~~
The program as envisaged at the time of HUSAL Iis ambitious and involves multiple sectors.
More importantly, subsidy reform cannot be achieved in a short period, and its success depends
on close coordinationamongthe different stakeholders, particularly given the large market share
of the semiautonomous housingfunds. To addressthe institutionalproblems and lack of a culture
of coordination,in 2004 a working group on housing subsidies was formed in CONAVI to bring
together all the major actors involvedin housing subsidy policy, including CONAVI, SEDESOL
FONHAPO, SHF, INFONAVIT, FOVISSSTE, and SHCP. This working group was crucial in
agreeing key reforms of subsidy programs in 2005 and continues to meet regularlyto discuss the
subsidy report prepared semiannually by CONAVI. The working group, under the leadership of
CONAVI, is responsible for supervising the ongoing analysis and evaluation of the subsidy
system.

104.       A comprehensive reform program such as this one demands a strong coordinating and
analytical role by CONAVI. Given the number of agencies and responsibilitiesinvolved, a strong
coordinationrole is important for deliveringresults inthe sector. The new HousingLaw approved
in June 2006 strengthens CONAVI's role as a policy leader and coordinator in the sector. To
fulfill its new mandate, a necessarynext step is for CONAVI to strengthen its technicalteam and
improve its analyticaltools to be able to provide in-timeanalysis and policyguidance.

105.       Monitoring indicators are crucial to monitor progress, measure impact, and adjust the
pace and content of the reform program. Monitoring indicators have been agreed with the
Government of Mexicofor each component of the three-loan program.



  The Mexico DecentralizedInfrastructureReformand DevelopmentLoan also supports the State of Guanajuato'swater and
sanitation and transport sector programs.
I'Lessons learnedfor HUSAL Imainly derive from the ImplementationCompletion Report, ReportNo. 32559, June 2005 and for the
HUDPL 11from the Simplified ImplementationCompletion and ResultsReport, ReportNo.37878, December2006.

106.        The most signiJicant challenge for urban development and upgrading programs is
capacity building at the local levelfor comprehensive urbanplanning that takes into account the
needs of the poor. Given that most responsibilities are shared among the federal, state and
municipal governments, such capacity building is necessary for practically all urban and housing
sectors. Programs such as Habitat, or implementing housing policy through OREVIS, and
fostering good practice in modernizingpublic registries all will depend on adequate financing and
implementation skills in local governments. This capacity building needs to include a
comprehensive review and updating o f the existing local regulations for, among others, land use,
municipal finance, participatory schemes, and the environment. Pending tasks in this regard
include the integration o f territorial and environmental planning; improved coordination between
Habitat and FONHAPO on serviced lots; enhanced community participation in investment
planning; and enhanced decision-making and integration o f social and infrastructure projects.

Analytical Underpinnings

107.        The three-loan program rests on a solidfoundation of technical analyses conducted by
the Mexican Government, the Bank, and other developmentpartners. These analyses include:

            Mexico Financial Sector Assessment Program (Report No 25850, 2001). Evaluates the
            main aspects regarding policy issues in housing finance. The report suggests a
            comprehensive reform strategy to address interrelated challenges including the (i)
            redesign o f subsidy programs, (ii)restructuring o f the state-owned housing finance
            institutions, and (iii)development o f mortgage securitization and private mortgage

Description

108.      HUDPL 111would consolidate the reforms made under thefirst and second loans. The
proposed HUDPL I11 continues to support strategic areas of action under the overall
I-IUSAL/HUDPL reform program. The specific areas are reforms toward achievinga unified and
more equitable system for federal housing subsidies; deepeningthe systems for housing loans and
savings for lower-incomegroups, expandingthe modernizationprograms for urban real property
registries andrights; and increasingthe supply of and access to urban landfor poor people.

109.      The five key actions in the government's program which were anticipated before
appraisal of the third operation have been completed.In some cases the original wording of the
policymatrix has beenredrafted to adequately reflectthe Government's programandlor to clarify

                   develonment


110.     The original wording of the key actionfor the subsidypolicy area was redrafted to better
reflect the mechanisms through which the subsidy reform is being implemented. There are two
important changes in the new text. First, the originaltext describedthe main characteristics of a
new subsidy system linking them to the approved budget for 2008. As early as November 2006,
the transitionteam confirmed to the Bank its interest in continuingthe reforms supported by the
DPL program. Accordingly, the draft 2007 budget already incorporated the budget allocation to
support a new subsidy system that was approved by Congress Second, although the new subsidy
system is based on adequate budget allocation, the budget is not the instrument whereby the
                                               35

program characteristics are set. Hence it will not reflect the necessary changes in the program
rules that improve the system's equity and progressivity. The new wording of the trigger
maintains the requirement of a budget allocation for a new subsidy system, linking the main
characteristics to the program's operational rules, which are the mechanisms whereby the main
features of eligibility criteriaand subsidy amounts are set.

111.      The key action for the housing credit and household savings policy area was
complemented to increase clarity. SHF is technically operating this shift in their strategic
objective through partnerships with new micro-lending companies and the design and
implementationof new products for housing micro-finance. This specification was incorporated
to the policy matrix to better reflectthe GoM's efforts.

112.      Theproperty registries modernization program achieved the target of covering 18 states,
although in terms of percentage of covered population the result was slightly below the 80
percent target. Clearly, the GoM is committedto the modernizationof the State's administrated
public registries, and this year has increasedthe scope of the program and the allocated budget
beyond what had been originally envisaged which more than makes up for the lower percentage
of the urbanpopulationcoveredto datewhich is 74 percent.

113.      The key actionfor the landpolicy area has been redrafted to highlight the importance of
the implementation ofpilot schemesfor land development relative to thepreparation of an action
plan. The original text of the agreed prior action incorporates the completion of a quantitative
study and the preparation of an action plan, which was to includea pilot program for the low-and
moderate income land development. The new wording emphasizes the importance of actual
implementation of a pilot scheme rather than merely the preparation of an action plan that
describes it. This new wording also reflectsbetter the progress achieved by SHF (in coordination
with local governments, SEDESOL and the private sector) in the four pilot schemes already
under implementation.


                                   VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

Poverty and Social Impacts

114.      The proposed operation is expected to have significantly positive poverty and social
impacts. HUDPL 111 benefited from a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA). Given the
scope of the proposedreform,this PSIA focusedon affordablehousing. It included, amongothers
things, (i) a review of existing analytical work (Bank and non-bank assessments); (ii)a review of
secondary data (ENIGH) and (iii)an institutionalanalysis of FONHAPO, the key operating agent
for pro-poor housing subsidy policy. This institutional analysis also included interviews with
multiple stakeholders, including OREVIs and municipios that execute FONHAPO's subsidy
program, Tu Casa. A quantitative analysis of subsidies is about to be completed. Key issues and
social impactsemergingfrom the PSIA are summarized below.

115.      Overall, the continued dialogue with GoM and other stakeholders through the DPL
program has been instrumental in raising critical issues andpolicy challenges to reduce urban
poverty and vulnerability in Mexico. Key issues emerged from existing analytical work-the
Bank's recent Urban Poverty Assessment in                                      Mexico Housing 2006 Report, and
evaluation ofthe Tu Casaprogram.The issues include:

    0     Thepositive poverty and social impacts that can be derivedfiom increasing the access
         of thepoor to housing and urban services are tremendous. Housingis a key asset for the
         poor to provide shelter, to use as a risk-mitigating strategy, and to substitute for formal
         retirementsystems. Inparticular,housinghas a significant impact on poverty in terms of
         basic social support. Housingplays a unique role in protectionas the center of family
          and community life, and health and social well-being. The importance of housing also
          reflects its economic role. Many low-incomehomes are a place of economic activity as
         well as shelter. Housing is a key asset that supports households' strategies to survive,
          meet future needs, improve their lot, and reduce their exposure to shocks or minimize
         their consequences.

    0    Keyfor the poor is notjust access to housing per se, but housing well located to allow
          access tojobs and services. The dialogue with GoM in the context of this HUDPL I11
          benefits from the impact evaluation of the Tu Casa Federal Housing program. The
          evaluation showed beneficiaries' dissatisfactionwith the remote location of their new
          housing. There is also evidence that when this mismatch occurs, new housing can be
          abandoned.

     0   Access to jobs and services in turn raises the issue of access to land for pro-poor
          housing. This is addressedunder the HUDPL policy track for land development for low-
          and moderateincome beneficiaries.

     0    Finally, affordability of housing, and therefore appropriate targeting of scarcefederal
          resources, is a challenge. Accordingto the report"Current HousingSituationin Mexico
          2006"4660 percent of Mexican households do not have access to mortgage lending.
          Households typically excluded from mortgage lending include those with very low
          wages (1-2 MW), informal workers, and/or workers with great job instability and
          precariousness.All these critical challenges are addressed by theproposed HUDPL III.

116.     The proposed loan will support actions that are likely to generate poverty and social
impacts throughfour main policy tracks: (i) federal housing subsidies; (ii) housing credit; (iii)
strengthening Habitat for slum upgrading; and (iv)land development for low- and moderate-
income beneficiaries. The key poverty and social impacts for each of these policy tracks are
summarized in appendix 4. The summary table also highlightsthe major instruments that will be
usedto assess and track these impacts and to inform government policiesinthese areas supported
by DPL.

117,     Regarding affordable housing specifically, the PSIA indicates that four complementary
series of actions supported by the HUDPL 111are likely to generatepositive social impacts:

    a) Thanks to the provisionofup/frontgrants and guarantees, the creation of the new subsidy
         program-Esta     es tu Casu-will    increase coverage of the demand from lower-income
         groups who traditionallycouldnot be served by privatesector financing.

    b) Tu Casa operational rules. GoM asked FONHAPO to focus on pure subsidies vs.
         lending. In doing so, GoM may create an opportunity for FONHAPO to reallocate
         resourcesand skillsto improve social targeting and field monitoringto focus on the low-




                                                 37

         income groups (informal workers) who cannot afford the formal requirements of
        programsthat combine subsidies with credits

    c) By increasing Tu Casa's emphasis on home improvements, scarcefederal resources will
        focus on increasing coverage of the demandsfor access to infrastructure, service, and
        jobs of low-income groups who are in adequately located landplots.

    d) Beyond the Housing Subsidies reform, the HUDPL 111will address the issues of housing
         affordability, location, and related access to land through two main tracks. First, housing
         microfinancewill continue to be expanded down-market and to home improvements vs.
         new housing. Second, the HUDPL I11will help provide the necessary economic, legal,
         and spatial analyses and a related set of recommended policy and regulatory actions that
         should informGoM's approachto increasethe supply of landfor low-incomehousing.

118.    According to discussion with key stakeholders, the main social risk associated with these
actions would relate to the possible side effects of a sole emphasis by Tu Casa on home
improvement. This optionwould deprive key social groups with no existinghomes from access to
new housing. These social groups comprise women heads of households living in overcrowded
conditions with families and small children, new rural immigrants, or young families with very
low wages and precarious jobs. For these groups, self-production of housing is hardly an
alternative. Therefore, a proposed risk-mitigation approach would be to support a gradual and
progressive emphasis on home improvements, with some remaining allocations for a new house
acquisitionprogrambut with bettertargeting.

119.    Another social risk may relate to the potentially adverse impacts on particular groups
caused by the expansion of the housing supply and subsidiesfor construction and upgrading.
This risk will be particularlycorrected by the increasingfocus on home improvement rather than
constructingnew dwellings for vulnerable people. However, this focus may not be sufficient to
address the structural problem of Mexico's legal and policy gaps in protecting informal settlers
from displacement and the country's resettlement policy. A solid mitigation measure would
includean upstreamapproachthat focuses onthese legalgaps and strengthens the capacity of key
federal and state agencies to implement a revisited resettlement policy. This measure, however,
extendsbeyondthe scope of the HUDPL 111.

120.     Moving forward, the PSIA findings also suggest the need to ensure a proper
implementation of the pro-poor housing subsidy reform. Implementation should focus on
outreach and effective targeting. This challenge, in turn, raises broader institutional implications
for federal and state agencies (Appendix 5).

121 I    Continuing dialogue and consultations. As highlighted above, this proposed HUDPL 111
was informed by the PSIA exercise. The operation also supports the involvementof civil society
and users-particularly    the poor-in    monitoring and evaluating the implementationof Habitat
program (The DPL matrix will be complemented by technical assistance to Habitat through the
HUTAL). More importantly, HUDPL I11was developed in the context of a new administration
that set out to formulate a new comprehensivePlan Nacional de Desarrollo. The policy reforms
supported by the HUDPL I11 are therefore informed by the series of public and technical
consultations that GoM organized as part o f this Plan Nacional de Desarrollo, especially on
housingand urbandevelopment. Appendix 6 details these GoM's consultations.

Environmental Aspects

122.    Policy reforms supported by the program will have signijkant environmental benejts.
Informal settlements suffer fiom numerous environmental and social problems due to lack of
basic services. The proposed loan will support policies such as promoting slum upgrading;
pursuing formal housing development in suitable, well-selected and well-designed areas; and
streamlining environmental considerations in housing policies. These policies will improve
infrastructureprovision, access to green spaces, public transportation, and social services. They
also will reduce vulnerability to natural disasters as well as energy and water consumption.
According to the analytical work completed to date, none of the reforms is expected to have
significant negative environmental or social impacts. Some localized negative environmental
impacts are possible from eventual implementationof programs supported by the loan, such as
inconveniences due to construction activities or resettlement from risk-prone areas. As in many
other Bank projects, these impactswill be managedthrough existing institutionsandregulations.

123.    The GoMis preparing a Strategic EnvironmentalAssessment (SEA) of the housing sector
to include environmental considerations in the federal housing policies. In January 2007,
CONAVI started to conduct a SEA that would serve as a master plan to include environmental
considerations in its policies and programs in coordination with SENER, CNA, IMTA, and
SEMARNAT. In addition, CONAVI announced that it will finance the SEA and that the
contributionsof SENER, CNA, IMTA, and SEMARNAT will be requested. CONAVI prepared
the terms of reference for the SEA and for five environment-related studies. They will be (i)
Building Code, (ii)monitoring houses that use environmentallyfriendly technologies, (iii)cost-
benefit analyses of energy- and water-saving technologies, (iv) guidelines to certify
environmentallyfriendly buildingmaterials and energy- and water-saving technologies, and (v) a
program to disseminate the benefits of sustainable housing. SEMARNAT and the other
organizationscomplementedthe terms of reference.

124.     The SEA calls for regionaldiagnoses andrecommendationswith regardto:

    0   Zoning and landuse (includingconsiderations on water availability, air quality, and green
        areas)
    0   Technologies (buildingmaterialsand systems)
    0   Demography
    0   Financing(innovative instrumentsto finance environmentallyfriendly houses)
    0   Utilities and public services (transport, access, energy use, water use, drainage, solid
        waste disposal)
    0   Standards(such as construction)

125.    It is expected that the final version of the SEA will be ready by February 2008 and the
final document submitted in May 2008. A quality enhancement committee is being created to
monitor and supervise the SEA activities.

Fiduciary Aspects

126.    In general, the public financial management (PFM) systems in Mexico are adequate for
DPL lending, as documented in the 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment, 2007
CountryProcurementAssessmentReport (under preparation), and other analytical work. There is
room for improvement in some areas, such as procurement and accounting practices that are not
up to internationalstandards.However, there are plans underway, which the Bank is supporting,
to move inthis direction.

                                                39

Disbursements

127.       In recent DPLs, the Ministry o f Finance (SHCP) has designated a national development
bank as financial agent o f the Borrower with regard to the loans. For this operation, SHCP has
designated SHF as financial agent and coordinating unit.Under this arrangement, the Bank would
make the single tranche disbursement to a designated account in US$ o f the financial agent4' for
subsequent credit to an account o f the National Treasury (SHCP/TESOFE). This credit thus
would become available to finance general budget expenditures through the PFM systems cited in
the previous paragraph. If requested by the Bank, the SHCP would provide the Bank with a
written confirmation o f the described transaction.

128.       Based on the review o f external audit reports and the extensive flow-of-fund experience
between the Bank and the financial agents usually designated by the SHCP, nothing has come to
the attention o f Bank staff that would indicate that the banking control environment into which
the loan proceeds would flow is other than adequate. This general view will be confirmed
specifically once a financial agent for this DPL is designated by the SHCP.

129.       Based on the assessment o f the PFM and banking environments, no additional fiduciary
arrangements are deemed necessary for the DPL.

Risks and Mitigation

130.       Two risks have been identified associated to the proposed HUDPL 111:The institutional
risk related to the difficulty o f ensuring adequate coordination across agencies. The program's
ambitious multi-sectoral approach required constant coordination between government agencies
and ministries, and a failure to do so could have put parts o f the program at risk. The Housing
Law o f 2006 has considerably strengthened CONAVI's mandate to coordinate the numerous
stakeholders. Accordingly, this risk is rated as low. A future priority should be to strengthen
CONAVI's technical capacity for it to better fulfill this role.

131.       There is a sustainability risk to the entire reform program in that the significant reforms
undertaken by G o M over the past several years need to be sustained throughout the medium term
to obtain the desired results. The National Development Plan incorporates the strategic lines to
continue and deepen the reform program, notably in public registries and housing subsidies. The
sectoral programs being prepared will incorporate the particular action lines to be taken. There is
also a considerable risk that INFONAVIT "captures" a major portion o f the new subsidy program
and effectively shuts out the still nascent private sector from the lowest-income segments. It is
worth reiterating that, as an institution, INFONAVIT enjoys virtual autonomy from the federal
government in terms of decision-making. The Bank will remain engaged with G o M on subsidy
reform through the HUTAL and, as in the past, it is expected that G o M will take seriously the
Bank's recommendations inthis regard. Overall this risk is rated as moderate.

132.       Overallproject risk: Low.

Mr, Robert Zoellick
President
The World Bank

U S A


Dear Mr.Zoetlick,


Thu letter of Sector Development Policy describes the current siluatron of the housrng and urban
sectors in Mexico It provides an ovetview of the main reforms performed,the strategies and actions
been implemented to achieve the goals set in the National Development Plan (2007-2012) The
reforms are focusedtowards reducingthe currently existinghousinggap,with specialemphasis in the
low income families, through dtfferent programs for housing acquisition and sustained urban
development. To continuethis ongoing effort,the MexicanGovernment is requesting the World Banks
support through the Third Development Policy Loan for Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty
Reduction,


I. MacroeconomicContext

In 2006 Mexico registereda moderate economic activity mainly due to the politicalatmosphere and
the lack of structural reforms. In spite of this scenario, GDP grew in that year at a rate of 4 8% in
annual terms. the best figure since 2000 Inflation rate reached 3.8% for 2006, in line with the official
target of 3% (ti%).

Underthe first year of President Calderon's administration several positive changes have occurred in
economic policy: among these changes its worth to mention i) the new pension law for public
employees (Ley del ISSSTE) which ensures the ftnancial viability of the pension system and
generates srgnificant savmgs in public sector accounts in net present value terms, due to the
elimination of a future high deficit 11)the new Law for Federal Budget and Financial Responsibility
which guarantees the best practices for the achievement of a balanced budget with a bettet control
over estimated oil prices and responsible management of resources, and iii) the recently approved
fiscal reform will providemore funds for the federal and localgovernments to achieve a more balanced
social development

Duringthe first half of 2007, GDP grew, in annual terms, at a rate of 2.7%. inferior Incomparison to
the 5.2% recorded in the same period last year, due to significant lower growth rates in the
manufacturing, construction and mining sectors and the real state turmoil in the USeconomy

From January to July 2007. inflation reached an annual increase of 4.0% due to some short-term
supply socks, particularly in the food sector. However this result is still consislent with the official
target.

Regardingfinancial markets developments, inSeptember 19, Fit& increasedtheir grade for Mexican
sovereign long-termdebt denominatedin foreign currency from "BBB"to "EBB+",and from "BBB*"to
"A-*long-termdebt in local currency due to the positiveexpectations on domesticeconomy. inJune 1,
the sovereign risk of Mexicodecreasedto its minimalhistoricallevel.71 points.

For 2007 and 2008, GDP is expected to grow at 3.0% and 3.5%, respectivelyand inflation will be
around 3.0940in eachyear. However,there are still three main risks that canaffect these results.a le=
favorable economic performance of the US economy, particularlyif the unsteadysituation in the real
statesector continues;internationalfinancial volatilityand significantchanges in oil prices.

The goal of the current mnomic policy is to maintain a strong fiscal policy aimed at impulsing an
accelerated and sustained economic growth to create the jobs required by the society and increase
thequalityof lifeandthe number of opportunitiesfor the Mexicanpeople.


2. HousingandUrbanSector

Mexico's successful growth in the housing sector over the last five years has been essential to the
country'seconomic and social development. Housinghas beena priorityon the government'sagenda,
addressing the needs and demands of less fortunate population, making it possible for families lo
create their own wealth. To this effect. importantchanges were furthered in the housingsector. aimed
at enabling growth, promoting more financing, increasing productivity and favoring land supply. The
government's platformfor transformingthe structuralcomponents on which the nationalhousing effort
is built, isthe new HousingPolicyissued last year.

The major reformsalreadyimprementedin housingpolicy include:

  2.1. The NationalHousingCommission (CONAVI)has successfully managed the coordinationof the
      national policy with most of the 32 states through: (if cream of State Housing Councils, (ii)
      implementationof programsto reduce indirectcosts associatedwith constructionand titling, and
      (iii) disseminationof best-practicesinformationon buildingstandards and titling documentation,

     The supply 01 financial products has k e n adapled to the current demographic dynamics with
      new products such as programs for housing rental, microfinance, expansion, and remodeling,
      and schemes with upfront subsidies. The new Housing Law, passed in June 2006, strengthen
      CONAVI mandateas policycoordinator and promotes community and privatesector participation
      inhousing,allowingbetterattentionto housingand urban issues.

      CUNAVl has initiated the selection and employment of consultants to develop the Housmg
      Building Code. This code will serve as an updated normative model For the approval of
      regulations, in order to develop safe, reliable and affordable housing in a sustainable urban
      context.

    CONAVI has also developed the NationalHousing Informationand fndiitors System, with the
    participation of the national housing finance agencies, which has the purpose of integrating,
    generating and disseminating the required information for the appropriate planning,
    implementatcon and monitoring of the housing policies, as well as the strengthening of a

     faking advantage of the recent expenence with federal programs such as "Esta cas tu Casa"
     (-This is Your House"),a programof Finance Schemes and FederalSubsidies for Housing was
     announced as the substitute for the Special Housing Credit and Subsidy Program (PROSAVI).
     This new program combines an up-front subsidy, credit. savings and a guaranty,(inthe cases
     that it is applicable) according to some housing modalities:

         Acquisition of new or used houses,
       0 Improvement,
       0 Self-construction and
       0 Acquisition of serviced lots

     Congress authorized US $545 million for subsidies for the 2007 fiscal year in two programs:
     "Esta es tu Casa"which plans to give around 115,100subsidies, and "Tu Caw' ("Your House")
     which plans to deliver about 128 thousand subsidies that will give continuity to their housing
     programs.both in a semi-urbanand ruralenvironment.

   2.3. The modifications to legal and operational institutional frameworks have resulted in the
     continuity of housingprograms,which at the end of 2006, reachedan unprecedented amount of
     952,763 financial supports granted from financial institutionsand housing institutions,of which
     722.802 correspondsd to acquisition of new or used housing and 229,961 were for housing

3. Strategiesand Actions

This sectiondescribes the main strategies implemented by the Federal Government in recent years,
as well as changes and actions that will take place in the medium and long term to deepen ongoing
reformsto provide the framework for the improvement of housing programsand urbandevelopment.
These measures focus on strengtheningmarket and institutions in order to find solutions for lower
incomefamilies that without these actions wouldn't be provided with housingand services.

Housing Strategy end Institutions. The National Development Plan 2007-2012, establishes the
search for SustainableHuman Development as its main premise; defined as the ongoing process of
development of capabilities to enable all Mexicans to have a worthy life without compromising the
heritage of future generations. To achieve this purpose, CONAVI has established the following
strategies: (a) to provide legal ceitainly on ownership through the homologationof public property
registries; (b) to extend the coverage of service and the founding alternatives for housing and
construction: c) to increase the availability of suitable land for economic development and housing
construction; (d) to re-use urban infrastructure and its existing equipment: (e) to strengthen the
NationalHousing System;(f) to promote improvements for the existing housingstock; (g) to generate
a greaterdynamism of the used housing mafket.The current administrationhas a clear determination
towards more ambitious goals, like giving financial support for six million houses during the following
six years, primarilyoriented for the lower income population.Low-incomefamilies, that are defined as
those with monetaryperceptionsthat do not exceed 5 minimummonthlywages (around $ 133 USD),
will receive financial support from federal subsidies to buy a house or land with services, fw

Housing Subsidy Programs and Policy.Additional to other measurestaken in 2005 related to the
housing subsidy programs, an "Evaluation of the Housing Subsidy Programs in Mexico" is been
canid out aided by the Housingand Urban Development Technical Assistance Programsupported
by the World Bank. Direct subsidies and implicit subsidies (those derived from the interest rates
offered by National Housing Institutions. OrJAVIS) will be evaluated in order to update and
complement the results of the 2005 study. This will help to develop a new nationalsubsidies scheme,
ensuring the establishment of guidelines for subsidy programs, emphasizing the importance of
carrying out transparent actions that promote an equitable and efficient treatment to avoid negative
impacts on the participationof the privatesector, both infinancingand housingproduction.

Hotisin@Credit and HouseholdSavings. The distributionof credits grantedby banksand non-bank
financial institutions (sofoles)has increasedsubstantially;neverthelessINFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE
still have a very high market share of more than 6Wo. SHF's efforts wilk aim at increasingthe private
sector participationmainly in areas that are unattended by ONAVIS, primarily in the lower income
sector and non-waged population.Together with INFONAVIT the registrationwindow for projectshas
been consolidated. This simpliftes the operation for buildersand starts a single database of housing
supply that is very usefulfor the housing sector.

SHF's strategy will managethe efforts to considerably reduce the gap between the Annual Total Cost
(CAT) and the risk free interest rate. The lines of action will be focused on: (a) The creation of the
Mortgage Insurance Company to trigger the widespread use of new branches, authorized in the
amendment of the Insurance Companies and Mutual Funds Law; (b) Focus its funding efforts on
undersewedpopulation segments, mainly in households with an income below 5 minimum monthly
wages; (c) Strengthen the micro-creditfounding for housingimprovement throughspecializedbrokers,
and broadenthe base of micro credit operation through more financial intermediaries; (d) Foster bank
and sofoles portfoliosecuritizationand supportingsmall intermediariesthroughplatforms which allow
them to participate in mortgage securitization, promoting the reduction in time and cost related to
credit origination

Properfy Rights Modernization. CONAVI, SHF, The National NotariesAssocjation (ANNM)and the
Mexican Institutefor RegisterLaw (IMDERAC)developedthe Public Property RegistryModernization
Model, which integrates the following components: legal framework, information technology, quality
management,properly rights professionalizing,institutionalpolicies, documentation management and
collection, participation with other sectors and perfomance indicators, which together ensure
compliance with the property rights principles, the legal security and the real rights dissemination.
Subsequently, this modelwas endorsedby the main stakeholders of the housing sector: INFONAVIT.
FOVISSSTE. FONHAPO. the Notaries College, the Mexican Banking Association, the Mexican
Sofomes Association and others. The model takes into account the internalional best practices and
integrates the pilot plan lessons from the property rights modernization implemented in the States of
Baja California,Colima and Sonora.

On March 6th 2007, the guidelines for the 2007 Public Property Registry Modernization Programwere
published in the OfficialGazette, where the FederalGovernmentestablishes as one of its first actions
during the current Administration the need lowork together with slate governments to undertake iegal
adaptations and develop the technological platform that allows them to standardize the Public
Property Registry.

 Furthermore, the Evaluation Committee conformed by CONAVl, Secretariade Gobernacibn and SHF
was created as an instance to analyze,evaluate and authorize the inclusion of projects that proceed
from the Baselines and Periodic Measurement results. as well as the work plan of the State

To reduce rural marginalization, the Governmentwill improve those areas where people with greater
disadvantages live.This will achieve a more orderly society where all citizenshave equal participation
opportunities, choice and decision, starting with the poorest municipafities through a plural and
balanced development. Actions to seek synergies, order and harmony between the regions, using
their comparative advantages, promoting their productive potential and promotingenvironmental and
social sustainability will be initiated.

The National InfrastructureProgram 2007-2012, sets the objective to provide qua{ opportunitiesfor
all Mexicans, particularlythose living in isolated. marginalized conditions,with lack of drainage, that
have no electricityor housing,Upgrading the living conditionsfor the low and medrum income families
and promoting the creationof new i n m e and employment sources for this sector of the population
has required the integral actions implemented through the Habitat program, which has a budget for
2007 of morethan USD215 millionand will include 215 citiesand metropolitanareas at the end of the
year.

Land Development for low incomehousing. The government is working to improve the quality of
life in cities, especially in the poorestareas.through the provisionof social infrastructureand adequate
housing,as well as the consolidation of efficientand competitive cities.

The country faces the challenges of poverty and urban marginalization; the Government will seek to
improve these conditions through basic infrastructure provision and equipment, in the marginalized
areas. The proportion of serviced households in the urban-marginalized zones, which have been
identifiedbased in the percentageof households in poverty, will increase to 89%.The infrastructure,
equipment and services (water. sewage and ebctricity) deficit and the pefcentageof unoccupied lots
in the mentionedareaswill be reduced.

The Federal Government is developing new mechanisms to provide housing for this sector of the
population through housing construction and the promotion of an orderly city growth under a primary
and secondary urbanization scheme which should include mechanisms of coordination among
different participants.

In particular SHf has initiated integral urban projects in various states to pilot a new mechanism for
land development for medium and low income housing. It is estimated that it wll benefit around 2
million people, with the joint work of BANOBRAS and other participants, which have suitable soil for
popular housing.These projectsare linkedto the housingsubsidies policy.

Mitigation of natural disasters.To raise the level of human and wealth development of Mexicans
who live in high risk areas, SEDESOL is working to prevent and attend natural disasters in
coordinated actionswith the communities.

The conservetbn of the natural capital of the country will be integratedwith the social and economic
development, identifying and exploiting the guidance and the productive potential of the territory
through an ecological managementthat includes actions in harmonywith the envtronmentthat ensure
the sustainable use of naturalresources. SEOESOL has set as a target that 80% of the municipalities
with a high marginality index cany out integrateddisaster risk managementactions and plans, helped
by ths incorporationof informationfrom tha NaturalHazardAtlas.

             Appendix 4. Descriptionand Analysis of the New Esta es tu CasaProgram

Program Description

Objectives. The Esta es tu Casu program provides federal subsidies for different types o f
affordable housing solutions for low-income households. The specific objectives are to (a)
increase access to (mortgage- and housing micro-) credit and cofinanciamento, (b) support the
capacity o f low-income households to create housing wealth, (c) increase joint responsibility by
beneficiaries for their housing conditions by opening up ways to use their accumulated wealth or
savings, (d) stimulate mobility inthe new and used housing market, (e) improve the quality o f life
o f the people by enhancing housing conditions and the urban environment, and (f) promote the
production o f social housing, and self-constructiodproduction o f housing in sustainable urban
and rural conditions.

Program components and beneficiary groups. The latest and still preliminary version o f the
Reglas identifies several categories o f beneficiaries (table 1):

     1. Lower-income persons who receive housing finance support from INFONAVIT,
           FOVISSSTE, ISSFAM, or other federal, state, or municipal entities:
                 a. Incomes at or below 2.6MW for individuals and 4MW for households or persons
                      older than 50 years o f age.48

     2. Non-INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE members:
                 a. Incomes at or below 4MW for individuals or 5MW for households.

     3. Low-income households that are beneficiaries o f other social programs affiliated with
           CONAVI and individuals whose homes were lost or damaged due to natural disasters.

Table 1 gives an overview o f the different components o f the latest version o f the program, the
subsidy amounts and target groups each is meant to serve, and down-payment requirements. In
addition to the subsidy amounts shown, there are additional subsidies for each venue:

     0     Beneficiaries receivingtheir subsidies through private lenders are given an additional up-
           front subsidy to pay for SHF mortgage insurance, which is required for all program-
           linked mortgage loans. The mortgage insurance premium is capped at 3.75 percent o f the
           loan amount, which is a concessionary rate subsidized by SHF (that is, ranging from
           roughly between M$2000-M$6000 for house values between M$120,000-M$227,000,
           respectively). Nonprivate lenders such as INFONAVIT can access the mortgage
           insurance, but their members must pay for it.49

Through INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE, beneficiaries receive an additional deep interest rate
subsidy. For INFONAVIT, this subsidy amounts to M$38,500-M$45,000                                         for persons in the
1SMW-2.6MW bracket).




48Up from 2MW and 3.5MW respectivelyunder the original program.
`9This arrangement is a main departure from the original (April 2007) program that first set the subsidy amount per beneficiary and
subtracted the mortgage insurance premium from that amount as part of the up-frontsubsidy (in other words the mortgage insurance
premium which is higher for larger loans, did not affect the progressive structure of the original program, while under the current
scheme those with larger loans receive a higher MI subsidy). Additionally, the original programdid not allow the housing funds to
access federally subsidizedmortgageinsurance.

       Appendix 6. Implementing the New Pro-Poor Housing Subsidy Policy in Mexico:
                                 Key Challenges for Inclusiveness

1. As part o f the PSIA, a Bank mission inquired into stakeholders' views and suggestions on
operative challenges that would need to be addressed if G o M is to enhance the effectiveness and
inclusiveness o f a federal housing subsidy program such as Tu Casa (or other housing for the
poor policies). Discussions focused on issues and options in: incentives structure for the
relationship with FONHAPO's executing partners at the state level (OREVIS and municipios);
coverage, targeting, and inclusiveness (that is, responsiveness to specific difficulties encountered
by marginalized groups). This appendix focuses on key findings related to implementation
challenges. While the HUDPL I11is informing the revision o f the Tu Casa rules at the federal
level, implementingthe success o f the affordable housing reform in terms o f reaching out to the
poorest will depend on key variables related to the institutional capacities of, and relationships
among key federal, state, and municipal agencies responsible for the execution o f the program.

2. At a general level, stakeholders' recommendations to enhance the pro-poor profile of the
Tu Casa program included the need to (i)improve outreach and communication about the
program, and (ii)provide assistance to the most marginalized, especially groups with low
levels o f education, with the application process itself (paper filling, small cash for required
notarization process when needed). Officials who receive the public in OREVIS or municipios on
a daily basis should identify those vulnerable groups and refer those cases to social workers or
assistants for help with the application process. Despite improvements, anecdotal evidence was
confirmed during field visits that many applicants still hear about the program through local
leaders. This creates risks o f political influence and reduces prospects for reaching out to those
who need the program the most. Good practice includes going through the files o f the DE
(Desarrollo Integrales de Familia?) and through mobile visits o f social workers to poor areas.

3. More specifically, there is scope to improve targeting criteria and methods at state level,
reaching out to thepoorest and most vulnerable. Within the long list o f applicants who meet the
basic criteria o f earning an income below the 3MW, how do OREVIS and municipios prioritize?
Some OREVIS have a sophisticated approach, giving priority to groups such as female heads o f
households, or households living in areas prone to natural disasters. FONHAPO operative rules
provide guidance on this, but it is not always known or disseminated. Others admit that they
select within these eligible applicants based on "first come, first served." Furthermore, some
OREVIS make a strict interpretation o f Tu Casa operative rules, rejecting applicants from very
poor and precarious backgrounds who cannot even afford to bringthe amount o f savings required
(aportedel benejciario). For Tu Casa rural for example, jornaleros [day laborers] typically earn
the equivalent o f 1 MW (or less) and cannot manage to pay the full contribution required on a
one-off basis. By contrast, other OREVIS and municipios allow for payment in different stages
(pago aplazo), which enables them to reach the poorest applicants.

4. These findings raise implications for, and beyond, processes at the OREVIS level. When
OREVIS adopt specific criteria for targeting and prioritizing within the list o f eligible applicants,
these rules should be published and made fully transparent. SEDESOL and FONHAPO should be
fully informed and be given the opportunity ofobjection, or no-objection (regulatoryrole).

5. An institutional strengthening in FONHAPO could make a difference. First, an effective
strategy for human resources is needed. More staff should be dedicated to field monitoring
(seguimiento).At least one advisor and one technical person should be recruited to bring social
policy and planning expertise to FONHAPO. Key terms o f reference would include (i)providing
advice on operative rules, ensuring that they be inclusive, and ensuring that they be responsive to


                                                  62

the difficulties encountered by poor and vulnerable groups to successfully apply to the program
(see Operative Challenges below); (ii)acting as FONAHPO liaison for contacts and information
exchange with social sections of SEDESOL deconcentratedunits, departamentos de promocion
social in OREVIS, and municipios; and (iii) overall, helping to implement the vision of a trust
fund with a humanface (consentido humano) and a high capacity to ensure an effectivetargeting
of scarce federal resources. Finally, (iv) staff with engineer and architect profiles should be
trained in ways to operationalize these concerns for a more-poor focus of programs exemplified
by Tu Casa .

6. Secund, FONAI-IPO has the potential to develop a strong capacity building and
knowledge-sharing function with lower-income segments of the population. by drawing on
the strong experience of its staff A complementary capacity building, or technical assistance
programfor OREVISand selectedmunicipios (for example, the 100 poorestmunicipios) couldbe
envisaged. Typical moduleswould focus on effective, pro-poortargeting.The knowledge-sharing
program would typically include the dissemination of innovation and good practices in the
implementationofhousingpoliciesfor the lower-incomesegments.

7. Third, FONHAPO's renewed mission would benefit from a strong communication
strategy. Externally, goals and performance targets, as well as regular progress on them, should
be widely communicated. FONAHPO should constantly clarify operative rules, that is, what is
not negotiablevs. flexible within theserules.

8. At the same time, institutional challenges toward more inclusive housing subsidy
programs extend beyond FONHAPO. FONHAPO operates the Tu Casu rules, but the
normative agent is SEDESOL. The coordinationbetween SEDESOL and FONHAPO therefore
must be strengthened. So should the collaboration between SEDESOL-FONHAPO and other
housing institutions (SHF, CONAVI, HABITAT) to provide a more integratedapproach to low-
income housing. Improved coordination would increase the ability of OREVIS to use the
differentprogramsand instruments more strategicallyto meettheir populations'needs.

9. The relationship with, and the capacity building of OREVIS and rnunicipios which are
now both entitled to execute FONHAPO subsidies, deserve particular attention. Existingin-
depth studies5' show that OREVIS vary in their institutional capacities and approaches to
targeting, with varying results in terms of pro-poor housing outcomes of federal programs
executed by them. This problem of varying capacity, performance, and engagement becomes
exacerbated inthe case of urban and rural municipios, which are also now eligible to executethe
Tu Casu program.

10. A change in the incentive structure of the relationship between FONHAPO and its
executing partners (mainly OREVIS) could be considered. Currently, FONHAPO assigns
resources on a formula basis. The merits of this formula are that it rests on objective indicators,
and benefits from a political agreement between the states and the Federation. However, it does
not reflect basic demographic changes that may affect changes in the demand for housing.
Examples are the formation of new households and the increase in the minimum wage. More
importantly, it does not provide incentives to states, through OREVIS and municipios, to
effectively implement the housing subsidies. Examples of deficiencies in performance include
abandoned new housing financed by Tu Casu (due to use of cheap lands resulting in poor
location); or misuse of subsidies (homes that ended up being rented and not occupied by the

original applicant). A federal block grant program for housing subsidies to states or OREVIS that
would be based on outcomes and/or performance would seem an effective and efficient way to
redress these problems.

11. Finally, there is also scope for greater transparency, monitoring, and accountability in
the implementation process. Once a subsidy certificate is approved, the federal resource
becomes a localkate resource. While state audit courts are responsible for controlling the good
use o f these funds, there would be scope to look into budget-tracking methods to follow up
exactly what happens with the initial federal expenditure. Field-based monitoring also should be
strengthened. FONHAPO already does this to some extent with its Direction o f Operations, but it
is clearly understaffed to do this well52and does not benefit from state-level representation.
FONHAPO relies on SEDESOL deconcentrated units for supervision (through a convenio).

Altogether, 51,997 people participated through 205 fora o f popular consultation. Among them
were 4,334 members o f indigenous communities in fora carried out in 57 communities; 79,921
people participated individually sending their opinions and proposals by different means.

2. Specificallyon housing, the citizen consultations on housing were carried out through regional
     fora in the Spring 2007 in 3 cities representing the South, North, and center o f Mexico
    (Merida, Hermosillo, and Morelia). Additionally, CONAVI set up an electronic address to
    receive comments and suggestions and a mailbox on its webpage to receive citizens'
     proposals. CONAVI also carried out a consultative session with members o f Congress. A
    total o f 374 people attended the regional meetings, o f whom 173 actively participated. Fortry-
     six written comments were received.
