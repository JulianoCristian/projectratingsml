If technical assistance projects\n            like Social Sector Technical Assistance Credit (SOTAC) are\n            being designed as a companion project to a structural\n            adjustment operation it is important to ensure that the\n            teams working on both operations are almost identical or, at\n            least, are led by the same task team leader. In low-capacity\n            environments focusing Technical Assistance on direct\n            capacity building may produce more sustainable impact.\n            Limited procurement options might result in non-delivery of\n            planned technical assistance assignments that are important\n            for the country's development agenda. A capacity\n            building component for implementation should be built into\n            the project, in those cases when there is not enough time to\n            do so in the preparation phase of the project. NGOs can be a\n            driving force in the development of innovative projects and\n            deliver significant results for relatively small amounts of\n            funding, when those NGOs are guided by capable and\n            open-minded Centers of Social Work management."}, "docdt": "2004-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
