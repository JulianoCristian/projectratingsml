designed to increase\n            grain production, and decrease harvest losses through\n            increased storage capacity and modernized and more efficient\n            storage management and improve productivity through\n            increased investment in on-farm mechanization. Investments\n            would be in grain storage and mechanization for grain\n            production in the remaining 3-year period of the current\n            Five-Year National Development Plan. Investment in on-farm\n            storage and mechanization would be all in the social sector,\n            including State and cooperative farms. Investment in\n            off-farm storage would be carried out by the Grain Trust,\n            the State agency for grain marketing. Minor expenditures for\n            technical assistance in grain handling, mechanization study\n            tours, development of a management information system for\n            major sub-borrowers, an agricultural price policy study and\n            future project preparation would also be financed under the project."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
