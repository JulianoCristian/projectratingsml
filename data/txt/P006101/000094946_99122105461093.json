satisfactory, and sustainability is likely. While the\n            ratings for both the Bank, and the Borrower's\n            performances are satisfactory, project preparation was\n            unsatisfactory, for, although project design adequately\n            addressed primary education issues existing at the time, the\n            design however, was insufficiently comprehensive. The\n            lessons learned convey, that as a result of this primary\n            education project - under which several studies addressed\n            the weaknesses in the system - the Government declared\n            Education Sector Development as a priority, adopting the\n            project into its recurrent budget, for future operations\n            continuity. This was conducive to a shift from project\n            specific, to sector wide issues, addressing all levels of\n            education, thus future operations should capitalize on the\n            government commitments to sector policy/strategy development\n            in education. A strong working partnership with the school\n            management was developed, ensuring input delivery to the\n            system. However, implementation lacked detailed costs, and\n            financial planning, hence, future projects should consider a\n            time-bound activity level implementation plan, with all\n            terms of reference for consultants, studies, or training,\n            drafted before effectiveness. In addition, implementation,\n            and outcome indicators should be divided, to attain\n            quantifiable targets, and, financial implications agreed at\n            the earliest."}, "docdt": "1999-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
