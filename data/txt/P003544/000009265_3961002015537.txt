MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A ?ROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR AN ED-UCATION DEVELOPMENT IN POOR PRO`INCES PROMJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum on a
proposed Development Credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 93.2
million, the equivalent of US$130 million, on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 35 years, to help finance a project for the development of
educatio. in poor areas of China.  The proceeds of the Credit will be
relent to the participating provinces for 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, with no interest. Provinces :rill be responsible for the foreign
exchange risk, and will pay 1 percent per annum service charge and 0.5
percent per annum commitment fee for amounts onlent in foreign exchange.
For amounts onlent in local currency, provinces will pay up to 3 percent
per annum service charge. The provincial governments will onlend a portion
of the Credit proceeds to participating municipalities and counties on the
same terms as those from the Government of China (GOC) to the provinces or
on more concessional terms.
BackEr'-n-
2.          The management and financing of education activities in China
has been shifting over the last few years from a centralized to a
decentralized structure. Re3ponsibility has increasingly been delegated
from central and provincial to local authorities (prefectures, munici-
palities and counties). Apart from a few key universities, the central
government no longer manages nor does it directly finance education
activities. Higher education is now mostly run by provincial bureaus,
secondary education by prefectural, municipal and county bureaus, and
primary education by cities and townships.
3.          As a result of this decentralization process, poor villages and
remote rural schools have been encountering difficulties in upgrading the
quality of education. In rural areas, the commune education committee has
been gradually replaced by Village Education Bureaus. Primary school
teachers, previously selected and paid by the commune, are now selected and
paid by Village Education Bureaus. About 50 percent of the teachers are in
the government budget and are called gongban teachers, while the remaining
50 percent, called minban teachers, receive a small subsidy from the
government and the rest of the pay is provided by the villagers, mostly in
kind (housing and food).  Improving the conditions of these minban teachers
and guaranteeing that they remain in the rural schools are formidable chal-
lenges for the Chinese education authorities. Village Education Bureaus
are also expected to increase enrollment and school completion ratios.
Currently, although more than 95 percent of the children enroll in school,
only 50 percent of children in rural areas finish the primary school cycle.
In many of the poor rtral areas, schools are dilapidated and there is a
shortage of books and appropriate teaching materials.
4.          Regarding the higher education system, a large expansion took
place during the 1980s. Enrollments doubled from about one to two million
students. It is now recognized that this expansion was carried out in many
provinces without sufficient attention to issues of costs and economies of



-2-
scale. Small and narrowly specialized provincial universities and colleges
were established with high unit costs, low student-teacher ratios, and poor
match 'ith the labor markets. The average size of Chinese higher education
institutions is only 1,920 students, and there are many institutions with
less than 500 students. The average teaching load of university teachers
is four to five hours a week, significantly below the average of nine hours
in the rest of the world. Due to high unit costs, higher education
expenditures have been growing at a fast pace, resulting in relatively
small or stagnant growth in expenditures in other levels of education. The
government has, therefore, recognized that it is necessary to rationalize
the structure of the higher education system before any expancion takes
place. Provincial Education Bureaus are actively seeking models and
mechanisms to consolidate universities, merge small ones, and reorganize
the internal structure to make better use of staff and facilities.
5.          It is expected that as reforms of universities and
decentralization of the education system proceed, accountability and
responsiveness of education to new local economic realities and demands
will be increased. However, the economically backward localities will find
themselves increasingly disadvantaged in their efforts to offer educational
opportunities to all children, and the small and poorly financed,
provincial universities will find it harder to adopt more efficient
managerial structures. Moreover, with further decentralization, local
education bureaus will find themselves trying to manage complex structures
for which they are weakly prepared. Wastage and inefficiency in the use of
scarce resources are also likely to increase. For these reasons, the
provincial governments need to establish a clear set of policies, adequate
incentives and appropriate monitoring mechanisms to continue the process of
decentralization, improve the management of resources at provincial and
local levels and encourage efficiency and quality improvements. The sector
report China:  Provincial Education Management and Finance (Report No.
8657-CHA) provides guidance on policies and programs that could help
Chinese education institutions to cope with new challenges imposed by
decentralization, and financial and economic reforms. The proposed project
is based on these recommendations.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
6.          IDA has supported the development of higher education in China
with four successive projects and has assisted the central government in
the provision of textbooks, improved teacher training, and expansion of
vocational education. It has alsv supported three medium-sized cities in
their efforts to improve the plarning and management of education
resources. It has also financed a successful project in Gansu province
that has in a short time achieved significant improvements in expanding
lower secondary schools and training of teachers.  The proposed project
would complement and expand Bank's previous efforts by adopting a stronger
provincial focus involving provincial and county level managers in planning
and implementing project activities. The focus is on improving the
capacity to plan and manage a decentralized education system by the intro-
duction of quality and efficiency improvements at local and institutional
levels. It will be the first Bank-assisted project in China that finances
primary schools, as well as covering education activities in poor and
remote rural areas in a comprehensive way. It will also be the first



- 3 -
project that involves county level bureaus in planning and implementing an
IDA-financed project. Because of its experience in other cour.tries, IDA is
well placed to support efforts under the proposed project, to assist the
government in designing more effective and efficient structures for its
higher education institutions, and in introducing at the basic education
level managerial practices that are new to China but which have been
successfully implemented in other countries. (Examples of experiences from
other countries include the rationalization of higher education
institutions through mergers and internal reorganizations, the use of
multi-grade teaching, the introduction of management information systems
and the systematic monitoring and evaluation of reform activities).
Proiect Objectives
7.          The overall aim is to assist the Government in initiating
institutional and policy reforms needed to improve the management of
education and its quality and efficiency within a decentralized and more
equitable framework. To this end the project would support three main
objectives: (a) to improve efficiency and quality of primary and lower
secondary schools with the aim of achieving an effective nine-year
compulsory education system; (b) to support the development and
restructuring of higher level education and the efficient use of resources
by colleges and universities; and (c) to improve provincial and county-
level education planning, financing and management systems.
Project DescriRtion
8.          To support the implementation of the compulsory education
system, the project will finance investments needed in small towns and
rural areas to encourage reforms 'n municipal and county education
services. These reforms include: increasing the number of complete
schools (i.e., those that offer all grades of primary education) by
increasing multi-graded classes; provision of free textbooks to very poor
children; improving resource management by increasing the workload of urban
teachers and the budget for non-salary items, improving quality related
school inputs such as library books and teaching aids; improving the
qualifications of teachers, especially of rural teachers; and increasing
the share of investment resources for poor and disadvantaged small
villages. Specific investments include construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance of schools, equipment, books and furniture. To assist the
process of restructuring higher education, the project will support pilot
projects in selected universities that are attempting to improve efficiency
through internal reorganization and mergers. The restructuring includes
rationalization of departments to reduce narrow specialization and to
provide broader courses that increase the flexibility of graduates.
Finally, to imnrove planning and management of provincial and county
education bureaus, the project will support adoption, in project counties,
of the software already developed in China to collect and analyze data on
teachers, students, infrastructure and resources. It will also inprove the
student examination systems and the bureaus' capacity to do research and to
prepare future investment plans.

Proiect I.nplementation
9.          The Basic Education Component will be carried out in 114
counties. At the provincial level, a Project Unit will deal with day-to-
day operations. It will be assisted at the county level by a Project
Implementation Leading Group. Staff in all these units have been closely
associated with project prepzrn.ion and have started to receive training in
project implementation.  The provvncial education bureaus will coordinate
the higher education and the planning components. The State Education
Commission (SEdC) will coordinate the monitoring and evaluation of project
activities. A Chinese panel of experts will be organized and financed
under the project and will be responsible for identifying and selecting
consultants for the technical assistance components, review terms of
reference for fellowships and study tours and assist in dissemination of
findings for special studies.
10.         The total project cost is estimated to be US$204.9 million, net
of duties and taxes, with a foreign exchange component of US$40.3 million
(20 percent). The proposed Credit would finance about 63 percent of total
costs with the couxitty and provincial governments financing the balance. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the disburse-
ment schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project pro-
cessing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Cnina are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, Report No.
10010-CHA, dated February 11, 1992 is being distributed separately. A map
is also attached.
11.         Sustainability.  Under present financial circumstances in
China, it is difficult to present a set of indicators that would ensure
availability of finarcial resources to sustain the levels of investment
required to carry out the proposed education reforms in very poor counties.
County, municipal and township finances have been restructured recently and
there is no record of performance under present finance laws. However, in
addition to government assurances that education will continue to have a
high priority and that expenditures for education will continue to grow,
there are several positive indications of program sustainability:
(a) population growth is expected to continue to be small, and the school
population will not grow more than 2 to 3 percent in the coming decade;
(b) provinces involved will most likely continue to have a rate of economic
growth of 4 to 5 percent per annum in the coming years; and (c) if the
current allocation of 10 percent of the total government budget is
earmarked for education, China will be able to provide the required
resources to school all children.
Agreed Actions
12.         The provinces have agreed to:  (a) carry-out action plans
designed to improve access, efficienc- and quality of basic education;
(b) provide IDA with a construction pian for each participating county
prepared on the basis of criteria acceptable to the Association;
(c) prepare a school maintenance plan during the first year of the project
to be carried out during the following years; (d) carry out on an annual
basis, maintenance of the equipment provided to secondary schools,



including provision of spare parts; (e) prepare a plan to revise the
sti?ucture of pre-service teacher training in project provinces; and
(f) make arrangements satisfactory to IDA for the development of software
for the MIS and training of staff.
13.         The Central Government provided assurances that it will:
(a) participate in a mid-term review of the progress of carrying out the
project by no later than June 30, 1995; (b) select a project province that
will prepare a comprehensive plan of reform of its higher education system,
and assist the province to prepare the pian; and (c) disseminate
experiences learned in implementing the .. &her education component.
Program Objective Categories
14.         The project has a strong poverty alleviation focus.  It will be
implem#'ited in 114 poor counties selected among 607 counties of the six
participating provinces. Together, there are 36 million people in the 114
counties. No GNP data is available for the selected counties but income
levels can be compared using the farmer's cash income per capita which
gives a good indication of the extreme level of poverty in the selected
counties. The average farmer's cash income ranges from 206 Yuans in the
selected counties of Guizhou to 374 Yuans in the selected counties of
Hunan. The average for China is 450 Yuans.
Benefits
15.         The primary beneficiaries of the Credit will be the children,
mainly rural and poor, who will be able to attend primary school and
complete their basic education with better quality and relevance. Improved
basic education will lead to higher literacy and higher productivity of
rural areas. The Credit will also develop the education services by
improving the efficiency of selected universities, and providing the
central and provincial governments with the capacity to pilot institutional
reforms needed in China to expand and improve university programs. As a
result of the proposed reforms, universities will be more cost-efficient
and will provide better-trained professionals needed in a more dynamic
labor market. Activities supported by the Credit will also supply models
for the implementing of reforms in China's use of education resources,
particularly in poorer areas. The project will place special emphasis on
increasing girls' participation rates in primary, secondary and higher
education.
Risks
16.         The principal risk lies in the ability of the provincial
governments to manage project impiementation and to provide counterpart
funds. There are a large number of provincial, municipal and local
institutions involved in implementing the project and the manageria.
structure in the provincial education bureaus is weak. To minimize the
risk, technical assistance and training will be provided to support
institution building and detailed monitoring plans will be prepared to
allow rapid identification of problems and adoption of corrective measures.
Careful project preparation with detailed implementation plans will also
mitigate the institutional weaknesses. A second risk is the possible lack



-6-
of counterpart funding ill the poorest counties. The six provinces have
committed themselves to resolve this problem by providing special funds
earmarked for the implementation of this project. The challenge lies in
being able to target these resources to make sure they reach the poorer
areas. Detailed financial plans and well-conceived monitoring instruments
have been prepared to mitigate this risk.
Recommed,ation
17.           I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend thaz the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
