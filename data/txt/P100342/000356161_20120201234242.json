Some lessons\n            learned includes: Despite Government of Nepal (GON) having a\n            high interest in constructing two Bio-safety Level 3\n            Laboratory (BSL3) laboratories, their sustainability,\n            including cost benefit, should have been more carefully\n            analyzed at appraisal. The project also managed media\n            through local and national daily briefings during\n            containment. This was also supported by training for media\n            spokespersons. The three agencies set up a communication\n            task force soon after the project became effective and\n            worked closely in developing common prevention messages and\n            focusing their delivery in 26 high-risk districts."}, "docdt": "2012-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
