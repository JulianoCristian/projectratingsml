P100342 will be reallocated as follow:

2.      Further to the project restructuring approved in March 5, 2010, which cancelled
SDR 1.46 million related to the cancellation of the construction of two Bio-Security
Laboratories Level 3 (BSL3), there was a substantial progress in project implementation,
in particular the animal health component implemented by DOLS. As of December
2010, the disbursement rate has reached 76%. The avian influenza (AI) outbreak in
Chitwan in October 2010 was detected through the project surveillance activities and
successfully contained.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary for DOLS to prevent and manage the
potential outbreaks in coming winter months, when the H5N1 virus is most active in
Nepal, Bangladesh and India. Despite the project expenditure has reached only 57%,
DOLS indicates that the funds have already been committed to civil works and
equipments with the balance of US$ 200,000 until the end of the project, i.e., July 31,


                                             2
2011. The requested reallocation is, therefore, to provide continued support for field
veterinary services, enhancement of laboratory capacity and project coordination unit.
