Avian Influenza Control Project are to minimize the threat\n            posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans\n            in Nepal by controlling such infections among birds,\n            especially domestic poultry, and preparing for, controlling,\n            and responding to possible human infections, especially an\n            influenza epidemic and related emergencies. The project\n            components include: animal health - this component will\n            support national prevention and control strategies; human\n            health - this component aims to prevent a human influenza\n            epidemic caused by HPAI, project management - this component\n            will support the strengthening of public agencies for the\n            coordination and management of the Project; and\n            communication - this programme is cross-cutting and\n            underpins both the animal health and human health components\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "2006-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
