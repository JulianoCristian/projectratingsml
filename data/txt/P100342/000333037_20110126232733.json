The reallocation\n            is necessary for Department of Livestock (DOLS) to prevent\n            and manage the potential outbreaks in coming winter months,\n            when the Influenza A (H1N1) and Avian Influenza (H5N1) virus\n            is most active in Nepal, Bangladesh and India. Despite the\n            project expenditure has reached only 57 percent, DOLS\n            indicates that the funds have already been committed to\n            civil works and equipments with the balance of US$ 200,000\n            until the end of the project, i.e., July 31, 2011.
