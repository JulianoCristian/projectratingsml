                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objectives of the Project are to minimize the threat in Nepal posed to humans by HPAI infection and other zoonotic diseases by controlling such
                         infections among domestic poultry and to prepare for, control, and respond to an influenza epidemic and other related infectious disease emergencies in
                         humans. These objectives will be achieved in three ways: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. If these goals are
                         achieved, the proposed Project will reduce the burden of disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection and the loss of productivity
                         attributable to human infections in Nepal and limit the spread to other countries as well.

                         outbreaks since October 2010. The disbursement remains at 84 percent as of end-October 2011. However, the Bank FM has confirmed that all the project funds have been spent at
                         the district level. Both the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) and the Department of Health Services (DOHS) must collect the statements from the cost centers and submit
                         those to the Bank by the end of the grace period, which is November 30, 2011.
