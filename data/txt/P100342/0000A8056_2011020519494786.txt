                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objectives of the Project are to minimize the threat in Nepal posed to humans by HPAI infection and other zoonotic diseases by controlling such
                         infections among domestic poultry and to prepare for, control, and respond to an influenza epidemic and other related infectious disease emergencies in
                         humans. These objectives will be achieved in three ways: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. If these goals are
                         achieved, the proposed Project will reduce the burden of disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection and the loss of productivity
                         attributable to human infections in Nepal and limit the spread to other countries as well.
