development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: investments in laboratory equipment and\n            civil works may be inefficient if they outstrip the\n            financial and technical capacity of staff to operate and\n            maintain them. Failure to adjust compensation rates for\n            inflation and other price increases can reduce the real\n            value of compensation payments. Flat rate compensation\n            mechanisms may be simple, but can cause problems when they\n            do a poor job of tracking the value of what is compensated\n            (for example, ducks may be worth much more than chickens).\n            Attempts to control spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian\n            Influenza (HPAI) in poultry at the border may have limited\n            effectiveness countries with long, porous borders.\n            Containing an influenza epidemic or pandemic among humans is\n            likely to be extremely difficult in countries with modest\n            public health infrastructure. Collaboration with United\n            Nations agencies can provide technical expertise that the\n            World Bank lacks, but there can be delays in implementation\n            if there is insufficient engagement of these agencies at a\n            headquarters level. The lack of dedicated procurement expert\n            can contribute to delays in implementation and an inability\n            to meet emergency goals. Procurement capacity needs to be\n            frontloaded to get good procurement plans finished early on,\n            to hasten rollout of emergency projects. Culling birds at\n            the source of an outbreak and nearby farms can be sufficient\n            if done quickly enough. Vaccination of poultry may be the\n            wrong strategy to use for reducing disease risk in low\n            capacity countries."}, "docdt": "2013-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
