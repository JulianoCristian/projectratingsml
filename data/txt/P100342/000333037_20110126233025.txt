7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The overall objectives of the Project are to minimize the threat in Nepal posed to humans by HPAI 
infection and other zoonotic diseases by controlling such infections among domestic poultry and to prepare 
for, control, and respond to an influenza epidemic and other related infectious disease emergencies in 
humans.  These objectives will be achieved in three ways: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; 
and (iii) response and containment.  If these goals are achieved, the proposed Project will reduce the 
burden of disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection and the loss of productivity 
attributable to human infections in Nepal and limit the spread to other countries as well.
