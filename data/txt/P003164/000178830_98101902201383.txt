INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPRNT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ZESCO FOR THE
KAFr.TE HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$115.0 million to
the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited (ZESCO) for the
construction of a storage dam at Itezhi Tezhi, a 300 MW extension of the
Kafue power station and a 60 km, 330 kv transmission line. The loan would
have a term of 25 years, including 5'2 years of grace, with interest at
7¼ percent per annum, and be guaranteed by the Republic of Zambia.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Zambiar
was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 1d, 1973 (R73-11).
A summary of this report together with an account of development silce
January, 1973 was presented in the President's Report dated May 15, 1973
(PA-1229a-ZA) on the loan to Zambia for the third edacation project, and
is attached in Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
3.        As of April 30, 1973 the Bank had made thirteen loans to Zambia
totalling $178.6 million after cancellations, of which $123.9 million is
now held by the Bank. IFC made its first investment in Zambia in February,
1972, providing $1.1 million for expansion of a shoe manufacturing
company.  Present and future Bank operations have been discussed in the
President's Report on the third education project dated May 15, 1973 and
are summarized in Annex II which also contains a statement of Bank and
IFC operations as of April 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects. A President's Report on a proposed program loan to Zambia was
distribu--ed on May 25, 1973.
PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
4.        Mining, which dominates the Zambian economy by contributing about
98 percent of foreign exchange earnings and employing 16 percent of the wage
labor force, is by far the largest consumer of electricity. Copper is the
most important mineral and in 1972 the copper industry consumed 92 percent
of electricity consumption. Manufacturing industry has increased its elec-
tricity consumption by about 20 percent annually in recent years, but its
share of total consumption is still small. Per capita consumption is about
1,000 1Wh which is high for an African country, but comparable to per capita
consumption in other copper producing countries such as Chile. All principal



-2-
cities, industrial centers, and the majority of towns along the line-of-rail
from Livingstone to the Copperbelt are supplied with electric power, but
the more remote areas are not serviced. Almos-t half of the people in urban
areas have access to electricity compared to 2.5 percent in rural areas.
In the past, electricity consumption grew by 6½ percent a year, but for
the future a faster growth of 7 tc 8 percent is expected mainly because of
a large copper expansion program and changing technology in the copper
industry.
5.        Total generating capacity in Zambia is presently 843 M4W comprising
108 mW at Victoria Falls, 600 MW at Kafue I and 135 mW from small thermal
stations. Generating capacity presently available to the interconnected
system serving Zambia and Southern Rhodesia is 1884 MW and is adequate to
meet the estimated maximum demand until shortly before the Kariba North
project on the Zambian side of the Zambezi River is commissioned in late
1975. The construction of the Kariba North station which is being assisted
by a Bank loan, will add 600 MW capacity to the interconnected system. By
1977 another 300 MW generating capacity would be required and this would
be met by the proposed project.
6.        The major wholesale supplier of electric power to Zambia as well
as to Southern Rhodesia is the Central African Power Corporation (CAPC)
which owns the Kariba dam and the South Bank power station, and transmits
power from this and other sources over its extensive 330 kv grid. The CAPC,
established following the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and
Nyasaland in 1963, is jointly owned and operated by Zambia and Southern
Rhodesia. The Corporation is controlled by a Higher Authority for Power
(HAP) comprising members from both Zambia and Southern Rhodesia. Following
Southern Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965,
Zambia refused to recognize the members appointed from Southern Rhodesia to
the HAP and CAPC. In spite of UDI, CAPC has continued to carry out its
day-to-day operations under a management committee, and the interconnected
system has operated efficiently for over a decade.
7.        Other distributors of power in Zambia are the Copperbelt Power
Company (CPC), owned 51 percent by government and 49 percent by the
government-controlled mining companies, and ZESCO, which is wholly owned
by the government. CPC purchases power from CAPC to supply the copper
companies; and ZESCO is engaged in bulk production, transmission, and
retail supply to all users in Zambia except for the mines and mine townships.
In addition to a few small, isolated hydro-electric and thermal stations,
ZESCO operates three hydro-electric generating stations at Victoria Falls
and the Kafue Stage I hydro-electric development. Bulk power from these
sources is sold to the CAPC but ZESCO also purchases power from the CAPC
grid for its retail supply. Until 1972, energy was imported from Zaire
for use in the CAPC system. However, Zaire no longer has excess energy
and has indicated it -ould like to import from CAPC's system from 1973
onwards.
8.        Future planned development in the electric power sector to 1978
besides this project,consists of the expansion of (a) CAPC's 330 kv



-3-
transmission system in Zambia and Southern Rhodesia, and (b) ZESCOs dis-
tribution system. Additional generating capacity, expected to be required
by 1979, is likely to be met most economically and conveniently by a third
stage of Kafae (450 MW) and a further expansion of ZESCO's transmission
system. Construction plans for this scheme, however, have not yet been
completed.
9.        Bank lending has been a major factor in developing the inter-
connected system in Zambia and Southern Rhodesia. The first Bank loan
(145-RN) was made in 1956 for the Kariba dam, the adjacent South Bank station
in Southern Rhodesia, and the interconnected 330 kv power system; the second
Bank loan (392-RNS) was made in 1964 for power system extension; the third
Bank loan (701-ZA) was made in 1970 for the Kariba North Bank station; and
the proposed loan would be the fourth loan in support of the power sector
in Zambia. A supplementary loan to help finance a cost overrun on the
Kariba North Bank project is also contemplated (see Annex II).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
10.       An Appraisal Report entitled "Zambia - Appraisal of Kafue II Hydro-
electric Project (Stage II)" No. 86a-ZA dated May 7, 1973 is being circulated
separately. A Loan and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
11.       The Project was prepared by government and ZESCO with assistance
from their consultants, the Swedish Consulting Group (SWECO). The Project
was appraised in the field in August and October 1972, and negotiations
were held in mid-April, 1973. Mr. E. C. Chibwe, Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Finance, led the Zambian delegation, which included MIr. P. Siwo,
Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Power, Transport and Works, and Mr. B.
1Munyama, Chairman of ZESCO.
Description and Purpose
12.       The Project would form Stage II of a program for the hydro-electric
development of the Kafue River - a tributary of the Zambezi and a major source
of low cost power in Zambia. The first stage was completed in April, 1972
at a cost of $118 million and consisted of a dam at Kafue Gorge and 600 ml
of installed generating capacity.
13.       The Project would consist of a storage dam across the river at
Itezhi Tezhi (250 Ion upstream from the Stage I powerhouse), a 300 }W
extension of the Stage I power station, and a 60 km, 330 kv transmission
line connecting the power station with the CAPC grid at Kafue town. The
600 M4W Stage I station presently operates with little water storage and
generates 3600 Gwh annually, on average, of which 1800 Gwh is firm. This
firm output would increase to 5200 Gwh on completion of the Project and,
together with the output from the two additional generators, would enable
total annual generation to increase to about 6200 Gwh0 Stage III would
involve the installation of 450 MS; immediately downstream from the Stage I
powerhouse.



Execution
14.       The Project would be undertaken by ZESCQ.; SWECO would supervise
its construction. Construction of the dam is expected to commence during
the latter half of 1973. Partial filling of the reservoir is planned for
1976 and the generating units are scheduled to be installed by the end of
that year.
15.       The geological formation of the dam site comprises granite overlain
by mudstone rock and alluvium overburden. Granite would not be available
as part of the immediate foundation for the dam in the valley portion but
the mudstone rock would offer adequate support for the proposed dam. The
alluvium would be removed to the fTull depth under the central portion of
the dam structure.  As there are some faults in the area, the geological
conditions, sources of construction material, and project design were reviewed
by an international Board of Consultants comprising wellknown experts.
They concluded that the system does not constitute an attive fault pattern
and that there should be no major construction problems.
16.       Nearly all of ZESCO's senior staff are expatriates, and there is
a shortage of experienced Zambian staff at all levels. However, ZESCO is
making extensive efforts to train and recruit staff to keep pace with its
expanding operations and is receiving substantial technical assistance
from Sweden. To help ensure that competent management would be maintained
assurances have been obtained that the Bank would be consulted on appoint-
ments to the posts of Chief Engineer and Financial Controller, and that
ZESCO would recruit experienced staff to fill vacant key positions.
Pro ect Costs and Financing Plan
17. *     The cost of the Project, excluding interest during construction,
is estimated at US$137.7 million equivalent. Not including physical and
price contingencies, civil works account for $58.9 million equivalent and
generating plant and trar-smissilon equipment for $17.2 milllion equivalent.
A3sessments of the Project cost were wade by the Project consultants and
also an independent firm of consul-tan-ts. In addition, after prior review
by the Banks bid invitations were issued for construction of the main dam on
the basis of international competitive bidding. The tenders were opened in
JannaUr,v 1973 and the contract has been awarded to Imprdgilo-Recchi,9  Italian
fivM, a4t a price aboMut 25 peraent less than the canauItanrts' cost -etmate.
The consu'tdnts' earlier cost estimate has been reduced accordingly.
18.       The contingencies included in the cost estimates still amount to
$h7.0 Pdllion. These are high but justified considering recent cost esca-
lations on civil works projects in Zambia and uncertain transport conditions
in the area.
19       The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of the
Project, estimated at $96.3 million equivalent, and interest during construction
oxI the Bank loan, estimated at $18.7 million equivalent. The total Bank
loan would thus be $115 million. The loan would be for a period of 25 years
including a 52 year grace period.  The local costs of the Project, estimated



at $41.4 million equivalent, would be financed by borrowing from the govern-
ment on terms samil±ar to the proposed Bank loan. The Government of Zambia
has agreed to provide any additional funds required to complete the Project.
ZESCO1s Financial Condition
20.     ZESCO, incorporated in December, 1969, was established to take over
the existing power supply undertakings in Zambia, other than CAPC and the
Kariba North Bank Company. The takeover of these entities brought a number
of problems which have to be taken into account when assessing ZESCO's
financial position. Firstly, the organizations acquired were financed
entirely by long-term debt and a small government grant. As a result, ZESCO's
capital structure as of June 30, 1972 contained little equity. Secondly,
because of inadequate rates and difficult operating conditions, ZESCO's
predecessors obtained insufficient revenues, and the combined operations of
ZESCO therefore produced a net loss during 1970/71.
21.       Measures are being undertaken to improve ZESCO's financial position.
The preliminary operating results for 1971/72 indicate a net income of about
Kl.l million. A significant upward revision of ZESCO's bulk supply tariffs
to CAPC from the Victoria Falls and Kafue stations is currently being nego-
tiated and is expected to be implemented by the end of the year. A
25 percent increase in ZESCO's retail tariffs - from which it derives the
bulk of its operating revenues - has been approved by government and will
become effective July 1, 1973. These revised retail tariffs, which would
be put into effect before the proposed loan becomes effective, would signi-
ficantly improve ZESCO's financial position. The appraisal forecasts, based
on ZESCO's present bulk supply tariffs to CAPC and the revised retail tariffs,
indicate that ZESCO would achieve an annual rate of return on its net fixed
assets of at least 8 percent and contribute a minimum of 25 percent to the
cost of expansion (including Kafue III) to 1977. Assurances have been
obtained during negotiations that ZESCO would take all necessary steps to
earn an 8 percent return from 1974/75 and that the government would take
necessary measures to enable it to do so. In addition, it was agreed that
ZESCO would not incur any debt without prior Bank approval unless maximun
future debt service is covered at least 1.4 times.
22.       To improve its capital structure, ZESCO has asked the government
to convert to equity one half of K40h2 million of debt which was assumed
when ZESCO took over existing undertakings. No action has yet been taken
since the government is presently reviewing its general policy towards its
investments in all parastatal organizations. During negotiations, the
government agreed that it would not ask for repayment of any portion of this
debt during the construction period of the Project if such repayment would
have a material and adverse effect on ZESCO's ability to meet its financial
requirements. However, even if this debt were not converted into equity,
the gradual accumulation of retained earnings is expected to improve the
debt/equity ratio to 82/18 by 1979/80.
23.       In 1972, the government transferred the Kafue Project - Stage I
to ZESCO in exchange for a K84 million loan. Although the asset and liability



have been recorded on. 7S.JCO1s books, and thus do not affect the financial
structu-re of ZESCO, the transaction has yet to be completed. During the
negotiations it was agreed that as a condition of effectiveness the govern-
ment vest in ZE3CO the legal title to these assets and thle loan agreement
be sigcned.
24.       As each of the organizations acquired boy ZESCO used different
accounting systems and procedures, and. in some cases had improperly maintained
records, ZESCO faced difficult problems in establishing proper accounting
records.  ZESCO has engaged an accounting firm to serve as auditors and to
assist in the establishment of a proper accounting system.  An assurance
has been obtained -that ZESCO3 w.ill continue to employ auditors satisfactory
to the Bank.
',arket for Energy Produced
25.       The facilities, scheduled to be installed by 1977, are designed
to meet the needs of the interconnected system serving both Zambia and
Southern Rhodesia and all of the energy produced will be sold to CAPC.  Sales
by CAPC have been increasing at an average rate of 9 percent per annum
during the last seven years. CAPC's sales during 1973/80 are forecast to
increase at 8 percent oer arnnum to a total of 16,100 Gwh, excluding possible
sales to Zaire. Sales in. Zambia are expected to increase by '7 percent per
.nnuum to a total of 7900 Gwh in 1980, and in Southern -Rhodesia by 10 per
annum to a. total of 83500 Gwh-h in 1980.
26.       Pespite MD3I, t'ie CAPC has continued to function as a joinu entityr
and has operated the system writh great savings to both Zambia -and Southern
Rhodesia. If th.e interconnected system, in spite of the two countries'
continuous support, should break down, the hydroelectric resources within
Zambia  would barely meet the estimated requirements in 1977 and the program
of construction of the Itezni Tezhi dam would therefore be appropriate.
Under these circumstances the extension of the Kafue power station could
be postponed for about 2 years; however, if Zambia were to meet the indicated
Zaire power requirements, the phasing of the project would be justified as
proposed.
27.      ila)dmum demand on the CAPC system is expected to reach 2460 MW in
1980 with energy requirements at that time reaching 1'7000 Gwh. '1ithout the
KaTue Stage II project, shortages of capacity would be experienced in 1978
and shortages in firm energy resources would occur in 1977. By 1980, these
shortages would amount to 507 14.d and 5000 Gwh respectively.
28.       The energy supply position would also be difficult until the
cormmissioning of TKariba IJorth if there is a period of less than average
rainfall.  To protect against a possible shortage, the government has agreed
to consider, among other mneasures, a temporary increase in the lake level
of the Ktafue Stage I reservoir by 1.2 m. This would only affect some
marginal pasture land0
Economic Justification and B,enefits
29.       The proposed Project is the most economic source of the additional
power required. Investigations by CkPC and ZESCO of other possible sources



-7-
(i.e. hydro-electric development on the Zambezi downstream from Kariba, or
thermal stations in Zambia or Southern Rhodesia) have shown that costs of
these alternatives would be considerably higher than Kafue II. It would
meet CAPC's needs for increased energy, and as such be complementary to
investments in additional mining capacity necessary to increase Zambia's
foreign exchange earnings, government revenue and employment.
30.         The economic return on investment in the Proiect is at least
18 percent. It ivas calculated using revenues assessed on the basis of
average energy generation and CAPC's prevailing average retail tariff and
therefore represents a conservative estimate of the return on the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
31.         All goods and services costing over $20,000 would be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. The Bank loan would be disbursed to finance 70 percent of
the total cost of civil works, the c.i.f. cost of the equipment and the
foreign cost of the engineering services. A preference margin of 15 per-
cent would be given to Zambian suppliers of equipment. The loan also provides
retroactive financing not exceeding $3.0 million for certain preliminary
civil works expenditures incurred after July 1, 1972 and for engineering
costs incurred after January 1, 1973.
Environmental Aspects
32.         The ecological aspects of the Project have been examined, and
no serious problems are expected. The most significant impact of the
Project on the environment is the elimination of flooding on the flats
below the dam in dry years. Such flooding is responsible for much of the
grass upon which a large number of cattle and wildlife survive.   The
reservoir, therefore, will include a sufficient volume of water in addition
to that required for the power discharges to induce a degree of flooding
necessary to reproduce the natural condition. The reservoir, which would
partly be located within Kafue National Park, would not affect any settle-
ments.  rlith time, the reservoir is likely to become important for fishing.
33.         Tse-tse flies and snail hosts of schistosmiasis are common in
the area. As these would present health hazards to the temporary labor
force, the contractor for the Project would be responsible for ensuring
that satisfactory sanitary and health measures are established and enforced.
The nature of these measures was indicated in the bidding documents for
the Itezhi Tezhi dam, and would also be outlined in those for the powerhouse
extensions.

P.ART V - LEGAL I'NSTRUTMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Loan Agreement between ZESCO and the Bank, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Zambia and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
loan documents conform to the normal pattern for loans for power projects.
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of t,he Bank.
PART VI - RECO?I4ENDATIOiT
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

1.        The econormy of Zambia is dominated byr the copper industry, which
contributes nearly 40 percent of GOP, 95 percent of exports and, up to 1970,
60 percent of government revenue. It, follows that the world copper price
has a large and pervasive effect on the economy. Since independence in
19614, copper pRices have been notoriously unstable, fluctuating between
.1700 and K1,300 per ton. Because the government has no adequate instruments
to insulate itself from the vagaries of the copper market, the economyr; is
inherentlly unstable.
2_       (GNP per capita is relatively high (estimated at +;3f5 in 1.971)  ut
there is a distinct contrast between the modern sector and the traditional
rural sector. The modern sector is concentrated in the Copperbel t !iovin-e
uhere the mining activity is locatecl and along the rlline-of-rail' whiLch is
the central area of the country where Earopearn farmers settled in the
colonial era and a numib)er of industries have been established. Almost
half the nopulation lives in the Copperbelt and near the line-of-rail, :-n
i7i :nvci1_ved in tile ,nodern sectcr. The rest of the popul:.-tion is sca.rcI
over the country and is riainl,r engaged in small-scale agriCahure.

caused a great strain on the administrative capacity of the countrv.
In the Second .ational Developmexit Plal 1972-1976 (SiDE), the
g-eneral. economic and soci;.l goals mentioned above are restated.  H1owever,
the Plan recognizes -that in spite of all effort w.hich mLight be made to ,tcp
the flowr of people leaving rural areas, this wil.l not preverit all such
rmovements. It therefore stresses the need to further develop the modern
sector, incl-iding lnining.  In. the past, expendituire for agriculture was
thirl- sprea.d over the country, with little impact anywhere. Under l.h.-
'1'), the government intends to concentrate its efforts in a numlDer of -1reas
wJith suificient potential where an integrated approach to rural development
will be attenipted.
5.        Economic developments in 1970 and 1971 are in sharp contrast with
those up to 1969. Between 1964 and 1969, gross national income at constan.t
prices grew on the average by a]Tost 17 percent a year. `Iore than half of

this increase, however, resulted from the improvement in terms of trade,
(rising copper prices), 1.) percent from a relative decline of factor
payments abroad, and 5.5-6 percent1 from the physical increase in production
(GD1).  The sharp increase in world copper prices had placed Zambia in a
strong financial Position, The government's Dudget and the balance of
payments procuced growing surp-luses.  in the course ot 1970, however, the
econulTc tide turned as a result of a combination of unfavorable factors.
b.        The two most important factors were no doubt the sharp decline
in copper prices in the second half of 1970 from K1200 to K780 a ton and,
in September 1970, the partial flooding of the Mufulira mine which accounted
for 25 percent of Zarnbia's copper output. As a result of lower copper
prices and production losses, the value of copper output in 1971 was 40 per-
cent lower than in 1969. GNP per capita is estimated to have fallen from
$425 in 196? to about $3~5 in 1971.
7.        The decline L-         and output of copper had, of course, also
strong adverse effects on governinent revenue and the balance of payments.
The deterioration in the budgetary situation, however, was comipounded by
two additional factors: f-irst, recurrent expenditures had been allowed to
increase sharTply, and, second, government reverrue from tne miring sector
declined also sharply because ot new capital allowances granted under the
1969 Master Agreement governing state participation in the mining industry.
Pre-viously, capital depreciation allowances were based on estmated asset
life, out, in order to bDoost production from some 70u,Ouo tons at present
to some 90U,000 tons by 1976, all capital expenditure was made tax deductible
in the year it occurs. This will result in lower revenue in the medium-term,
but increase the taax base substan'tially after completion of the expansion
program in 1976. As a result of the factors mentioned above, the recurrent
budget, which in 1970 still had a surplus of K176 million - more than
enough to finance all development expenditures - showed a deficit of K18
mnillion in 1071.  Foreign reserves declined from a peak of K432 million in
August 1970 to K100 million by June 1972 (3 months' imaports), but this
sharp decline cannot be explained by the unfavorable development of prices
and output of copper alone. There can be little doubt that legal and
illegal capital flight has increased since 1969.   In 1971 alone, it may
have amounted to more than Kloo million, most likely in reaction to the
government's decision to have the country's retail and wholesale business
transferred to Zambian ownership.
b.        During 1972, the government took a number of steps to restore
financial balance. To imiprove the balance of payments, imports of certain
llLxury goods and consumer goods that are also produced locally were
prohibited, and a surtax on dutiable imports was introduced.   Exchange
control regulations were tigh-tened, including measures to curb capital
flight. Preliminary indications are that these measures have had some
success; since June, 1972 the level of external reserves has remained stable
at an equivalent of somewnat over two months' imports.   To improve the
budgetary situatior., new tax measures were introduced in the 1972 and 1973
budgets. Austere spending policies reduced recurrent expenditure in 1972
by nearly a percent.  These policies are to be continued in 1973. Nevertheless,
it appears unlikely that the government will be able to generate any budgetary

savings in 1973. Although by the mid-1970s a substantial increase in
mining revenue can be expected as a result of the expansion program
currently underway, a continuation of the government's policy of increasing
non-mining tax revenue and, at the same time, containing recurrent expendi-
tures is necessary if the government is to make a substantial financial
contribution to its own development budget once again.
9.        To limit deficit financing, government development expenditure
was severely cut in 1972 and 1973 to a level of some K115 million in both
years as compared to levels originally intended under the Second National
Development Plan 1972-1976 of same K175 million in 1972 and K185 million
in 1973. In 1972, the government was ill-prepared for the need to cut
development expenditure. Cuts were made in an indiscriminate way witnout
proper consultation with spending ministries with the result that some
severe disruption in ongoing priority programs occurred. In 1973, the
determination of priorities has been made in a far more rational and
selective manner. Preference has been given to the completion of ongoing
high-priority projects, such as those supporting the copper expansion
program and education. Projects of relatively low priority such as new
roads, improvements and extensions of airports and government office build-
ings have been postponed. The government has recently begun to redefine
priorities and levels of development expenditure for the remainder ot the
plan period (1974-76) in the light of the expected resource availability.
10.       The government is now actively seeking foreign assistance for
projects for the execution of high priority development programs that it
originally intended to finance domestically. But tne government will have
great difficulty during the next two or three years in providing local
counterpart funds to foreign loans, and especially in projects where the
foreign exchange component is low, some local cost financing by external
agencies is required. It will also take some time before disbursements from
new foreign loans will become available. In the interim, to keep deficit
financing within tolerable bounds and to prevent further cuts in the develop-
ment program, it would appear necessary for Zambia to seek quick-disbursing
non-project aid.
11.       Zambia's immediate economic future is clouded by the closure of
the border between Zambia and Rhodesia last January. With the help of a
United Nations .4pecial Mission, the government is drawing up an emergency
program to maintain the country's transport capacity until the Tan-Zam
Railway between Dar es Salaam and Zambia opens in 1975 or 1976. The direct
and indirect economic costs of the border closure are difficult to evaluate.
Volume of exports might not be adversely affected, but since the tonnage
ol imports is roughly twice that of exports, it will be much more difficult
to maintain the normal level of imports. Therefore, in the short-term,
scarcity of raw materials, intermediate goods and equipment is likely to
affect the level of production. However, no decline is expected in copper
production from the 1972 level. The recent increase in copper price may
actually lead to an increase in the value of exports. With lower imports,
production in the rest of the economy would fall and cause a loss in
government revenue, thereby exacerbating the already precarious budgetary
position.



ANNEX I
Page6
12.       The estimated direct cost of the emergency is still highly
uncertain. The Zambian government estimates that in order to maintain
the flow of strictly essential imports, an additional budgetary outlay of
about K44 million would be necessary in 1973. To cover the foreign
exchange cost it has actively tried to mobilize loans and grants from
various governments as well as suppliers' credits. Indications are that
the necessary amounts will be fortncoming. To cover the local cost
connected with the emergency the government intends to increase its
borrowing from the non-banking sector and in the Euro-Dollar market, thereby
avoiding a diversion of funds intended for the development budget.
1j.       Because of its considerable mineral and agricultural development
potential, Zambia's longer-term economic prospects are good despite her
dependence on copper and her landlocked position so far from markets,
provided she continues successfully to weather the recent economic and
political storms. In the future, Zambia's need to borrow will be much
greater than in the past. Because of limited borrowing in the past,
Zambia's debt service obligations are low. Thus, there is considerable
scope for further borrowing abroad at conventional terms. If, for example,
Lambia contracts foreign loans in the amount of $175 million on the
average each year from 1973 through 1985, which would be well above the
level of borrowing in the recent past, the debt service ratio would still
not exceed 10 percent by 1985.

C. PROJECTS IN EXfECUTIoN/l1
Loan No. 562   Industrial Forestry Project:   $5.3 million loan of October 5, 1968;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Execution of the project is making more rapid progress than expected
at the time of appraisal. There is a lack of accountants and the
project management still relies on the services of a member of our
Agriculture Development Service. We have suggested that government
seek technical assistance from bilateral sources until qualified
Zambian acccuantants beccme available. Project costs have proved to
be higher than expected so that the disbursement percentage applicable
to expenditures other than direct imports will have to be reduced
fron 44 to 25.
Loan No. 592   First Education Project:   $17.4 million loan of April ll, 1969;
Closing Date: September 30, 1974
The project became effective in July, 1969, but was initially delayed
some 12-1I4 months due to management problems and prolonged
negotiations regarding studies and the consultant's contract which
eventually led to the efficient and economical modular construction
system ultimately adopted for the project schools. Construction is
now proceeding well. The efficient construction method would have
regained six months of delay but for the government's financial
problems which resulted in a cutback of funds early in 1972 and the
extension of the closing date by 2½ years. The Northern Technical
College (Nortec) item ($1 million) is behind schedule because of a
review of the government's technical education policy which has now
been completed. This review has resulted in greater emphasis on
pre-employment training and less on apprenticeship than originally
envisaged; the school is now being redesigned. The entire project
was to cost US$36.2 million; the government now expects a US$3.41
million cost overrun which it will finance itself.
Loan No. 627   Livestock Development Project:   $2.5 million loan of June 30, 1969;
Closing Date: November 30, 1974
The project was expected to be conpleted by mid-1974 and development
has begun on all but one of the beef ranches. However, progress is
now at a standstill and serious financial problems have emergea.
Financial viability of the Zambia Cattle Development Limited (ZCDL),

regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in
particular to report any problems which are being encountered,
and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

which is responsible for execution, and also of some of the ranches
to be developed under the project, is uncertain. Management problems
and government policy which held down prices on beef and milk while
costs rose rapidly are the principal causes. At the government's
request the Bank and Barclay's Bank, a co-lender, assisted govern-
ment officials in reappraising the project. We concluded that the
project be reduced to include only those components which offer
promise of becoming viable, that management be given authority to
operate fully on a commercial basis, that organizational changes be
introduced to that end, and that prices on beef and milk be raised.
The government has subsequently raised these prices and is consider-
ing the other recommendations.
Loan No. 645   Second Education Project:  $5.3 million loan of November 30, 1969;
Closing Date: August 31, 1973
This project is almost complete, but a delay in the initial stages
caused by periodic building material shortages, contractors limited
managerial capacity and insufficient local representation by one
firm requires a nine months' extension of the Closing Date (to
June, 1974) to allow for the construction guarantee period and for
the closing of the accounts.
Loan No. 685   Commercial Crops Far¶ming Project: $5.5 million loan of June 5, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project is scheduled for completion in mid-1975. After a slow
start, the project is now making satisfactory progress. So far, 66
assisted tenants have been settled, 23 of them since the end of the
last growing season.  During that season, assisted tenants produced
h4o,6g'a kg tobacco, representing 7 percent of the national crop;
yields were slightly above the national average of 901 kg/ha.
Loan No. 701   Kariba North Bank Hydro-electric Power Project: $40.0 million loan
O. juxy 2-9, 1970; Closing Date: July 1, 1976:
'nhe cost of the Kariba North Hydro-electric Project, for which the
Bank made a loan of $40 million in July, 1970 to cover the foreign
exchange expenditure, has turned out substantially higher than
estimated at the time of appraisal. When bids were opened in
October, 1970 it became clear that the foreign exchange expenditure
alone would be more than $10 million higher. That increase was
attributable to world wide price increases on heavy electrical
equip.ent over and above appraisal estimates arnd high contingency
allowances included by contractors in tneir bids for unexpected
expenditures arising from Zambia's position as a land-locked country.
Subsecuently, changes in exchange rates in December, 1971, delayed
provision of access roads to the site and staff housing on the site,
and adverse rock conditions have caused further significant increases
in cost. In addition, the main civil works contractor experienced

Page 5
severe financial difficulties and was forced into receiversnip in
February, 1973. A new contractor has been selected to complete
the main civil works. Construction work has restarted.
Negotiations are now under way to finalize the contract; a work
schedule and revised cost estimates, including the effect of the
recent currency realignments, are being prepared. A supplementary
loan is contemplated as soon as the cost estimates have been
revised.
Loan No. 882   Integrated Family Farmiing Project:  $11.5 million loan of February 2d,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Conditions of effectiveness are likely to be met shortly, but one
month's extension of the termination date of May 28, 1973 might be
required.

Progress on Banl operationls in Zambia has been adversely affected
by the diff.culties Zambia has f"aced over the past few years.  The Unilateral
'.'Beclaration of Independence in Southern Hhodesia in 1965 forced Zambia to
sever her close ties wit' 3outhern Rhodesia at a considerable cost and dis-
ruption to the develocrmenit program.  Shortage of educated and sidlled man-
power has interfered with Iarogress on some proJects while recent cost esca-
lations have caused. d.ifficulties on others, especially the Kariba North Bank
p.ro'.ect.  inally, the sharp fall in copper prices forced the governmnent to
repnase camital expenditures on the first education project for Which the

ment objecti-res of (i) correctin7 the rural-urban imbalance, (ii) distributing
wealth; and (iii) providing- emnlcvent and educational opportunities.   Zambia
hopes to achieve these olbjectives by investments in (a) the power sector

Zambia - Kafue Hydro-electric Project (Stage II)
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:        Zambia Electricity 3apply Corporation (ZESCO)
Guarantor:       Republic of Zambia (GRZ)
Amount:          Various currencies equivalent to US$115 million
Terms:           Interest Rate: 7%
Amortization: 25 years including .5t years of grace
Project
Description:     The main features of the Project to be constructed over
the period 1973-79 are:
(1) a storage dam across the Kafue River at Itezhi Tezhi
consisting of:
(a) rock and earthfill dam, 1500 m in length, and 53 m
maximum height above riverbed, involving about
8 Mm3 of fill;
(b) two diversion tunnels in rock, each with a cross-
sectional area of 190 m2 and a length of 300 m,
incorporating regulating structures and gates; and
(c) concrete chute spillway with three radial gates;
(2) an extension of the Stage I Kafue power station located
250 km downstream from the dam, and consisting of the
installation of two 150 MW generating units with
ancillary civil works and switchyard extensions; and
(3) a 330 kv single circuit transmission line, bo km in
length, connecting the Kafue power station to the
Central African Power Corporation (CAPC) grid at Kafue
town.
In addition to increasing the firm energy of the Kafue power
station, the dam would provide sufficient water storage to
permit additional water discharges in dry years to reproduce
the annual flood cycle downstream of the dam on whicn
present agricultural development depends. The storage
could be increased to allow for possible future irrigated
agriculture on the Kafue Flats. Regulation of the river
flow provided by the Project would also be useful for
subsequent development under a third stage of the Kafue Project.
Estimated Cost:  Project costs are estimated at $137.7 million, with $96.3 mil-
lion (about 70%) in foreign costs and $41.4 million in local
costs. A more detailed breakdown is set forth in the following

Estimated
Disbursements
(US$ thousands):  For the civil works, disbursements would be made against a
percentage of the amount of the contractor's periodic
invoices. For engineering services and equipment, pannents
would >:e made in full on the basis of the foreign costs
of contractors awarded. The schedule of estimated disburse-
ments in US$ thousands is as follows:
73/74   74/75   75/76    76/77   77/78   78/79
19,'00  22,700   26770   19,1450  17,000  17,000
Procurement
Arrangements:      Procurement will be on the basis of internation2l competitive
bidding, except for items involving expenditures of less than
$2C0,000.  These exeempted items would be procured on the
basis of government tendering procedures. The proposed loan
also include retroactive financing for engineering services
since January 1, 1973 and for certain preliminary civil works
started during 1972 and currently under construction. These
:tems are estimated to involve a maximum cost of $3.0 million
equivalent. Bid invitations for construction of the dam were
issued to prospective tenderers after review by the Bank and
an award has been made. Bids for the Kafue power station
extension will be invited by the end of 1973.
