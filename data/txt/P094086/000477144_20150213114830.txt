1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. At the time of preparation of the Balochistan Education Support Project (BESP),
Pakistan was the second most populous country in the South Asia region with a population of
over 150 million. Economic growth had increased from an average of 3.3% during 1997-
2002 to an average of nearly 6% during 2002-05. The 2005 earthquake in the north of
Pakistan had no direct impact on the province of Balochistan and was expected to have a
marginal impact on economic growth.

1.1.2. Balochistan's economy historically has differed from the rest of Pakistan. It is the
poorest of the country's four provinces with standards of living and social indicators lagging
substantially behind the rest of Pakistan. With 43% of the total landmass of the entire country,
the province has only 5% of the country's population. This makes service delivery and
infrastructure development challenging. A large proportion of the population lives in small
and dispersed rural settlements with only 24% of the population living in urban areas.

1.1.3. At the time of appraisal, education attainment in Balochistan reflected the province's
overall low development indicators. Literacy levels were at 37%, lagging far behind those of
the other provinces and the national average of 53%. Low and declining enrollment, large
gender disparities, poor quality of education, lack of continued community focus in
community support programs, limited private sector participation, weak public sector
capacity and limited financial resources were identified as issues affecting education sector
development in the province at the time of appraisal.

1.1.4. Rationale for Bank Involvement: The Bank had been supporting education programs
in other provinces and recognized that Balochistan had the greatest need, requiring both
financial and technical support to enable it to test different service delivery models. At the
same time, recognizing the challenges faced by the public sector in delivering quality
education at the primary level, the GoB was committed to testing different models of public-
private partnerships for primary education delivery, which, if successful, could be scaled up.
It designed the Balochistan Education Support Project (BESP) to test an alternate delivery
mechanism and approached the Bank for financial and technical assistance given its
experience of supporting the Balochistan Primary Education Project (BPEP).

1.1.5. The Project objectives were aligned with the 2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
and provincial priorities as articulated in the Balochistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
2003 (PRSP 2003). Specifically, the Project was to contribute to improvements in education
delivery, a key objective of the third pillar of the CAS, i.e., improving lives and protecting
the vulnerable. The Balochistan PRSP emphasized the need to increase focus on improving
human development, one of its five pillars. The Project also contributed to Pakistan’s long-
term objective of achieving its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by increasing net
primary enrollment rates and reducing gender disparity in Balochistan via successful public-
private and community partnership delivery models.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The development objective of the Project was to promote public-private and
community partnerships to improve access to quality primary education, in particular for girls.


                                                                                              1
1.2.2 Success in achieving the PDO was to be measured using the following five PDO level
outcome indicators and targets (PAD page 4):

       a) Total enrollment of students (Target: enrollment increased by 35,000, with at
          least 40% girls);
       b) Average annual student attendance (Target: average attendance not less than
          70%);
       c) Average grade completion rate (Target: average completion rate not less than
          70%);
       d) Average annual teacher attendance (Target: average annual teacher attendance,
          net of leave entitlement, not less than 90%); and
       e) Average annual increase in learning achievement in Language and Mathematics
          (Target: an annual increase of 3% and 5% respectively).

1.3    Revised PDO and Key Indicators and Reasons/justifications

1.3.1 The PDO and the PDO level key indicators were not revised.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary beneficiaries under the Project were students in the private and
community schools funded by the Project. Secondary beneficiaries included the Balochistan
Education Foundation (BEF), parents, teachers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
private sector partners, public and private training institutes and local construction
contractors.

1.5    Original Components

1.5.1 The Project supported education service delivery models through partnerships with
NGOs and low-cost private sector education providers. The Project had three components
which were to be implemented under partnership arrangements between BEF and three
distinct types of Implementation Partners (IPs). These included: (i) Community Schools
Implementation Partners (CIPs); (ii) Private School Implementation Partners (PIPs); and (iii)
Technical Assistance Implementation Partners (TIPs). US$1.8 million (9% of the project
cost) was left unallocated at the start of the Project to cover contingencies and the expansion
of successful interventions. The components and partner roles are summarized below.

1.5.2 Component 1: Establishment of New Community Schools in Rural Areas
(US$ 13.9 million): This component was to provide access to quality primary education to
school-aged children through the establishment of new community schools in rural areas
where the community was able to enroll at least 20 students in a school and where there were
no girls’ schools within a radius of two kilometers. These schools had to provide formal
primary education with assistance from eligible partner NGOs, known as CIPs. BEF was
responsible for monitoring performance of these schools and CIPs and their compliance with

the schools established under this component.

1.5.3 The PECs, selected by beneficiary communities, were responsible for managing and
supervising community schools. They were also to pay teacher salaries and other recurrent
costs of schools through funding provided by BEF. The Project was to fund recurrent costs
for the first two years of each school’s operation through BEF at the recommendation of CIPs
and following verification of agreed milestones. To ensure the sustainability of community
schools, GoB committed to fund recurrent costs of schools from the third year of each
school’s operation through BEF. These schools were to continue operating under the
management of the PECs after project closure.

1.5.4 Eligible community schools under the Project which successfully maintained
enrollment for two years and whose community donated land by formal transfer of ownership
by mutation to the respective PEC were to be provided with appropriate funding from the
Project for a new permanent school building in accordance with existing and projected
enrollments. Construction had to be undertaken by the community according to an earthquake
resistant design approved by the Bank and with technical assistance arranged through the
Project.

1.5.5 Component 2: Support to New Private Schools (US$2.1million): This component
focused on promoting access to low-fee quality private primary education in semi-urban and
urban areas through support to private school operators, known as PIPs, to establish new
private schools along the fellowship model tested successfully under BPEP. Each PIP was to
be given a per student subsidy for up to four years according to rates determined by BEF in
consultation with PIPs. PIPs were to receive annual subsidies per student for facilities and
material costs, and a monthly subsidy linked to student enrollment and attendance. New
private schools were to be established (i) if there were at least 50 out of school children (age
4-9) in a locality; and (ii) if there was no government primary school or any other school for
girls in a radius of one kilometer. An additional school in the same locality could only be
established if it were justified based on growth in the number of students or overcrowding in
existing schools. The schools were to charge low fees (at appraisal, school fees were not to
exceed Rs.300 per month). The performance of this model was to be evaluated during the
Mid-Term Review (MTR), and the option of extending support to existing private schools
was to be explored.




                                                                                                         3
1.5.6 Component 3: Capacity Building (US$4.2 million): The objective of this
component was to build the capacity of BEF and its partners under Components 1 and 2.

              Sub-component 3.1 - Training and Skill Development: To ensure the provision
               of quality education in both community and private schools, the Project was
               meant to support quality improvements at the school level. These
               improvements included local teacher recruitment, teachers’ professional
               development, including subject training, close monitoring and the academic
               supervision, availability of free textbooks, student achievement testing and
               provision of teaching and learning materials. To ensure that key stakeholders
               were able to perform their respective functions effectively, intensive training
               was to be given to them. PECs, CIPs and PIPs were to be trained in school
               management, book keeping, accounting, participatory techniques, gender and
               monitoring and supervision. BEF was to receive training in project
               management functions including financial management, procurement,
               environment and monitoring and evaluation. This capacity support was to be
               delivered through technical assistance provided by a variety of consultants,
               NGOs, and public and private training institutes, known as TIPs.
              Sub-Component 3.2 - Institutional Support to BEF: This sub-component was
               meant to support: (i) BEF’s staff salaries and operational costs (including
               evaluation studies); and (ii) if land was provided by GoB, the construction of a
               permanent office for BEF.

1.6    Revised Components

1.6.1 The Project components were not revised.

1.7    Other significant changes

1.7.1 Closing date: The original project closing date, January 31, 2011, was extended twice
(by a total of 42 months) under two successive Project Restructurings in order to allow for
the completion of construction activities under Component 1. The first closing date extension
was to July 31, 2012, and the second to July 31, 2014. Construction of eligible community
schools faced delays due to a worsening security situation in the province and difficulties
faced in identifying appropriate partners to provide technical support to PECs during the
construction process. Section 2.2 discusses this in further detail.

1.7.2 Reallocation: The Project included an unallocated expenditure category (US$1.8
million) to meet contingency costs and the expansion of successful interventions. This
amount was reallocated in the second Project Restructuring, dated July 20, 2012, to finance
CIP contracts for the extension period to meet equipment and operational expenses of BEF
during the extension phase and to provide additional resources for school construction. At
appraisal, Project funds had been allocated to the construction of a permanent office for BEF
on land that was to be allotted by the GoB. However, no suitable site was provided. These
proceeds were distributed to other expenditure categories (through the third and final Project
Restructuring, dated May 27, 2014) at the end of the Project (July 2014) to fund activities
which would promote the sustainability of project results. These activities included office
equipment for BEF, such as computers, smart phones and tablets to serve as a delivery
mechanism for supplementary education content and material for teachers and students in the
community schools. Other activities included refresher teacher training courses for teachers


                                                                                             4
in community schools and third-party validation of project results. These funds were also
used to cover additional costs associated with the recruitment of engineers to support the
construction of schools under Component 1.

1.7.3 Revision of targets (non-PDO): The following targets were revised during the Project:

              The number of private schools to be established under Component 2 was revised
               downwards from 300 to 200 schools during the MTR 1 because of the non-
               availability of private sector partners that could have qualified under the selection
               criteria of this component. Please see Annex 2.
              The number of community schools to be constructed using project funds was
               decreased from the appraisal target of 450 to 225 schools as documented in the
               November 2011 Implementation Support Aide-Memoire (AM) due to significant
               escalation in the cost of construction (approximately three times the appraisal
               estimate). No additional funding could be secured to bridge the shortfall.

2          Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Background Analysis: BESP was designed as a four and half year Specific Investment
Loan (SIL) financed through an IDA Credit. The Project, in its focus on increasing access,
especially for girls, was an appropriate response to challenges faced in the delivery of quality
education in the country’s poorest province. Challenges identified by the task team during
preparation were based on available data and are found to be sound by the ICR team. Most
importantly, the Project builds on the success of community-supported and non-government
and private sector entity involvement in the implementation of education, infrastructure, and
micro-enterprise programs under BPEP and the Bank-supported Pakistan Poverty Alleviation
Fund (PPAF)2. Key lessons learned from BPEP were fully reflected in the design of BESP
and include, among others: (i) avoiding complex project design; (ii) outsourcing
implementation to competitively selected IPs; (iii) ownership of project design by the
borrowers during the preparation phase and actions demonstrating a long term commitment
to the project design; (iv) the involvement of communities improves school performance; and
(v) partnering with qualified NGOs contributes significantly to project success. BESP design
also reflected important institutional and organizational lessons learned from PPAP, some of
which include: (a) establishing the autonomy of the apex body, BEF; (b) recruiting senior
management and staff competitively from the private sector; and (c) establishing clear and
transparent operational procedures and selection criteria for partner organizations.

2.1.2 Project Design: Given Balochistan’s unique challenges in education service delivery
compared to the rest of the country (e.g., large geographic spread, low population density,
poor infrastructure), BESP’s approach was to first test and potentially scale up innovative
models of education delivery outside the public sector. It was the first Bank-supported



1
 This is documented in the ‘Preliminary findings of the Mid Term Review of BESP dated March 15, 2010
(Folder ‘2009 Preliminary Findings) and in ISR 10 dated December 21, 2010.

2
    The Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Project was implemented from 1999-2004.



                                                                                                       5
education project in Pakistan to support an apex organization (BEF) which would use IPs to
execute and implement project components. The design of the Project was simple in its
support to two different models of delivery, and both components were heavily supported by
the technical assistance and capacity building component (Component 3). The Project made
adequate allowances for course correction and design changes by leaving a portion of the
Credit amount unallocated and by setting clear targets for the mid-term. The Project provided
Credit proceeds directly to BEF, which had the following advantages: (i) it mitigated the risk
of provincial budgetary constraints on the Project; (ii) it bypassed institutional capacity
constraints faced by the public sector; and (iii) it emphasized the accountability that the
implementing agency would be held to and thus generated a high level of ownership of the
Project by the implementing agency. The arguments presented in the PAD for alternative
approaches and design elements which were considered and subsequently rejected by the
preparation team are found to be compelling and well thought out.

2.1.3 The PDO and its indicators are deemed appropriate to the Project. Targets set for the
PDO indicators were realistic and phased according to the pace of implementation expected
at the time of Project design.

2.1.4 Risks and Mitigation Measures: Given that BESP sought to test different and new
approaches for service delivery outside the public sector in a challenging context, the Project
was properly identified as high risk. Diminishing government commitment, political
interference, security challenges, and weak fiduciary capacity all posed substantial to high
risk to the Project. All risks were identified and mitigation of risks was handled consistently
and in a timely manner during the Project. The commitment of the GoB in maintaining BEF’s
operational autonomy and its predominantly private sector Board contributed to successful
implementation.

2.1.5 Quality at Entry: No quality-at-entry assessment of the Project was carried out by the
former Quality Assurance Group (QAG). A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was
conducted in November 2005 during appraisal. It endorsed the design and approach of the
Project and provided guidance on issues of sustainability, capacity building, access and
quality, as well as implementation arrangements. The final design of BESP reflects the
guidance received. It bears mentioning that a Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio
(QALP) conducted in November 2008 found the design of the Project to be highly
satisfactory.

2.1.6 Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory. This assessment is based on the following
factors: (i) the PDO is simple and relevant; (ii) the evaluation framework and targets (except
for one indicator, see paragraph 2.3.1) are sound and realistic; (iii) the design is an innovative
response to clearly identified challenges in the sector and province; (iv) project design is not
complex, and has a well-designed technical assistance component to support implementation
of project activities; (v) lessons learned from other projects have been fully reflected in the
design; (vi) risks are appropriately identified and mitigation measures are deemed
proportionate to the magnitude of risk; and (vii) implementation arrangements, including for
fiduciary and safeguards aspects, are suitable and realistic.

2.2    Implementation

2.2.1 Implementation progress remained satisfactory until early 2011 when the rating was
downgraded to moderately satisfactory in the Implementation Status and Results (ISR)


                                                                                                6
reports to reflect delays in the construction of community schools under Component 1. This
rating was maintained until project closing..

2.2.2 The following factors contributed to successful implementation:

    (i)      GoB commitment to the success of project interventions. This was demonstrated
             by: (i) the regular transfer of teacher salaries to PECs with few exceptions; (ii) the
             Department of Education’s (DoE) recognition of community schools and the
             subsequent allocation of Balochistan Education Management Information System
             (BEMIS) codes to each; and (iii) the provision of free textbooks to community
             school students and teacher training to community school teachers in the last year
             of the Project. The recognition of community schools was of particular
             importance insofar as students who were issued a completion certificate from a
             BESP-supported community school could continue their education at a public
             middle school.
    (ii)     Timely recognition and resolution of implementation challenges by BEF and the
             Bank team. Regular and candid dialogue between the Bank and the counterpart on
             implementation progress, and a well-substantiated MTR 3 allowed timely
             restructuring of the Project on three occasions – the first two extending the
             Closing Date to allow the completion of construction of community schools4, and
             the last reallocating funds to other expenditure categories as required. The
             dialogue also ensured that adjustments to BESP design and targets could take
             place to reflect ground realities. A key instance is the discontinuation of
             Component 2 – Support to New Private Schools5 after it was apparent that the
             model was not sustainable due to a lack of potential private sector partners and
             poor cost recovery by some PIPs.
    (iii)    Satisfactory Project management and M&E. A dedicated and proactive
             implementing agency such as BEF has been pivotal to the success of the Project.
             BEF’s operations continuously took into account the ground realities of operating
             in a challenging security environment. BEF developed effective protocols to
             handle problems related to internal community conflict and teacher replacement in
             case of teacher resignation or unavailability.
    (iv)     Effective use of capacity building and technical assistance funds. Component 3 –
             Capacity Building - was instrumental to the successful implementation of
             Components 1 and 2. It funded activities such as teacher training, PECs training,
             CIPs, PIPs and BEF staff training, student achievement testing, and monitoring
             and evaluation (including Third Party Validation (TPVs)). The timing of these
             activities was well-aligned to the pace of implementation.
    (v)      Close project supervision despite difficult security environment. Despite the
             volatile and steadily worsening security situation in the province, both the Bank
             team and BEF did a commendable job of supervising BESP on a regular basis,
             using appropriate alternatives when required. These included the use of third-party
             monitoring when Bank visits to the field were not feasible due to security
             constraints and meetings between the task team and BEF in locations other than
             Quetta or via videoconference on several occasions.


3
  A Third Party Validation (TPV) of Project activities was completed in November 2009, well in time to feed
into the MTR.
4
  The second Restructuring also reallocated funds to other expenditure categories as required.
5
  This Component was implemented for a period of four years as originally designed in the Project.


                                                                                                              7
2.2.3 The following factors hindered or delayed implementation:

           (i) Difficulties in provision of technical support to PECs and CIPs during
                construction of schools under Component 1. This, along with a worsening security
                situation, the unavailability of raw materials and skilled labor in some
                communities and occasional delays in the release of funds to PECs for
                construction resulted in delays throughout the life of the Project. Several
                alternatives were considered to address the low capacity of the PECs with regard
                to community school construction and to ensure a high quality of construction.
                However, none proved satisfactory: a management supervision firm could not be
                identified, the cost of services of a similar firm proved too high, and the
                supervisory services offered by the GoB’s own Civil and Works Department
                proved inadequate. The final option exercised, i.e., the hiring of Individual
                Engineer Consultants (IECs) by BEF to facilitate, supervise, and validate school
                construction was eventually successful, particularly under the management and
                supervision of a Construction Manager hired by BEF.
           (ii) Non-transfer of non-salary recurrent costs to community schools. GoB committed
                to take on recurrent costs of community schools supported by the Project from the
                third year of each school’s operations, as reflected in a legal covenant. Despite
                being raised at several levels by the implementing agency and the Bank, from
                2009 onwards, GoB only provided recurrent funds sufficient to cover teacher
                salaries. Non-salary recurrent funds had to be raised by communities themselves,
                or from reduced teacher salaries. Teacher salaries have not been raised in six
                years6, making teacher retention at the current salary level difficult.
           (iii)Ineffectiveness of the BEF Board. The BEF Board did not meet as frequently in
                2013 and 2014 as before. The ICR team has not found any satisfactory reason for
                this. The less frequent meetings have resulted in the delay of important actions
                such as hiring of BEF staff, hiring of an internal audit firm, and implementation of
                the satellite monitoring initiative. The position of Managing Director (MD), BEF,
                remained vacant from August 2013 to January 2014 resulting in delays in funds
                transfer to PECs for school construction as the MD is the principal signatory for
                all PEC transfers.

2.2.4 Quality of Supervision: Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. This assessment
is based on (i) close supervision by the Bank team in a difficult security environment; (ii)
timely identification and response to implementation issues; (iii) attention to project
sustainability; and (iv) intensive capacity development of BEF and IPs. As noted above, a
QALP conducted in November 2008 found the quality of supervision to be satisfactory.




2.3        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design: M&E arrangements designed for the Project were adequate and
appropriate for generating data to assess the success or failure of the different models of


6
    At the time of Project closing.


                                                                                                  8
education delivery tested under the Project. Five key PDO-level outcome indicators and three
Intermediate Results (IR) Indicators were identified to monitor progress towards achieving
the PDO. Information on the indicators was to be measured regularly by BEF’s IPs and
reported to BEF at specified intervals. BEF Field Supervisors were to monitor the operation
of private schools and conduct spot checks of at least 20% of community schools every
quarter. TPVs were appropriately embedded in the M&E framework to verify and provide an
additional layer of monitoring. All project data and information were to be transmitted to the
M&E Unit at BEF which would be responsible for validating and incorporating data into a
computerized education management information system. Data were to be used to assess the
effectiveness of BESP components, inform adjustments in implementation strategy and refine
the Project’s design.

2.3.2 One issue identified in the design of the M&E framework is that the measurement of
the fifth PDO indicator, i.e., annual improvement in learning achievement, is not explained in
sufficient detail, given the highly technical nature of standardized testing. From the PAD, it
would seem that CIPs were to monitor the quality of learning and report this annually to BEF.
Given the high cost and technical complexity of developing and administering standardized
tests on an annual basis, the method and frequency of collecting student achievement data
were unrealistic.

2.3.3 M&E Implementation: The M&E system was implemented as planned for the
majority of project indicators. A baseline for all PDO and intermediate results indicators was
established on time, with delays only in the establishment of a baseline for student learning.

2.3.4 IPs prepared quarterly monitoring reports against targets assigned to them and
submitted these to BEF. Staffing issues faced by the M&E Unit for field monitoring were
resolved by 2010, after which monitoring by BEF remained regular, with over 20% of
schools visited each year until project closing. BEF Field Supervisors monitored private
schools until this component reached its conclusion in December 2010. The M&E Unit, BEF,
set up a computerized database, BEF’s Management Information System (MIS), for
collecting project data early during the Project. The Unit also initiated the dissemination of a
newsletter to communicate the Project’s activities and achievements.

2.3.5 A major milestone achieved through the Project was the assignment of BEMIS codes
to each Project-supported community school in April 2013. This ensured that community
schools were included under the overall provincial education sector Management Information
System (MIS) and in the census reports.

2.3.6 However, implementation of the M&E system as designed was incomplete in the area
of student learning assessment. Student learning assessments were not carried out on an
annual basis, despite a PDO indicator for annual increases in Language and Math learning
achievements. Although national expertise was engaged to design and implement surveys for
learning achievement in project schools, only three rounds were held in 2007 (baseline),
2008/2009, and 2013. It should be noted that 2013 round used Early Grade Reading
Assessment (EGRA) tools which could not be used to assess improvements in student
learning. Although it yielded important information on student learning, it made uncertain the
achievement of the PDO indicator that year. The ICR team feels that the technical nature of
learning achievement measurement, as well as the high level of attention that the BEF
dedicated to the construction component of the Project, discouraged a regular administration
of the learning assessments as envisioned at project design.


                                                                                              9
2.3.7 As per appraisal, BEF had to establish a website that included complete data on all
project components including the selection process of IPs. The BEF established a website for
the Project which was intermittently updated. The website page did not include complete data
on all project components, including the selection process of IPs. BEF also established a
complaint management system in 2008. Through this mechanism, BEF received 44
complaints of which 43 were addressed. Almost half the complaints were related to PEC
performance, teacher absenteeism, and school management. Over one-third of complaints
were related to school construction. At the time of this ICR, BEF was investigating the
remaining complaint.

2.3.8 M&E Utilization: M&E utilization is found to be satisfactory. Encouragingly, data
generated by BEF’s M&E system was not limited to the monitoring of implementation
progress. Analysis of the data: (i) allowed design readjustments to the Project; (ii) revealed
particular issues for further investigation by BEF for which reports and studies were carried
out including on low female enrollment in selected regions of the province, performance
comparison of local vs. non-local teachers in community schools, community schools’ drop-
out and the sustainability of PIPs.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguard and fiduciary compliance are rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the
following assessments:

2.4.2 Environmental aspects: The Project was given an environmental category of B at the
concept review stage. The Bank’s safeguards policy OP 4.01 required an environmental
assessment for BESP’s proposed activities, such as the construction of school buildings,
which could have had low to moderate, short-duration and minor negative environmental
impact. Other anticipated project activities were expected to have minimal environmental
impact. The construction of community school building required conformity with standard
engineering design requirements to avoid safety hazards associated with earthquake and
floods as well as to ensure proper ventilation and lighting in the school buildings. Some other
minor environmental impacts included issues such as a scarcity of water during construction
and improper waste disposal. These were characterized as ‘low negative impacts’.

2.4.3 BEF prepared the Environmental Management Framework (EMF) at the design stage
of the Project. BEF was also responsible for implementation of the EMF and the Project’s
compliance with it. Implementation of the EMF in the field was the responsibility of the PEC
and IPs which ensured compliance with the EMF’s environmental guidelines.

2.4.4 BEF trained PEC and IPs engineers on the EMF. All PECs were trained in
environmental aspects. Due to high turn-over, training was not conducted for new PEC
members as the membership changed from year to year. The BEF did not recruit an
Environmental Coordinator for the Project. This responsibility stayed with BEF’s Director
(Operations) as an additional responsibility and, later, with the Manager (Construction) as an
additional charge until project closure.
2.4.5 An area of significant accomplishment was in school design and construction using
roller-compacted concrete (RCC) structures. These are stronger and less vulnerable to
earthquakes. Boundary walls were built with prescribed heights for 189 schools out of total
219 schools constructed under the Project. Boundary walls were not built for the remaining
schools because by the time construction reached this phase, contracts were closed due to


                                                                                            10
Project closure. Boundary walls made it safer for children to attend school and helped
increase girls’ enrolment. As required in the EMF, the Project also conducted TPV for the
implementation of the EMF.

2.4.6 Social aspects: Communities provided land for schools in rural areas free of cost.
Successful implementation of BESP contributed to a significant increase in girls’ enrollment
in rural areas. Out of a total of 48,354 students enrolled in project schools at closing7, female
enrollment comprised 42% of community school enrollment and 34% of private school
enrollment.

2.4.7 The Project extended quality education to underserved communities in rural, peri-
urban and urban areas across all 31 districts in the province. Project-supported schools (under
Components 1 and 2) have increased overall enrollment in the province by 5%, and girls’
enrollment by 5.3%8.

2.4.8 Financial management: Financial management compliance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory based on the following assessment: Financial management capacity in
Balochistan is generally weak with ‘high risk’ rating. The project design included measures
to mitigate these risks, such as the training of IPs, and payments to IPs on their achievement
of milestones as agreed in the Partnership Agreement and through regular monitoring by BEF.
Overall, financial management staffing and arrangements remained adequate and in
compliance with annual audit throughout the life of the Project. CIPs closely monitored PECs
and community schools. The external audit firm reviewed the performance of all IPs on a
sample basis on an annual basis and IPs had their accounts audited annually. However, two
issues persisted during the Project, i.e., delays in putting in place internal audit arrangements
within BEF, and failure by the GoB to release the non-salary budget for community schools
(see paragraph 2.2.3).

2.4.9 Procurement: Procurement compliance is rated Satisfactory. Selection of all IPs under
the BESP was carried out in accordance with the Bank’s guidelines. BEF developed a
procurement plan for project implementation which provided a basis for the choice of
procurement methods and review thresholds. This plan was agreed between BEF and the
Bank. The procurement plan was updated annually or when required in agreement with the
Bank.

2.4.10 PECs were given grant funds for community school construction. There was no
centralized procurement of building material or for contracting school construction at the
BEF level. The design of community schools buildings was done by a consulting firm hired
by BEF through competitive bidding. Individual Engineer Consultants (IECs) were hired to
facilitate, supervise and validate school construction in accordance with designs provided by
BEF. IECs facilitated the PEC in identifying potential areas for the procurement of labor and
materials and trained communities in skills to support construction. PECs either (i) contracted
construction labor and material on a competitive basis, or (ii) contracted labor and procured
construction material themselves. The joint supervision of school construction by consultants
and the local communities provided a highly effective oversight model.

  Before support to schools under Component 2 reached its conclusion, enrollment in private schools supported
under the Project was 22,381 students. At the end of the Project, enrollment in community schools was 25,973.

2.4.11 A lack of procurement staff with relevant expertise led to minor delays in the award
of contracts. Procedural difficulties were also encountered for obtaining approval through the
BEF structure which hindered the efficient and timely procurement of goods and services.

2.4.12 The institutional capacity of BEF, CIPs, PIPs and PECs was strengthened through
training. The capacity of IPs was built to follow procurement procedures agreed between the
BEF and the Bank. Third Party monitoring of the IPs ensured compliance with agreed
deliverables. PECs were made accountable to communities through disclosure of school
procurement and financial matters.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Post-completion Operation: Community schools will continue to be monitored by
BEF and their functionality is expected to continue provided their recurrent costs are met by
the GoB. BEF is piloting the use of smart phones to engage with students and teachers on a
regular basis. Please see Section 0 – Risk to Development Outcome for a discussion on
sustainability of project outcomes and activities.

2.5.2 Next Phase: A clear indication of the success and ownership of the community-
supported school model in the province is the GoB’s use of community involvement in
expanding access to the public school system.

2.5.3 The Bank’s response to the GoB’s request for continued support to the education
sector was the Promoting Girls’ Education in Balochistan (PGEB) project, which became
effective in September 2012. It is funded by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for Khyber
Pukhtunkhwa, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan. PGEB which is a
US$10 million grant to the GoB, aims to improve the availability and accessibility of
education services for all children, with a special emphasis on girls, in the province of
Balochistan. Community-supported mechanisms similar to those used under BESP are used
by the GoB in its efforts to rehabilitate shelter-less schools to improve their functionality,
improve school physical infrastructure and construct new schools in areas where no schools
are available. The implementation of all activities is based on active community participation
at all levels of project design and implementation.

2.5.4 In March 2014, the GoB submitted an application for US$34 million in grant
financing from the Global Partnership for Education for the Balochistan Education Project
(GPE-BEP) prepared by the Bank as supervising entity for Balochistan under the GPE. This
application was approved by the GPE Board and is to be negotiated with the GoB in 2015.
The proposed development objective of the Project is to increase school enrollment and
retention in project-supported schools, with a special focus on girls’ participation, and to
develop mechanisms for information collection and use for the improved management of
education. Under the project, 2,000 public schools will be established with community
partnership and involvement in school management.

2.5.5 Several design aspects have been built into both PGEB and GPE-BEP based on
lessons learnt from BESP: (i) the schools established are recognized upfront as ‘government
schools’ using successful community support mechanisms, as opposed to being set up as
‘community schools’; (ii) contract teachers hired for newly established community schools
set up under PGEB are employed using rules and procedures applicable to regular


                                                                                           12
government teachers, ensuring they can be regularized onto the GoB payroll after the life of
the projects; and (iii) supervision support must be made available to the government for
better management of construction related activities.

3      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 Project objectives remained highly relevant during the life of the Project, and were
well-aligned with the Government of Pakistan’s development and education sector priorities
articulated in the PRSP II (Government of Pakistan, 2009) (Pillar VI, Chapter 9) and the
Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (FY10-13 and extension to FY14).

3.1.2 Objectives: BESP’s objective to increase access to quality primary education, in
particular for girls, remains highly relevant and consistent with the Government of Pakistan’s
current development priorities as articulated in the draft five-year development vision, Vision
2025, and the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2015-19 for Pakistan. The
four priorities of Vision 2025, Energy, Economy, Extremism, and Education, are anchored
within the CPS as results areas. The objective of the Project is well-aligned and specifically
relevant to Result Area 3, ‘Inclusion’, which supports inclusive growth by reducing inequities
for vulnerable groups, including women and youth, and those in poor or conflict-affected
areas including Balochistan, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KPK) and Federally Administered Tribal
Areas (FATA). It is also aligned to CPS (FY2015-19) Result Area 4, ‘Service Delivery’,
which supports the acceleration of improvements in service delivery, including education.
The project objectives are strongly relevant to the achievement of monitoring indicators
under Outcome 3.2, ‘Reduced Vulnerability of Groups at Risk’ (Result Area 3; page 21 CPS
FY15-19) and Outcome 4.3, ‘Increased School Enrollment and the Adoption of Education
Quality Assessment’ (Result Area 4; page 24 CPS FY15-19).

3.1.3 Design and Implementation: The design and implementation of the Project remain
relevant in the current context in Balochistan. Sector and provincial challenges identified at
the time of design remain unchanged except for a worsened security situation. The GoB’s and
Bank’s response to these challenges builds on BESP design and lessons learned from its
implementation. These are evidenced by the adoption of community-supported mechanisms
in public education service delivery in two subsequent Bank-supported projects, i.e., PGEB
and GPE-BEP.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Achievement of the PDO was to be measured using five PDO level outcome
indicators (paragraph 0.). By the end of the Project, 633 community schools and 197 private
schools had been established. Activities under Component 2 – Support to New Private
Schools – were completed by 2011. Details of component performance are available in
Annex 2 – Output by Component.

3.2.2 Four out of five PDO indicators were exceeded. Most PDO indicators were
maintained above their target level for the duration of the Project, with the exception of that
for female enrollment in private schools (see paragraph 3.2.4). Highlights include:




                                                                                            13
         i.   PDO 1 – An additional 35,000 students (at least 40% girls) enrolled in project-
              supported schools, was met well ahead of time in 2009. Project-supported schools
              (under Components 1 and 2) have increased overall enrollment in the province by
              5%, and girls’ enrollment by 5.3%9. Targets for enrollment in both community
              schools and private schools were exceeded by 33% and 38%, respectively, by
              Project end, the latter despite a revision of Component 2 targets (new private
              schools to be established was decreased from 300 to 200 at MTR - see paragraph
              1.7.2). Female enrollment in community schools was maintained at above 40%
              throughout the Project and stood at 42% at project closing.

        ii.   Average student attendance, teacher attendance and student grade completion
              rates for both community and private schools were maintained consistently above
              their target levels for the duration of the Project and at project closing.

3.2.3 There is insufficient data available to assess the fifth PDO indicator, ‘Annual
Improvement in Learning Achievement’. Assessments conducted over 2008/09 showed an
increase of 16.17% and 9.60% in mean scores of student learning achievement in Language
and Mathematics, respectively, from the 2007 baseline, exceeding annual targets. However,
as mentioned in paragraphs 2.3.1 and 2.3.5, student assessments were not carried out on an
annual basis. An assessment of student learning outcomes at Grades 2 and 5 in BESP
community schools was carried out in 2013/14 using Early Grade Reading Assessment
(EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) tools to measure learning in
Urdu and Mathematics. While this assessment yielded important information on learning
outcomes, it did not measure improvements in learning achievement and hence cannot be
used to measure PDO indicator progress.

Student Learning Assessment: Oral Reading Fluency and Basic Numeracy in Community Based Schools
                                  in Balochistan, Pakistan (2014)

Key findings from the study show that the oral reading proficiency and basic numeracy skills of both grades two
and five children are weak and significantly lower than expected levels commensurate with their grades.
Children’s oral reading fluency in both grades two a nd five is significantly lower than recommended
benchmarks of 45 and 100 correct words per minute (CWPM), respectively. Less than 5% of children in grade
two and only 6% in grade five can correctly read a grade-appropriate paragraph. Similarly 7 percent of children
in grade two and 13 percent in grade five have the capacity to write a sentence in Urdu without a mistake. While
children in grade five on average read twice as many correct words per minute as grade two children —
indicating positive, but inadequate progression between grades two and five—their oral reading fluency is
significantly lower than the recommended benchmark of over 100 CWPM. Boys tend to outperform girls by a
small but significant margin in grade two. However the difference diminishes in grade five.

Children’s basic computational and problem solving skills are weak across the province. Boys tend to have
significantly stronger foundational mathematical skills than girls. Significant differentials exist between boys
and girls at both grade two and five levels reflecting that girls’ learning outcomes in mathematics are weaker
than boys.

3.2.4 Female enrollment in private schools fell below the target of 40% . The reason for
this offered by the BEF and Bank team that private schools were co-educational and girls
dropped out after Grade 4 due to the prevalence of male teachers in private schools is found
to be incomplete by the ICR team. Data from December 2010 (a few months before the
conclusion of Component 2) shows that boys and girls enrolled in private schools have

similar drop-out rates of 10% and 9%, respectively. Female teachers constituted almost 53%
of the teaching force at these schools. This issue clearly warranted further investigation given
that female enrollment in community schools, which were located primarily in rural areas,
was maintained at over 40%.

3.2.5 Achievement of the PDO is found to be Moderately Satisfactory. Based on the
assessment above, the Project contributed significantly to increasing access to primary
education in Balochistan through its support to the establishment of community- and private
sector-supported schools in all 31 districts of the province. Student and teacher attendance
and student grade completion rates were maintained well above target values for the entire
life of the Project. This is commendable in a province characterized by governance, security
and poverty challenges. However, given the shortfalls in targets for female enrollment in
private schools and the lack of data on student learning outcomes, a rating of Moderately
Satisfactory is deemed appropriate for achievement of the PDO.

3.3    Efficiency

3.3.1 A comparison of the cost of education delivery at appraisal based on 2004/05 data
estimated that recurrent expenditure per student in government schools would be less than
half (US$44.78) than expenditure per student in community schools, which would cost
US$98.26 (including monitoring costs) due to project low student-teacher ratios (STR). Costs
would equalize (at US$44.78)) if community schools had an STR of at least 25 (the STR for
government schools was 43). Per student recurrent expenditure was projected to double for
community schools in thinly populated areas where the STR was expected to be only 15
(page 74, PAD).

3.3.2 Based on similar analysis conducted by the ICR team using actual data from FY14,
the community school model is found to be more cost-efficient than delivery by the
government school system. However, in the absence of a comparison of quality at community
schools and government primary schools, overall efficiency cannot be assessed. Government
primary schools in Balochistan are delivering primary education at a recurrent cost of
US$104.91 (PKR 10,729) per student per year (in FY14). In comparison, the recurrent cost of
delivering primary education per student per year under the Project community schools (in
FY14) with monitoring through external organizations is US$69.15 (PKR 7,072), which is
34% less than government costs. The cost, excluding monitoring through external
organizations, is US$37.52 (PKR 3,838)which is 64% less than the cost of delivering primary
education through government schools. Please see Annex 3 for more details, including the
fiscal implications of the community schools on the GoB.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

3.4.1 The overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory to reflect the following: (i)
the PDO and design remained highly relevant throughout project implementation and
continue to remain relevant, as can be seen in subsequent operations; (ii) almost all key PDO
and intermediate results indicators were met and exceeded and the Project made significant
contributions to increasing access to primary education in the province; and (iii) the Project’s
model of delivery (under Component 1) was found to be more cost-efficient than the
alternative, i.e., government provision of primary education, although overall efficiency
cannot be assessed in the absence of a reliable comparison of education quality. Finally, the
achievement of the BESP’s objectives in a security environment which steadily worsened
since the time of project design is commendable.

3.5           Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development. BESP had a direct
impact on increasing enrollment in the province, specifically in areas where there was no
school in a one kilometer (Component 2) or two kilometer (Component 1) radius. Project-
supported schools (under Components 1 and 2) have increased overall enrollment in the
province by 5%, and girls’ enrollment by 5.3% 10 . The provision of these schools led to
increased enrollment from urban, peri-urban, and rural poor households. Community
mobilization and its involvement in the selection of PECs are likely to have had a beneficial
impact on people’s perception of schooling and generated increased social demand for
education. A high teacher attendance rate likely contributed to consistent enrollment of
students in project schools over the life of the Project, despite the fact that the majority of
community schools are still without a building. The construction of buildings for 219
community schools and the provision of free textbooks by GoB in the last two years of the
Project are also likely to have contributed to increases in stabilization of enrollment,
especially for girls. BESP also had an impact on gender equity. The percentage of female
enrollment at the end of the Project was 42%, higher than the government primary school
average of 39%11. The construction of boundary walls in community schools which were
provided with a building is likely to have had a positive impact on female enrollment.

3.5.2 Institutional Change/Strengthening. BESP implementation resulted in significant
institutional changes and made progress towards strengthening the capacity of BEF and its
partners. For instance:

          i.     During project design, amendments were made to the BEF Act to increase private
                 member representation on its Board to mitigate risks stemming from political
                 interference.
        ii.      An enabling environment was created for the private sector. All private schools
                 were established in low-income communities where private operators were
                 unlikely to open schools without BEF support. All private school operators and
                 teaching staff were trained in private school financial management and
                 administration, record keeping and managing relationships with parents among
                 other topics.
        iii.     BEF’s capacity was enhanced through Component 3 to expand its operations into
                 low enrolment areas, evidenced by its presence in remote, rural areas in all
                 districts of Balochistan.
        iv.      PECs were trained to deliver school management, financial management, record
                 keeping and, for some, school construction and functioning. This contributed to
                 improvements in governance at the community level.
         v.      Under the Project’s capacity development component, 1,100 teachers were trained
                 (764 community school teachers and 336 private school teachers). Training
                 included on-site classroom support and multi-grade teaching modules, and
                 teaching kits were provided to all community schools. These initiatives are
                 expected to have had positive impacts on teacher professional development and
                 overall teaching quality.

4             Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

4.1           The risk to development outcome is rated High based on the following assessment:
               There are positive signs of sustainability of project outcomes and delivery
                 mechanisms: (i) the adoption of the community-supported model of education
                 service delivery by the GoB (see Section 2.5); and (ii) 75% of schools established
                 under Component 2 were still operational over three years after support to them
                 ended12. However, several risks, if realized, threaten the sustainability of BESP
                 outcomes. These include: (i) withdrawal of GoB funding for community schools’
                 recurrent expenditure (non-salary recurrent funding has not been provided to
                 community schools since 2009); (ii) dwindling GoB commitment for supporting a
                 community-based model of education service delivery once ongoing support to
                 the GoB concludes; (iii) low teacher retention due to non-competitive salary
                 increases over time; (iv) a decline in school-level and community-level capacities
                 for effective school management once capacity building activities are no longer
                 externally funded; and (v) a worsening security situation which can result in
                 school closure.
               The risks to development outcome sustainability which have been identified are
                 mitigated, in part, by the Bank’s ongoing dialogue with the GoB as part of two
                 education projects (BPEP and GPE-BEP) in the province, and options to promote
                 sustainability of project outcomes were discussed in detail prior to project closing
                 with BEF, SED and the GoB. No decision on the future of the community schools
                 established under Component 1 has been taken as yet. Of concern, however, is
                 that the options discussed, including the regularization of community school
                 teachers and the handover of community schools to the Secondary Education
                 Department (SED), entail the sacrifice of PEC and thus community authority over
                 teacher recruitment and termination. This could potentially dilute the success of
                 the BESP delivery model and instead allow governance issues which afflict the
                 public sector service delivery system to take root.

5             Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1           Bank Performance
              (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

5.1.1 The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Satisfactory based on the
following assessment:


12
     Based on a sample-based sustainability review conducted by BEF in end 2013.


                                                                                                  19
      i.      The PDO was highly relevant and remained so throughout the Project, as
              discussed in Section 3. The PDO was well aligned to the Bank’s CPS, and GoB
              and Government of Pakistan priorities in the sector.
     ii.      The preparation task team incorporated the advice and lessons learned from other
              similar Bank-financed operations, as well as guidance received throughout project
              preparation, including from a QER held in 2005. Technical aspects of the Project
              were well-developed and appropriate for sectoral, institutional and policy
              constraints in the province and to address capacity limitations among
              implementing partners.
    iii.      M&E arrangements designed for the Project were adequate (with the exception of
              one indicator; see paragraph 2.3.1), with appropriately built in and timed third
              party monitoring.
     iv.      Risks (see Sections 2.1 and 0) were aptly identified at entry and the mitigation
              measures proposed were adequate.
     v.       Fiduciary and social and environmental aspects of the Project were well-designed
              and aligned to the Project’s design.

5.1.2 BESP was covered under a Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio conducted in
November 2008. The Assessment found the Quality of Design to be Highly Satisfactory
based on findings similar to those described above. It highlighted two main shortcomings
with the design: (i) there was no economic analysis or cost-benefit analysis conducted to
provide a basis for the Project; and (ii) international TA should have been included under the
Project to work with BEF and local IPs to set good implementation standards. The ICR team
feels that while there are merits to the first point, it is highly unlikely that an international
firm would have been able to provide support to IPs in Balochistan given the challenging
security situation.

           (b) Quality of Supervision

5.1.3 The Bank’s performance with regards to quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory
based on the following assessment:

      i.      The Bank team was comprised of an appropriate skills mix (education, fiduciary,
              environmental and social experts, economics/poverty reduction experts,
              engineers) for supporting and supervising the Project. Missions were conducted
              regularly, and during times of heightened security risks, the team did a
              commendable job of using alternatives to supervise and monitor the Project
              (videoconferences with BEF, holding missions in Karachi/Islamabad, using third
              party monitoring services).
     ii.      Risks and implementation issues were identified and addressed in a proactive
              manner, and candidly highlighted and discussed in all supervision documentation
              (e.g., ISRs, AMs). Project ratings are found to be realistic and in line with
              implementation progress. The Bank team maintained a strong focus on the
              achievement of the PDO throughout the life of the Project.
    iii.      Attention was paid to the sustainability of Project initiatives from an early stage of
              implementation, which contributed significantly to the design of follow-on
              operations in the sector in Balochistan.

5.1.4 The QALP assessment conducted in November 2008 found the Quality of
Supervision to be Satisfactory based on similar findings to those described above. It


                                                                                                 20
highlighted one main shortcoming with project supervision, i.e., delays and inconsistencies in
support from the environmental safeguards team. However, this issue was eventually
resolved and the level of support provided to the Project once the construction of community
schools commenced has been found to be acceptable.
Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.5 The Bank’s overall performance is rated Satisfactory based on the assessments above.

5.2    Borrower Performance

       (a) Government Performance

5.2.1 Overall, the GoB showed a high level of commitment to and ownership of activities
supported under the Project and to the achievement of the PDO. At the design stage, the GoB
facilitated amendments to the BEF Act to allay risks stemming from political interference by
increasing private member representation on the BEF Board. During implementation, the
GoB maintained close oversight of the Project and met regularly with visiting Bank missions.
Also, as mentioned in paragraph 2.2.1(i), the DoE’s recognition of community schools and
the allocation of BEMIS codes to each, the regular transfer of teacher salaries to PECs (with a
few exceptions) and the provision of free textbooks to community school students and
teacher training to community school teachers serve as further demonstrations of the GoB’s
commitment.

5.2.2 Government performance was found lacking in one critical area, i.e., the undertaking
of financial responsibility for operation and maintenance of project community schools from
the third year of each school’s operation, as committed by the GoB through a legal covenant
contained in the BESP Legal Agreements. The GoB only provided recurrent funds sufficient
to cover teacher salaries. Non-salary recurrent funds were raised by the communities
themselves, sometimes at the expense of reductions in already-stagnating teacher salaries (see
paragraph 2.2.3(ii)). Despite repeated commitments by the GoB to address this issue, non-
salary recurrent funds were only provided once in April 2011. In addition, the GoB did not
allocate land to BEF for the construction of a new building to be funded under the Project.

5.2.3 Given the risk posed to the sustainability of community schools established under the
Project due to the non-provision of adequate non-salary recurrent funds, Government
performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

       (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

5.2.4 Implementing Agency performance is rated as Satisfactory. Overall, BEF
demonstrated strong commitment and ownership to achieving the BESP development
objectives and coordinated with the provincial government, in particular the Department of
Finance and DoE. In its role as the implementing agency for the Project, BEF: (i)
implemented several models of delivering primary education to 48,629 students, achieving
targets under most PDO indicators; (ii) proactively identified, resolved, and reported
implementation challenges that arose during the Project, especially in a challenging security
environment; (iii) efficiently verified, analyzed and shared data collected by the IPs in a
timely manner to concerned stakeholders, including the Bank task team; and (iv) complied
with the Bank’s fiduciary and safeguards requirements. BEF performed consistently well


                                                                                            21
throughout the life of the Project, albeit with some challenges in the last two years of
implementation: there were delays in important actions such as hiring of BEF staff due to
infrequent meetings of the BEF Board, and delays in funds transfer to PECs for school
construction due to a vacant Managing Director position (see paragraph 2.2.3(iii)).

       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

5.2.5 Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, given the
assessments above. While the performance of BEF in a context such as Balochistan is
commendable, as is the achievement of the PDO, the risk posed to the sustainability of
community schools established under the Project is significant enough to warrant the rating
assigned by the ICR team.

6      Lessons Learned

6.1    Significant lessons have been learned from BESP’s experience, several of which have
been included in the design of PGEB and GPE-BEP:

          Government commitment and ownership. Strong government commitment and
           ownership are critical for successful implementation and sustainability of service
           delivery models which make use of mechanisms outside the public sector. For
           instance, the recognition of community schools by the DoE was fundamental to
           enabling community school students to transition to higher grades in mainstream
           public schools. Similarly, project objectives are at risk because of a lack of
           financial commitment by the Government to sustain community schools.
          Empowerment of communities can lead to high levels of ownership. Community
           involvement in designing and monitoring schools cultivated a strong sense of
           ownership. Communities raised non-salary recurrent funds in the absence of GoB
           funding, ensured female student enrollment and retention, and helped identify and
           attract teachers to their communities.
          School-based management through the community also allowed for better
           accountability. Empowering communities with teacher hiring and firing ensured
           that teacher absenteeism and student drop-out rates were low.
          Community school models that are well designed and well-managed are
           examples of successful public, private and community partnerships. These
           models are cost- and time-effective and address the issues of out of school
           children’s access to education.
          The community school model tested under the Project proved to be a viable
           alternative to government service delivery, especially in conflict-prone areas.
           The Government should play a role in providing adequate resources for models
           using community-supported mechanisms to provide education service delivery in
           underserved and conflict-prone areas.
          Private sector participation in low-cost education delivery is not as viable in
           Balochistan when compared to the rest of the country given a lower propensity of
           households to pay.
          Community involvement in designing and managing schools is crucial for
           increasing children’s access to school, in particular girls, and for decreasing
           drop-out and reducing teacher absenteeism rates.
          Capacity development support is crucial for ensuring timely and effective
           implementation of projects in provinces and regions with limited public sector


                                                                                          22
           capacity, weak private sector presence and deteriorating law and order
           environments. Continuous engagement and support to community partners under
           the community-supported model is important to ensure that no knowledge is
           “lost” due to migration, etc.
          Community schools need regular monitoring to remain operational. Low cost
           technology based monitoring systems need to be explored and introduced in
           projects that are implemented in conflict-prone and hard to reach terrains.
          The public sector’s institutional capacity to measure learning achievement in
           Language and Mathematics in schools is weak. This capacity needs to be built
           within public sector institutions that deal with such assessments.

 Balochistan Education Support Project

 Overall Achievement:
 Four out of five PDO indicators exceeded targets set. These PDO indicators were
 maintained above target level for the duration of the Project, except female enrollment in
 private schools. Project-supported schools (under Components 1 and 2) have increased
 overall enrollment in the province by 5%, and girls’ enrollment by 5.3%13.

            a) Total enrollment of students stood at 48,354 with 42% girls in community
               schools and 37% in private schools (Target: enrollment increased by 35,000,
               with at least 40% girls);
            b) On average, annual student attendance was maintained above 70% in both
               community and private schools. At project closing, student attendance was
               85% and 86% in community schools and private schools14, respectively
               (Target: average attendance not less than 70%);
            c) On average, average grade completion rate was maintained above 70% in both
               community and private schools. At project closing, the grade completion rate
               in community schools and private schools15 was 74% and 85%, respectively
               (Target: average completion rate not less than 70%);
            d) On average, annual teacher attendance was maintained above 90% in both
               community and private schools. At project closing, teacher attendance was
               95% in community schools and 94% in private schools (2010) (Target:
               average annual teacher attendance, net of leave entitlement, not less than
               90%); and
            e) The target for increases in learning achievement in Language and
               Mathematics was exceeded (6.17% and 9.60%, respectively) in 2008/09
               (Target: an annual increase of 3% and 5% respectively).

          PAKISTAN: BALOCHISTAN EDUCATION SUPPORT PROJECT

Fiscal Impact of Community Schools established under the Project on GoB’s Current
Budget

The establishment of community schools under BESP (Component 1) was the only
component that had and will have fiscal implications for the current expenditure of the
Government of Balochistan (GoB). The Project funded all current costs associated with new
community schools through the BEF. The Bank funded these costs for the first two years of
operations of each newly established community school. The GoB agreed to finance current
costs of community schools from its budget via BEF from the third year of each school’s
operation. The analysis that follows looks at the fiscal impact on the GoB’s budget for
supporting these schools. 633 schools were completed over the life of the Project and all have
now been shifted to the GoB for the financing of operational costs. These include teachers’
salaries and fixed non-salary expenditures per school per month.

The total cost to the GoB of these schools in FY 14 was PKR 76.88 million (US$0.75
million) under Scenario I. This scenario is based on the actual release of funds by the GoB
for both salary and non-salary expenditures over the life of the Project.

The total cost to the GoB of these schools in FY 14 was PKR 85.58 million (US$0.84
million) under Scenario II. This scenario is based on the actual financial requirements of
these schools irrespective of whether these were released or not by the GoB. This includes
the actual teacher salary and the non-salary expenditures as agreed by the GoB.

Based on the GoB’s total current expenditure, total current expenditure on education, total
current expenditure on primary education (Table 1 below) and the total cost of maintaining
BESP’s Community Schools under the two scenarios discussed above (Tables 2A and 2B
below), it is estimated that the GoB spent PKR 75.6 billion (US$739.3 million) on education
in FY 14. Of this, PKR 9.3 billion (US$90.9 million) has been spent on primary education.

Based on these figures, the GoB has spent 0.26% of its education expenditure and 0.83% of
the primary education expenditure in FY 14 for maintaining these schools under Scenario I.
The GoB would have spent 0.29% of its education expenditure and 0.92% of the primary
education expenditure for maintaining these schools under Scenario II. In both these
scenarios, the cost to the GoB is insignificant when compared with GoB’s total current
expenditure on education and on primary education.

                         Cost of Education Delivery: A Comparison

Government primary schools in Balochistan have an average student teacher ratio of 43 and are
delivering primary education at a cost of PKR 10,729 (US$104.91) per student per year.
Government schools do not provide free textbooks and instructional materials and the non-salary
repairs and maintenance budget for primary schools is almost negligible.

In comparison, the cost of delivering primary education per student per year under the project
community schools is substantially less under similar circumstances. This has been calculated
under two scenarios. Scenario I calculates this cost based on actual expenditure borne previously
by the Bank and now by the GoB. This includes salary, non-salary expenditure and monitoring
costs of these schools by TIPs (NGOs). Scenario II calculates this cost based on actual
expenditure borne that includes salary and non-salary expenditure and excludes the monitoring
cost of these schools by TIPs (NGOs). The reason for excluding TIPs (NGOs) is that these
NGOs now do not have a contract for monitoring community schools due to the non-availability
of funds with the GoB/BEF. Community schools established by the Project have an average
student teacher ratio of 34.

Based on this analysis, the cost of delivering primary education per student per year under the
project community schools in both scenarios is given in Table 3 below. Under Scenario I, the
cost of delivering primary education per student per year through the Project’s community
schools is PKR 7,072 (US$ 69.15), compared to the government school cost of PKR 10,729
(US$ 104.91). This is 34% less than the cost of delivering primary education under government
schools. Similarly, under Scenario II, the cost of delivering primary education per student per
year through the Project’s community schools is PKR 3,838 (US$ 37.52) as compared to the
government school cost of PKR 10,729 (US$104.91). This is 64% less than the cost of delivering
primary education under government schools. The cost of delivering primary education with
monitoring through TIPs (NGOs) or without monitoring through TIPs (NGOs), remains
substantially less than the cost of delivering primary education through government primary
schools.

If the student teacher ratio in community schools goes down to 22 from 34, the cost of delivery
of primary education will match that of government schools, where the current student teacher
ratio is currently at 43:1.

Executive Summary

Balochistan Education Support Project (BESP) started in August 2006 with the support of World
Bank financed IDA credit. Government of Balochistan was the borrower and Balochistan
Education Foundation was the client of the project in coordination with Government of
Balochistan. The project rationale was the improvement and development in the public private
and community partnership in the province. The Project implementation mechanism was
designed after assessing the lessons learned from the previous project in the name of BPEP
(Balochistan Primary Education Project) from 1993 to 1999. Revised mechanism was a unique
design which hired local NGOs as CIPs (Community Implementation Partners) private
individuals and organizations as PIPs (Private schools Implementing Partners) and public and
private institutes as TIPs (Technical Implementing Partners). The organizations collaborated the
partnership with BEF for achievement of three set Project Development Objective intermediate
outcomes as establishment of 650 Community Schools, 200 private Schools and building
capacity of Teachers, Parents Education Committee members, Community Implementing
Partners (NGOs), Private schools Implementing Partners (PIPs) and BEF staff.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) based on the outcome indicators of enrolling 35000
children with 40% girls, retaining the students’ attendance to 70%, teachers attendance to 90%,
students grade completion rate to 70%, and annual increase of 3% and 5% in learning
achievement in language and mathematics respectively. All the PDO level outcome indicators
were achieved in access by the end of the project except the backlog of 3% in overall target of
40% girls enrollment in first outcome indicator on enrolling the children in community schools.
All the Project Development Objective indicators were achieved through three set intermediate
outcomes.

The project contributes 5% of total Balochistan primary enrollment.

The project design introduced a new cost and time effective model to Balochistan Education
Department in terms of immediate access to all the deprived population/locations. Planning and
Development Department, Government of Balochistan strongly recommends that the design
should be adopted for an instant enrollment of an alarming number of out of schools children in
Balochistan.

Project Background and Context

With a population of over 150 million people, Pakistan is the second most populous country in
the South Asian region. Economic growth has increased from an average of 3.3 % during 1997-
2002 to an average of nearly 6 % during 2002-05. The FY06 data indicates that economic growth
would continue to be strong at about 6.3%. The earthquake in the north of Pakistan had no direct
impact on Balochistan, and was expected to have only a marginal impact on economic growth.


                                                                                             37
However, the fiscal impact of the earthquake was expected to be substantial due to large
additional expenditure on relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction.

Balochistan’s economy differs from that of the rest of Pakistan. It is the poorest of the country’s
four provinces, with standards of living and social indicators lagging substantially the rest of
Pakistan. With 43% of the total land mass of the entire country it has very low population density
with5% of the country’s population. This makes service delivery and infrastructure development
extremely challenging. A large proportion of the population lives in small and dispersed rural
settlements with only 24 % of the population living in urban areas.
Moreover, Balochistan’s financial resources for addressing its development agenda are limited
and continued prevalence of governance issues deeply impair development prospects.

Education attainment in Balochistan reflected the province’s overall low development indicators.
Literacy levels at 37% lagged way behind the other provinces, and the national average of 53%.
Some of its districts had one of the lowest rates in the world, with one district recording literacy
of 4%, and with only 2% enrollment at primary level.

The issues of the sector in Balochistan can be summarized as follows:
Low and declining enrollment in primary education: National survey statistics 17 for
Balochistan show that Primary Net Enrolment Rate (NER) has increased only marginally from
36% in 1998-99 to 37% in 2004-05. Over this period net enrolment rates have shown an
alarming lack of progress for both boys (44% in 1998-99 and 44% in 2004-05) and girls (28% in
1998-99 and 29% in 2004-05).

Large gender disparities: Primary gross enrolment rate (GER) for girls, at 49% compares very
unfavorably with that of 83% for boys. Female enrolment is 35% of total primary enrolment.
Female participation is constrained by insufficient female teachers for girls’ schools, lack of
qualified local women who could potentially become teachers, large distances affecting female
mobility, and cultural and social issues of a tribal society in rural areas which places less value
on girls’ education. Then there were slightly over 40,000 teachers in the government system
from primary to higher levels out of which only about 12,000 were female. It had a total of 9734
government primary schools, out of which 6862 were male. The number of schools at the
middle level were only 772 (228 for girls), and there were 550 (124 for girls) high schools in the
province. Government schools’ enrolment was 707,000 at the primary level, only 100,000 at the
middle level, and 40,000 at the high school level.

Poor quality of education: Poor teacher training, lack of qualified teachers, especially women,
high teacher absenteeism, poor monitoring and supervision, lack of textbooks, overcrowded
classrooms in some schools, ineffective use of facilities in others, and outdated pedagogical

  Pakistan Integrated Household Surveys (PIHS) in 1998-99 and 2001-02, and its successor the
Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM) in 2004-05, the PSLM

practices have resulted in very poor quality primary education. Poor quality of teaching has
contributed to low levels of student learning

Lack of continued community focus in successful community support programs: The spirit of
community participation is strong in Balochistan, and builds upon the successful experience of
the Community Support Program (CSP) under the IDA supported Balochistan Primary
Education Project (BPEP) between 1993-99, which established about 1,300 new girls schools,
with 60,000 girls’ enrolment, in partnership with communities. After the end of BPEP, the CSP
Schools were converted into government schools under government management. The teachers
no longer felt accountable to the communities and as a result the community involvement
declined over time. The government system was unable to sustain community participation due
to its own institutional constraints.

Limited participation of the private sector: Private schools account for about 6 % of enrollment
in primary education 18 in Balochistan, compared with 28 % for the country as a whole. The
primary GER in government schools in Balochistan at 63 % compares well with the Pakistan
average of 62 %. The overall GER of 67 % for Balochistan was lower than that for Pakistan at
86%. While the rest of Pakistan had experienced an expansion in low cost private schools, in
Balochistan, private schools had only increased from around 250 schools in 1993-94 to around
1,300 in 2003-04, 19 mainly operating in the urban and semi-urban areas. Private sector
expansion into rural areas was limited by financial constraints on both the potential private
school operators and the target population.

Weak institutional capacity of the public sector: In 2004-05 there were 707,00020 primary
school students enrolled in government schools, taught by about 17,000 teachers. The Provincial
Authorities at various levels (provincial, district, local) lacked the capacity to plan, regulate and
monitor the delivery of quality primary education, especially in the rural areas. Weak capacity
has been further affected by a poor governance environment which in turn affected quality of
public service delivery.

Lack of financial resources: Balochistan has limited revenue generation capacity with low
growth of the private sector. This was exacerbated by the province’s geographic spread, with low
population density, which makes it difficult for government to offer full coverage in a cost-
effective manner.

 Estimated by the private school operators association in Balochistan. In the year 2000 the Federal Bureau of
Statistics carried out a sample survey of private educational institutions in Balochistan and estimated the total
number of private schools at 452, of which 261 were primary schools. This data will be updated with an ongoing
census of all educational institutions in Pakistan.

  GER rates from PSLM (CWIQ) 2004-05 together with population estimates from the National Institute of
Population Studies (NIPS) indicates that there are 707,000 primary school students in government schools in 2004-
05. Administrative data from BEMIS also reports 707,000 primary school students and 16,872 primary grade
teachers in government schools in 2004-05.

(4) Average annual teacher attendance (Target: average annual teacher attendance, net of leave
entitlement, not less than 90%); and (5) Average annual increase in learning achievement in
Language and Mathematics (Target: an annual increase of 3% and 5% respectively).

All five PDO level targets were met except the enrollment of girls. The enrollment of girlswas
37% of the total enrollment (42% in community schools and 30% in private schools) against a
target of 40%.

By the end of the project, the total enrollment in 633 community schools and 197 private sector
schools was 48,629 with 17,794 (37%) girls covering all districts of Balochistan.The total
enrollment of students in community schools was 26,248, average annual student attendance was
84%, average grade completion rate was 81%; and average annual teacher attendance was 96%.
The total enrollment of students in private schools was 22,381, average annual student
attendance was 86%, average grade completion rate was 85%; and average annual teacher
attendance was 94%. The average annual increase in learning achievement in Language and
Mathematics for community schools was 6.17% and 9.60% respectively in both the schools. No
assessment was carried out for measuring this for private schools.

The student attendance, completion rate, and teacher attendance increased by 3%, 3%, and 1%
respectively; the reason was continuous monitoring and follow up from BEF and its IPs.

The 42 months extension period was focused on construction of building for community schools.
The enrollment during these 42 months only dropped by 1,585 in community schools because of
the low retention rate of school teachers. The target for community school construction was
reduced from 450 at appraisal to 225in 2011. The target was revised because the funding for this
activity was only sufficient to construct 225 schools due to increase in the cost of construction
material and labor that was not anticipated at the time of appraisal. Out of these 225 community
schools, only 219 were constructed and the remaining 6 were dropped because of the community
conflict. The construction of community schools started in 2012 instead of 2009 because the
construction modality could not be finalized in time. Eventually it was agreed between the Bank

and the GoB that the community schools will be constructed through PECs with facilitation of
Individual Engineering Consultants (IEC) hired by BEF.

During the extension period, only community schools were monitored and the private sector
schools component was dropped in December 2010 because it was not in the original design of
the project. The target for private schools was revised from 300 to 200 schools because of the
non-availability of PIPs that could have qualified under the selection criteria of this component.

Parent Education Committees (PECs) of all 633 community schools were registered as legal
entities. Their accounts were opened and made operational either in a bank or a post office. To
ensure sustainability of the Project schools, the Government of Balochistan allocated and
subsequently transferred funds for salaries and non-salary expenditure.

Under the capacity building component of BESP, 1,100 teachers were trained (764 community
school teachers and 336 private school teachers), against a target of 2,100. The target of 2,100
estimated at appraisal was high because it anticipated a larger number of teachers per school. All
BEF and CIP professional staff was trained in project management, financial management, social
mobilization, human resource management, M&E along with other training areas as per the need
of the professional staff. All private school operators and teaching staff was trained in private
school financial management and administration, record keeping, managing relationships
with parents, etc. against a target of 80%. 3,245 Members of all 633 PEC’s were trained. PEC
members were trained only once during the duration the entire project. These members left PECs
when they migrated to other villages or became ineligible for PEC membership once their
children graduated. The new members that replaced the old members were not trained.

BEF’s capacity through component 3 was enhanced to expand its operations into low enrollment
areas and scaled up its operations as evident from its presence in the remote rural areas of all
districts in Balochistan. The TPV highlighted that the advantage of a capable and experienced
Managing Director coupled with motivated and hardworking managers, remained a core reason
for successful operations by BEF.

Factors Affecting Implementation

Widespread Geographical Area:
The project dared a good successful attempt to access to the communities where the GoB ED
could not access. The purpose contributed a model support to Education Department but the
widespread and scattered communities hurdled service delivery and communication means.
However, the commitment of BEF and the IPs and communities made it possible to establish the
schools.

Lack of interest of community participation:
The low literacy rate in rural Balochistan ultimately results lack of the interest of rural
communities in educational activities and development. The regular social mobilization being the
part of the project design made the participation of the communities sure throughout the project
period.




                                                                                               42
Risk to Development Outcome

The risks identified during project preparation were appropriate and addressed through
implementing mitigation measures. These included strengthening BEF’s Board membership to
reflect a majority of the members from the private sector, establishment of a central complaints
mechanism, intensive training to BEF, IPs, Teachers, and PECs, regular programme and
financial monitoring, and improvement in procurement procedures. Risks that still persist are: (i)
weak economic management and volatile security situation can limit GoB’s investments in
education; (ii) GoB’s commitment diminishes with regard to supporting community based
primary education; and (iii) and Government funding for the recurrent expenditures of
community schools eventually dwindles or is withdrawn due to a tight fiscal situation

Sustainability of the Project

The project has been managed by BEF from its inception to closeout. BEF was able to manage
the establishment, operationalization, and construction of primary schools. It built the capacity of
teachers, IPs, and PECs; successfully produced and distributed child centered learning materials;
established a fully operational education monitoring system; and created partnerships with
private sector and NGOs partners to help deliver quality primary education. The project has built
sufficient institutional capacity in BEF and its local IPs to manage the project interventions after
the close out of the project.
The community schools established under the project will continue to function if the financial
support that includes teacher fees and community schools’ operation and maintenance charges
continue to be funded by the GoB’s annual budget for primary education and the community
schools are regularly monitored by BEF. Private schools will function on a sustainable basis
through charging fees that cover their operational cost.

The low cost private schools established under the project are not monitored since July 2011.
This component was closed in December 2010 because of the non-availability of PIPs that
qualified under the selection criteria for PIPs. The Third Party Validation conducted in 2009
highlighted that about 29% of these schools were operating at a break even and the remaining
71% were saving between PKR 15,000 to PKR 50,000.

Banks involvement in the province will continue in the education sector. The Bank plans to
transition its existing US$14.46 million ‘Promoting Girls Education in Balochistan’ (PGEB)
project when it ends in June 2015 to a new US$34 million ‘Global Partnership for Education’
project for Balochistan in 2015.

Other Outcomes and Impacts of the project

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
BESP had an impact on gender equity. The Gender Parity Index (primary school) in project
schools was 0.60 for rural areas that is quite close to the provincial ratio of 0.69. Since the
project was focused on vulnerable groups, it promoted inclusion of disadvantaged populations in
the education system.




                                                                                                 43
Institutional Change/Strengthening

BESP implementation resulted in significant institutional changes and made progress towards
strengthening capacity of BEF in education development, financial management, grant
management, monitoring and evaluation, fostering relationships with the communities and the
private sector education institutions, and inclusion of disadvantaged populations.

Lessons Learned

          It is very important that the public sector commitment and ownership for the
           implementation and successful completion of any project are efficient.
          The PECs when migrate or their children graduate, they have to quit the membership
           of the PEC. The PECs should be imparted with regular training every year or every
           second or third year.
          In retaining children and teachers attendance, and increasing children enrollment and
           decreasing dropouts, community active participation is important.
          Public sector institutions capacity to measure average annual increase in learning
           achievement in Language and Mathematics in Schools is weak. This needs to be built
           within institution, which deal with the education sector.
          To retain teachers at Community Schools, their salaries need to be at the minimum
           equivalent to the minimum wage rate.
          Capacity development support is crucial for ensuring timely and effective
           implementation of projects in provinces and regions that have limited public sector
           capacity, weak private sector presence and have deteriorating law and order situation.
          Community School construction should be undertaken through professional
           engineering contractors under the supervision of PECs.
          Early Childhood Education should be made a part of primary school teacher training.
          Most importantly, the community school establishment design is far time and cost
           effective. The province is suffering from and alarming access issue. Education
           Department of Balochistan should adopt this design to ensure access throughout
           Balochistan.

Borrower’s comments on Draft ICR (received on December 31, 2014 from Prof. Dr. Abdul
Tawab Khan, Managing Director, Balochistan Education Foundation)

Dear Aysha,

Thank you very much for sharing the draft ICR. We have gone through it and it seems aligned
with the discussion and consultations during ICR preparation process.

However, through this communication I would avail opportunity to bring on record, the
continual support and professionalism of The World Bank team during implementation of BESP
project. No doubt, without which achievements and successful implementation would have not
been possible. Certainly, it is an appreciable contribution of The World Bank in education sector
of most underprivileged rural communities of deprived province.

I would also like to record that Balochistan Education Foundation (BEF) as an implementing
agency of the BESP has demonstrated visible progress and learning enthusiasm, despites of
several challenges of distances, peace & security, cultural barriers and lack of infrastructure.
BEF has successfully completed the challenge of establishing 633 Community Driven Schools in
far flung rural areas of Province, enrolling 27,000 children with 44% girls’ students. The
performance has been recognized by line departments and the donor at various forums. BEF
remained successful in maintaining and ensuring transparency and good financial management
practices during the implementation of BESP. During the period of project, BEF is turned into
performing organization and able to establish professional, honest and dedicated team.

Now, this is the time to make efforts in sustaining Community School Model and enhance it to
scale, so that development indicators on access to quality education in the province could be
achieved. In this regard, BEF expects and requests all possible support of The World Bank in
future as we enjoyed in past.
