                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The PDO indicators of the project remain on track with above target enrollment and satisfactory student and teacher attendance at community schools. The project continues to
                         support 633 functional schools across the Balochistan province with an enrollment of 26,000 children (43% Girls). The last phase of construction of community schools is underway
                         now with an end target of 225 community schools. Of this target, 116 schools have been completed. Availability of adequate funds to meet the nonsalary recurrent expenditures of
                         community schools remains an issue and could affect school operation and sustainability.
