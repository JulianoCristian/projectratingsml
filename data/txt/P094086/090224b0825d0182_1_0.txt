                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project is coming to an end having achieved its development objectives, with all of the PDO indicators met. Notably, the targets for enrollment, for student and teacher
                         attendance at community schools, and for student grade completion have been surpassed. These outcomes are particularly encouraging given the extremely challenging operational
                         and security environment in the province, as well as the fact that Balochistan has the lowest education outcomes in the country. The project continues to support 633 functional
                         schools across the Balochistan province with an enrollment of 26,000 children (43% Girls). The last phase of construction of community schools is underway now with an end target
