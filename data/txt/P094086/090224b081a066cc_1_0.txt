                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall progress of the Balochistan Education Support Project toward achievement of its development objectives remains moderately satisfactory. With an enrollment of over 26,000
                         (43% girls) in 633 community schools in all 30 districts of the province, the project has achieved its end of project enrollment targets. However, delays in construction of community
                         schools puts these achievements at risk.
                         There has been considerable progress in construction of the first batch of 100 community schools (a total of 225 schools are expected to constructed using project financing)

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured in July 2012 to (i) extend the closing date of the project for two years to allow completion of school construction; and (ii) reallocate funds from the
                         unallocated category of the project to enable continued support to parent education committees (PECs) that manage community schools during the extension period.
