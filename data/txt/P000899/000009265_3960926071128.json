The overall outcome of the project\n            is rated as satisfactory; the performance of the Bank and\n            the borrower is rated moderately satisfactory. The project\n            objectives were to support the Government's efforts to\n            reform public sector management, in the short term, by\n            facilitating the implementation of the Structural Adjustment\n            Program (SAP) and, in the longer term, by strengthening the\n            policy, and management capacities of key government agencies\n            to manage the economy. Lessons learned are as follows: (a)\n            The closer control of training could ensure that those\n            trained are assigned to more responsible jobs, and are\n            eligible for promotions, possible salary supplements or\n            other incentives in order to retain them in the civil\n            service. (b) A clear understanding by International\n            Development Association (IDA) of the socio-political\n            framework, and sufficient consultation with the authorities\n            would avoid over-designing of project components and wasted\n            efforts, as was the case for the Economic Liaison Unit\n            (ELU), and the Economic Policy Unit (EPU). (c) The Bank\n            should support an independent initiative for policy analysis\n            such as the recently established centre for policy analysis,\n            which will do non-partisan economic research, and is\n            supported by the Government. The center should play an\n            advisory role not only to high-level government authorities\n            but also to technicians responsible for policy analysis. (d)\n            The Government should create an environment in which\n            Ghanaian economists feel that they have an opportunity to\n            contribute to improved policy making."}, "docdt": "1993-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
