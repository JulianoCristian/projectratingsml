MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT PROJECT
1.        The following report  on a proposed  development credit to  Ghana
for SDR 8.6 million (US$10.8 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and help finance an
institutional support project linked to the Structural Adjustment Program
(see Report No. P-4403-GH, dated March 23, 1987 distributed separately).
2.        Background.  Since 1983, Ghana has been implementing an ambitious
Economic  Reform  Program  (ERP), making  profound   changes  in  economic
policies and institutions. In carrying out the ERP, the Government is
v          contending with a  large number  of economic.  technical and  institutional
difficulties. Of these, weak management and implementation capacity are
emerging as   particularly important  constraints.   The key  economic  and
financial management agencies are seriously understaffed and suffer from
shortcomings in organization and financial resources to purchase necessary
equipment. In particular, policy analysis, public investment planning,
budgetary control, aid coordination and debt management functions need to
be strengthened urgently.   Economic and  financial manage.ment  information
systems  need  upgrading   to  improve  policy   making.   The  supply   of
professional skills to the civil service must be augmented substantially,
while excess staff at the lower levels need to be retrenched.   Recognizing
that as the structural adjustment program gathers momentum, already
overloaded  economic   management  institutions   will  be   placed   under
increasingly severe pressure, the Government has made public sector
management reform a key goal.
3.        Proiect Obiectives.  The  project's  immediate  objective  is  to
facilitate implementation of the Structural Adjustment Program, while its
long-term goal is to rebuild the Government's capacity to efficiently
manage the economy.   Specifically, the  project would  (a) strengthen  the
capacity of core agencies, especially the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning (MFEP), to formulate and implement economic policies in pursuit of
structural adjustment objectives; (b) increase public sector productivity
by supporting Government's efforts to overcome the skilled manpower
shortages, rationalize civil service management and retrench surplus staff
over 1986-88; and (c) provide policy-makers with timely information on the
impact of reforms on the welfare of different population groups.
4.        Project Description. The project would support: (a) establishment
of a policy advisory staff under the Secretary of MFEP; (b) creation of a
unit within the office serving the Head of State and the Government charged
with processing of economic policy decisions and aid agreements; (c)
expansion of MFEP's capacity to undertake public investment programming,
budgeting, expenditure forecasting and control, revenue collection, debt
management and aid coordination; (d) execution of a staffing and functional
review of the civil service and a related salary policy review, and
establishment of a sound personnel management system, through the office of



- 2 -
the Head of the Civil Service (OHCS); (e) design of a coherent staff
redeployment program and support for redeployment and training activities;
(f) provision of studies and advisory services in support of critical
structural adjustment program tasks, carried out by mobilizing skilled
Ghanaians wherever possible from outside the public service through a
skills mobilization scheme; and (g) implementation of a living standards
measurement survey. Overall guidance to project management would be
provided by the Government's Structural Adjustment Program Teem. A project
director responsible for day-to-day project operations has been appointed
to head  a  newly-formed  Project  Management Unit.   The  project,  to  be
implemented over seven years, would finance both local and international
consultants,  in-country  and  overseas  training,  office  equipment   and
vehicles (including operation and maintenance). The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$14.1 million, including a foreign exchange
component of US$8.9 million or 63 percent of the total. Financing would be
provided by the proposed credit, a grant of US$1.1 million from ODA(UK) for
the civil service and training components and by US$ 2.2 million from the
Government. The Government's contribution includes US$1.2 million financed
through proceeds from the sale of PL480 Food for Peace. UNDP co-financing
for the economic planning and  training components is under discussion.   A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing e-vents and the status of
Bank  Group  operations  in  Ghana  are   given  in  Schedules  C  and   D,
respectively. The staff appraisal report, No. 6693-GE dated March 20,
1987, is also attached.
5.        Rationale for IDA involvement.  There is little prospect that the
Government can successfully implement the SAL (and proposed IHF SAE and
EFF) -- especially the specific conditions on public expenditure, including
investment planning-- in a timely manner, without assistance of the type
proposed. In addition, the project is designed to strengthen Ghana's
institutional capacity in economic management, and its long-term objectives
are therefore central to the Bank's country strategy and lending program.
The SAL program, the proposed public enterprise reform project, and the
proposed project together represent a coherent approach to public sector
management reform. IDA is also the lead agency in attracting co-financing
for the reforms.
6.        Agreed Actions.   The  Government  and IDA  have  agreed  on  the
following conditions of effectiveness: (a) all conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of the Structural Adjustment Credit agreements would be
fulfilled; (bl MEEP should assign a training officer to co-ordinate the
training to be carried out under the economic management sub-components;
(c) IDA would review and approve the project's first year work program; and
(d) Government would approve the skills mobilization scheme. Agreement has
been reached with the ODA(UK) on the terms of reference for the staffing
and functional review, review of the Civil Service Act, salary policy
review, DHCS institutional assessment and preparation of a training and
staff development program.



In addition, assurances have been received that (a) IDA would be afforded
an  opportunity  to  comment   on  any  major   changes  proposed  in   the
organization, structure and functions of HKEP; and (b) Government would
complete  a  salary  policy  study  not  later  than  November  30,   1987.
Government and IDA also have agreed that no disbursements would be made for
expenditures  for:   (c)  the   skills   mobilization  scheme   until   the
administrative  arrangements  for  the  scheme  have  been   satisfactorily
defined; (d) building materials for completing housing for persons to be
employed under the skills mobilization scheme until Government submits
satisfactory details of the materials required; and (e) contracts entered
into after December 31 of each year until review and approval by IDA of the
project's work programs for the year.
7.        Justification.   The  project  would   support  a  far   reaching
public sector  reform program.   In  addition to  the benefits  related  to
implementation of the Structural Adjustment Program, overall efficiency  of
the ministries and agencips dealing with economic and public sector
management  would  increase.    Improved working  conditions,   logistical
support, higher salaries (from reallocation of budgetary savings from
retrenchment), and training opportunities would permit Government to
attract and retain more qualified civil servants, particularl7 at higher
levels.
8.        Risks.  There  are three  risks all  of which  which the  project
shares with the Structural Adjustment Program: (a) dependence on the few
Government officials who constitute the core economic team; (b) the
proposed split of MPEP into separate ministries of Finance and of Planning,
which might adversely affect implementation, especially if the resource
allocation function (public investment program and budgeting) were divided;
and  (c)  political  difficulties  in   carrying  out  the  civil   service
redeployment program. Government management weakness would be mitigated by
the streamlined project organization already established and by encouraging
the hiring of Ghanaian andlor external consultants. The Government has
assured IDA that it will be consulted on any proposed major changes in the
organization, structure and functions of MEEP. To overcome resistance to
civil service reform, Government, with IDA support, is exploring other
sources of external assistance to help ease retrenched workers' transition
into other productive employment.
9.        Recommendation.  I am  satisfied that the  proposed credit  would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
