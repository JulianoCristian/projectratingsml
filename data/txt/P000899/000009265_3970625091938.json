Specifically, the project will: 1) strengthen the\n            capacity of core agencies, especially the Ministry of\n            Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP), to formulate and\n            implement economic policies in pursuit of structural\n            adjustment objectives; 2) increase public sector\n            productivity by supporting Government's efforts to\n            overcome the skilled manpower shortages, rationalize civil\n            services management and retrench surplus staff over 1986-88;\n            and, 3) provide policy makers with timely information on the\n            impact of reforms on the welfare of different population groups."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
