MEMORANDUM AND RECOMNENDATION OF TUE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$79 MILLION
TO THE KINGDOX OF XOROCCO
FOR A HIGHUAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.    The following report on a proposed loan to the Kingdom of Morocco in the
amount of US$79.O million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would be repayable over 20 years with five years of grace at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate and would assist in (a) implementing a three-year
priority program (1990-92) of rehabilitation and periodic maintenance; (b)
strengthening the overall institutional framework by integrating road maintenance
planning within a comprehensive pavement management system; (c) improving the
organization of the road freight transport market through progressive
deregulation and associated changes in road user taxation policy and in vehicle
safety, and (d) enhancing the operations of the construction industry.
2.    Backaround.  Road haulage dominates the Moroccan inland transport market,
handling over 90% of interurban passenger traffic and about 70% of freight
traffic.  However, because of restrictions on funding in recent years, road
infrastructure now requires substantial rehabilitation or upgrading to meet the
demand for improved levels of service. This includes (i) rehabilitation and
maintenance of the classified road network, (ii) betterment of the rural roads
network, (iii) modernization of parts of the classified network, and (iv)/bridge
reconstruction and repair.   Given the continuing need for macro-economic
stabilization, Morocco cannot afford investments requiring large contributions
from the Government budget, and has had to ado:.t in the 1988-92 Development Plan
a strict strategy of public expenditir is rationalization. For the road sector
this means postponing the road betterment and modernization programs [items ii)
and iii) abovel, and giving utmost priority to the maintenance of the existing
infrastructure and to improving the efficiency of transport operations. The
proposed project would provtide essential support in this respect, thereby
substantially reducing expenditures on deferred maintenance and ultimately on
reconstruction in the future, and increasing the sector's contribution to the
economic recovery.
3.    Proiect Objectives.   The proposed project would be the first Bank
operation for the highway sector in the past five years and would introduce a
broader, sectoral approach to the development of the highway sector and to road
transport in general.   The main objectives are to assist the Government in
bringing sector investments in line with economic priorities, primarily by (i)
concentrating resources on the preservation of existing roads, (ii) strengthening
the overall institutional framework by optimizing the use of funds for road
resurfacing and maintenance within a compreh-~ensive pavement management program,
(iii) pursuing efficiency improvements iii the road transport market through
progressive deregulation of the trucking industry and related adjustments in road
user taxation, and (iv) pursuing efficiency improvements in the construction
industry in lire with the Bank's efforts in the Maghreb region. As part of
project preparation, the Bank assisted with an analysis of road user charges,
which resulted in the establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund thereby ensuring



more stable resources for road maintenance operations. In addition, the priority
road investment and maintenance program included under the proposed project is
being monitored in terma of overall resource allocations, as part of the target
investment program under the SAL. Finally, a National Transport Sector Master
Plan Study, prepared as part of the PERL, has proposed a far-reaching program
of reforma for the road transport industry which is currantly being reviewed by
the Government.  The initial steps in thîs process, as vell as provision for
discussions with the Bank on further steps in de;:egulation of road transport are
included in the project Action Plan. As such, the project objectives are fully
consistent with the Bank's overall strategy for Morocco, which involves
rationalization of the public investment program, liberalization of tbe oconomy,
and support to resource mobilization.
4.    Prolect DescriRtion.   The proposed project consiste of an investment
component, to be financed under the loan, supported by a policy adjuwtment and
institutional development Action Plan.  The investment componont would consit
of a three-year slice of the road investment and maintenance program, and the
loan would be disbursed against selected expenditures, including: (i) civil works
for road rehabilitation (about 1,000 km), and periodic maintenance (about 1,300
km of road resurfacing, 500 km of shoulder restoration, and 5,000 km of pavement
marking), bridge reconstruction, construction of workshops and of the National
Center for Vehicle Inspection and Testing (CNEHA); (ii) equipment for road
maintenance, traffic counting, workshops, and road safety; (iii) consulting
services required to implement the Action Plan, namely studies for the
development of transport in rural areas, studies for the widening of narrow
roadas, and technical assistance and overseas training for the strengthening of
MPW and MOT, and the development of a program to increase the  construction
industry efficiency. The Project Action Plan provides a comprehensive time-bound
framework for monitoring the key policy and institutional development objectives
under the project with particular reference to the organization of the road
freight transport market, road user charges, and improvements in road maintenance
planning, in particular through the clarification of responsibilities between
central and local governments (para. 7).
5.    Project Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the three-year-program
(1990-92) is estimated at US$533.6 million with a foreign exchange cost of about
US$254.7 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$79 million would finance 15X of
the total program, while proposed parallel cofinancing from the African
Development Bank in the amount of US$33 million vould cover a further 6X.  The
rest of the program is financed from budgetary resources (34X), earmarked road
user revenues (29X), and ongoing World Bank and African Development Bank loans
(16%). A breakdown of the program costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedules
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of the key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7983-MOR,
dated January 8, 1990, is being distributed separately.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The Bank has influenced important
institutional changes in the transport sector and has helped the Goverrment
develop its transport infrastructure throughout its lending activities.



- 3 -
Deterioration of that basic infrastructure is the main threat facing the
Government in thf.s protracted period of stabilization and adjustment, and Bank
involvement would ensure that road rehabilitation and maintenance will receive
due priority within the entire sector investment program over the next five
years. Also Bank involvement would support the Government's commitment to
increased liberalization in the transport sector, specifically by reducing its
intervention on the road transport market, and by providing appropriate
incentives through changes in road user taxation. The objective is to eliminate
distortions and reduce overall transport costs.   Under the aspects of both
investment rationalization and increased operational efficiency, the proposed
project would build on progress achieved under the PERL and the more recent SAL.
Regarding the construction industry, the project would support ongoing Bank
initiatives for the enhancement of the construction sector in the Maghreb region.
7.    Ag-iaed Actions.   Agreement has been reached on the overall scope and
priorities of the road investment Pnd maintenance program and on the need to
review the program annually with the Bank. A comprehensive project Action Plan
has also been discussed and agreed. It covers the first steps in progressive
liberalization of the road freight transport market, adjustment in road user
taxation to provide appropriate incentives for the renewal of the truck fleet,
specific measures for improving road maintenance planning and a timetable for
formal approval and implementation of a new road network classification with a
clear allocation of responsibilities between central and local governments. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government on the following
actions of particular significance: (a) execution of the project Action Plan;
(b) updating the investment and maintenance program annually including taking
measures to ensure adequate budgetary allocations; (c) submission of a technical
and economic evaluation of subprojects according to the agreed methodology and
criteria; and (d) provision of appropriate financial accounting and reporting.
8.    Justification. The project will bring substantial benefits to the economy
in the form of reduced transport costs which will follow from the road
rehabilitation and maintenance program.   In addition, improved planning of
maintenance operations will optimize the use of scarce maintenance funds, and
together with the improved maintenance program, provide longer-term savings by
avoiding or defering road reconstruction costs. Improvements in the organization
of the road freight transport market will also contribute to lowering total road
transport costs.   Enhancement of the construction industry operations will
improve the ability of local enterprises to cope effectively and efficiently with
expanding construction demand.   Overall,  these reductions  in costs will
facilitate industrial and agricultural growth and export trade expansion. The
*     economic rates of return (ER) of subprojects range from 20% to over 100% for the
road rehabilitation components (average 50%), and from 24% to 90% for the
periodic maintenance components  (average 30%).   The overall ER for the
Bank-financed part of the investment program is about 40%.
9.    Risks.  The main risk relates to the timeframe needed to overcome long
established institutional rigidities in NOT's operational structure.   The
Government has shown, during project preparation, a strong commitment to project
objectives by initiating substantial actions covering road use- charges. The
careful design of the Project Action Plan, as well as the strengthening of NOT's

capabilities, should reduce tih rlk of dtscontinuity in  "OT' coumitusnt. The
rsik of a possible shortfall in budg.tary allocetions for th. prograu bas ben
considerably reduc.d vith (t) the recent creation of the Road Mainte nnoe lunm,

periodic reviews of th. public iuvestment prograr under the SAL Sud under the
project.
