The main objectives are to bring sector investments\n            in line with economic priorities, primarily by: (a)\n            concentrating resources on the preservation of existing\n            roads; (b) strengthening the overall institutional framework\n            by optimizing the use of funds for road resurfacing and\n            maintenance; (c) pursuing efficiency improvements in the\n            road transport market; (d) pursuing efficiency improvements\n            in the construction industry. The  project consists of two\n            components. First, the investment component will consist of\n            a three-year slice of the road investment and maintenance\n            program including: (a) civil works; (b) equipment for road\n            maintenance, traffic counting, workshops and road safety;\n            and (c) studies, technical assistance and overseas training.\n            The adjustment and institutional development component\n            provides a comprehensive time-bound framework for pursuing\n            the key policy and institutional development objectives\n            under the project with particular reference to the\n            organization of the road freight transport market, road user\n            charges and improvements in road maintenance planning."}, "docdt": "1990-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
