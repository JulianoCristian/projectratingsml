The main objectives are to bring sector investments\n            in line with economic priorities, primarily by: (a)\n            concentrating resources on the preservation of existing\n            roads; (b) strengthening the overall institutional framework\n            by optimizing the use of funds for road resurfacing and\n            maintenance; (c) pursuing efficiency improvements in the\n            road transport market; and (d) pursuing efficiency\n            improvements in the construction industry. The project\n            consists of two components. First, the investment component\n            will consist of a three-year slice of the road investment\n            and maintenance program including: (a) civil works; (b)\n            equipment for road maintenance, traffic counting, workshops\n            and road safety; and (c) studies, technical assistance and\n            overseas training. The adjustment and institutional\n            development component provides a comprehensive time-bound\n            framework for pursuing the key policy and institutional\n            development objectives under the project with particular\n            reference to the organization of the road freight transport\n            market, road user charges and improvements in road\n            maintenance planning."}, "docdt": "1990-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
