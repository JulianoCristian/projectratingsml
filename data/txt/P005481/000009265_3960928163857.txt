KINGDON OF MOROCCO
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUHMARY
Borrower:              Kingdom of Morocco
Beneficiaries:         Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Transport
Amount:                US$79 million
Terms:                 Repayment in 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate.
Project Objectives:    The proposed project would be the first new operation for
the highway sector in the past five years and would
introduce a broader, sectoral approach to the development
of the highway sector and to road transport in general.
The main objectives are to assist the Government in
bringing sector investments in line with economic
priorities, primarily by (i) concentrating resources on
the preservation of existing roads; (ii) strengthening
che overall institutional framework by optimizing the use
of funds for road resurfacing and maintenance within a
compretiensive pavement management program; (iii) pursuing
efficiency improvements in the road transport market
through gradual deregulation of the trucking industry and
reiated adjustments in road user taxation and (iv)
pursuing efficiency improvements in the construction
industry in line with the Bank's efforts in the Maghreb
region. As such, the project objectives are consistent
with the Bank's overall strategy for Morocco, which
involves rationalization of the public investment program,
liberalization of the economy, and support to resource
mobilization.
Project Description:   The proposed project consists of an investment component,
to be financed under the loan, supported bv a policy
adjustment and institutional development component. The
investment comDonent would consist of a three-year slice
of the road investment and maintenance program, and the
loan would be disbursed against selected expenditures,             h
including: (i) civil works for road rehabilitation (about
1,000 km), and periodic maintenance (about 1,300 km of



( il.)
road resurfacing, 500 km of shoulder restoration, and
5,000 km of pavemient marking), bridge reconstruction,
construction of workshops and of the National Center for
Vehicle Inspection and Testirg (CNEHA);
(ii) equipment for road maintenan-s, traffic counting,
workshops, and  road  safety;  (iii)  studies  for  the
development of transport in rural areas, studies for the
widening of narrow roads, and technical assistance and
overseas training for the strengthening of MPW and MOT
and  the  development of a program  to  increase  the
construction industry efficiency.  The Adjustment and
Institutional   Develooment   Component   provides   a
comprehensive time-bound framevork for pursuing the key
policy and institutional development objectives under the
project with particular reference to the organization of
the road freight transport market, road user charges, and
improvements in road maintenance planning, in particular
through the reallocation of responsibilities between
central and local governments
Benefits and Risks;    Main benefits deriving from rehabiL. -ation and maintenance
programs are reduced road user costs and savings from
prolonged life of road pavements. Main benefits deriving
from policy and institutional measures are manifold: the
the project is expected to contribute to (i) strengthening
the Highway Department's capability for the planning and
management of the road network; (ii) improving MOT's
efficiency in management of the sector; (iii) facilitating
greater liberalization in the road transport market and
reducing overall transport costs; and (iv) improving the
ability of local enterprises to -ope effectively and
efficiently with expanding construction demand, while
supporting the ongoing Bank initiatives for the
enhancement of the construction industry in the Maghreb
region. Potential risks are those associated with the
timeframe   needed   to   overcome   long   established
institutional rigidities in MOT' s operational structure.
The Government has shown, during project pre.paration, a
strong commitment to project objectives by initiating
substantial actions covering road user charges.   The
careful design of the adjustment and institutional
development component, the strengthening of MOT's
capabilities, and the annual review of MOT expenditure
programs under the proposed project and under the SAL,
should reduce the risk of discontinuity in MOT's
commitment.

T. TUE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Transport and the Economv
1.01    Over the past five years, Morocco has undertaken important structural
reforms which, have succeeded in achieving a modest growth rate with low
inflation.   In the recent past, the Moroccan economy has grown at an annua.
average of about 3.3%, slightly more than the increase in population.   The
proposed medium-term adjustment program, which is being supported by the Bank,
seeks to reinvigorate the economy with a growth rate of about 5% per year. This
program is based on the implementation of several policy tools including fiscal
reform, trade liberalization, Public Znterprise reform, agricultural sector
deregulation, and an increase in the level and efficiency of public investment
expenditures (para. 1.06). In effect, while taking much of the brunt of fiscal
adjustment in the past, a continued reduced level in public inves-tment
expenditures could constitute a major constraint to maintaining a high level of
economic growth in the ruture. The proposed project forms part of the Bank's
program for structural adjuscment, and would provide support to the
rationalization and increased efficiency of priority investments and maintenance
in the highway sector.
1.02    The Moroccan transport sector plays an important role in the development
of the economy.   It provides direct support to industrial and agricultural
development, plays a key role in encouraging exports, and reducing the cost of
imports, and supports the growth of tourism.   The land transport system is
well-developed and includes some 28,000 km of paved roads out of a total network
of some 58,000 km, and a railway network of about 1,800 km, of which about 970
km are elertrified, and 240 km are double-track. There are nine major ports,
and about 20 airports handling scheduled flights. Total interurban passengers
a-,-d freight traffic are estimated at about 30 million passenger-kms and 15
billion ton-kms, of which about 93% and 70% respectively are carried by road
transport.
1.03    Although road transport dominates interurban passenger traffic, the share
of the railway is much more important in the main rail corridor between
Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat, and Kenitra with its extension r,orthward to
Tangier, and eastward to Fes and Oujda (Map IBRD 21695). These routes account
for about one-third of interurban traffic, with the railway handling about 25%
of the total (33% for freight traffic other than phosphates, and 20% for
passenger traffic). As a whole, rail passenger traffic increased at about 4%
per year over the last decade, mainly as a result of the introduction of improved
passenger services, particularly the high-speed trains between Casablanca and
Rabat. During the same period road traffic also increased at about 4% per year.
About 3 billion ton-kms of rail traffic, or 65% of the total, represent captive
phosphate traffic, which moves towards the ports of Casablanca, Jorf Lasfar, and
Safi for export. The port system, like the railways, was also developed to serve
phosphate exports, which have stabilized in recent years at 20 million tons
annually. Total port traffic in 1988 amounted to 39 million tons, of which close
to 18 million tons were handled through the main port of Casablanca. The latter
handled exports of agricultural products as well as imports and exports of
industrial goods, a large proportion of which is containerized.

B. Transport Organization
1.04    The Government agencies involved in the administration of the transport
system are: (i) the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), which is resrionsible for the
construction and maintenance of roads and ports infrastructure through its Road
and Port Directorates; it also o'ersees cargo handling and port opsrations; (ii)
the Ministry of Transport (MOT), 6aich regulates road transport, and supe:.vises
the railways, civil aviation, the state-owned bus company, and the sr:ate-owned
freight forwarding agency; (iii) the Ministry of Fishing and the Merchant Marine
which supervises shipping; and (iv) the Ministry of Interior as the supervising
body for local authorities, which are increasingly involved in the planning and
maintenance of local road networks.
1.05    Given the large number of agencies involved in the management of the
sector, there is sometimes an overlap of responsibilities between different
agencies. This is particularly true in the ports sector, where both ODEP (the
state-owned port operator) and MPW have responsibilities for planning port
infrastructure and for overseeing port operations. A port reorganization is
current'y underway (para. 1.09). Similar complications can be expected in the
future with increasing decentralization and the mobilization of resources at the
local authority level following the recent introduction of a value-added tax.
This has recently lead to a proposal for the reallocation of responsibilities
for the road network between MPW and local authorities (para. 2.03). In parallel
to increasing decentral,zation, there is also a move to introduce more autonomy
for public enterprises in the transport sector. The financial restruct tring of
a number of public enterprises and the implementation of "contrats-progiLammes",
clearly defining the respective responsibilities of Government and the
enterprises, are part of an ongoing Bank supported Public Enterprises
Restructuring Loan (PERL).   In the transport sector, this includes a reform
program for ONCF, the railway enterprise (para. 1.09).
C. Transport Investments
1.06    Table 1.1 shows transport sector public investments broken down into
road, rail, sea, and air transport modes, for the current P'an as well as the
two previous Plan periods.   Total transport sector investments have been
relatively stable in real terms over the past decade amounting to about DH 2.5
billion (US$300 million) annually in 1987 prices. Generally, about one third
of investments has been allocated to highways, one third to ports and shipping,
and about 25% to railways. Although investment levels had fallen during the past
few years due to budgetary constraints, overall expenditures in the sector are
likely to return to their former levels, in line with a need to provide the
necessary support to the adjustment process and renewed economic growth.
However, this increase in investment levels will be accompanied by a shift in
priorities with much greater emphasis being given to the highway sector, which
in turn will be compensated by a sharp decrease in expenditures on ports and
shipping. At the same time, and in line with the Government's policy to increase
the financial autonomy of its public enterprises, transfer of Government funds
to the railway sector have been curtailed. In all sectors priority is being
given to the completion of ongoing projects, and to the optimal utilization of
existing facilities.   Under a Bank Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), which



- 3 -
provides for annual reviews of a defined target investment program for the period
1988-90, the Gcovernment has commicted itself to increasing allocations to the
highway sector.   Details of the proposed highway investment and maintenance
program are given in Chapter II.

D. Sector Issues and Strategy
1.07    Bank  dialogue  with  the  Sovernment  on general  sector  issues  and
recommendations to solve them, concentrate on tha following:
(M)     improvement in the planning of investments and their coordination
among modes and across sectors;
(ii)     better ise of the existing faci.ities and services through improved
management of the public enterprises, stepped-up deregulation and
greater accountability of resources, and decentralization of
decisions;
(iii)     gradual  elimination  of  subsidies  by  the  Government  and
cross-subsidies among users through a more flexiblc tariff system.
and correct pricing of resources used; and
(iv)     increased  budgetary  allocations  for  the  rehabilitation  and
maintenance of infrastructure.
1.08    Closer intermodal coordination is needed both at the investment level
and in the provision of transport services; urban and interurban services,
schedules and routes have to be hetter coordinated, and a share of the process
should be left to market forces. The Government has made substantial efforts
to lmprove planning and coordination of investments in the road subsector by
submitting mairtenance and construction progrèams to prior economic analysis
(Third and Fourth Highway Projects), and further progress is expected with the
clarification of the maintenance responsibilities for the whole network (para.
2.03). Similarly, in the port subsector, considerable progress has been made
in the analysis of long-term programs, which are based on economic investment
criteria for project selection.   In parallel with these developments,  the
Government has also recently completed a road user chargé- study with the
objectives of improving equity in the recovery of road user costs and ensuring
ade.uate resources for highway rehabilitation and maintenance (para. 2.14). The
key issues at the present time relate to problems of road and rail coordination,
and the need to establish a planned program of investments in the main transport
corridors as well as to the need for greater liberalization in the road transport
market.   These issues are currently being analyzed as part of a National
Transport Master Plan Study, which is being financed under the Fourth Highway
Project.  Preliminary recommendations from this study as well as recommendations
on adjustments to road user charges will be pursued under the proposed project
and are included in the Action Plan (paras. 2.13 and 3.07).
1.09    Overall, Government policy towards public enterprises is changing with
the emphasis on reducing budget dependence, increasing managerial efficiency,
and transferring some of their opvrations to the private sector. In effect, the
Government is now realizing that excessive control and interference in the
management of the public enterprises, support for low priority investments,
limitations on market entry and below-cost tariffs have created distortions in
the transport market,  and excessive costs to the economy.   In 1985, the
Government took an initial stei to reduce its intervention on the road transport



market by raising the limit of trucks under route and freight assignment control
by the Office National des Transports (ONT) from . 5 to 8 tons.  Further progress
is row contemplated with a gradual change in ONT's role away from control of
regulations towards freight forwarding and the provision of information on the
road transport market on an optional basis (para. 2.13). In the port subsector,
in 1984,  the monopoly  of  the cargo handling  company was  abolished.    A
reorganization study being carried out with Bank financing under th Port of
Casablanca Project (Loan 2657-MOR) will make recommendations for decentralization
of port operations and privatization of some commercial activities.   In the
rail.way subsector, ONCF's financial position has improved under the Bank' Public
Enterprise Restructuring Loan (PERL), and it is currently establishing a
"contrat-programme"   with   the   Government   clearly   defining   respective
responsibilities and objectives.
E. Bank Experience in the Transport Sector
1.10    The Bank provided loans totalling US$258 miillion equivalent to the
Moroccan Government from 1969 to 1985 for the construction, improvement, and
rehabilitation of main roads under four highway projects, and of rural feeder
roads under ten agricultural projects. The first port project became effective
in 1986 and provides a loan of US$22 million to improve institutions in the port
subsector and help maintain infrastructure in the ports of Casablanca and
Mohammedia.   Although no railway operation has been financed by the Bank,
measures concerning ONCF were included under the Public Enterprise Restructuring
Loan (PERL). The highway projects were designed to encourage investments with
hlgh returns to the economty, particularly maintenance and rehabilitation, and
to help build up the staffing and organization of the agencies responsible for
road construction and maintenance, and for transport coordination.  The rural
roads projects have met specific needs as part of agricultural development
packages, and were designed as transport and agriculture integrated investments.
Bank's involvement in financing these roads has encouraged the Ministry of
Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, and MPW to cooperate more closely and
consistently in determining appropriate design standards, and in making
arrangements  for the maintenance of these low-volume roads.   The Project
Performance Audit Reports for the First, Second, and Third Highway Projects,
respectively Loan 642-MOR, Credit 167-MOR, Loan 955-MOR, and Loan 1830-MOR, which
were designed to improve traffic conditions, highway maintenance, and transport
planning outline their successful irdplementation, with rates of return above
appraisal estimates despite cost overruns. Loan covenants have been generally
complied with, but progress expected on transport planning did not materialize
to the extent desirable, in particular because oi.. split responsibilities and
limited cooperation between MOT and MPW. Disbursement lagged considerably behind
the physical implementation of the projects because of the slow processing of
payment requests by the Government. The situation has started to improve during
the ongoing Fourth Highway Project, and the proposed project is expected to
benefit from the implementation of the SAL, which addressed the budget execution
issue at the country level.

a, b, c above) and local authorities (category d). This redistribution is linked
to increased resource mobilization at the local level with the redistribution
of the revenues of the value-added tax introduced in 1987. Since it is important
that this new network classification be implemented as soon as possible, in order
to ensure a more appropriate allocation of resources for the road investment and
maintenance program, a time-bound framework for its approval was agreed under
the Project (para. 3.07 and Annex 5).
2.04    The detailed condition of the network was assessed under a General Study
on Road Maintenance2, financed under the Third Highway Project. The results of
that study and recent developments regarding pavement condition are analyzed in
Section I below dealin6 with road maintenance.   With respect to geometric
condition, the table below shows that 83% of the paved network is under
six-meter-width.

Currently, widening is carried out on an ad hoc basis only, in conjunction with
road rehabilitation work.   The road narrowness issue is likely to become
increasingly important, and a systematic apprcach to road widening is warranted.
The proposed project would assist DRCR in this respect (subpara. 3.09.b).
B. Road Transport Demand
2.05    The table below shows a growth rate of the total vehicle fleet over the
period 19'0-1985 of 3.5% annually. In absolute terms, the figures have to be
considered with caution, since they take account of vehicle scrapping roughly,
by applying a flat reduction coefficient of 30% to official data from the
Statistics Department of the Ministry of Plan (indeed, with the official figures,
Morocco would have a relatively high level of vehicle ownership, compared to
other countries at its income level: about 3' per thousand persons). Better
knowledge of the vehicle fleet is essential for maintaining a reliable road
database, and the project includes technical assistance to MOT for this pur,ose
(subpara. 3.09.e).

2.06    Since 1976, DRCR has conducted annual nationwide traffic counts on the
paved network3. Traffic growth rates, as measured by vehicle-km traveled on the
network, have averaged 4.2% annually between 1976 and 1985, with a vigorous trend
at the beginning of the period followed by a conjonctural stagnation between 1983
and 1985. This is illustrated by the following table.

The table hereafter shows the situation in 1988, broken down into four classes
of traffic. The latter is heavily concentrated on the primary network, and helps
to understand how DRCR's priorities have been set (para. 2.31).

The spectrum of axle loading is not accurate, because no recent survey data
exist. Better knowledge of traffic aggressivity is essential for proper pavement
design, equitable road user taxation, and enforcement of legal vehicle weight
restrictions. For this purpose, the project incluces replacement and additional
counting and w'ighing equipment (subpara. 3.11.b).
2.08    With respect to road safety, thc5 number of road accidents is still a
cause for serious concern in Morocco. As shown in Annex 7, there have been in
recent years at least 24,000 to 28,000 accidents per year, and 2,000 to 2,300
persons were killed. The death rate in relation to the amount of traffic is at
least double that in several countries of Southern Europe. Several branches of
Government are involved in the road prevention system, the main ones being MPW,
MOT, and MOI. A National Committee for Road Safety (CNPAC) has been set up to
coordinate and impulse activities of the various departments. The *:esults of
this organization can be considered globally as positive, since the number of
fatalities has been decreasing since 1977 (Annex 7, Table B). However, the trend
has been worsening since 1984, with a slight increase in the rate of fatalities
per amount of traffic. Continuous efforts are therefore needed to improve the
situation.
2.09    Efforts  have  been  made  to  improve  the  reporting  of  accidents.
Statiscical analysis of the causes is now available and of good quality (the
Project File contains the 1987 Road Safety Report), allowing CNPAC to identify
appropriate preventive measures with respect to (i) road users, (ii) vehicles
and (iii) infrastructures. Regarding the road users, informative campaigns in
the media and strengthening of enforcement operations have been organized, but
the action is a long-ternm one. Regarding vehicles, there is a need to strengthen
the technical inspection centers system, and Bank assistance for this purpose
would be included in the project (subpara. 3.08.d and Annex 9, para. 6).
Finally, action on infrastructure is a constant concern of MPW, which is in
charge of the road safety data base, and the Bank is contributing to this through
improvements in the road condition and equipment.
C. Road Transport Organization
2.10    Interurban bus and truck services are operated mainly by small private
companies or cooperatives.   Buses are licensed as to routes and service
frequencies, and apply fares which are set by the Ministry of Transport. The
Government also operates a nationwide bus company - CTM/LN -, which accounts for
about 10% of the public road passenger market. The trucking industry is entirely
in private hands with the Office National des Transports (ONT), a public agency,
acting only as an intermediary for some 600 private operators or cooperatives.
The market is broken down into three segments (i) private operators with trucks



- 10 -
of up to 8 tons gross weight, which handle about 40% of the market; (ii)
own-account operators with vehicles in excess of 8 tons gross weight, which
handle about 36% of total traffic; and (iii) public for-hire operators, who are
affiliated with ONT and handle the remaining 24% of the road freight market.
2.11    According to regulations, private operators with vehicles of less than
8 tons gross weight are authorized only to operate on own-account. However, in
practice these trucks operate for-hire transport, and the regulations are not
applied. In contrast, the operators of large for-hire trucks above 8 tons gross
weight are required to use the services of ONT, which has a monopoly in freight
forwarding services. ONT acts as a marketing agency, applying standard rates
and charging a 6% levy on freight rates for its services. To its members, ONT
provides overhead services that individual operators could not afford as well
as some protection for truckers in that it distributes freight according to each
carrier's capacity. In addition, where no back-hauls are available, carriers
receive compensation paid out of further levy on freight rates, amounting to 8%
of rates.
2.12    As a whole, road freight transport works reasonably well with high rates
of vehicle utilization and overall load factors for most interurban movements
of about 60%. However, the average age of vehicles is high, over 10 years for
light- and medium-sized trucks, and about seven years for semi-trailers. This
reflects the low level of tariffs, low labor costs for maintenance, and above
all the high customs and import duties on new vehicles. In addition, a large
percentage of long- and medium-distance freight is handled in small vehicles,
and considerable savings could be achieved with a move towards larger and more
efficient trucks.
2.13    A Road Freight Market Study was carried out under the Fourth Highway
Project, and an ongoing Transport Master Plan Study is preparing an action
program for the road transport industry. The Master Plan Study has analyzed a
scenario for deregulating the road freight market, which could reduce total
trucking costs by as much as US$20 million per year, and thereby facilitate
industrial and agricultural growth and export trade expansion. An outline of
the proposed program is given in Annex 5, and the main recommendations would be
pursued under the Project (para. 3.07). The current scenario developed under
the study would involve a progressive deregulation of the trucking industry,
including, as a first step, allowing private truckers to operate legally on a
for-hire basis. Other initial measures would include greater emphasis on ONT's
role as a freight forwarder while reducing its regulatory role.   Various
scenarios for more far-reaching reforms involving freer access to the industry
will be analyzed in detail by the Government upon completion of the Master Plan
Study, and these will be discussed further with the Bank during project
implementation.
D. Road User Taxation
2.14    An analysis of road user charges was prepared by MPW during 1988 as part
of the justification for establishing a Road Fund (paras. 2.20, 2.32). The Road
Fund was approved by Parliament in December 1988, and revenue will now accrue
to the fund primarily from a new axle tax as well as from an existing tax on fuel



- il -
(TIC - taxe intérieure sur la consommation) and from vehicle registration fees.
The revenue from these sources will cover about 40% of the total road
rehabilitation and maintenance budget, the proceeds being allocated primarily
to routine maintenance as per the Road Fund Law (Project File, Annex 1). The
results of the analysis conducted by MPW showed that total road user revenues
from all sources exceed at least eightfold an optimal program of expenditures
on roads, including increases in network sapacity. All vehicles provide revenues
in excess of their road use costs, ranging from about eightfold for buses to
twofold for semi-trailers. The share of taxation in vehicle operating costs is
relatively even among different vehicle types ranging from 28% to 38%; the
highest being own-account trucks. However, on a ton-km basis the level of taxes
decreases with increasing truck size, a factor, which should encourage the use
of larger more efficient multi-axle trucks, which in turn inflict proportiorately
less damage to the network. As a whole, road user charges in Morocco appear
reasonable. However, custom duties should be reduced to encourage renewal of
the vehicle fleet, and the tax structure could be simplified somewhat,
particularly following the introduction of the new axle tax.  Reductions in
customs duties are currently being introduced under the SAL. Details of the road
user charge analysis are given in Annex 4, and an outline of recommended
adjustments to the structure of road user charges is given in the Project Action
Plan (Annex 5).
E. Administration
2.15    HPW's Roads and Traffic Department (DRCR), whose organization is shown
on the attached chart, is responsible for the design, construction and
maintenance of the classified road network. The headquarters, however, deals
only with matters of general planning, coordination, and supervision, since the
district offices have a large degree of autonomy in planning, contract award and
administration, and supervision of works.   The field organization has been
expanded recently and now consists of 39 provincial offices, grouped under seven
regional offices with 80 subdivisions. There is continuous contact between the
headquarters and the engineers in charge of the district offices, which allows
problems to be identified and solved quickly.
2.16    DRCR's organization is quite adequate to deal with the road network under
its authority. The main recommendations of the Road Maintenance Study5 (financed
under the Third Highway Project) dealing with organization improvements have been
put into effect (para. 2.30).   Furthermore,  strengthening of the economic
studies, management systems, and higher level maintenance staff has successfully
taken place under the ongoing Fourth H'ghway Project.  Last, but not least,
MPW/DRCR have been successful in convincing the Government about the seriousness
of the road deterioration problem and the urgency to take drastic measures (para.
2.32).  There is now a need to pursue the strengthening of the lower level
maintenance staff as well as to improve the maintenance planning and structural
condition survey capabilities of DRCR. The latter has asked the Bank to provide
technical assistance for this purpose under the proposed project (para. 3.09).
5 Etude d'Amélioration de l'Entretien Routier, op. cit.



- 12 -
2.17    Three departments of MOT are dealing mainly with transport planning and
road transport regulation: the Department of Transport Studies, Planning and
Coordination, the Land Transport Department, and the Vocational Training
Department. This organization is adequate but has to improve its efficiency by
managing its services better and introducing new tools and techniques. MOT has
already taken an important step in this direction with the Transp3rt Sector
Master Plan Studye, one of the main aims thereof being the increase in the
planning capabilities of MOT   The Study's recommendations in this area would
be pursued under tie Project. Other steps planned are the strengthening of each
of the three departments above, and a particular emphasis on the transport needs
of rural areas.  Technical assistance for these purposes is includeA under the
proposed project (subparas. 3.09.d and e).
F. Planning and Financing
2.18    A public investment review was carried out in December 1987 to discuss
the Government's planned expenditures at the eve of the new 1988-1992 Development
Plan. The results appear in Table 2.6.A below, which shows that three Ministries
are involved.
(a) MPW deals with the classified network and has benefitted from a
sharp increase in its planned budgetary allocations as from the
second year of the Plan (1938) with additional resources earmarked
for road maintenance (para. 2.19). The share of maintenance and
rehabilitation in the MPW total has thus increased sharply from 56%
in the 1981-87 period to 75% in the current Plan.
(b) Local roads are financed through decentralized Government budgets
under supervision of MOI.   Due to the transfer of new fiscal
resources to them, the local communities have now much larger
resources to be devoted to urban/rural roads.   This raises two
questions, first on their technical capabilities to manage such
resources, and second on the precise scope of their responsibilities
as far as road maintenance is concerned.   The answer to both
questions may reside in a closer relationship with MPW, whose
regional services can provide adequate assistance as needed, but
a prior condition is the delimitation of responsibilities through
an updated network classification (para. 2.03). The Government has
been working on this subject for some time, and the allocation of
these responsibilities will be pursued under the Project (subpara.
3.08.e).
(c) MOT is involved through a few public enterprises dealing with
passenger services (the CTM-LN on intercity routes and eight city
bus operators for urban transport), freight assignment (ONT) (para.
2.10), and road safety (CNPAC) (para. 2.08). The relatively small
amounts involved show that public ownership is limited as far as
road transport is concerned.

2.19    Road infrastructure investments are detailed in Table 2.6.3, which gives
a breakdown by year and nature of expenditure:   (i) new construction,  (ii)
rehabilitation, (iii) maintenance (routine and resealing), and (iv` miscellaneous
(studies, training, technical assistance, buildings). The total amounts to DH
6.6 billion for the 1988-92 period. The annual amount per km is US$5,600 of
which about 75% is for road maintenance, equivalent to about US$4,200 per km.
These expenditures are funded by the general budget for DH 4,950 million (the
initial Plan allocation for the road subsector), and by the recently created Road
Fund for DH 1,684 million (para. 2.14).  The high priority accorded to road
maintenance under this Plan is a very positive development with respect to public
investment rationalization.
2.20    Apart from general underfunding, highway maintenance suffered until
recently from a low efficiency in the implementation of the investment
programs. Defining efficiency by the ratio of actual payments ("émissions"),
made in a given year on the payment authorizations ("crédits de paiement")
allocated for that year, this ratio used to be in the range of 60-65%. As can
be seen from Table 2.7 below, the annual amount actually paid for maintenance
programs averaged DH 348 million over the period 1981-1987.
Table 2.7 Maintenance Expenditures. 1981-1987
(Actual payments, DH million current)
1981    1982    1983    1984    1985    1986    1987       Average
294     618     432      127     155     256      553       348
This average level is very low by any standard (the 1984 Road Maintenance Study
recommended about the double in 1983 prices). Furthermore, the erratic character
of the annual allocations together with delays in payment caused severe
disrup_ions vithin the construction industry (para. 2.28). The Road Fund is
expected to be the answer for more stability in resources.  The countrywide
budget implementation issue is being addressed under the SAL, which calls for
several measures to improve and expedite execution of the investment programs,
such as the progressive reduction of payment arrears, carrying over of unused
commitments, improvement of the payment efficiency ratio, etc. The investments
proposed under the present project are included in the Target Investment Program
(TIP) of the SAL, meaning that the highway investment program would be reviewed
annually, jointly by the Government and the Bank, and the efficiency ratio,
expected to increase to 70% as from 1990, would be monitored as well.
2.21    Monitoring of the priority to be accorded to road maintenance in the
current Plan would be done through the SAL's TIF (para. 2.20) and the specific
monitoring requirements under the project (para. 3.20).   In addition, close
relationships with other donors active in the field will be pursued, in order
to ensure coherence in the objectives and complementarity in the means. This
is especially true with the African Development Bank in view of its active
lending program in the sector (para. 3.04).

G. Human Resources
Ministry of Public Vorks
2.22    DRCR's staff comprises about 5,900 employees, including 377 management
personnel; 1,813 technical employees for highway construction, maintenance and
rehabilitation; 1,730 technical employees for equipment operations and
maintenance; and 1,980 administrative employees (Table 1 in Annex 8). MPW, which
is in charge of coordinating Vocational Training and Staff Training all over the
country, is fully equipped in terms of pre-employment facilities for the public
works sector, with one engineering school (Hassania), four technician centers
(Agadir, Marrakech, Rabat, Oujda) and a large network of Vocational Training
Centers and Institutes of Applied Technology vithin the Office of Vocational
Training and Employment (OFPPT). The Personnel and Training Department (DAPF)
organizes systematic continuing training for engineers in project analysis,
economics, technical matters and management and for technicians through
sensitization seminars. However, about 60X of the operational manpower lacks
skills in highway maintenance and rehabilitation techniques. Thus, technical
continuing training needs to be organized on a systematic basis for the entire
staff.
2.23    The existing MPW training institutions provide basic preemployment
training only. Moreover, they lack adequate and qualified trainers to provide
the specific road maintenance and rehabilitation specialized training programs
needed by DRCR (Table 2 in Annex 8). MPW has a center in Casablanca, which
trains about 120 drivers and mechanics every year. However, since the existing
center is too small, old, and not conver.iently located, MPW is implementing a
training and retraining system to upgrade its technical staff in highway
maintenance and rehabilitation, by ising facilities existing in the country (MPW
and OFPPT training centers).   Design,  objectives,  training programs,  and
financial needs have been determined on the basis of a study completed in 1984.
The first training program (Annex 8) vill concern about 300 trainees, and
facilities are being upgraded with Government and international financing (AfDB).
The project will finance the technical assistance needed to finalize the
programs, train the trainers, and make the system operational (subpara. 3.09.c).
Ministrv of Transport
2.24    MOT ensures the training of its staff in charge of road transport on an
informal basis, on-the-job, using bilateral assistance, and training abroad.
In order to introduce a computerized management of the driver licensing, vehicle
registration, and transport agreement services, the MOT Vocational Training
Service (DFP) intends to organize training for selected officers in charge of
these functions. The project will finance the technical assistance needed: (i)
to help setting up the computerized system; (ii) to train, on-the-job, the
officers in charge; and (iii) to provide specialized training abroad for these
officers (subpara. 3.09.e).
2.25    MOT is establishing a National Center for Vehicle Inspection and Testing
(CNEHA) (para. 3.12), which will require six technicians.  The project will
finance the tecbnical assistance needed to help establish CNEHA and to train the



- 16 -
technical staff in a similar center abroad.   The MOT, Transport Studies,
Planning, and Coordination Department (DEPCT) also intends to improve the
efficiency of its techniques. This requires that the technicians in charge be
trained in the use of computers for transport planning and coordination. The
project will finance the training, partly on-the-job with the help of
consultants, and partly abroad in similar services (subpara. 3.09.e).
H. EnRineering and Construction
2.26    DRCR's Studies Division is responsible for preparing major highway
projects.   The division's staff is well-qualified and adequate computer
facilities are available. Two autonomous agencies complement DRCR's engineering
capability: first, the National Center for Pavement Evaluation and Road Research
(CNER), a public agency in charge of pavement design analyses, structural
condition surveys, and related applied research; second, the semi-public material
tests and studies laboratory (LPEE), which can carrf out all soil and material
tests required for civil works as well as engineering studies. Both agencies'
staff have acquired experience by preparing all road strengthening studies for
the earlier Bank financed highway projects. However, CNER needs some technical
assistance to train its staff to more advanced tools and techniques, and this
will be provided under the proposed project.
2.27    The design standards used by DRCR are satisfactory. Geometric standards
are based on a design speed chosen in function of traffic, terrain, and nature
cf the road. Pavement design is also satisfactory and is based on a catalogue
of pavement structures, updated from time to time.  The Highways Design and
Maintenance Standards Model (HDM III) has been introduced and is expected to be
used more largely for highway investment analysis in lieu of simpler in-house
models.
2.28    Morocco has a well-developed contracting industry, with several local
firms fully up to international contracting standards.  Construction works are
normally carried out under unit price contract awarded after competitive bidding,
and contract prices are competitive. Small- to medium-size contracts (US$2 to
10 million) are usually won by Moroccan contractors, except in the case of bridge
construction contracts, where foreign competitior. is more successful.   The
profession gathe;s a modern sector of 1,300 enterprises (of which less than lOX
work in the road sector), and an informal sector of about 8,300 small
enterprises. The former is organized through the Federation of Building and
Civil Engineering Contractors (Fédération Nationale du Bâtiment et des Travaux
Publics), which has over 700 members classified according to their capacity,
experience, and skills, and is working towards a mandatory classification of the
whole profession. The construction industry expanded vigorously in the 1970's
in parallel with the strong investment policy of the Government, but since the
early 1980's have suffered from (i) low and unstable level of public expenditures
and (ii) substantial delays in payments. This situation is expected to be eased
vith (a) the current growth-oriented macroeconomic program, (b) better planning
of works by MPW and (c) stronger payment discipline from the Ministry of Finance
(para. 2.20). Furthermore, the industry's performance could be significantly
imptoved by providing construction enterprises and consulting firms operating
in the sector with updated information on the demand for their services, by



- 17 -
increasing the local availability of basic construction materials such as gravel
and sand whose mining is subject to environmental controls, by enhancing
technological transfer, and by developing effective standardization, quality
control and certification practices (para. 3.10).
2.29    The supervision of construction is carried out by DRCR regional staff,
assisted by LPEE for the necessary soils and materials' tests.   LPEE also
undertakes some specialized parts of the supervision, if the technical staff in
a given region is unable to fulfill all tasks. For major road construction, DRCR
establishes a special supervision office with engineers and other specialists
permanently assigned to the supervision of the road. The combined capability
of DRCR and LPEE in supervising road construction is adequate to deal with
contracts as large as those included in the project.
I. Road Maintenance
2.30    The 1984 Road Maintenance Study financed under the Third Highway Project
provided for a detailed assessment of the road network and the maintenance staff
facilities, equipment,  and materials.   Its main recommendations regarding
maintenance organization and staff training have since been implemented, either
under the Fourth Highway Project (staffing and equipment of maintenance crews,
establishment of workshops as autonomous equipment maintenance centers,
acquisition of road maintenance equipment), or under the 1988 African Development
Bank's Transport Sector Loan (construction of a training center, development of
a bridge management system). However, with respect to the financial needs for
maintenance works, not only the Study's recommendations were not followed, but
vorse, the maintenance allocations were reduced in absolute terms due to the
stringent budgetary constraints that prevailed during the years 1981-1986. This
has made the funding i.ssue one of the main road maintenance issues, but the
situation is improving with the earmarking of part of the needed funds (paras.
2.19, 2.20, 2.32).
2.31    The road network condition is part of the database maintained by
DRCR/CNER by means of visual inspections and structural surveys. The table below
shows the condition in 1983 and 1988 as assessed and forecast by the Road
Maintenance Study, together with the actual 1988 condition.

Far from the sharp improvement, which had been expected, the current situation
as compared with the 1983 one presents only a slight improvement for the primary
and secondary roads, and a worsening for the tertiary roads condition. This is
the result of (i) the zevere underfunding of road maintenance for the past six
years (para. 2.20), and (ii) the subsequent retrenchement strategy of DRCR, which
concentrated the scarce res;ources on the most trafficked main roads.
2.32    The consequences of this situation were highlighted in 1987 by MPW in
terms of (i) worsening of road condition, with more than 50% of the network in
bad condition within f ive years; (ii) increase in maintenance backlog, since more
roads will have to be strengthened or reconstructed, with higher prices than
normal periodic maintenance; and (iii) increase in vehicle operating costs: the
additional amounts involved are, in oider of magnitude, four times the size of
the maintenance  requirements,  with  a higher  forei i exchange  component.
Eventually the Government was convinced of the need for more stable resources
for road maintenance, and the legislature passed a law in December 1988 creating
a Road Maintenance Fund.  The official documents related to the Road Fund are
in the Project Files, and the fund design is discussed in para. 2.14. The fund
has been operational since January 1, 1989 and will provide resources (to come
from existing as well as new transport taxes) to cover all routine maintenance
and part of periodie resealing operations.
2.33    DRCR's maintenance programas are based on norms and criteria that specify
the design and the frequency of strengthening and resealing as vell as of the
diverse routine maintenance operations.  These standards with the associated
ceosts are shown in Annex 2. Although DRCR currently ranks the components of its
various annual programs using a road user costs approach, the optimality of this
normative approach is yet to be demonstrated, and technical assistance for this
purpose is included under the project (subpara. 3.09.a). However, these norms
have been very useful in the vreparation of the maintenance program, and it is
interesting to compare the financial effort required by their application with
the existing budget allocations.   The financial requirements are summarized
below.
Table 2.9  Annual Maintenance Cost Requirements
Traffic class          Length       Maintenance Costs (KDH/km/vear) 1988 prices

The maintenance budget for the 1988-92 Plan is DH 4,964 million (including the
Road Fund), or DH 993 million per year. Thus due to the Road Fund, the planned
maintenance budget would essentially meet the requirements,  although some
adjustments may be necessary to offset the effects of inflation.

2.34    In view of the mairtenance underfunding that has existed for several
years, the requ.rements mentioned in para. 2.33 above have, of course, not been
met during the past period, and a serious backlog has accrued. Table 2.8 above
shows the accumulation of roads in bad condition in the actual 1988 situation.
Most of these roads now need rehabilitation before regular maintenance can be
applied. DRCR's strategy to catch up wi.h the existing backlog is to give more
emphasis to strengthening/rehabilitation activities than would have been needed
under normal circumstances by applying the maintenance standards above. Table
2.6.B shows that the total devoted to these activities in the 1988-92 Plan
amounts to about DH 2,920 millior., or abc'it 60% of the total maintenance
allocations.    With  this  amount,  about  6,000 km would Le  rehabilitated,
representing a periodicity of 7.5 years for the medium to high traffic network
(more than 750 vpd), as compared with the general norm of once every 15 years
for this kind of operation. There is also a serious backlog in the repair of
should!rs and in road marking.  The proposed project will provide support in all
these areas to help meet part of the backlog (para. 3.04).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Oblectives
3.01    The project is based on the objectives for tLe transport sector defined
in the 1988-92 Development Plan, which are to (i) improve efficiency to meet
demand at the lowest possible cost; (ii) rationalize transport investments and
optimize the use of limited funds for maintenance; (iii) establish cost-based
tariffs and a realistic policy for recovery of road user charges; and (iv)
strengthen planning and implementation capabilities. The Bank is supporting this
approach through its ongoing dialogue with the Government, and the proposed
project is in line with these objectives, building on institutional capabilities
achieved to date.
3.02    The proposed project would be the first Bank operation for the highway
sector in the past f ive years.   In line with the increasing competence of
executing agenicies in Morocco to plan and implement sector-wide investment
programs, and with the need for emphasis on sectoral policy and institutional
issues, the proposed project would also be the first highway sector project,
introducing a much broader approach to the development of the sector.   It
includes an Action Plan for policy adjustment and institutional improvement,
providing the framework for an investment component to be financed under the
loan, with the following specific objectives:
(a) assist the Government in its efforts to bring sector investments
in line with economic priorities, and to concentratz its ressources
on the preservation of existing roads;
(b)  strengthen the overall institutional framework by improving the
integration of road resurfacing and maintenance planning within a
comprehensive pavement management program; and
(c)  pursue the development of a realistic zoad user taxation policy,



- 20 -
and assist in the deregulation of the road transport market.
(d) pursue efficiency improvements in the construction industry in line
with the Bank's efforts in the Maghreb region.
B. Project Dascription
3.03    The proposed project is composed of two elements:
(a) MPWes 1990-92 highway investment and maintenance program (para. 3.04);
(b) policy adjustment and institutional development measures concerning
bth, MOT and MPW (paras. 3.07 to 3.09).
The proposed Bank loan would finance selected components of aach element
mentioned above  (para.  3.12).    During negotiations,  Government  agreement
concerning project objectives and description was obtained (para. 5.02).
Road Investment and Mainte...ance Program
3.04    The 1990-92 road investment and maintenance program is presented in Table
A of Annex 6, and summarized in Table 3.1 herebelow. This program covers the
last three years of the current Plan 1988-92 (para. 2.19), and rightly focuses
on maintenance of the network: new construction accounts for only 22% of the
total, and rehabilitation and maintenance for 77%. The maintenance effort will
be raised to meet the needs of the r.etwork as defined by the Road Maintenance
Study and subsequent studies carried out by DRCR.   Part of this program is
already financed by external sources, sucb as the African Development Bank
(AfDB), which is very active in the sector (para. 2.21), and IBRD. The main
rationale for IBRD's continued intervention is to help the Goverament reduce the
backlog accumulated during the recent period of ecoaomic stringency. Areas where
serious backlog exists include road and bridge rehabilitation, resurfacing,
shoulder restoration, and pavement marking (para. 2.34).
3.05    As shown in Table 3.1, two items make up the new construction work
program:
(a) provincial roads: these are secondary, and mainly tertiary roads
in selected areas for the development of agriculture and/or tourism.
Part of these roads are being financed under the Fourth Highway
Project;
(b)  other primary roads:  these are mainly roads built for regional
development purposes; regarding the Rabat-Casablanca expressway
(financed under the Fourth Highway Project), this item is being
completed.
These items have been responsible for most of the addition to the paved network
during the past few years (para. 2.02), but with diminishing importance on
average.   Thus, if the new construction ratio averages 25% over the period
1988-92 (Table 2.6.B), this ratio is only 22% for the period 1990-92.

includes (i) most of the consulting services provided for under ongoing IBRD
projects (training and technical assistance to DRCR, provincial roads study,
etc.), and AfDB projects (development and implementation of a bridge management
system, etc.), and (ii) additional needs (development and implementation of a
pavement management system, training of maintenance crews under the new Road
Maintenance Training Center, etc.), which would be partly financed under the
proposed project.
Sector Policy and Institutional Developgment Measures
3.07    As part of the dialogue between the Government and the Bank on the
development of the sector, MPW and MOT have identified a series of actions
directed at resolving the major issues mentioned in this report. These issues
were identified mainly through studies financed under the Third and Fourth
Highway Projects and experience gained through implementation of these projects.
Evidence of commitment to resolving these issues has already been shown through
tha preparation of the road user charges study with assistance from the Bank,
which contributed inter alia to (i) the establishment of the Road Fund in January
1989, and (ii) a modification of the annual vehicle road tax calling for the same
rate regardless of vehicle age.
3.08    The main actions contemplated in sector policy include adjustments in



- 22 -
the road user charges system to ensure adequate coverage of road use costs,                r-
reduction of overall transport costs through further liberalization of the road
freight market, and improvement in resource allocation for the road sector
through reallocation of responsibilities over the entire network. Actions to
be pursued under the Project to attain these objectives are outlined in Annex
5 and include:
(a) completion of the National Transport Master Plan Study and
development, on the basis of this study and the Bank's comments,
of an action plan to address (i) the ageing of vehicle fleet (para.
2.14); (ii) the status of private operators (less than 8 ton gross
vehicle weight), and (iii) ONT's role in the overall freight
transport system as a freight forwarder (paras. 2.10 to 2.13);
(b) analysis of the impact of the price differential between diesel and
gasoline fuels (para. 2.14);
(c) strengthening of the role of Government in road safety matters, such
as vehicle inspection and vehicle overloading (paras. 2.08, 2.09);
and
(d) implementation of the new road network reclassification (para.
2.03).
3.09    The main actions envisaged in institutional efficiency acijustments to
be pursued under the Project include improvements in MPW's and MOT's sector
managerial and planning capabilities, road maintenance management, and personnel
training. To attain these improvements:
<a) DRCR would develop optimal road maintenance strategies and pursue
the development of a pavement management system, building on
achievements to date, and would strengthen CNER, the national center
for road studies and research (para. 2.26);
(b) DRCR would develop and start implementing a rational policy for the
widening of narrow roads;
(c) DRCR would implement a training and retraining system in highway
maintenance and rehabilitation (para. 2.23);
(d) MOT would improve the planning and organization of transport in
rural areas, together with MPW and MOI; and
(e) MOT would strengthen internal capacities in transport planning and
efficiency in road transport management and safety (paras. 2.24,
2.25).
3.10    In addition to the above sector policy and institutional development
actions, MPW plans to facilitate the operations of the national construction
industry (para. 2.28). A long-range program, whose implementation would spread
over the next Five-year Plan, has been prepared by MM and includes the following



- 23 -
(Project File, Annex 1):
(a)  improvement of MPW's knowledge of the construction industry sector,
in particular with respect to its production capacities,
intermediate consumptions, sub-contracting practices, employment
issues, and informal sector activities;
(b)  development of measures for promoting the supply of local materials
efficiently and economically with particular attention to quarry
products whose mining is constrained by environmental concerns;
(c)  promotion of the establishment of a documentation and information
center on the construction industry, its activities and technical
developments to be used by public administrators, developers,
entrepreneurs, and experts in consulting;
(d)  expansion of the research and testing activities of the Laboratoire
Public d'Essais et d'Etudes and assessment of the interest of
strengthening its regional offices to better meet the local needs
of contractors, enterprises and consulting firms; and
(e)  streamlining of the present functions and enhancing of the activity
of MPW in the regulatory and standardization fields, respectively.
This includes better adapting regulation and norms to local
geographic,    geological,    climatological   and   sociological
situations.
A timetable of those studies to be included in the Project would be prepared by
MPW by June 30, 1990.
3.11    Details of the various actions are ineluded in Annex 5.   During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that the adjustment and
institutional reform component would be carried out in accordance with an
implementation program acceptable to the Bank.  The program consists of the
measures to be taken as outlined in the Action Plan. Agreement was also reached
that progress in its implementation would be reviewed by September 30 of each
year and appropriate adjustments made taking into account the Bank's comments
(para. 5.02).
Items financed under the Proposed ProJect
3.12    The Loan would finance the following components of the 1990-92 program
(Annex 9):
(a)  Civil Work..  This component would include: (i) rehabilitation of
about 1,000 km of roads; (ii) resurfacing of some 1,300 km of roads;
(iii) shoulder restoration on about 500 km of roads; (iv) pavement
marking on some 5,000 km of roads; (v) reconstruction of about seven
bridges; (vi) construction of workshops facilities, and (vii)
construction of the National Center for Vehicle Inspection and
Testing (CNEHA, described in Project File, Annex 1).



- 24 -
(b)  Eguipment.   This component would include (i) road maintenance
equipment;  (ii)  traffic  counting  equipment;  (iii)  workshop
equipment; and (iv) road safety equipment.
(c) Consulting Services. This component would include the studies and
technical assistance required to implement the Action Program,
namely (i) study into the widening of narrow roads, and technical
assistance to DRCR/CNER, (ii) study into the development of
transport in rural areas, and technical assistance to MOT, and (iii)
studies to enhance the construction industry performance.
(d) Overseas training. This component would include scholarships abroad
for (i) MPW , and (ii) MOT.
C. Cost Estimates and Financint
Prolect Cost Estimates
3.13    Table 3.2 hereafter shows the total project cost in summary form, while
Table B of Annex 6 provides a more detailed brealcdown of costs.   The total
capital cost is estimated at US$533.6 million equivalent, including a foreign
exchange component equivalent to US$254.7 million, and a local cost component
of US$278.9 million equivalent, including US$107.1 million in taxes and duties.
The total project cost net-of-taxes is therefore US$426.5 million equivalent.
3.14    Estimates for civil works are based on unit prices for recent contracts
in Morocco, adjusted to mid-1989 level. The cost of road maintenance and traffic
equipment is based on recent purchase prices of similar equipment. The technical
assistance cost estimates are based on recent rates for consulting services in
Morocco.  Contingencies have been allowed only for price escalation, and are
based on annual rates for local inflation of 5% until project completion and for
foreign inflation of 7.2% in 1990,  and 4.4% thereafter.   Overail,  these
contingencies represent 11% of base costs.  Foreign exchange components have
been calculated for each project item. For civil works, the breakdown between
foreign and local components (the local including taxes) was calculated for each
major item in the bill of quantities, assuming that most of the contracts would
be awarded to Moroccan contractors. The latter assumption is based on recent
contracts awards.
3.15    Project financing would come from different quarters.   Government
appropriations amount to DH 2,805.1 million, or 63% of the total project cost.
46% of Government appropriations (or DH 1,290 million) are expected from
earmarked funds (para. 2.14). External funding includes IBRD and AfDB loans,
whose total (ongoing and proposed) amount to US$195.7 million, or 46% of the
total project cost net-of-taxes. The proposed IBRD loan of US$79 million would
represent 18.5% of total net-of-tax cost. AfDB has confirmed its interest in
providing parallel cofinancing in the amount of US$33 million, representing a
further 7.7% of total project costs.   Of the total foreign exchange cost,
estimated at US$254.7 million, 33% would be met from existing loans, 31% from
the proposed  IBRD  loan,  and  13%  from  the proposed AfDB  loan.    During

negotiations,  the expenditure  and  financing plans were  confirmed by the
Governnment (para. 5.01).

3.16    The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed against selected items
that would contribute to (i) reducing the backlog in road rehabilitation and
maintenance (para. 3.04), and (ii) implementing the Action Plan (paras. 3.08,
3.09, 3.10). These items are described in para. 3.12, and in Annex 9.
D. Implementation
3.17    The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Morocco.  DRCR will be the executing
agency for the MPW components, and DEPCT and DTT for the MOT components. The
project is expected to become effective in May 1990. In principle it is possible
to complete the project by mid-1993, but a margin of a further six-month period
is advisable to allow for unforeseen delays, taking the completion date to
December 31, 1993. The loan closing date is scheduled for December 31, 1994,
providing a full year after project completion to allow the Government time to
submit final withdrawals applications.
3.18    Civil works to be financed under the Loan have been the subject of
feasibility studies carried out by DRCR (Chapter IV). Final engineering of the
first year rehabilitation program is being carried out by DRCR and LPEE. For
the following years, DRCR would submit the technical and economic evaluation cf
rehabilitation subprojects for the Bank's review, according to the same
methodology, criteria, and procedures as applied for the first year program.
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations (para. 5.02). The final
design for the bridge program would be ready by mid of 1990. Draft terms of
reference for the main consulting services have been prepared and reviewd by the
Bank and will be finalized according to the timetable in the Action Plan. The
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 10, and was confirmed with the
Government during negotiations (para. 5.01).
3.19    Witl1 regard to project monitoring, the Government would prepare bi-annual
reports to the Bank providing:   the progress of execution of Bank-financed
activities; the status of disbursement requests and of withdrawals from the
Special Account, and the schedule of estimated withdrawals of the proceeds of
the loan.
3.20    Furthermore, in order to monitor progress of MPW's and MOT's program and
related Action Plan, the Government would at least semi-annually meet with
representatives of the Bank, and would provide information in accordance with
the following scope and schedule:
(a) By March 31 of each year, MPWV, MOT, and the Bank would review:
-   compliance with the Action Plan during previous year,
-    expenditure levels in the implementation of the investment and
maintenance program during the previous year, and sources of
funding, including Government and financing under the loan;
-   planned expenditure levels for the coming year by major
category of expenditure, including details of the financing
plan;



2,
-    composition and statue of act &.vities to be financed under the
loan including the various steps for preparation or
implementation.
(b) By September 30 of each year, MRW and hOT would provide information
on:
-    proposed update of actions and targets included in the Action
Plan;
-    proposed update of the pluriannual expenditure program in
financial and physical terms, and proposed "Loi de Finances";
-    status of selection and execution of Bank financed activities.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government would
(a) furnish to the Bank by September 30 of each yea- for its review the
Government's proposed annual investment program and related financing plan for
the following year, and (b) thereafter finalize the road investment program
taking into accour,t the Bank's comments, and take all measures to ensure its
prompt implementation (para. 5.02).

3.22    Regarding civil works,  the value of individual road rehabilitation
contracts would vary between US$0.2 and US$3.5 million, while contracts for
periodic maintenance would vary between US$0.05 and US$2.4 million. According
to their bidding capacity, contractors would be able to submit bids for more than
one contract in bid packages. However, the civilworks activities are scattered
throughout the country, constrain,ng their being packaged to attract foreign
competition.   Moreover,  the experience under the last two highway loans
demonstrates that foreign contractors have limited interest in participating in
bids for even larger contracts. Nevertheless, they have succeeded in obtaining
a few contracts.  Therefore, most contracts are expected to be won by local
contractors. However, contracts for civil works estimated to cost US$2.0 million
or more, would be awarded through ICB in accordance with Bank's guidelines for
proecurement.   Contracts estimated to cost less than US$2.0 million up to an
aggregate not to exceed US$70 million would be awarded following LCB procedures
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.25). Bidders for bridge reconstruction will
have to be prequalifiad.
3.23    Procurement of bitumen will be done under the roadworks contracts, and
bidders will be permitted either to make their owri arrangements for the
procurement of bitumen to meet their needs, or to request the Government to
supply bitumen at the bulk rate at which it is purchasing to meet its needs.
Under the above arrangements the cost of bitumen included in the bid price will
be eligible for disbursement from the loan proceeds.
3.24    Regarding equipment, the threshold above which contracts would be awarded
under ICB, is US$100,000. Domestically manufactured goods procured under ICB
will be allowed a 15 percent preference margin or the import duty applicable to
non-exempt importers, whichever is lower, in the comparison of bids.  Goods
contracts below US$100,000 would be procured through shopping procedures based
on comparison of not less than three price quotations, subject to an aggregate
value not exceeding US$1 million.
3.25    Local competitive bidding procedures were reviewed during project
preparation, and found generally acceptable to the Bank. There are, however,
a few procedures which are inconsistent with Bank procurement guidelines and
others which require clarification. These procedures and proposals to improve
them are detailed in Annex 13.   During negotiations, agreement was reached
regarding the adoption of procedures acceptable to the Bank.
3.26    Consulting services and technical assistance will be provided by either
consulting firms short-listed, or individual experts selected by each executing
agency. The qualifications and experience of the consulting firms or individual
experts selected by the Government, as well as the terms and conditions of
contract, should be satisfactory to the Bank.
3.27    Contrects or bidding packages would be submitted for prior review in
accordance with the following thresholds:



- 29 -
Contracts, whose cost la expected
Project Item                              to exceed the equivalent of
(a)  All civil works except bridges            US$1,000,000
(b)  Bridge reconstruction                     US$  500,000
(c)  Equipment                                 US$  200,000
The above thresholds would lead to prior review of contracts or bidding packages
covering about 80X of the total contract amount for the bridges, 60-80X for the
other civil works (depending on the extent to which they are grouped), and 80X
for the equipment. The lower threshold for bridges is advisable because of their
greater technical complexity than the other civil works.  The first bidding
document for each category would be submitted for Bank review. For subsequent
documents only the changes, if any, would be submitted for the Bank's clearance.
3.28    Durirg negotiations, all the above procurement arrangements were ag.iCd.
upon with the Government (para. 5.02).
F.  Drburnements
3.29    The Bank would disburse on the following basis:
(a)  Civil Works:              64X of total expenditures;
(b)  Equipment:               100X of foreign expenditure, 100X of local
expenditures (ex-factory cost), and
70X of local expenditures for
items procured locally;
(c)  Consulting Services:      802 of total expenditures;
(d)  Overseas training:       100X of total expenditures.
3.30    In the past it has taken an average of seven years  to complete
disbursement of loans or credits to Morocco (all sectors), and transport projects
in the EMENA Region have taken equally long. In the case of the Fourth Highway
Project, the disbursement period will have been six years. This appraisal sets
a disbursement period of 5 1/4 years on the basis of (i) the very nature of the
project (1990-92 sector program), and (ii) extensive discussions with the project
authorities regarding the causes of delay on earlier projects. Specifically.,
(i) this project will benefit from improvements expected under the SAL in budget
processing and implementation (para. 2.20); (ii) measures have been taken to
speed up the processing of withdrawal applications within the Government, and
(iii) DRCR has now a good record in the management of Special Account together
with the Ministry of Finance. The corresponding estimated disbursement schedule
is shown in Annex 11.
3.31    A Special Account, covering all categories of disbursement, may be
established by the Government on terme and conditions acceptable to the Bank
for this loan. The authorized allocation would be US$5,000,000, approximating
an estimated four months disbursement. During negotiations the conditions for
the establishment of such an account vere g&ga8n upon (para. 5.02). Statement
of expenditures would be used for contracte valued at US$100,000 or less.



- 30 -
G. kuditAng
3.32    Independent auditors, aceptable to the Bank, will prepare annual audit
reports covering project related activities.   Separate reports covering the
Special Account and the Statements of Expenditure will be prepared. The reports
will be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of the
fiscal year. These arrangements were agreed during negotiations (para. 5.02).
M. Environmental Impact
3.33    The works to be carried out under the project will not detrimentally
affect the environment. The road works will not require the demolition of any
permanent housing, but will enhance the reliability of access to markets,
schools, and medical services, and thus improve the rural environment. Another
positive achi%vement will be the decrease in air pollution caused by vehicle use,
to be expected from the establishment of the National Center for Vehicle
Inspection and Testing that will take care inter-alia of the pollution standards
enforcement (Annex 9, para. 6). Traffic safety would also be improved through
better road condition, monitoring, and enforcement.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01    The proposed road pavement strengthening program and periodic maintenance
program will enable the fullest use to be made of the existing primary and
secondary road network. Investments in new roads represent only 13% in the total
program and are mainly concerned with roads constriicted for regional development
purposes (para. 3.05). Because of their small part in the program, no specific
evaluation has been undertaken for this component. As a result of its focus on
key routes linking important urban centers, industries, and major agricultural
areas, the rehabilitation and maintenance program will provide substantial
benefits to a wide variety of road users. The main financial benefits of both
the paveannt strengthening and maintenance programs will be in reduced transport
costs, wlich result from improved driving surfaces. Additional benefits are
savings Lrom avoiding higher maintenance costs, which would ultimately be
required to keep roads in passable condition and prevent even greater increases
in transport costs.   In addition,  the proposed technical assistance will
considerably strengthen DRCR's capability for the planning and management of the
road network.  Similarly, the provision of technical assistance, studies and
training to the Ministry of Transport will help to improve overall management
in the transport sector and will increase general operational efficiency in the
sector.    Furthermore,  implementation of the Action Plan  involving minor
adjustments to road user charges and greater liberalization in the road transport
market will help remove piesent distortions and reduce overall transport costs.
Finally, enhancement of the construction industry operations would speed up the
execution, and contribute to reduce the costs, of public as well as private
investment programs.

B. Pavement Rehabilitatlon Program
4.02    The  proposed  project  would  finance  about  1,000  km  of  pavement
rehabilitation/strengthening during the period 1990-92 or about 25% of the total
program. Feasibility studies have been completed for a long list of about 1,300
km of roads using a computer program. From this list, a tentative three-year
program totalling 1,000 km has been selected as well as a first-year priority
program covering some 280 km of roads. The overall program includes heavily
trafficked roads throughout the country including important sections of the RP1,
RP3, RP4 and RPl9 in the vicinity of Meknes, Fes ar.d Oujda in the northern part
of the country and the RP40 and RP 32 lînking the port of Agadir with the
interior in the sout.ern part of the country (Map IBRD 21695). Traffic on these
roads in 1986 ranged from 500 vpd to over 4,000 vpd with an average of about
1,800 vpd, heavy vehicles accounting for about 15% of total traffic. Traffic
is assumed to continue increasing in line with the expected develoment of the
economy at about 4% per year.   However,  the viability of the pavement
strengthening program is not sensitive to traffic growth as all sections are
justified on the basis of initial traffic.
4.03    Pavement design and the economic analysis cover a fifteen-year period.
User benefits from pavement strengthening derive from the difference in vehicle
operating costs on (a) poor road surface throughout the fifteen-year evaluation
period and (b) an initially excellent surface progressively deteriorating to a
poor surface.  The deterioration assumptions used are based on those of the HDM
model, and the vehicle operating costs were derived using the HDM subprogram.
Savings of the additional maintenance, which would be needed if the road were
not rehabilitated, have also beeiî estimated. Using these assumptions, the ERs
for tie tentative 1,000/km program range from 20% to over 100% with wverall
average of about 50%. Details of the economic evaluation are given in Annex 3.
C. Periodic Maintenance Proaram
4.04    The evaluation of the periodic maintenance programs has been ur;dertaken
in a similar manner to the pavement strengthening program. Feasibility studies
have been completed for a long list of road sections provided by the Provincial
Public Works Directorates (DPTP). In all, some 1,600 km of road sections have
been analyzed, from which a tentative priority program covering some 1,300 km
has been selected representing about 40% of the total program. Traffic on these
roads are lower than on the sections for pavement strengthex±ing and are generally
in the range of 500 vpd to 2,500 vpd.  The ERs of the tentative three year
program range from 24% to 90% with an average ER of about 30%.  Details of the
economie evaluation are given in Annex 3.
D. Bridge Reconstruction Program
4.05    The proposed project would continue with a modest program of bridge
reconstruction, which was initiated under the Fourth Highway Project. The latter
defined a uniform methodology for determining priorities among different bridges,
and the same methodology has been applied for the extension of the program.  This
involves classifying bridges according to width restrictions, weight limitacions
and poor alignments. The anaiysis shows that bridges with weight limitations
are the most costly in terms of transport expenditures and, therefore, have the



- 32 -
highest rates of return. The additional costs are caused by diversion of traffic
to larger routes or the carriage of goods in smaller capacity trucks.   At
appraisal, a tatal of five bridges had been assessed, the two most important
being located on the main north-south RP30 41, south of Agadir. Traffic volumes
on the routes served by the bridges range from about 1,l.00 vpd on secondary roads
to about 3,500 vpd ot; the RP 30 near Agadir. The amount of traffic diversion
varies from case to case and according to vehicle type, but the proportion ranges
from 20% to 60% of total traffic, the proportion being higher for heavy vehicles.
In all five cases, the estimated ER exceeds 40%.
i.  Improved Haintenance Planning Procedures
4.06    The proposed project includes technical assistance to help improve DRCR's
capability to optimize its road rehabilitation and maintenance programs. Using
a road data base established by CNER, data on vehicle operating costs and road
maintenance units prices would be combined to develop a simple pavement
management system.   A start has already been made with such system for the
economlc cvaluation and ranking of the program financed under the proposed
project. Using appropriate micro-computer technology, a planning system would
be developed, which will ensure the effective utilization of funds on pavement
maintenance. Based on updated information, the indicative three-year program
identified under the proposed project would be reviewed using the management
system and the system extended to cover all of the primary and secondary netvork.
This would result in greater reductions in transport costs over the road network
than would be achieved with maintenance programs established on a more ad hoc
basis.
F. Freih-t Market Liberalization
4.07    It is expected that a gradual liberalization of the road freight
transport market will result in improved efficiency and a substantial saving in
road transport costs. The National Transport Master Plan Study has analyzed a
possible scenario which provides for a progressive increase in gross vehicle
weights, mainly through easier entry conditions into the road transport market.
It is estimated that this scenario could result in annual savings of about 5%
of total road freight transport costs, equivalent to about US$20 million. Other
measures, such as emphasizing ONT s role as a forwarding agent while reducing
its regulatory role should brîng further saving3 but these are difficult to
quantify.
G. rroJect Risk
4.08    In order for the effectiveness of road maintenance operations to be
increased as m.ch as possible, early recruitment of assistance to DRCR is of
great importance. In view of the high priority given by the Government to the
pavement strengthening and maintenance program, the institutional objective of
developing DRCR's capacity to fulfill its role with regard to technical quality
control of roadwork and road maintenance should be fully attainable. Once fully
staffed and functioning, the maintenance planning and monitoring units would
serve to assure continuing, long-term efforts to fully attain project goals.
Secondly, with the recent creation of the Road Fund, whose operation would be
closely monitored under the project, DRCR is less likely to suffer severe



- 33 -
budgetary shortages for the road maintenance program bs in the past.  Moreover,
the annual reviews of the road investment and maintenance program under the
proposed project and under the SAL should mitigate possible shortages in local
funds.
4.09    Benefits expected from increased road transport liberalization and
improved road user charges design will accrue only in relation with MOT's
commitmen¶: to implement the Action Plan. The careful design of this Action Plan,
the strengthening of MO's planning and management capabilities under the
project, and the annual reviews of MOT expenditures under the proposed project
and under the SAL, should reduce the risk of discontinuity in MOT's comiaitment.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01    During lonn negotiations, the Government confirmed the following:
(a) the project cost estimates (para. 3.15);
(b)  the outline terms of reference for the consultant services (para.
3.18); and
(c) the implementation schedule (para. 3.18).
5.02    During loan negotiations, Government agreement was obtained on the
following:
(a)  the project objectives and description (paras. 3.02, 3.03);
(b)  Government will carry out the adjustment and institutional reform
component of the Project in accordance with an implementation
program acceptable to the Bank (paras. 3.07 - 3.11);
<c)  Government will furnish its proposed annual road investment plan
to the Bank by September 30 of each year and thereafter finalize
it, taking into account the Bank's comments and take measures to
ensure its prompt implementation (para. 3.20);
(d)  DRCR will, by September 30 of each year, submit the technical and
economic evaluation of rehabilitation activities proposed for the
following year for the Bank's review according to the same
methodology, criteria, and procedures as applied for the first year
program (para. 3.18);
(e)  procurement arrangements (para. 3.28);
(f)  Government may establish a Special Account of US$5,000,000 on terms
acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.31);
(g)  independent auditors will prepare annual audit reports covering
project related activ'ties with separate reports for the Special



- 34 -
Account and the Statements of Expenditure. The reports will be
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of
the fiscal year (para. 3.32).
5.03    Subject to the above conditions, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$79 million equivalent to the Kingdom of Morocco for a 20-year term
including a five-year grace period.

ROAD MAINTENANCE: STANDARDS AND COSTS
1.       Maintenance standards define the nature, quantity and frequency of
vorks needed to keep the network in satisfactory and stable condition. The
works are broken down into routine maintenance, patching, pavement marking,
resurfacing, ard strengthening. Standards for these activities have been
derived from the 1984 Road Maintenance Study, financed under the Third Highway
Project and adjusted from time to time.  Further refinements are expected from
proposed improvements to the existing pavement management system and
elaboration of maintenance strategies.
2.       Routine maintenance is generally carried out by force account and
include ditch and structure clearing, grading of shoulders, rood signaling and
snow clearing. The amount of work to be carried out is independent from the
traffic level, and the unit cost per km is as follows (1984 costs updated to
mid-1986 level):
Routine maintenance:    Materials, equipment             4,350 DR/km
Labor                           2,590 DH/km
Total                           6,940 DH/km
3.       Patching is carried out by force account on the basis of 1.5% of
the pavement area for roads in poor condition. For roads in fair and good
conditions, the amounts needed are respectively one half and one fourth of
that needed for roads in poor condition. Unit costs per meter of road width
are:
Patching:      Bitumen                                135 DH/km per meter wide
Aggregates                              45 DB/km per meter wide
Crew                                   285 DH/km per meter wide
Total (for road in poor condition)   465 DH/km per meter wide
4.       Pavement marking is generally contracted out, with the following
standards:
Traffic            < 750            750 - 3,000           > 3,000
Marking            none             centerline            centerline + sides

5.       Pavement resurfacing and strengthening are carried out by contract.
For trafics below 3,000 vpd, the usual resurfacing technique is resealing
(with single or double surface treatment), %hile for higher traffics premix
overlays are used. Pavement strengthening is designed for a 15-year period
using a methodology which provides for about 20 different design structures.
Each structure corresponds to a combination of traffic level, type of soil,
and climat*. A "catalogue of design structures" la used together with a
"manual for pavement strengthening" (Project files, Annex 1). The cost of
each structure is computed using a general formula:
C = a W + b
where:        C    =  cost in DO/km per meter of pavement width
a, b = structure parameters
W    =  pavement width
6.       The table herebelow summarizes maintenance standards and costs on the
following assumptions:
Traffic (vpd)          < 750     750 - 1,500       1,500 - 3,000        > 3,000

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
I. Introduction
1.    This annex provides details of the approach used lu the preparation and
economic evaluation of the pavement strengthening and periodic maintenance
programs. Preparation was undertaken by DRCR working in close collaboration
with Bank missions. Background data and working papers are available in the
Project File and are listed in Annex 1.
2.    Road rehabilitation programs are prepared by DRCR on the basis of detailed
proposals initiated by the Provincial Directorates (DPTP). Technical studies
are generally prepared by consultants or by regional design staff assisted by
the CNER. DRCR now wishes to strengthen its capabilities to plan and prepare
these programs using a simple pavement management system. The basic methodology
has been used in the evaluation of the project and would be incorporated into
the planning system. Details of the methodology are given in Project File.
II. Nethodology
3.    Pavement strengthening and overlays are designed for a 15-year period
using a methodology which provides for 20 different design structures. Each
structure corresponds to a combination of traffic level, pavement structure,
type of soil and climate. The pavement design used is described in Annex 2.
4.    User benefits from pavement strengthening derive from the difference
between vehicle operating costs on a poor road surface throughout the 15-year
evaluation period (without project scenario) and on an initially excellent
surface progressively returning to a poor surface condition during the pavement
life (vith project scenario). It is assumed that new overlays provide a surface
roughness equivalent to about 2,000 mm/km. The road surface, with or without
the overlay, would gradually deteriorate roughly in proportion to cumulated
traffic. A maximum level of deterioation is assumed corresponding to roughness
measurement of 6,000 mm/km. For periodic maintenance, no overall improvement
is assumed ln surface roughness following resealing of the surface but pavement
deterioration is temporarily halted for a period of five years.
5.    Pavement deterioration has been measured using a Bump Integrator on some
1,300 km of roads proposed for pavement strengthening and some 430 km of roads
proposed for periodic maintenance. This represents all of the 61 sections in
the long list of roads proposed for pavement strengthering and about 271 km of
the 1,600 km in the long list of sections proposed f r periodic maintenance.



- 41 -
Page 2 of 2
A visual appreciation of surface condition was made for the remainder of the road
sections and these were translated into roughness measurements. The scale used
is:
Good              2,000 mm/km
Fair              3,000 mm/km
Poor              4,500 mm/km
6.    Pavement deterioration is reflected in higher vehicle operating costs.
The latter have been established using the roughness/vehicle operating cost
relationship of the Road Deterioration and Maintenance Sub-Model of the Bank's
Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Hodel, Version 3 (HDM 3). Six standard
vehicle types were used and vehicle operating cost data were established for a
range of roughness from 2,000 to 6,000 mm/km. The basic data and the vehicle
operating cost estimates are shown in Table 1 in June 1988 prices.
7.    To maintain roads in serviceable condition, maintenance effort and cost
increase in line with the progressive deterioration of the road pavement.
Estimates have been made of savings in maintenance expenditures which would
follow from the proposed pavement strengthening or resealing operations.
Maintenance costs are broken down intn routine maintenance, such a ditch and
structure clearing and grading of shoulders, and patching operations which
include the costs of bitumen, aggregates and 'abor.
III. Resu1 ,
8.    Table 2 shows the results of the application of the above methodology to
sections proposed for the three-year program of pavement strengthening and Table
3 to sections proposed for the first year resealing program. The methodology,
including the selection of an appropriate pavement design structure, is applied
to each kilometer of road and the results cumulated for a given road section.
0f the 1,300 km of road sections proposed for pavement strengthening, 1,067/km
were selected for the three-year program. The ERs on this priority program range
from 20% to over 100% with an overall average of about 50%. Of the 1,600/km
proposed for resealing operations, 1,320/km vere retained for the three-year
program with ERs ranging from 24% to 90% and an overall average of about 30%.
A high priority first year program has been selected and design and bidding
documents prepared for early tendering. The remaining roads would be re-examined
based on updated inventory and traffic information during project implementation.
Future planning will a'so benefit from proposed refinements to the existing
pavement management system.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
HIGUVAY SECTOR PROJECT
Analysis of Road User Charges Y
A. Introduction
1.    The Ministry of Equipment undertook vith Bank and consultant assistance
a study on road user charges during 1988. The study was used as part of the
justif4cation for establishing a Road Fund.   The Road Fund was approved by
Parliament in December 1988 and revenue will accrue to this fund from a new axle
tax, from part of the existing tax on fuel and from vehicle registration fees.
B. Çurrent Tax Structure
2.   In this analysis road user charges relate to any indirect tax or charge
levied on the purchase and operation of motor vehicles.   (Taxes aimed at
generating general revenue as well as specific road use fees are included).
These taxes can be divided into two broad groups, namely (a)/taxes on vehicle
ownership such as registration, licence fees, custom duties and sales tax; and
(b)/taxes on use such as fuel taxes and import duties and sales taxes on spare
parts and tires.
3.    The structure of taxes on road users is summarized in Table 1...  As in
many otlier countries, road user taxation in Morocco has been guided by the
primary objective of raising general revenue for the Government.   Income
distribution is reflected in the high level of taxes on private cars and
gasoline.    In addition,  efficiency objectives vere  at the basis of the
introduction of an axle tax which favors the use of larger multiple-axle trucks
that lover the weight per axle and thus are less damaging to roads.
4.    Some of the anomalies in the present tax structure are outlined belov:
(a)   A number of licence fees ("taxes de stationnement, de coordination
et de tonnage") are applied only to private and ovn-account
operators, the most important one being the "taxe de coordination"
which provides revenue to the Office National
1   The methodology used here is the Road User Charges "Ouick Methodology"
prepared by Frida Johansen,  January 12,  1988.    (World Bank internal
memorandum).

des Transports, ONT. This bias against private and own-account operators is
counteracted to a certain extent by a slightly more intensive use of these
vehicles compared to the ONT operators, and by the commission which is paid to
ONT by its members. With the new axle tax, the various licence fees related to
gross vehicle weight could be modified and the tax structure simplified.
(b) Customs and import duties are high, particularly for assembled
vehicles.    When  combined  with  VAT,  the  average  tax  on  a
locally-assembled vehicle represents over half the vehicle price,
and about 40% of the price for imported assembleu vehicles. Customs
duties should be reduced on both assembled and knocked down units
in order to encourage renewal of the vehicle fleet.
(c) Vehicle registration fees are currently lower for vehicles above
five years old. This presumably reflects a perception that older
vehicles are used less intensively and therefore cause less road
damage. However, there is no evidence that this is the case, and
it also delays vehicle renewal.'
(d) There is a substantial difference in the price of gasoline and
diesel fuel which has caused distortions in development of the
vehicle fleet (Table 1.2). Currently over half the passenger car
fleet is composed of diesel-powered vehicles. Moreover, the low
price of diesel also encourages the use of older vehicles and,
therefore, inhibits reneral of the vehicle fleet. The tax margin
between the two fuels could be gradually reduced and, in the
meantime, substantially higher registration fees applied to
diesel-powered passenger cars and vans to equate the charges on
passenger vehicles independently of the fuel they use.
C. Cost Recoverv from Users
5.      Road use costs have been estimated based on an "optimal" road maintenance
strategy taking into account road conditions, traffic volumes and growth and
the unit costs of works. Together with capacity investments estimated at DH 700
million annually, the total annual costs are estimated at about DH 1.7 billion
(Table 2). Planned expenditures on the road network in the next few years are
to be limited to maintenance activities and are not expected to exceed DH 1
billion annually.
6.      Road costs have been broken down into three groups: (a) costs related
to road usage and which are roughly proportional to the number of
v'.cle-kilometers; they include routine maintenance and network extensions;
(b) costs which reflect space usage and congestion such as capacity investments
like widening and are related to equivalent passenger car units; and (c) costs
Since preparation of the study, annual vehicle registration fees have
been amended and are now the same regardless of vehicle age.

related to heavy vehicle aggressivity on roads wh4ich are allocated on the basis
of the number of equivalent standard axles and include periodic resealing and
strengthening operations.
7.      Table 2.1 shows the estimates of traffic on the Moroccan road network
measured according to vehicle-kilometers, equivalent standard axles and
equivalent passenger car units.  Table 2.2 shows the allocation of road use
costs according to these various measures of traffic, thereby deriving a cost
per unit of traffic (vehicle-kilometer equivalent standard axle-kilometer,
equivalent passenger car-kilometer). Vehicle operating costs have been derived
using the vehicle operating cost sub-model of the Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards Model - HDM 3. Table 2.3 shows the incidence of taxes and costs and
compares road use charges and road use costs per vehicle-kilometer.
8.      The results of the analysis show that road user charges exceed road
costs for all vehicle types, ranging from about eightfold for buses to about
twofald for semi-trailers. Overall, road user revenues are about eight times
the "normative or optimal" road use costs in Morocco.  The share of taxes in
vehicle operating costs ranges from about 28% to 38% and is the highest for own
account truck operators.   On a ton-kilometer basis,  the incidence of tax
decreases with truck size which therefore encourages the use of larger trucks.
D. Road Fund
9.      In January 1989, several taxes were specifically earmarked for a Road
Fund in order to ensure adequate expenditures for road maintenance. These taxes
include part of the tax on fuel formerly known as the "taxe intérieure sur la
consommation", a new axle tax and vehicle registration fees. The Road Fund is
expected to amount to about DA 400 million annually equivalent to about 40% of
planned road maintenance expenditures.   The fund would cover all needs for
routine maintenance and about 65% of periodic resealing operations. The official
documents related to the Road Fund are in the Project File.
E. Conclusions
10.     Road users are heavily taxed and no further tax ir.creases are warranted.
However, the tax structure is relatively complex and some simplification could
be introduced that would also correct the anomalies noted in Section B. The
reduction of custom duties is already being provided for under the SAL. It is
recommended that the price differential between gasoline and diesel fuel be
analyzed in more detail as part of the Project Action Plan (Annex 5).

revenue accrues to ONT and is then transferred to the Treasury.  The rate is based on gross
vehicle weight and ranges from OH 481 for vehicles of 2 to 3 tons gross weight up to OH 9450 for
vehicles above 34 tons gross weight.
-Taxe de Tonnage": This tax ts paid only by own-accaunt truck operators, ONT trucks and private
trucks less than eight tons gross weight be1ng exempt. The tax is assessed according to gross
vehicle weight at the rate of OH 20 per ton.
Insoection Fea: 140 OH per vehicle. Applies annually to all vehicles from new except buses which

A. orainzat.in et Rond Pzt2lù& Transuont
1.      The road freight transport market iD Morocca is entirely in the hands of the private scotor, ONT enauring only a role of an intermediary for
about 600 individuel operators or cooperati les.  About 24S of the market ls accounted for by operators using the services of ONT, 361 by own-account
operations and 40X by private operators outaide of ONT (less than 8 tons gross vehicle weight). According to current legislation, private operators
are limited to own-account transport. However, these regulations are not strictly enforced.
2.      The productivity of truck fleets is relativeoy aood:  between 60,000 and 100,000 km per vehicle per year.  The load factors for interurban
movements are alsa biab, naely around 60X for the three groups of operators.  However, the average aSe of the fleet ia high, namely over ten years
for light and medium trucks, and about seven years for heavy trucks. This situation reflects in part the high cost of vohicles, the low level of
tariffs, ond low vehicle maintenance costs. A reduction in cuatoms duties is currently boing introduced under the SAL, -uhich should encourage renewal
of the fleet.  Iu addition, the system of road transport licenaing which is required for ONT operators, imposes a heavy cost burden on their
cperations. A further constraint is that a large proportion of long- and medium-distance freight is handled in amall vehicles, and considerable
savings would be achieved with a move towards larger and more efficient trucks.
3.      Modifications to current road transport regulations should be introduced progressively.    As such, the folLowing steps will be implemented:             v

4.      The recontly cempleted road user charses study shows thet revenues generated by road users, excoed road use costs for aIl types of vebhicles,
the ratio varyina ftro  tbree to neven times for commercial vehicles.  The incidence of taxes in vehicle operatina costa varies from 28Z to 38Z, this
percentage being the highest for own-account transport.  on a ton-kilometer basis, the taxes decrease with increasins truck sire.  As mentioned aboye,
hi p custcme dutiea discourage renewal of the vehicle fleet but these duties are now being reduced under the SAL.
5.      As in many other countries, the principal objective of road user taxation in Morocco is to generate revenue for the Treasury.  Incoma
distribution conaiderations are reflected in the hi p level of taxes on private cars and on gasoline. In addition, efficiency objectives are at the
basAi  of the recant introduction of an aile tex, the latter favoring the une of lar8er multiple axle trucks, which have a less damaging effect on road
pavements.

C. REallecation et Resmoannbilities ovar the Road Setwork
7.      The present road classification is old (datin8 tram 1947), and need to be updated to better match tbe current administrative and econamie
pattern of the country. A new administrative breakdown As currently beins considered by the Government with a redistribution of responsibilities for
the network between MPW eud local authorities.  This redistribution is linkcd to increased resource mobilization at the local level with the recent
introduction of a value-added tax. It As important that this network classification be officialized as socn as possible in order to ensure a more

8.      MR has proven Ats capability to plan end manage the road network in the face of adverse conditions through carefully designed
rehabilitation snd maintenance programs, snd the successful haudling of the Road Fund dossier is a testimony to that. However, it may well be that
these various prosram  are only sub-optimal, in that DRCR's approach is essentially normative snd the trade-off between different policies snd
techniques (say, more or lesa patching versus thin or thick overlay, versus rehabilitation) As not optimized. DRCR now feels the need for a broader
conceptuel framework, where optimal strategies could effectively be defined.
9.      la the contait of a clear statement on traininS policy in Morocco, MPM's trainins prosrams have improved si,nificantly for pre-employment as
ell as vocational training. However, this bas more benefitted the hiiher level staff than the intermediate and lover level staff, a nd about 60% of
the tecbnical/operational staff still lacks skills in highway maintenance techniques. Thus, focus on training for this category oe staff is needed to
really improve labor productivity.
10.     The following measures would help DRCR meet the above objectives:                                                                                      pi

11.     The main departmenta of MOT dealing with transport planning and road transport regulation are the Department of Transport, Studios, Planing
and Coordination (DEPCT) and the Land Transport Department (DTT). This organisation is adequate but bas to improve its efficiency through better
management and introduction of new tools and techniques. MDT bas already taken an important step in this direction with the Transport Sector Master
Plan Study, one of the main aima théreof beina the strengthening of MDT' capabilities in transport planning. Further stops should be taken to put
into effect this institutional strenathening.
12.     Thé transport needs of rural areas is one of the main concerna of HOT, in relation with the special emphasis accorded to the development of
the rural sector in the 1988-92 Plan. MT attempted to organize the combined transport of passengers and goods in 1985, with mixed resulta due to
poor design of vehicles and of feeder roads. There is a need to review the present organization of rural services and rural infrastructure, and to
provide the governsent with recommendations on the appropriate institutional set-up:  incentives (including for the identification and developsent of
specially adapted vehicles), financing, tarification, rural road maintenance organization and funding, etc.
13.     Tue following measures would help MDT méet the above objectives:

strengthening its regional offices to better meet the local needs of contractors, enterprises and consulting firms; snd (e) streasline the prosent
functions snd enhance the activity of MPW in the regulatory and standardization fields, respectively.  This include botter adapting regulation and
norms to local geographic, geological, climatological and sociological situations.
15.     The following measure would help MPW to meet the above objectives:
-  In consultation with other Goverument departments concerned and           - Timetable of studies to be established by June 30. 1990.
with the construction industry at large, launch a series of

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
HUMAN RESCURCES COMPONENT
I. Ministrv of Public Works CMPW>
A. Roads and Traffic Department tDRCR)
This component aims at supporting the road maintenance training system
being implemented by DRCR. The training and retraining system will allow the
training of personnel of DRCR in the flelds of operation and maintenance of heavy
equipment for public works, and of road maintenance activities.
The decision to develop and implement a training and retraining system
follows a 1984 Road Maintenance Study, which provides the necessary elements for
the design of training programs and preparation of the bidding documents for the
technical assistance needed to start-up training operations. The results of the
study have been updated, in particular with regards to the existing manpower and
the proposed training programs. Tables 1 and 2 hereafter provide these updated
elements.
The Project will finance a training program for administrative personnel
and trainers. This will be accomplished by training seminars in Morocco, and
by short training abroad in similar institutions. This component will include
the start-up of all training programs and their evaluation after three years of
operation.
Training abroad:
Heavy equipment operation and maintenance:   12 trainees during 1.5
months, total 18 man-months;
Heavy equipment  repair:    12 trainees  during 2 months,  total  24

KINGDON 0F MOROCCO
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RIIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
SELECTION OF BANK-FINANCED COMPONENTS
1.      This annex describes the components that have been targeted under the
project for Bank financing.   These components have been selocted for their
contribution to (i) reducing the backlog in road rehabilitation and maintenance,
and (ii) implementing the Project Action Plan. The first-year program has been
defined for civil works, using the methodology described in Annex 3 and in the
Project File (item 11); for subsequent years the same methodology would be used.
The costs of the Bank-financed items are presented at the end of this annex
(para. 8).
Road Rehabilitation
2.      In continuation of the program implemented under the ongoing IBRD and
AfDB projects, the proposed project provides for a line of credit for the
strengthening and rehabilitation of about 1,000 km of roads (base cost: DH 315
million). The road sections have been selected from a list of 1,300 km for which
feasibility studies were carried out in 1988. The technical and economic study,
which has led to the final selection from this list, was made by DRCR (Project
Files, item 11). The major components of the work will be adding a layer of
either asphaltic concrete, gravel topped by a wearing course of double surface
treatment, or gravel topped by asphaltic concrete, the choice depending on the
volume of traffic. In addition, most sections will require ancillary works, such
as widening where necessary, restoring shoulders, and repairing and improving
drainage facilities. No realigning work is envisaged.
Periodic and Routine Maintenance
3.      Period maintenance of paved road works would be carried out on the basis
of DRCR's established standards (Annex 2). The indicative three-year program
identified under the proposed project would be reviewed using an improved
pavement management system. Regarding resurfacing, feasibility studies have been
completed for a long list of road sections (1,600 km) provided by the provincial
subdivisions, from which a tentative priority program covering some 1,300 has
been selected (one criterion for selection has been the continuity of itinerary)
for a base cost of DH 255 million. A first-year program has been defined for
some 210 km (Project Files, item 11). Shoulder restoration is usually carried
out together with road rehabilitation or strengthening, but a backlog has been
identified of about 1,000 km of roads whose pavement soundness is threatened by
the worn-out shoulders (Project Files, item 21). The project would provide for



- 66 -
ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 3
a line of credit covering two thirds of this backlog. With respect to pavement
marking, although the norms are modest (Annex 2), a huge backlog exists, due
again to the priority accorded in the recent past to the essential maintenance
of the heavily trafficked road sections. A priority program covering about 5,000
km has been defined (Project File, item 22), which would be financed under the
project for a total base cost, including shoulder restoration, of DH 90 million.
4.      Routine maintenance activities will be intensified ta meet the standards
necessitated by regional climate, traffic, and road condition.  The proposed
project would provide financing for workshops and equipment.   The global
workshops system comprise a central workshop in Casablanca, where major overhauls
will be done on a carefully planned rotation basis, and seven regional workshops
which will handle intermediate repairs. The Fourth Highway Project dealt with
the central and two regional (Fès, Marrakech) workshops. The proposed project
would complete the program through (Project File, item 23) (i) construction and
equipping of two workshops in Agadir and Meknès, and (ii) equipping of the last
two workshops in Rabat and Oujda (total base costs: DH 6 million for buildings
and DH 9 million for equipment). Regarding road maintenance equipment, most of
the needs have been covered under previous loans (by IBRD, as well as AfDB), and
the additional equipment proposed for purchase under the project is therefore
limited to light vehicles needed to carry the maintenance crews (Project File,
item 24) for a base cost of DH 23 million.   The project would also finance
traffic counters to allow for the renewal of worn-out and/or obsolete equipment,
and to improve the coverage of the network as far as automatic counting is
concerned (Project File, item/25) for a total base cost of DH 9 million.
Reconstruction of Bridaes
5.      There are some 2,000 bridges in Morocco which need adequate maintenance
and rehabilitation.   A bridge management system aiming at  improving the
inventory, assessment and prioritization of needs, and preparation of a detailed
rehabilitation program, is financed under the AfDB Transport Sector Loan. The
most urgent needs in terms of safety or width or "black spots" (due to poor
bridge layouts and access ramps) have been partially dealt with in previous IBRD
and AfDB loans, and the proposed project will continue this priority program
with about seven bridges to be reconstructed (Project File, item 12) for a base
cost of DH 50 million.
Road Safety Program
6.      As shown in Annex 7, the number of accidents had decreased in relation
to the traffic. However, accidents due to mechanical defects are increasing,
and this incriminates the present system of vehicle inspection.  Regulations
have to be updated (for instance, passenger cars do not need to pass a mechanical
inspection before they are 10 years old), and enforced more vigorously. The
proposed project would provide financing for the construction and equipping of
a National Center for Vehicle Inspection and Testing (CNEHA), whose aims would
be (i) regulation and control of norms, and assistance to the private vehicle
inspection centers (27 are operating presently), and (ii) industrial testing and



- 67 -
ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 3
homologation of vehicles and accessories, in particular those accessories built
and used locally. Technical assistance would be provided for the start-up of
the CNEHA and for the re-examination of existing regulations regarding safety
and environment protection, with a view to make recommendations for their
improvement and prepare draft updated legislation accordingly. A feasibility
study of the CNEHA was carried out by MOT in 1985 (Project File, item 13), and
the costs have been updated as follows (base costs in DH million).
