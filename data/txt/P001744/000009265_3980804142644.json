Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project are: (i) sectoral reforms\n            should be accompanied by adequate complementary sectoral\n            investments in order to have a major impact; (ii) a\n            well-coordinated, multi-donor effort is essential for\n            greater impact of sector investments because of the\n            resulting synergy and complementarities as the experience of\n            Third Southern Mali Rural Development Program (Mali-Sud III)\n            attests; and (iii) sector reforms and investments should be\n            carefully placed within an agreed overall macro framework\n            and long-term sector development program as exemplified by\n            the positive impact that devaluation and the low\n            inflationary environment had on agricultural production,\n            particularly cotton."}, "docdt": "1998-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
