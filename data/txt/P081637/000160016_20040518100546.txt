                  average annual growth rates o f 4.5-5.0 percent during 2002-05, the
                  reductionof the poverty rate by halfby 2005 compared to 2001, and the
                  reduction of the unemployment rate from 18.1 percent in2001 to 12-14
                  percent in 2005, while malung substantial progress towards EU
                  accession, which it i s hoped will occur in 2007. The medium-term
                  program balances a strategy o f private sector-led growth with reducing
                  social exclusion and increasing empowerment to ensure wide
                  participation in growth. The program consists o f five complementary
                  pillars:

                      energy, railway, telecommunications, andwater sectors;

                      reducing entry constraints, accelerating exits, securing deregulation
                      and reducing regulatory costs, improving the delivery o f public

                      includingthrough continuing labor market reform;
                      Deepening thefinancial sector, improving the legal framework for
                      lending, completing banking reform, and developing financial
                      markets;
                      Improving public       sector  governance,     strengthening  public
                      administration capacity, improving service delivery, reducing
                      corruption,   strengthening accountability        and   transparency,

             An updated Letter of Development Policy prepared by the authorities
             describes the government's medium-term program and summarizes
             progress made in implementing the program under PAL-1 and PAL-2,
             and i s attached to this Report.

Benefits:    First, the proposed PAL-2 continues support to the government as it
             implements its medium-term economic program to achieve sustained
             growth, reduce poverty and. social exclusion, while making strong
             progress towards EU accession. Second, PAL-2 also continues support
             to help the government establish mechanisms and institutional
             arrangements      required   to   ensure     successful  implementation,
             coordination, monitoring, and evaluation o f the government medium-
             term program. Third, the proposed PAL-2 lays the groundwork for
             PAL-3 and possible further future PALSthrough identifying specific
             outcomes to be achieved over the period 2004-2007 and specific future
             critical actions to be supported by PAL-3. Fourth, the proposed PAL-2
             complements current and planned investment projects in trade and
             transport facilitation, health, child welfare, registration and cadastre,
             social investment and employment promotion, revenue administration
             and district heatingthrough establishing the enabling policy framework.
             Fifth, the program supported by the loan complements and reinforces
             the recently concludedIMF program, as well as the new programthat i s
             currently under discussion.

Risks:       First,implementationriskremainsan issuebut has decreasedsince
             the beginning of the PAL program as evidenced by the successful
             completion of both PAL-1 and PAL-2 and the improvements in
             institutionalcapacity achievedto date under the PAL program. To
             address implementationrisk, under PAL-1 the government activated the
             Council for Structural Policy to improve coordination and sought to
             implement institutional strengthening programs for critical offices and
             agencies. During PAL-2 preparation, the government restructured the
             Council for Structural Policy into a Council for Economic Policy,
             chaired by the DeputyPrime Minister and Minister of Economy. The
             Council for State Administration, chairedby the Deputy Prime Minister
             responsible for this area, was also established under PAL-2 to provide
             for coordination on implementation across government in this area.
             PAL-2 has a particular focus on improving public sector governance,
             including public administrationreformandjudicial reform, and seeks to
             help build government capacity to design and implement the reform
             program. The current and planned investment projects also mitigate
             this risk through providing implementation support. The risk is further
             mitigated through PAL-2 also seeking to leverage off the outcomes o f
             specific donor projects inthe areas o f public administration reform and
             judicial reform.

             Second, politicalrisk remains high. This is mitigated to a significant
             degree by the fact that there is strong support from all political parties
             for Bulgaria's EU accession and NATO membership (achieved on

                   March 29, 2004) which helps to provide an anchor for remaining
                   structural, institutional and social reforms. In addition, progress has
                   been made in reducing unemployment from 18.1 percent in 2001 to
                   14.3 percent in2003. Some progress has also beenmade indeveloping
                   appropriate strategies and action plans in the area o f anticorruption.
                   Initial government actions in this area could be better communicated
                   and disseminated.      Implementing difficult structural reforms with
                   accompanying improved targeting of social programs and a well
                   designed communications strategy would also mitigate furfher the
                   political risk. The social protection and assistance pillar of the reform
                   program i s designed to alleviate the adverse impact o f the remaining
                   structural reforms while the business environment pillar i s designed to
                   provide expanded opportunities for employment.

                   Third, there may be external shocks jeopardizing macroeconomic
                   stability. Bulgaria faces several significant potential external risks.
                   Bulgaria's external accounts are sensitive to three key parameters: an
                   increase in oil prices, higher interest rates, and a prolonged slowdown
                   in EU economies which are the destination of over fifty percent of
                   Bulgarian exports and the origin of more than half the FDIinflows. In
                   2003 the external current account deficit widened to more than 8% o f
                   GDP from 4.3% in 2002. Rapidly growing credit to the private sector
                   fueled import growth which significantly outpaced strong exports.
                   However, record high FDI inflows o f over US$1.4 billion financed
                   more than 85% of the external current account deficit. Thishas allowed
                   a further increase in foreign exchange reserves, which provided
                   coverage o f 5.3 months o f imports in 2003 compared to 4.9 months in
                   2002. The active efforts to restructure andreduce external debt over the
                   last couple o f years have enabled Bulgaria to manage these external
                   risks appropriately. Compared to 2002 external debt declined by close
                   to 7 percentage points o f GDP and stood at 63% at end-2003.
                   Continued maintenance o f strict discipline in macroeconomic
                   management and o f the measures inplace to respond to potential risks,
                   together with acceleration o f structural reforms,          will further
                   substantially mitigate these risks.

          ONA PROPOSED SECOND PROGRAMMATICADJUSTMENT LOAN
                             TO THE REPUBLICOFBULGARIA


1.       The proposed Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL-2) to the Republic of
Bulgaria for Euro 123.7 million (US$l50 million equivalent, converted into Euro during
Negotiations) i s designed to support the MediumTerm Reform Program o f the Government o f
Bulgaria (GOB).This loan is the secondo f three programmatic adjustment loans envisaged inthe
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussedby the Boardon May 9, 2002. This document and
the accompanying updated Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) present an assessment of
progress inachieving the key objectives of the government's three-year program.



                A. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSPROSPECTS           AND

Achievements Under PAL-2

2.       The government has continued to make consistent progress in implementing its
reform program under PAL,-2; macro-economic performance has been strong; and
Bulgaria remains on track for EU accession in 2007 (following NATO accession at end-
March 2004). Economic growth i s being sustained at 4-5 percent per year (4.9 percent in 2002
and 4.3 percent in 2003). Macroeconomic stability has been maintained, inflation is low, with
12-month inflation at 5.6 percent in December 2003 compared to 11.3 percent in 2000. Public
debt to GDP has been reduced below the Maastricht threshold o f 60 percent to 46.2 percent in
December 2003'. Fiscal accounts were balanced in2003 compared to a deficit o f 10.3 percent in
1996. FDI inflows were estimated at US$1.4 billion for 2003, up to 7 percent of GDP as
compared with 5.8 percent o f GDP in 2002. The European Commission (EC) has assessed
Bulgaria as a functioning market economy and 26 o f the 30 chapters for EUaccession have been
closed.

3.       Reasonable progress has been made in tackling remaining structural reforms.
Privatization of the commercial sector is almost completed, with divestiture of around 95
percent by value of assets of non-infrastructure state-owned enterprises (as at 1995); and
privatizationof the financial sector has been completed. The private sector as a share o f GDP
has increased &om 53 percent in 1996 to 64 percent in20022; and 98 percent of banking assets
were as at end 2003 inprivate ownership. A new strategy has been approved by the government
and the National Assembly for the privatization o f Bulgartabak and an international consultant
appointed inMarch 2004. Privatizationof the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC) i s
at an advanced stage with a share purchase agreement signed with the winning bidder on
February 20, 2004. Pnvatization o f the electricity distribution companies i s underway with the
first stage process completed inMarch 2004. The government has moved forward with its plans
to secure private sector participationor involvement inthe district heatingand water companies.

4.       New Energy and Telecommunications Laws were enacted in September and
November 2003. Energy pricing reforms are improving efficiency and reducing the fiscal
burden.     The independence of regulatory commissions in the areas o f energy and
telecommunications has been strengthened, as has that of the competition authority, and the
institutional capacity o f these bodies further developed. Reasonable progress continues to be
made on railways restructuring, includingtermination o f loss-making services (199 lulometers o f
loss-making services were terminated under PAL-2) and reduction in the railways workforce (a
reduction of around 10 percent was achieved under PAL-2 compared to the position as at end
2001).   Significant improvements have been made to the regulatory environment which will
reduce administrative barriers and regulatory compliance costs through elimination and
modification o f regulatory regimes : 52 regulatory regimes were eliminated and 92 modified
significantly in2003 (against original PAL-2 benchmarks o f40 and 50 respectively).

5.       The legislative and regulatory foundation for further development of the financial
systemhasbeensignificantlystrengthenedunder PAL-2. Inthis respect, the Accounting Law,
Auditing Law, Financial Supervision Commission Law, and Social Insurance Code have all been
enacted. The banlung sector has been put on a sound footing, financial intermediation is
increasing rapidly, albeit from a low base, while the quality o fbank portfolios remains high-real
credit to the private sector increased by around 43 percent in 2003 compared to 2002. Pension
reformhas continuedwith strengtheningo fpension fundregulation and governance.

6.       The policy and legislativebasehas beenput inplacein 2003 to secure a merit-based
and depoliticizedcivil service through a major public administrationreform program. This
represents a significant achievement. Over the period January 1, 2004 to April 26, 2004, 439
competitive recruitment processes were launched under the provisions of the amended Civil
Service Law, compared to 164 competitive recruitment exercises over the whole o f 2003.
Improvements in service delivery are being secured through introduction o f performance
standards and the implementation o f one stop shops; together with the strengthening o f
transparency and external accountability.        This is underpinned by a new performance
management system which provides incentives for a service and performance orientation on the
part o f civil servants. Pay reform has been launched; and government structures are being
subjected to rigorous review. An Anticorruption Program for 2004-2005 has been approved
including specific anticorruption strategies in each o f the areas o f education, health and the
judiciary. Conflict o f interest regulations have been strengthened. There was a 213 percent
increase inrequestsby the public for official information in2003 compared to 2002.

7.       Allocative efficiency is being strengthened in public expenditure management
through the introduction of a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework and program budgeting
(piloted in three Ministries in 2003). A reform inthe system o f intergovernmental finance has
been undertaken, under which all centrally mandated delegated local government functions are,
for the first time, fully funded in the 2004 Budget. A beginning was made under PAL-2 to
rebalance recurrent and capital expenditures to allow for much-needed investment in
infkastructure, particularly roads, with capital expenditures planned for 2004 at 3.6 percent of
GDP, compared to a total o f 3.2 percent o f GDP in2002.

8.       Judicial reform was acceleratedthrough the passing of amendments and additions
to the Constitutionin September 2003, and the consequential amendment o f the Judiciary Act
inMarch2004. These amendmentswere designed to securedepoliticization,provide for external
accountability, and secure increasedeffectiveness and higher performance inthejudiciary.

9.       Unemployment has declined from 18.1 percent in 2000 and from 17.7 percent in
2002 to 14.3 percent in 2003; and the employmentrate increased from 39.7 percent at end
2000 to 43.9 percent in 2003 (quarter 3). Per capita income has increased by 78 percent since
the crisis of 1996/97, from US$1,200 in 1997 to US$2,130 in 2003. Household incomes rose in
real terms by 18.8 percent in2002 after having declined the two previous years. The poverty rate
has been reduced from 36 percent in 1997 to 12.8 percent in2001 (although this is still twice the
levels o f 1995Q. The urban poverty rate has declined from 34 percent to 6 percent; the rural
poverty rate has declined from 41 percent to 24 percent.

10.      Health reform and pensions reform both remain on track, and improved coverage
and efficiency in social assistance has been secured. The govemment in 2003 pursued a
number o f initiatives to tackle social exclusionthrough developingplans to secure the integration
o f children with special educational needs into mainstream schools and to achieve the
deinstitutionalization of the comparatively large number o f children in specialized care
institutions.   It also approved an action plan for protection against discrimination against
minorities in the education system; secured the enactment o f the Anti-Discrimination Act, and
approved amendments to the Labor Codeto protect against discriminationinemployment.

11.      An education reform program was launched in spring 2004. This was designed to
strengthen quality and equity, and to complement the reforms in the area o f fiscal efficiency
begunin2003.

12.      The Matrix of Performance Benchmarks attached as Annex 6 shows the progress
achieved under PAL-2 and the progress expected under PAL-3 together with the medium-
term DesiredOutcomesfor the program overall. Attached as Annex 6C is a Progress Against
Desired Outcomes Matrix. This shows the progress achieved under PAL-2 (by end March 2004)
towards reaching the medium-term program objectives.             The Annex i s based on a mix o f
statistical data and quantitative and qualitative analysis, includingresults from Administrative and
Regulatory Cost Surveys, surveys on perceptions of the judiciary, anticorruption surveys, and
Public Officials and Pay and Benefits Surveys.


RecentEconomicDevelopments

13.      The early years of transition were marked by slow and unsustainedreformefforts?
Until1997, Bulgariawas one ofthe poorest performingeconomies ofCentralandEasternEurope
(CEE). The preceding decade was marked by massive external borrowing, stop-go stabilization
policies, and a slow pace o f structuralreforms. Fueledby a failure to establish market discipline,
widespread rent-seekmg, and the prevalence of soft budget constraints among enterprises, banks,
and the govemment budget, Bulgaria's problems culminated in a severe economic and financial
crisis in 1996-97, resulting in a cumulative decline o f GDP by about 14 percent, a sharp decline
in per capita income, and an increase in poverty. After several months of chaos involving a
hyperinflation episode, the collapse o f the banking sector, and a major foreign exchange crisis,
Bulgaria adoptedinJuly 1997 a Currency Board Arrangement (CBA).

14.      Bulgaria respondedaggressively to the 1996-97 crisis. Followingthe general elections
of April 1997 and the adoption o f the CBA, Bulgaria began implementing conservative fiscal

policies and accelerated implementation o f structural reforms.               The wide-ranging structural
program included implementation of reforms in the social, agriculture, enterprise and banhng
sectors, and liberalization of prices and trade. By December 1999 when Bulgaria was invited to
start negotiations towards EU membership, its economy was largely stabilized, and growth and
per capita income had begun to recover. This improved performance took place in a difficult
extemal environment marked by turmoil in international markets, unfavorable commodity price
developments, and trade disruptions associated with the Kosovo crisis. The current account
deficit widened from 0.5 percent o f GDP in 1998 to 5 percent in 1999 due to external pressures.
At the same time Bulgaria faced a legacy of high indebtedness, low levels of investment, and
risingunemployment. To address the combined effects of these challenges, Bulgaria accelerated
implementation o f structural reforms, expanded its social safety net to mitigate the impact o f the
transition, and maintained disciplined macroeconomic policies.                  After five years of sound
macroeconomic management and acceleration o f structural reforms, Bulgaria succeeded in
restoring growth and bringing down inflation (as shown in Table l), improving public and
                                                                                  and

15.      While the domestic financial sector has improved substantially in line with the
resumption of growth in the real sector and strengthened banking supervision, rapid
expansionof bankcreditposes new challengesto bankingsupervision. Followingthe closure
o f 17 banks, consolidation o f a number of banks, and privatization o f almost all state-owned
banks, mainly to foreign investors, the banking system was put back on solid ground. The Joint
World Bank-IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) review' concluded that
Bulgaria's banking system       - which is currently the main component o f the financial system was       -

  A joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission visited Sofia in November
2001. The FSAP report was discussed with the authorities during the Fund Article IV mission in May
2002.

  generally well supervised, highly capitalized, and profitable. However, the legacy o f the deep
  banking crisis in 1996-97 led to a more conservative lending policy by banks; and a low deposit
  base. As a result, bank intermediationremained low compared to other countries of Central and
  Eastem Europe (CEE), and the non-bank financial sector continued to be underdeveloped.
  However, after four successive years o f economic growth, credit expansion, especially in retail
  banking, has accelerated since 2001. This has been driven by higher deposit growth, lower
  international interest rates on bank deposits abroad, and competition among commercial banks.
  In2003, realcredit to the privatesector increasedby43 percent year-on-year. There areno signs
  yet o f worsening bank portfolios-prudential         indicators remain good as a result of heightened
  supervisionand intenseriskmonitoring, while bank profits are increasing.

  16.      Private sector development hasbeen central in accelerating growth. The acceleration
  o f privatization and restructuring o f existing SOEs, together with improvements in the business
  environment and the gradual decrease in tax burden, have contributed to the expansion o f the
  private sector to 64 percent o f GDP in 2002 compared to 53 percent in 1996. From being the
  country with the smallest private sector share of GDP o f CEE countries in 1996, by 2002
  Bulgaria was behindonly the CzechRepublic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary and Estonia6. The
  share o f new enterprises7which could spur growth and help the economy reach its full potential
  increased from 41 percent of total employment and 23 percent of value added in 2000 to 45
  percent and 27 percent respectively in2002. However, this i s still lower than in more advanced
  CEE countries where new enterprises accounted for more than 50 percent of employment and
  between 55 and 65 percent of value added in 1997-1998.

  17.      The economic recovery contributed to a reduction in poverty. Living standards have
  improved and overall poverty levels have declined bytwo-thirds since 1997. The economic crisis
  in 1997 seriously affectedlivingstandards, andpoverty escalatedto 36 percent ofthe population,
  according to the household survey conducted in 1997.' Since then, poverty rates have declined
  significantly, to 12.8 percent in 2001;        as consumption levels have recovered fkom the crisis.
  While the overall magnitude of the decline inpoverty rates since 1997 may have been less than
  two-thirds due to potential for measurement error in 1997 as a result of highinflation rates, there
  has been a notable improvement in living standards since the crisis. Improvements can also be
  seen with respect to the depth and severity o f poverty (see Box 1). This suggests that the period
  o f sustained economic growth between 1997 and 2001,as well the existing social safety net, have
  had an important impact on living standards.

  18.      Despite the improvements since 1997, poverty remains at twice the levels of 1995
  and deep poverty persists among certain vulnerable groups.                 The nature of poverty has
  evolved, as recent improvements in welfare have not been equally distributed across the
  population. There are "pockets of poverty" among certain groups, particularly the long-term
  unemployed, ethnic minorities, most notably Roma, and families with more than four children.
  There is still scopeto reduce poverty through further improving the targeting o f social assistance.

I Box  1: RecentPoverty Trends andthe Poverty Gap
            Inthe last 6 years Bulgaria has made impressive progress interms o f growth, macroeconomic
  stability and poverty reduction. As a result o f prudent fiscal policy and continued progress in structural
  reforms, Bulgaria has maintained stability and growth has been between 4-5 percent per year. Per capita
  income has increased by 78 percent since the crisis o f 1996197. Per capita income was estimated at
  $2,130 in2003 compared to $1,200 in 1997 - which illustrates a remarkable improvement in standards of
  living in a short period of time.   While poverty ratios are not entirely comparable over time due to
  methodological differences, it is clear that the poverty rate declined - the poverty rate in 1997 was 36
  percent o fthe population and 12.8 percent in2001.
            Despite the improvements since 1997, the poverty rate in 2001 remained at twice the levels of
  1995. In addition, recent improvements in welfare have not been shared broadly across the population.
  There are "pockets o f poverty" among certain groups, particularly the unemployed, ethnic minorities,
  most notably Roma, and families with more than four children.           Poverty also has a significant rural
  dimension. Urban areas have experienced a more significant drop inpoverty levels, from 34 to 6 percent,
  while inrural areas, poverty rates were less than halved, from 41 percent to 24 percent.
            While comparable estimates for 2002 and 2003 are not yet available, there are some signs that
  poverty may be further declining as a result o f the large social safety net and strong GDP growth. The
  number of the unemployed is decreasing while household incomes are rising. The average 2003
  unemployment rate declined by 3.5 percentage points compared to 2002 and stood at 14.3 percent. This
  dramatic decline may be attributed to accelerated economic growth and net employment generation inthe
  private sector, supported by the introduction o f the new three-year active labor market program that
  started in 2003. The new program, From Social Assistance to Employment, covers mainly long-term
  unemployed and includes provision o f public sector jobs at minimumwage to 100,000 unemployed. So
  far 87,000 unemployed on average have found jobs under the program, and the number o f long-term
  unemployed has decreased by more than one quarter since end 2002. At the same time, household
  incomes rose in real terms by 18.8 percent in 2002 after declining for two consecutive years. This
  increase may be attributed to hgher incomes from agriculture family plots as a result o f favorable weather
  conditions. This suggests that household incomes o f rural families, which represent another vulnerable
  group, may also have improved.

19.      Social protection reforms helped the poor cope with transition shocks, but the
effectiveness of the system and its sustainability both need to be strengthened further. The
government has strengthened means-tested social benefits, improved targeting o f benefits to the
most vulnerable individuals and households, and reduced duplicative benefit programs.
Institutional and administrative capacity and financing within the social assistance system have
been strengthened. Licensing requirements, contractual and funding transfer arrangements and
minimumstandardsfor delivery of social care services byNGOsandthe private sector havebeen
specified. Nonetheless, there is scope for improving the effectiveness o f existing programs by
strengthening the administration o f social assistance delivery, tightening the eligibility criteria,
reducing leakage and social exclusion, and improving means-testing.

20.      Persistently high unemployment has finally started to decline as a result of
accelerated growth and net employment generation in the private sector, supported by
active labor market programs. At about 18 percent in 2000-2002, the unemployment rate in
Bulgaria was one o f the highest in the region.          However, since the beginning o f 2003
unemployment in Bulgaria has declined dramatically, reaching 13.5 percent in December 2003.
Private sector job creation has picked up, with private sector employment growing by close to
70,000 inthe first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in2002. It should be noted,
however, that part of this growth could be explainedby the introduction o fmandatoryregistration
of labor contracts, which may have surfaced some labor previously in the informal sector. In
addition the 2003 program From Social Assistance to Employment envisaged providing public
sector jobs to 100,000 long-term unemployed. In the medium term, with the completion o f
privatization of remaining large SOEs, and continuing restructuring o f the enterprise sector, the
government will need to devote particular attention to maintaining the flexibility o f the labor
market, reducing the heavy social contributions, and improvingthe skills mix.

21.      The government realizes that itwill be important for it to focus on improving access
to both education and health for vulnerable groups in line with its approach to meeting the
MillenniumDevelopment Goals (see Box 2). Despite growing enrollment rates, the attendance
rates especially for children from vulnerable households in rural areas and among ethnic
minorities have declined below 1995 levels, particularly for preschool and secondary education.
Inadditionto the highcostsofeducation for the poorhouseholds, there is evidence that they also
face barriers to accessing health care, because of the prevalence of formal and informal out-of-
pocket payments and gaps inhealthinsurance coverage for uninsuredgroups. As inthe case with
education, Roma are more likely to fall through the cracks o f the health system than other groups
because of lack o f necessaryidentification and registration papers, and poor communication with
healthproviders which is compounded by social exclusion.

22.      The external position has remained under pressure, with the external current
account deficit growing rapidly in 2003 driven by strong domestic demand for raw
materials and investment goods. The external current account deficit almost doubled in2003 to
about 8.4 percent" o f GDP compared to 2002. Fueled by rapidly expanding domestic credit,
merchandise imports grew by 14.2 percent (ineuro terms), outpacing significantly the continuing
strong growth in exports, which increased by 9.9 percent. While favorable interest rates have
contained the increase ininterest payments, income paid to foreign direct investors has increased
by 50 percent compared to 2002. Nevertheless, FDIinflows, includingnon-privatization related
flows, have increased significantly compared to 2002. FDI inflows o f more than 7 percent of
GDP, together with the continuing repatriation of bank assets heldabroad, provided the bulk of
the financing o f the external current account deficit in2003. Foreign exchangereservesremained

at a comfortable level, covering about five months o f imports o f goods and services. At the same
time, total external debt (public and private) has declined by about 38 percentage points since
1997, to 63 percent of GDP at end2003."

23.      Sound macroeconomic policies and continued progress on structural reforms are
addressing current account imbalances and improving development prospects. Bulgaria's
policy framework is centered on the CBA and supported by tight fiscal policy, strict incomes



'IThe external debt to GDP ratio declined significantly due to a series o f debt buybacks, debt exchanges,
limited new borrowing and slow disbursement of projects inthe pipeline, as well as higher GDP growth
and exchange rate adjustments. The external debt to GDP ratio of 63 percent of GDP for 2003 is a
preliminary number from the macro framework agreed with the IMF as shown inthe February 2004 IMF
Board documents. As at April 2004, the BulgarianNational Bank was estimating this ratio at 58.7 percent.

policy and a broad agenda of structural reforms. Macroeconomic performance has been robust:
Bulgaria has had a primary surplus o f 2-3 percent of GDP and a fiscal deficit of less than one
percent o f GDP since 1999; the Fiscal ReserveAccount (FRA) has remainedat about 100 percent
of the next year's gross public debt service requirements; inflation has remained at single digit
levels; internationalreserveshave remainedat about five months o f imports; and growth has been
between 4-5 percent per year. Total public debt, external and domestic, has declineddramatically
from over 100 percent in 1997 to below the Maastricht criterion'* and stands at 46.2 percent o f
GDP in end 2003, of which external was 41.4 percent and domestic debt accounted for 4.8
percent o f GDP.

24.      Providedthe government maintains fiscal discipline, sustains a strict incomespolicy,
and acceleratesstructural reformsto secure sustained improvementsin competitiveness,the
CBA provides a stable nominal anchor and facilitates the political economy of reform.
Prudent macroeconomic policies and implementation o f structural reforms have contributed to
improved economic performance in 2003 (see Figures 1 to 6).                    Bulgaria shows stronger
fundamentals in 2003 compared to 2002: despite slow growth in the EU and other economic
partners, Bulgaria's economic growth remains solid, the inflation rate declined further, the
unemployment rate reached four-year record lows, while fiscal accounts are balanced. However,
the widening external current account deficit and the rapid growth in domestic credit are
increasing the vulnerability to risks. To respond to the deterioration o f the external current
account balance, the government agreed with the Fundunder the two-year Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA)13to save the revenue overperformance and achieve a balanced budget in 2003 instead o f
the budgeted 0.7 percent overall fiscal deficit. BNBhas in addition undertaken several measures
to limit further credit expansion and to safeguard the health of the financial system, including
reclassificationo f bank loan portfolios through reducing the period for classifying loans as losses
from 120 to 90 days; increasing the number of on-site inspections; and securing expansion of the
credit registry to include all credits, not only credits o fmore than BGN 10,000.

25.      Significant but manageable external risks exist. Bulgaria faces several significant
external risks. The pressures on the externalposition are growing, supported by acceleratedbank
credit. A failure to attract sufficient greenfield FDI or cany out the remaining privatization
program would put the projected external financing at risk, requiring additional adjustment to
ensure that debt levels continued to decline. Moreover, Bulgaria's external accounts are sensitive
to three key parameters: an increase inoil prices, higher interest rates, and a prolonged slowdown
inEUeconomies which are the destination ofclose to sixtypercent ofBulgarian exports and the
origin of more than half the FDI inflows. However, the achievements to date, the continuing
goodperformance in2003, and the measuresinplace to address fiscal and externa1,vulnerabilities
mitigate these risks.




  This is according to article 104 ofthe Treaty Establishingthe EuropeanCommunity signed inMaastricht
in 1992. The convergence criterion on debt refers to the ratio of gross government debt to GDP, which
must not exceed 60 percent at the end of the preceding financial year or shall be approaching the reference
value at a satisfactory pace.
l3 The SBA was approved on February 27, 2002 and expired on March 15, 2004.                 Currently the
Government and the IMFare discussing a new 2-year precautionary program. The Government has agreed
to limit fiscal deficit (based on accrual accounting) to not more than ?4percent of GDP in 2004, and
proposed measures to withdraw liquidity from the banking system by transferring to BNB government
deposits heldwith domestic commercial banks.

Medium Term Prospects

26.       The medium term macroeconomic f r a m e ~ o r kcentered on the CBA is expected to
                                                               ' ~
support rapid and sustainable economic growth in the coming years. The medium term
o ~ t l o o k 'envisages robust growth o f about 5 percent per annum, a gradual narrowing o f the
               ~
external current account deficit, and a reduction in debt to GDP ratios. Growth would be driven
by a continuous rise in investment and improved export performance in line with the expected
recovery in external demand from EU and increased competitiveness o f Bulgarian goods on
international markets.       Consistent with the planned upgrades in infrastructure sectors and
continued progress towards EU accession, investment i s likely to grow at a higher speed and
reach at least 23 percent o f GDP in2006. Despite the continuing slow growth among Bulgaria's
main trade partners so far, macroeconomic performance has been good and is expected to
improve further in 2004-06 as EU economies may start their recovery and the cumulative effect
o f structural reforms inBulgariabecomes more visible.

27.       FDI inflows continue to be the primary source of balance of payments financing.
FDIinflows inBulgaria show a significant increase in2003, providingsufficient coverage of the
external current account deficit. For the first time FDIinflows in2003 exceeded US$1.4 billion
or more than 7 percent o f GDP. About US$0.4billionwere receipts from privatization, mainly o f
DSKBank, with the rest mainly from green-field investments andinvestments inalready existing
companies. In 1998-2003, FDI inflows amounted to close to US$5.4 billion, the bulk o f which
were in the service sector (65 percent)     - mainly financial services, trade and tourism. About
US$1.6 billion were invested in industry in this period - mainly oil-processing, chemicals, food,
metal and non-metal mineral products. Plannedprivatization inthe energy sector, and expected
completion of the Bulgartabak and Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC) transactions,
together with additional investments, such as those projectedinthe energy sector, are, when taken
together with expected greenfield investments, likely to help Bulgaria meet its financing needs.
The returns from foreign direct investment inthe country have been growing and a further boost
ininvestments ispossible ifthe remaining structural and institutionalimpedimentsare addressed,
includingweaknesses inthe business climate, the public administration, andthejudicial system.

28.       International financialmarkets have respondedfavorably to the achievements of the
reform program. In the summer o f 2003, Standard and Poor's, Fitch, and Moody's upgraded
Bulgaria's credit rating, with the first two rating agencies assigning investment grade rating to
long-term local currency debt. Spreads o f Brady and Euro bonds are continuing to decline - in
December 2003 they went down compared to end-2002 by 119 and 95 basis points respectively.
Active debt management policies in 2001 and 2002 through debt buybacks and exchanges have
reduced debt levels and reduced interest and exchange rate risks o f the debt portfolio. InMarch
2002, the government exchanged US$1,319 million Brady Bonds. The exchange resultedina net
present value savings o f US$94 million and released a collateral o f about US$220 million. In
September 2002, the government reduced further the share o f Brady Bonds in total debt by
exchanging US$866 million for global bonds, and released another US$140 million o f collateral.
As a result, the external public debt stock is estimated to have declinedby US$l08 million. The
total external debt has fallen significantly since the beginning o f 2003. By end 2003, total
external debt stood at 63 percent o f GDP and is expected to decline further due to the sharp
reduction of external public debt.

29. The current course of fiscal policy is basically appropriate to ensure macroeconomic
stability, growth and poverty reduction in the medium term. The main fiscal challenge,

budget inthe medium-term, while lowering the overall tax burden - especially payroll taxes - to
however, is to work towards an improved allocation of expendituresI6 to achieve a balanced

boost investment and employment, and reduce external indebtedness. So far fiscal adjustment
has been made possible by revenue expansion rather than expenditure rationalization. Only
recently, revenues have started to decline, reflecting the gradual reduction o f the tax burden. To
limit revenue losses from future tax cuts, the tax administration needs to be overhauled and tax
compliance improved. A decade long neglect o f investment in basic infrastructure has been
exacerbatedby several years o f declining capital and maintenance expenditures which have borne
the brunt o f expenditure cuts. Going forward, fiscal adjustment will need to be achieved through
relying heavily on expenditure rationalization, whichneeds to precede reductions intax burden to
safeguard fiscal sustainability. Inaddition, the fiscal strategy will need to adjusted inresponse to
the decline in privatization revenues, a main source of fiscal financing, as the privatization
program is completed.

30. The government has improved              I   9 ,        Figure 7 :Government Expenditure
                                                                    (inpercentofGDP)
the    quality of fiscal adjustment
through achieving some rebalancing
of current and capital spending. As
shown inFigure 7, followingthe overall
decline in public spending since 1999,
capital expenditures have declined from
4.8 percent o f GDP to about 3.2 percent
in 200217    - this declining trend was
halted in 2002 and the balance between                1999    2000      2001      2002     2003p      2004

current and capital expenditures has                                                                  Budget

began to improve since then. Capital                     OMaintenance and operations mCapital expenditure
spending     has    increased     by    0.2
percentage points of GDP per year since 2002 and is budgeted at 3.6 percent in2004. Following
a request by the government, the Bank prepared an analysis o f proposed projects for motorway
construction. The study produced a number o f recommendations on priorities for medium-term
investment in this area. Improving the balance between current and capital expenditures i s also
requiringimprovementsto be secured inthe budget management of operations and maintenance.
As budget allocations to capital expenditures increase as a percentage of GDP, these will need to
be supported by adequate levels o fresources for operations and maintenance. Decisive efforts to
improve public expenditure management and management o f the public investment program are
needed, if the quantitative improvement inthe balance between current and capital expenditures
i s to acheve the desired impact on growth.

31. Improving the allocation of public expenditure requires creating an efficient and
transparent expenditure management system with enough flexibility to adjust quickly and
efficiently to macroeconomic shocks. The central key pressure points on the fiscal position are
in health care, education, and the social protection system (pension funds, social assistance
programs, and labor market policies). The recent Public Expenditure and Institutional Review
(PER) for Bulgaria" demonstrated the need to improve allocations to address the issues of

overcapacity inhealth and education, and to improve the targeting o f social protection programs,
which constitute about one-third of total public spending.

32. In addition, increased efficiency in expenditure management would require an overhaul
of intergovernmental relations.          The government approval in mid-2002 o f the Fiscal
Decentralization Programfor 2002-05 is a step forward in that direction. The program aims at
reducing the fiscal pressures arising from arrears inmunicipal finances, and improvingefficiency
in service delivery.      A recent World Bank study, Issues in Intergovernmental Relations",
identifies the need for a sustainable solution to the issue o f unfunded state mandates and
municipal arrears; the need to provide improved incentivesto deal with overcapacity inmunicipal
schools and to establish more effective mechanisms to raise resources for investment; and the
desirability o f granting greater control to municipalities over revenues inthe long-term.

33.      The government has taken a number of steps to improve public sector governance.
The govemment has put together comprehensive strategies and action plans for: (i)state
administration modernization; (ii)judicial reform; and (iii)fighting corruption.
Commissions have been set up to combat corruption - a standing committee o f the National      Two

Assembly and an inter-ministry operational commission. A number of measures have been
undertaken to strengthen control within the Tax Administration, the Customs Agency, the
Ministryofthe Interior, andthe NationalSecurity Service.

34.      With the external financing provided by the PALs, structural reforms can be
phased in while softening the impact of adjustment, protecting the poor, and safeguarding
social cohesion. Without the PAL financing, policy dialogue and support, the momentum for
accelerating structural reforms i s less likely to be sustained and the costs o f adjustment would
weighheavily on vulnerable segments o fthe population. While internationalreserves remainat a
comfortable level to support macroeconomic stability in the context of the CBA, Bulgaria will
continue to rely on official creditors' support to meet its extemal financing requirements; allow it
to start addressing a decade of neglected maintenance o f physical assetsneeded to support private
sector-led growth; and soften the impact on vulnerable groups. ContinuingBank financing under
the proposed series o f PALs o f up to US$l50 million (equivalent) per year over the three year
programperiod provides fiscal and balance o f payments support needed for the government to be
able to implement this broadreform program.

Creditworthiness

35.      Creditworthiness Indicators.        Prudent fiscal policies, implementation of structural
reforms, and an active debt management strategy have resulted in improvement o f
creditworthiness indicators (see Annex 4). Total debt outstanding and disbursed as a share o f
GDP has declined from 100 percent in 1997 to around 63 percent in2003. This share is expected
to decline to around 50 percent by 2006. Similarly, total debt service as a share o f exports o f
goods and services i s expected to decline from around 13 percent in 2002 to 10 percent in 2004,
and then increase to about 12 percent as a result o f increased repayments on Brady and Euro
bonds. The share o f debt service to lBRD to total public debt service i s expected to increase to
around 16 percent in 2004 and after that decline to 13 percent by 2006. The share o f Bulgaria's
portfolio in IBRD's portfolio is expected to remain under 1.3 percent. In addition, spreads on
Bulgaria's Brady bonds have been narrowing since the June 2001 election, reflecting prudent
policies and markets' expectation of a more active debt management strategy. The collapse o f the
CBA inArgentina and the difficulties inTurkey have not had any significant impact on this trend.

There have been no discemable contagion effects on Bulgaria's domestic financial markets, and
financial fundamentals and indicators of external vulnerability remain comfortable.

36.      IBRDexposurewill remainmanageableinthe basecase scenario of the CAS. lBRD
debt service i s projectedto remain at 1.O percent of exports, and to increase from 7 to 16percent
o f public debt service during the CAS period. The ratio o f preferred creditor debt service to
public debt service has remained above 35 percent and increased sharply in2001 and 2002. It is
projected to decline to about 42 percent in2004 before rising again to 54 percent in2006. These
high ratios are partly the result of debt restructuring in the mid-1990s which stretched out
Bulgaria's public debt repayments to private creditors over decades with the issuance o f Brady
bonds, and o f limited commercial bank lending until the strong recovery following the 1997
reforms. Continued substantial adjustment lending as envisaged in the CAS would reduce the
Bank's headroom in Bulgaria, especially for further adjustment loans beyond FY05. However,

probability to succeed - are the comerstone o f the overall Bank's strategy, high adjustment
since the three proposed PALs - designed to support a robust reform program that has a high

lending is justified, but its impact on the Bank's exposure will have to be carehlly monitored.
The additional triggers2' for processing PAL-3 identified inthe CAS were adopted to ensure that
adjustment lending would reach the proposed US$450 million level only if indicators o f
economic outcomes confirmed that Bulgaria substantially improved its standing as a result of
reforms under the first two PALs, and if the downside risks o f overall economic performance at
that time were low.



                                    B. THEREFORM            PROGRAM

Objectivesof the Government'sMedium-TermProgram


37.      The incoming government in mid-2001 identified two objectives: (a) sustaining
economic growth and @) reducing poverty and creating employment, both key to EU
membership. The agenda o f the previous govemment hadbeendriven more by dealing with the
economic and financial crisis of 1996-97, restoring the focus on macroeconomic stabilization,
accelerating the much delayed privatization program, establishing a sound fiscal regime to
support the CBA by cutting expenditures and closing non-viable SOEs, and launching the reform
of the social protection system.2' The reform program o f the current govemment builds on the
gains o f the past five years while markmg a strategic shift in emphasis towards promoting growth
and reducingpoverty to be achieved through increasing investment and productivity and building
human capital. The updated Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) i s attached as Annex 5. The
*'The following developments would trigger reconsideration o fproceeding with the presentation o f PAL-3
to the Board: (i) material deviation from the downward trend in the total public debt to GDP ratio as
projected inthe CAS; (ii) lack of improvement inthe spreads on Bulgaria's sovereign borrowing via-a-vis
countries with similar risk rating, or deterioration in its own risk rating; (iii)
                                                                                material deviation from the
improving trend inthe fiscal balance projected inthe Government's mediumterm program, reaching fiscal
balance by 2005; (iv) material slowdown in the present trend of increasing SMEs' share of total
employment; and (v) inadequate progress in reducing arrears in tax payments, social insurance
contributions, and energy billpayments as set out inthe Government program.
21 Since 1997, the Bank has supported structural reforms with a Critical Imports Rehabilitation Loan, a
Social Protection Adjustment Loan, two Finance and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loans (FESALs), two
Agriculture Structural Adjustment Loans (ASALs), and an Environmental Protection Structural Adjustment
Loan (EPSAL).

government has articulated thefollowing as the key outcomes of itsprogram: (a) achieve average
annual GDP growth rates of 4.5 to 5.0 percent during 2002-05; (b) reduce the poverty rate by
half by 2005 compared to the rate in 2001; and (e) reduce the unemployment rate to 12-14
percent in 2005 compared to 17.5 percent in 2001. The program components that address
strengthening of market institutions, modernizing the public administration,fighting corruption,
and reforming thejudicial system are all critical to the EU accession agenda.

38.     The strategy for attaining the sustained growth and poverty reduction objectives
has two main themes. First, the government intends to useprivate initiative as the main engine
of growth. For this reason, the government program focuses on creating an investment climate
that encourages private investment and enhances productivity. This requires redefining and
upgrading the role and capabilities o f the public sector, establishing credible institutions such as
the judiciary, and putting in place a stable legal and regulatory environment.           Second, the
government is taking steps to ensure that the population is empowered to participate in future
growth. The government i s worlung towards reforms in the education and health sectors, not
only to improve efficiency o f these large public expenditures, but also to develop human capital
capable of adapting to an increasingly dynamic work environment, especially with greater
competition expected from EUcountries. In addition, there is recognition that poverty reduction
policies need to be tailored to reach certain groups that have not benefited from the recent
increase inwelfare. The government realizes that growth alone will not lift certain groups out of
poverty.


39.     To implement its growth and poverty-reduction strategy, the governmenthas built
itsmediumterm reformprogram on five pillars:

    Sustaining structural reforms in the enterprise sector with emphasis on completion of
    privatization and on the restructuring o f the energy, railway, telecommunications, and water
    sectors;
    Establishing a market-friendly business environment, focusing on entry and exit policies,
    reducing regulatory costs, improving the delivery o f public services, competition, andjudicial
    reform;
    Deepening thefinancial sector, addressing the constraints to sustainable increased lendingby
    the banking system and the development o f financial markets;

    Improvingpublic sector governance, strengthening public administration capacity, improving
    service delivery, reducing corruption, strengthening accountability and transparency,
    strengthening public expenditure management, and increasing the efficiency and
    effectiveness o f thejudicial system;

    Investing in human capital and strengthening social programs, improvingquality, access and
    efficiency in education and health, continuing pension reforms, increasing social assistance
    effectiveness, providingfor better integration o f the disabledand reducing institutionalization
    of children.
Cross-cuttingThemes :Growth, Povertyand Governance

40.     The five program pillars complement each other. All five Pillars contribute to the
growth agenda. Pillars Ito I11provide for reducing the role of the state inthe economy through:
(i)completing privatization; (ii)improving efficiency o f energy, water and district heating and
securing greater private sector participation in these sectors; (iii) creating conditions to attract



                                                 15

FDIand allowing for significant growth of SMEs through deregulation; (iv) advancing tax and
customs reform; (v) reducing subsidies, e.g. to the railways, so as to free up resources to invest in
infrastructure critical for supporting investment; (vi) pursuing accounting reform; (vii)
accelerating insolvency reform; (viii) strengthening the new regulatory agencies in
telecommunications, energy, and financial services; (ix) maintaining labor market flexibility; and
(x) strengthening banking system effectiveness. Pillar IV supports this agenda through rebuilding
interactions between the private sector and public officials; increasingthe effectiveness o f capital
investments; accelerating judicial reform; and seeking to reduce corruption (thereby reducing the
rate of return investors require for investment projects). Pillar V seeks to create a longer term
capability to respond to the needs of a dynamic market economy through supporting investments
inhumancapital.

41.      All five Pillars contributeto reducingpoverty and socialexclusion. Pillars Ito I11are
designed to achieve growth with equity. Equity i s further supported through the active labor
market measures under Pillar 11. Pensions reform is pursued though Pillars I11and V. Social
impact assessments o f railways restructuring and o f Bulgartabak privatization and restructuring
are being completed by the government under PAL-2 (as was the case with energy restructuring
under PAL-1).      Pillar IV contributes to this agenda through supporting measures to reduce
corruption, particularly in education and health (which bear disproportionatelyhard on the poor);
rebuild interactions between citizens and public officials; improve public sector service delivery;
and increasethe effectiveness of the courts. Pillar V provides explicitly for improving access and
equity ineducation and health; protectingthe disabled from discrimination and allowing them full
access to education and work opportunities; achieving de-institutionalization; improving coverage
and targeting insocial assistance; andreducingdisincentives for work.

42.      All five Pillars contributeto improving governance. Pillar Iprovides for transparency
inprivatization. Pillar I1focuses on deregulation, reducing administrative discretion, developing
an effective administrative court system, strengthening competition, reducing corruption in
insolvency proceedings, and advancing tax and customs reform. Pillar I11 aims to strengthen
corporate govemance, improve the governance o f pension funds, and introduce greater
transparency through the introduction o f international accounting standards, and provides for
enactment o f the money laundering law. Pillar IV tackles a number o f specific issues relating to
public sector accountability and transparency, such as strengthening arrangements for conflict o f
interest and freedom o f information; as well improving the public administration through creating
a legislative base to secure merit and depoliticization, strengthening accountability and
transparency, and requiring the publication of service standards. Pillar IV also focuses on
accelerating judicial reforms through strengthening the accountability framework for judges.
This i s to be achieved through introducing clear provisions relating to immunity, mandate and
replaceability o fjudges. Pillar IV also supports strengtheningaccountability and transparency in
the public expenditure management system. The government's Anticorruption Program for
2004-2005 developed under PAL-2 provides a focus on tackling corruption in education and
health and inthejudiciary to complement the earlier focus on tax and customs and the Ministryo f
Interior. Pillar V aims to tackle some o f the accountability and transparency issues in the
education and healthareas including informalpayments for education andhealth services.

43.      The proposed PALSalso support the government's EU accession and integration
agenda. The PAL program complements and supports the government's efforts in building a
functioning market economy and creatingthe capacity to cope with the competitive pressures and
market forces within the EU in the medium term. Achieving the PAL program objective of
building a dynamic and competitive economy through stable macroeconomic performance, deep
structural reforms, sustainable private sector-led growth, and an improved investment climate to



                                                 16

some extent determines the degree to which Bulgaria will be able quickly to benefit from EU
accession. The PAL program also complements EU accession related efforts to strengthen and
develop the ability o f the public administration andjudicial system to implement and enforce the
acquis communautaire.

44.      The effectiveness of the above program depends on the maintenance of sound
macroeconomic policies. The govemment committed inits Memorandum o f Economic Policies
attached to the Letter o f Intent to the IMF dated February 12, 2002 to: (a) maintain the CBA at
least until accession to the EU; and (b) implement a cautious and flexible fiscal policy, which i s
key to safeguarding extemal viability under the CBA. The govemment is aware of the
importance o f structural reforms to sustained macroeconomic stabilization. During discussions
on the new IMF program held from March 25-April 13, 2004 the govemment confirmed its
commitment to implement sound macroeconomic policies to address extemal vulnerabilities.

Pillar 1: Sustaining Structural Reforms

45.      The government program in Pillar 1 aims to rationalize the role of the state by
privatizing activities that can be performed by the private sector. The govemment also aims
to improve the efficiency o f energy services and prepare the energy sector for EU accession; to
improve the efficiency o f the railway sector and secure a decrease in railway subsidies; and to
liberalize the telecommunications market; modemize the water sector; and mitigate
environmental risks.

46.      Bulgaria has completed the divestiture of around 95 percent of non-infrastructure
SOEs.2' In addition, with the sale of the State Savings Bank (DSK) in 2003, about 98
percent of the assets of the banking system and 100 percent of the insurance sector are now
in private hands.23 The next phase of privatization involves the restructuring of the energy,
railway, and water sectors with the objective o f improving efficiency o f service delivery through
securing greater private sector investment and involvement within a fi-amework o f market rules
that ensure fair competition. Under PAL-2 the govemment sought to complete privatization or
liquidation of a number o f large SOEs, notably Bulgartabak (see Box 3); and to complete
privatization of 50 percent o f remaining small SOEs as o f September 30, 2002. There is now a
new strategy in place for completing the privatization o f Bulgartabak through the Bulgartabak
Holding selling its daughter companies through a process o f individual privatizations.              Non-
saleable entities are to be restructuredliquidated. The bulk o f these transactions are expected to
have been completed by end December 2004. The PAL-2 Second Tranche Conditions for the
secondtranche o fUS$25 million equivalentrequire significant progress to have been achieved on
Bulgartabak privatization and satisfactory progress to have been achieved on Bulgartabak
restructuringAiquidations.      The govemment i s under PAL-2 undertaking social impact
assessments of Bulgartabak privatization and restructuring and of railways restructuring; and is
ensuring that the reforms continue to be implementedincompliance with environmentalpolicies.
By end-2005, the only remaining state enterprises will be those listed in Annex 6A, reducing the
size of thepublic sector to about 25-30percent of GDP.




22 Privatization performance is measured on the basis o f value o f long term assets o f non-infrastructure
SOEs as o f end-1995.
23The two remaining non-private banks - the Business PromotionBank and the Municipal Bank majority
owned by the Sofia municipality-account for 2.5 percent o fbank assets as end-2003.

 Box 3 :Bulgartabak Privatization

          Bulgartabak is a vertically integratedholding comprising 22 companies in Bulgaria and 8
 cigarette producing companies in neighboring countries. While Bulgartabak is not loss-making
 and does not represent a fiscal drain, its privatization is important as a sign of government resolve
 to maintain an attractive investment climate, particularly as this privatization has been outstanding
 for a number of years. The original privatization strategy envisaged the sale of Bulgartabak
 Holding as one company. Inthe end it proved difficult to identify a buyer for such a complex and
 diversified entity and the procedurewhich hadbeen launchedin July 2002 was finally cancelledin
 April 2003.

          Based on the experience from the failed procedure the government re-considered its
 strategy and developed a new approachfor privatization of the companies inBulgartabak Holding
 basedon selling saleable companies either individually or inpackages; while moving to restructure
 and liquidate non-saleable companies. The government will under its new strategy not require
 commitments for the purchase of pre-agreed volumes of tobacco from local producers. The new
 strategy was endorsed by the Council of Ministers inOctober 2003 and approved by the National
 Assembly inDecember 2003. On October 7, 2003 the shareholders meeting introduced a two tier
 management structure for BulgartabakHolding. The ManagementBoard of the company was also
 restructuredto introducea representativeofminority shareholders.

          Following the approval of the strategy by the National Assembly, the Holding selected in
 March2004 through competitive tender an international consultant/fmancial adviser to assist the
 Holding with the implementation of the strategy. By end July 2003 the consultant is expectedto
 recommendto the Holding the specific approachand sequencing to be followed inthe privatization
 ofthe companies within the BulgartabakHolding, including any pre-privatization measures; and to
 propose a Restructuring Strategy for approval by the Supervisory Board of the Holding. It is
 expectedthat by end 2004 the majority of saleable entities of the Bulgartabak Holding will have
 been sold, and that implementation of the restructuringAiquidationplan for non-saleable entities
 will be inline with the timescalesinthe approvedRestructuringStrategy.




47.      The government program in the energy sector aims to reduce Bulgaria's energy
intensityand to enable the privatesector to assumean increasingshare ofcommercialrisks.
Under PAL-2 the government continued the process o f rationalizing energy prices to cover costs
and eliminate cross-subsidies by substantially raising electricity and heating prices on July 1,
2003. To improve the legal and regulatory framework, under PAL-2 the government secured the
enactment o f the new Energy Act consistent with EU energy directives, adopted key sector
regulations and market opening measures, and upgraded the institutional capacity o f the State
Energy Regulatory Commission. The distribution companies are also in the process o f being
privatized to strategic investors. Substantial progress has been made in the elimination o f price
distortions and cross-subsidies in the electricity sector following price adjustments of 20 percent
in 2002, 15 percent in 2003, and 10 percent in 2004. The government is also under PAL2
continuing to implement its District Heating Strategy, which involves commercialization
measures in the short term and securing greater private sector involvement and participation in
the medium term. Subsidies to district heating companies were reduced from 50 million leva in
2001 to 45 million leva in 2003 and to 24.3 million leva in 2004, with these subsidies planned to
be eliminated with effect from July 2004. By end 2003, energy consumption to GDP had been
reduced by 13 percent compared to the 2001 level. The energy reforms are expected to reduce
Bulgaria's energy consumptionto GDP by 15percent in 2005 comparedto the level in 2001.

48.      In the railway sector, the government's restructuring program aims to increase
efficiency, ensure financial sustainability, and improve staff productivity, while significantly
decreasing subsidies to the railways sector. The Railway Law passed in November 2000
provides the legalbasis for the implementation o f the program. This entailedthe establishment of
a new railway operating company and a new railway infrastructure State enterprise. Under PAL-
2, the railways operating and infrastructure companies made some progress on developing sound
medium-term business plans. 199 lulometers o f loss-making services were terminated in 2003
under PAL-2, and the railway labor force was reducedby almost 10percent compared to the level
at end 2001. The Ministry of Transport and Communications developed also under PAL-2 a
revised strategy for restructuring o f the railways. The cost-recovery level o f intercity passenger
services reached 67 percent in 2003, with cost recovery for international services reaching 66
percent. Progress was also made under PAL-2 through identifying the non-commercial services
to be subject to the planned Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts and preparing the
framework contract for PSOs. By 2005, the railway companies will secure reduced losses,
improve the condition of the rail network, and partially renew the rolling stock. By end 2004, the
railway labor force will be reduced by 20percent compared to the end-2001 level and by end
2005 the railway operating company will have achieved aJinancial working ratio of I05percent
(before subsidies and PSO payments). By end 2005, operating subsidies (excluding loans and
grantsfor investment) will be reducedfrom 0.5percent of GDPin 2000 to 0.2 percent of GDP.

49.      In the telecommunications sector, markets have been liberalized consistentwith the
government's EU accession agreement.             Under PAL-2, the government after significant
difficulties signed inFebruary 2004 a Share Purchase Agreement with Viva Ventures for the sale
o f 65 percent of the shares o f the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC).             A new
TelecommunicationsLaw was passedunder PAL-2 by the National Assembly in September 2003.
This new law replaces the Telecommunications Law o f December 2001 and is consistent with
best practice and with the government's EU accession agreement. The new Law reinforces the
Communications       Regulation    Commission's        (CRC)  independence,    transparency,    and
accountability; secures the liberalization o f the telecommunications market; and ensures effective
and fair competition. The program for the institutional strengthening o f the CRC continuedto be
implemented under PAL-2, including ensuring its financial independence. Also under PAL-2 the
government continued its efforts towards promulgating legislation providing for the legal
recognition of electronic contracts and personal data protection in electronic communications.
The government remains committed to implementing its time-bound EUaccession commitments.
As at early 2004, telephone connectiontime for new applications was less than one month. Also
by early 2004 the number of households with Internet access had risen to 94 percent. Under
P A L 3 the government will complete the analysis o f competition in the market launched under
PAL-2..This will be an input to the government fine-tuning its policies with respect to
implementation o f its commitments to the EU; implementation of the new Telecommunications
Law; and will provide the government with an up to date assessment o f the presefit position with
respect to the extent o f broadband access and competition, indirect access, and provision o f
universal access. This analysis will form the basis o f an updated sector policy and action plan
also to be approved under PAL-3. By the end of 2005, the government goals are to achieve a
degree of digitalization of transfer network of 100 percent, of exchanges 82 percent, and of
subscribers capacity 46 percent; to secure the number of households with telecommunication
services allowing internet access at 94percent; and to ensure that telephoneconnection waiting
time will not exceedonemonth.

50.       In the water sector, the government's modernization program seeks to address the
problems of inefficiency, water losses, and lack of investment through securing greater
private sector involvement and participation. The water service providers cover 98.4 percent


                                                   19

of the population which means that access is not a major issue. Under PAL-2 the planned
concession transactions for Varna and Shumen were replaced with alternative arrangements for
securing private sector participation in the management o f municipal water companies. The
government under PAL-2 developed the framework for a water regulator (water supply and
sewage services) to ensure that quality services can be provided at affordable prices. Further,
under PAL-2 a Water Sector Strategy has been prepared and approved by the government, with
particular focus on water supply and sewage.           Securing private sector involvement and
participationina number of the regional water companies will now be actioned under PAL-3. By
end-2005, thegovernment expects to have secured a reduction of the operating ratios (the ratio of
operating costs including depreciation to total revenues) of Water Companies to 80percent.

51.      The government is continuing its momentum in environmental reforms to meet the
challenges of EU accession compliance to environmental acquis. Environmental laws and
regulations continue to be harmonized with those o f the EU. The capacity o f environmental
institutions and agencies to enforce environmental laws and regulations is being strengthened.
Under PAL-2 the government sought to implement the provisions of the EUIntegrated Pollution
Prevention and Control (IPPC)Directive, and to extend the issuance of integrated permits. Sixty
integrated environmentalpermits hadbeen prepared by March 2004. The government also under
PAL-2 developed and issued the regulation on Environmental Impact Assessment.                The
government will under PAL-3 develop a Natural Resource Management Strategy which will
ensure that land, forests and biological resources are used inan environmentally sustainable way.
By end-2005, the government goal is to have issued 225 integrated environmentalpermits under
the IPPC directive and by end-2007, to have issued permits to all enterprises covered by the
IPPC directive.

Pillar 2: Establishing a Market-friendly BusinessEnvironment

52.      While the liquidation of loss-making SOEs and the implementation of the
privatization program has increased productivity, future growth will depend on the
emergence of dynamic private sector enterprises.             Experience in advanced transition
economies indicates that gains from further labor shedding and other defensive restructuring
measures will taper off over time. New sources o f growth will have to come from increased
investment by the private sector in both new as well as existing enterprises. The government
program aims to expand private sector activity through attracting FDIand developing a dynamic
SME sector. To achieve this, the government program inPillar IIaims to reduce entry constraints
and regulatory costs, improve business service delivery by government offices, ensure
competition and functioning markets, maintain flexibility in the labor market, and improve the
efficiency of the insolvency regime. The SME share in employment increased to 53.8 percent in
2002 from 50.6 percent in2000; and SME share invalue added increased to 34.2 percent in 2002
from 29.5 percent in 2000. With these reforms, the government aim is to attract FDI at an
average annual rate of US$ 1.0 billion (of which greenfield FDI is expected to be at least 50
percent) during 2002-05; by 2005 to increase the share of S M E S ~in~ value added and
employment to at least 50 percent; by 2005 to increase the private sector share of GDP to 70
percent; and during the period 2002-2005 to increase total factor productivity by 2.5 percent
annually.

53.      The government continues to implement its program to streamline the regulatory
regimes that affect business entry and increase transaction costs for the private sector. At
the start o f the PAL program the Inter-ministerial Working Group for the Optimization o f


24Definedas enterprises with 100or less employees.


                                                 20

Regulatory Regimes reviewed all 360 centrally-managed regulatory regimes and approved a
program eliminating 71 and modifying 121 of these regimes by end 2004. Under PAL-2, 52 o f
these regimes have been eliminated (higher than the PAL-2 benchmark target o f 40); and 92
modified (significantly higher than the PAL-2 benchmark target o f 50). The government has also
taken steps to ensure that the introduction o f future regulatory regimes i s based on a clear
rationale and a proper analysis o f costs and benefits, and includes appropriate consultation with
affectedstakeholders. To control the future development o f regulatory regimes, under PAL-2 the
government developed the Law on Administrative Regulation and Administrative Control on
Economic Activities which has been enacted by the National Assembly. This defines the
principles which are to underpin the introduction o f new regimes and to guide government
actions. The CoM has under PAL-2 prepared specific guidelines to central administrativebodies
on the design o f proposed new regulatory regimes, including the need for identification and
measurement of costs and benefits and the establishment o f a process by which new regimes
evolve appropriately from concept to implementation. An Internet-based public register o f all
current operative regulatory regimes was also developed under PAL-2. The regulatory reform
agenda is far from being exhausted : under PAL-3 sector-specific and municipal regulations will
also be reviewed.

54.      A draft of the Law on the Bulstat Register has been prepared under PAL-2. This
followed the completion o f the preparatory work for resolving the technical issues concerning the
introduction of the unified business identification number. The enactment o f the Law and the
implementation o f comprehensive business registration reformprovidingfor the establishment of
an efficient administrative, electronic, and accessible registry will be completed under PAL-3.
The government's "Report on the State Administration for 2002" revealed a decrease o f 21
percent inadministrative services being undertaken by the central state administration inthe area
of regulatory regimes for 2002 compared to 2001; the comparable reduction for municipal
administrations was only 1.8 percent. By end-2005, the government objective is for at least 50
percent of the current regulatory regimes to have either been eliminated or mod$ed, thereby
signijicantly reducing the regulatory costs to businesses comparedto the 2002 baselinefigure (as
measured by the fivst completed Administrative and Regulatory Cost Survey (ARCS), and as
updated by the secondARCS survey, being undertaken under PAL-2, and which was launched in
December 2003).

55.       In parallel to regulatory reform, the government continued under PAL-2 to
implement reforms to front line government offices and agenciesto improve service delivery
and increase effectiveness and cost effectiveness. For those regulatory regimes that are
considered following review still to be required, the cost of compliance is beingreduced through
simplifyingthese regimes' administrative processes. Simplification measureshave under PAL-2
been initiated inthree sectors, construction, tourism, and food processing, which together account
for about 10 percent of GDP. The government has under PAL-2 piloted a performance standard
monitoring system in government offices that deal with construction and labor services, and
intends to expand the monitoring system to other offices dealing directly with the private sector
under PAL-3. One stop shop service delivery systems, including service performance standards
and arrangements for their monitoring, were under PAL-2 introduced on a pilot basis in five
central administrative structures and six regional administrations; and are to be rolled out
throughout the administration under PAL-3.

56.       The government has also moved ahead under PAL-2with tax and customs reforms.
It initiated the replication of measuresadopted at the TTSFE pilot sites at agreedborder crossing
points and internal customs offices. These are to be rolled out under PAL-3. DuringPAL-2 the
government also initiatedthe establishment o f the National Revenue Agency. The government i s


                                                 21

reviewing and prioritizing information system changes, which will enable under PAL-3 the
integration of all corporate and govemment revenue information. By 2005,front line government
offices are expected to achieve a 90percentperformance against standards during theyear.

57.      The government remains committed to creating a level playing field and functioning
markets and to strengthening the effectiveness of the institutional arrangements for
protecting the competitive environment. To improve the effectiveness of the Commission for
the Protection of Competition (CPC), under PAL-2 the govemment encouraged the further
upgrading of the capacity o f the CPC, supported by a technical assistance grant from the EC. By
end 2005 the government hopes to be able to have secured an increase in competitiveness of the
private sector compared to theposition in 2002.

58.     The government intends to maintain and continue (and where possibleto increase)
labor market flexibility and to further reduce unemployment, including the share of the
long term unemployed. The government's program includes: deregulation o f labor relations
through changes to the Labor Code; and devolution o f responsibility for determining labor
relations to the social partners, while making provision for appropriate representation o f
employers and employees in formal tri-partite bodies.              The govemment has under PAL-2
approved and submitted to the National Assembly amendments to the Labor Code to strengthen
anti-discrimination provisions, particularly important given that a disproportionate share of the
unemployed are from minorities. A general framework law has also been passedto help prevent
discriminati~n~~.Under PAL-3 the government will seek to enhance the scope and quality o f
employment services, such as job search assistance and counseling, by removing regulatory and
bureaucratic barriers for private service provision and by introducing the one stop shop approach
to the public employment services. The govemment has changed its approach to monitoring and
evaluating the outcomes and net impacts o f employment programs, including the From Social
Assistance to Employment program, to focus on outcomes and net impacts rather than inputs.
Also under PAL-2, the government put in place measures to ensure an improvement in the
representativeness of parties in the tri-partite arrangements. By end 2005, the aim is to have
achieved a reduction in unemployment, in the share of long-term unemployed, and in youth
unemployment, and an increase in the employment rate (based on laborforce surveys).

59.      To facilitate the exit of non-viable enterprises, the government has sought to
complete a number of initiatives to accelerate the insolvency process. Under PAL-2 it
launched an overhaul o f the Civil Procedure Code to streamline the cumbersome procedures that
cause delay ininsolvency proceedings and indisposal o f assets under liquidation. It also secured
under PAL-2 amendments to Part IV of the Commercial Code. The government has also under
PAL-2 moved to secure implementation of the more stringent criteria for the licensing and
dismissal of trustees, and strengthen their monitoring and control by the Ministry o f Justice and
the courts. Finally, institutional reforms in the judiciary, discussed in Pillar IV, are intended to
upgrade the skills o f execution judges and improve the efficiency o f court administration. The
government aims to secure a reduction in the average processing timefor insolvency cases by
2005from 3.8years in 2003 towards levels in other advanced transition economies.

Pillar 3: Deepening the Financial System

60.     Bulgaria has almost completed banking reform, and financial intermediation is
beginning to increase. About 98 percent o fbanking assets are now inprivate ownership, mainly
by foreign financial institutions, as a result of the aggressive privatization program in 1999-2001


25This aims to prevent discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, race, religion, age and gender.


                                                   22

and the privatization o f the State Savings Bank DSK completed in2003 under PAL-2. The legal
and institutional framework for lending i s being improved to encourage financial intermediation.
M2to GDPincreasedto anestimated 47 percent ofGDP in2003 comparedto 43 percent in2002
and 42 percent in2001. Credit to the private sector increased to an estimated 27 percent of GDP
in2003 from 19percent in2002. Realcredit to the private sector increasedby almost 43 percent
in 2003 compared to 2002. The supervision powers of the BNB have been strengthened under
PAL-2 to enable BNB to identify and investigate direct and indirect owners o f banks. Under
PAL-2 amendments to the Law on Registered Pledges were enacted. The Accountancy Act and
the Independent Financial Audit Act were enacted under PAL-2 to bring current standards up to
international standards thus improving the quality o f financial information. Bulgaria has enacted
under PAL-2 the Law on Measures Against Terrorist Financing and amended the Law on
Measures Against Money Laundering in line with international standards and good practices. By
2005, the government's objectives are to see theM2/GDP ratio increasefrom 42 percent in 2001
to 50percent; to achieve an increase in private sector loans to GDPfrom 15percent at end-2001
to levels which are sustainable and in line with those in advanced transition economies, while
maintaining prudential standards. By end-2003, the private sector share of banking assets is
expected to be about 9 8 p e r ~ e n t . ~ ~

61.      The authorities are taking measuresto stimulate capital markets. The development
o f the pension fund and insurance sectors is intended to mobilize long term savings which could
be invested in long term financial instruments in the market. Under PAL-2 the authorities
achieved a significant strengthening o f the governance structures o f private pension funds. By
end 2003, the combined pension fund portfolio had reached 1.5 percent of GDP.                    The
Commercial Code has been amended under PAL-2 and the Law on Public Qjfering of Securities
has been amended to address deficiencies in minority shareholder protection and to strengthen
corporate governance provisions. The Financial Supervision Commissionhas been established to
oversee regulation and supervision of securities markets, insurance companies, and pension
funds. Also, the Consultative Council for Financial Stability, a separatebody of senior officials
from all financial services supervisory agencies, has been established to ensure proper
coordination and development o f a system-wide perspective in assessing and dealing with risk
and vulnerability. By end 2004, the program outcomes are for the combined pension fund
portfolio to reach 2 percent of GDP; also by end 2004, for the pension fund portfolio rate of
return to be higher than real wagegrowth and state bondyields.
Pillar 4: Improving Public Sector Governance

62.      The government has made strong progress under PAL-2 in developing and
implementingits broad program to improve public sector governance. This has included
developing and beginning the implementation o f programs to reform and strengthen the capacity
o f the public administration, to improve service delivery, to strengthen public expenditure
management, to reduce corruption, and to pursue fundamentaljudicial reform.

63.      The government's program to improve publicsector governanceis at a muchearlier
stagethan its programof structural reforms2':under PAL-2 the main objectivehas beento
put in place the policy, institutional and legislative base for improved public sector
governance. This policy and legislative base really begins to be implemented under PAL-3.
Many o f the outcomes of the program to improve public sector governance will only be achieved


26The MunicipalBank (owned bythe municipality of Sofia) and the Business Promotion Bank will be the
only remaining non-private sector banks, and these two banks accounted for only 2.5 percent of banking
assets as of end2003.
27These were the main focus of Bank support not only under PAL-1 but also FESAL-1 and FESAL-2.


                                                  23

over the period 2005 to 2007. This represents a wholly realistic timescale, and i s fully in line
with practice and experience from OECD countries. Similar issues arise in some of the Pillar V
reform areas. It should be borne in mind that the typical timescale in OECD countries from
policy analysis through policy development to the start of implementation for a major reform is
typically around four years. When developing and launching such reforms in the context of a
three year timescale, as i s the case with the present PAL Program, care needs to be taken when
attempting to evaluate the impact o f these reforms over a comparatively short-term timescale.
The mainreformoutcomes can be expected only to be achieved over a medium-term timescale.

64.       The governmenthas developed a comprehensiveapproachto public administration
reform and has under PAL-2 approved an updated medium-term public administration
reform strategy and action plan the Strategyfor State Administrative Modernization -from
                                      -
Accession to Integration. The govemment has under PAL-2 implemented a rigorous system for
monitoring the outcomes o f the public administration reformprogram, and has published the first
set o f results inits third annual report on the functioning o f the public administration. A Council
for State Administration Modernizationhas been created to coordinate the implementation o f the
Strategy. Three working groups were set up under the Council dealing with central government
reform, local and regional government reform and service delivery, in particular e-governance.
The working groups under the Council include the participation of external experts and NGOs,
such as the Association of Municipalities. This i s intended to ensure the creation o f a broader
participatory process on issues of administrative reform. PAL-3 will include rigorous monitoring
by the government of the outcomes achieved as it begins to secure the implementation of this
ambitious program in areas such as merit; depoliticization; the implementation o f performance
related pay; the restructuring of government through the implementation of functional review
recommendations; and measuring the performance achieved by government ministries and
agencies against service standards By the end of 2006, the government's objectives arefor the
civil service at all levels of government to be increasingly based on merit; to be depoliticized; to
display a service and performance orientation; to have strong internal and external
accountability frameworks; to be based on appropriate structures and be of appropriate size; to
be competitively remunerated so as to be able to avoid serious recruitment and retention
problems; and to have administrative capacity developed to an appropriate levelfor all key areas
of EUaccessionand integration.

65.      The policy and legislative framework for a merit-based and depoliticized civil
service hasbeenputinplaceunder PAL,-2. This framework became effective with effect from
January 1, 2004.         The government has sought under PAL-2 to strengthen merit and
depoliticization by completing in October 2003 a set o f major amendments o f the Civil Service
Law and by developing also a set o f amendments to the Law on State Administration. The
amended Civil Service Law provides for the introduction o f mandatory competitive selection for
new entrants to the civil service. Inaddition good progress was made on the gradual conversion
o f posts in the general administration from labor contracts to civil service status through the
implementation o f the new classifier o f positions in the state administration.            Secondary
legislation to define the detailed procedures and mechanisms for competitive recruitment have
been developed under PAL-2. Secondary legislation has also been developed to specify the
criteria to be used in internal competitive recruitment processes for posts that are to be filled
internally from within the administration without external competition. Over the period January
1, 2004 to April 26, 2004, 439 competitive recruitment processes were launched under the
provisions of the amended Civil Service Law. This compares to 164 competitive recruitment
exercises over the whole of 2003 (out o f a total of 1,592 recruitment exercises completed inthat
year); and 137 competitive recruitment exercises in the whole o f 2002 (out o f a total o f 941
recruitment exercises completed inthat year).



                                                   24

66.      The draft amendments to the State Administration Law prepared under PAL-2
provide for clarification of the role and position of cabinets inthe state administration. This
i s intended to clarify the distinction between political positions in the cabinets o f Ministers, and
civil service positions inthe state administration. By end 2006, the civil service is intended to be
merit-based; depoliticized; and rules-based; as demonstrated through monitoring of positions
filled though competitive recruitment; the results of repeat public officials surveys; demonstrated
low turnover at change of government or change of Minister; and monitoring of numbers and
locations and changes inpolitical appointees.

67.      Under PAL-2 the government put in place a merit and performance based rewards
and career advancement system.              A comprehensive performance appraisal system was
introduced inall core ministries from January 1,2003 and the first round o f appraisals completed
by end 2003. Pay reform measures have been initiated under PAL-2, and under PAL-3 the
government plans to complete the introduction o f the new system o f performance-related pay and
career advancement developed under PAL-2, linked to the results o f the performance appraisal
system. Under PAL-3 the government intends to make progress in malung civil service pay in
areas of recruitment and retention difficulty more competitive with the private secto?8. Also
under PAL-3, performance-based wage determination will be extended across the public sector.
By end 2006, civil service employment conditions are intended to be increasingly competitive
with theprivate sector as demonstrated through declines in vacancy levels in areas of recruitment
and retention difficulty; increases in civil servicepay; and increase in the internal decompression
ratio (ratio of basepayfor graduate entrant to Deputy Minister).

68.      The government initiated under PAL-2 the re-organization of all ministries through
a program of functional reviews. This program is designed to align Ministry and agency
structures, functions and staffing with those required to deliver key government work program
priorities; and to put in place the administrative capacity necessary to meet the requirements of
EUaccessionandintegration. Functionalreviews were carriedout under PAL-2 in2003 for three
pilot ministries. The recommendations o f these reviews are to be implemented under PAL-3. A
further ten pilots (four ministries and six regonal administrations) are to be completed under
PAL-3. By end 2006, government structures, functions, staffing levels and skills are intended to
be appropriate for the effective delivery of priority government work program objectives and
requirements of EU integration.

69.      The government has also developed plans for improving service delivery under
PAL-2. An integrated performance management system for the public administration was put in
place. Ministries have been requiredto define their performance objectives on an annual and tri-
annual basis. These objectives are to be reflectedinthe program budgets; and will also be linked
to the performance appraisal system for individual civil servants. The performance appraisal
systemwas put inplace for all first and second line spendinginstitutions over the course o f 2003.
Specific performance standards for officials involved in delivering services to the public have
been adopted under PAL-2. The 2001 baseline public officials survey revealed that only 26
percent o f civil servants were familiar with the performance standards expected o f them.
Institutional performance mechanisms for service delivery institutions will include service
charters and will berolledout under PAL-3 in2005.




28 The 2002 baseline pay andbenefits survey o f the public sector andprivate sector inSofia showed that for
civil service pay to reach the 80 percent me&an for equivalent private sector jobs, the following levels of
pay increases would be necessary : junior expert 38 percent; senior expert 88 percent; chief expert 144
percent; head of section 201 percent; department head277 percent; and director 379 percent.


                                                    25

70.      Pilot exercises on the creation of one-stop shop service delivery systems have been
introduced under PAL-2 in five central agencies and six municipalities.               Based on the
preliminary results o f these pilots and the results o f the self assessment o f service delivery
mechanisms conducted by all central state administration bodies involved in public service
delivery, the government adopted under PAL-2 a plan for the phased introduction o f service
delivery and performancestandardsfor all line ministries, agenciesandmunicipalities.

71.      The government has adopted under PAL-2 an ambitious action plan for e-
governance.     Significant progress has been made during PAL-2 on the development of the
infrastructurerequired for the effective operation of on-line services to citizens. The optical cable
network now extends to 60 percent of the territory o f Bulgaria (currently only to the regional
level). The extension o f the network to the municipal level to ensure an effective operation of e-
services i s planned to have been completed by the end o f 2005. The government has also
completed under PAL-2 the electronic registry o f state institutions, includingthe database o f all
existing regulatory regimes (Pillar II),  and containing also on-line forms for customs and tax
claims and applications. The register.of regulatory regimes represents a major step forward in
creating a transparent and accessibleapproach to regulatory activities. By end 2006, improvement
in quality of services being delivered should be demonstrated through results of service delivey
surveys; self-assessments by agenciesproviding administrative services; evidence of an increase
in the morale ofpublic officials from public oficials surveys; a signijkant increase in the number
of eservices being delivered; and an increase in performance orientation on the part of civil
servants as measured in public officials surveys. Thegovernment will have determined the extent
to which administrative services are to be subject to competition, and the degree to which
outsourcing is to be introduced.

72.      The government under PAL-1 had adopted a National Anti-Corruption Strategy.
This provided a comprehensive framework for approaching the problem of corruption and a
unifyingframework for the government's cross-cutting attempts to combat corruption inall areas
of its work-program. The 2001 public officials survey showed that 50 percent o f officials
covered felt that corruption was a significant problem affecting the performance o f government
institutions. Under PAL-2 the government took the first steps to seek to translate this ambitious
agenda into a sequence of concrete actions in selected priority areas. The government also
prepared under PAL-2 measures to address weaknesses relating to conflict o f interest and asset
declarations; set up an inter-ministerial commission to implement the national anti-corruption
strategy; created a full time secretariat to support the work o f the commission; and designed a
monitoring system to track progress in meeting the anti-corruption objectives. Ministries and
agencies prepared detailed and practical anticorruption action plans under PAL-2 ,including the
MinistryofInterior andthe tax andcustomsadministrations.

73.      The Council of Ministers under PAL-2 approved an Anticorruption Program for
the period 2004 to 2005 which includes specific sectoral anticorruption strategies for
education and health :and the Supreme Judicial Council approved a linked anticorruption
strategy for the judiciary.       Under PAL-3 the government plans to codify administrative
procedures to reduce inappropriate discretion on the part o f civil servants; to further strengthen
freedom of informationregulations to provide for more timely access to information and for more
effective and transparent appeals mechanisms; and to develop fkrther a series o fjoint approaches
to specific areas o f anticorruption with business and investor associations and with NGOs; while
also developing curricular and public awareness material. There was an increase of 213 percent
in requests by members of the public for official information in 2003 compared to 2002 (an
increase from 21,649 requests in2002 to 67,712 requests in 2003). This followed an increase of
39 percent in such requests in2002 compared to 2001 (an increase from 15,556 requests in2001


                                                 26

to 21,649 requests in 2002). By end 2006, the government's aim is that levels of state capture
and administrative corruption will have been reduced compared to 2001; with the public
administration displaying stronger external accountability and transparency, including more
effective access to information regimes.

74.      The government developed under PAL-2 a comprehensive program for
strengthening public expenditure management. This included actions designed to increase
allocative efficiency and transparency inbudget formulation; to strengthen the budget execution
system and processes; to strengthen the effectiveness o f internal and external accountability
arrangements; and to strengthen the system o f intergovernmentalfinance. By 2007, the center of
government decision-making and public expenditure management systems will be designed to
allow the CoMmore effectively toprioritize and allocate resources in support of key government
priorities.

75.      The government under PAL-2 moved ahead with the implementation of program
budgeting. The government's programbudgetinginitiative inthe 2003 budgetyear includedone
pilot, the Ministry o f Environment and Waters. The pilot program budget document included
program classifications and descriptions, as well as information about objectives and potential
performance measures. Inthe 2004 budget two more line ministries, the Ministry o f Transport
and Communications and the Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy, also developed program
budget documents. For the 2005 budget it was agreedunder PAL-2 that four more pilots will be
added, the Ministry o f Education and Science, the Ministry o f Economy, the Ministryo f Energy
and EnergyResources, andthe Ministryof Youth and Sports. Inall of these pilots the intention i s
to create direct links between programs, budgeted allocations, objectives and actual performance
targets.

76.      At the same time as these budgets are being developed, the NationalAudit Office
will begin to prepare assessments of program budgets. The first of these will be for the
Ministry of Environment and Water's program budget. There will be activity on both the
preparation side o f the reform (creating the budgets) and on the evaluation side (in ensuring
accountability inthe reform process). The medium-term aim i s to expand the program budgeting
initiative to all spending entities ingovernment, with all nineteen line ministries expected to have
program budgets by 2007. By end-2005, the public expenditure allocations process should be
markedly improved in all ministries, with ministries displaying an improved ability to prioritize,
allocate and manage resources in support of key government priorities. The move towards a
program budgeting classification and identification o f more specific objectives and goals i s also
expected to help enhance the transparency o f the national budget and help create incentives for
responsive service delivery to the public, perhaps particularly important inthe area o f education.
The government objective is that by 2006 for the 2007 budget preparation cycle) the public
expenditure management system will be based on the medium-term jnancialframework and on
outcomes-basedprogram budgeting.

77.      The government under PAL-2 also improved public sector capital expenditure
management processes and systems. The Ministry of Finance under PAL-2 took a number of
steps to improve the processes and practices involved in planning, appraising, monitoring and
reporting on capital expenditures. The 2003 draft guidelines for capital expenditure planning and
appraisal were developed according to EU standards, and distributedto all line ministries. The
guidelines to be approved by the Minister o f Finance in 2004 will be the basis o f analysis and
prioritization of capital expenditures for the 2005 budget. While capital expenditures declined to
3.2 percent o f GDP in 2002 compared to 4.8 percent in 1999, the allocation in the 2004 budget
was for 3.6 percent o f GDP. Further, the 2004 budget reflected an increase in capital



                                                 27

expenditures and expenditures allocated to operations and maintenance. The Ministryof Finance
developed a system in2003 that will in2004 allow for recording, monitoring and reporting on all
capital expenditures. The National Investment Divisionhas been established within the Ministry
o f Finance as the agency responsible for coordination of national investment policy inthe public
sector. By end-2005, it is intended that theprocesses in placefor managing capital expenditures
will be standardized and institutionalized,facilitating improvements in both the eficiency and
effectiveness of capital expenditure decisions and expenditures and with enhanced accountability
for capital expenditures.

78.      The government is also under PAL-2 moving forward with the implementationof
the new FinancialManagement Information System(GFMIS). Under PAL-2, the GFMIS has
become operational for five modules intwo pilot second level spending units in the Ministry of
Finance (the Central Administration and the General Tax Directorate). This will be extended to
all ten second level spending units inthe Ministry in 2004. The long-term aim i s to expand the
GFMIS to other spending entities in government. To this end, a number of further short-term
actions have been taken under PAL-2.          Firstly, a project management structure is being
developed. Secondly, a draft strategy for full FMIS implementation, developed by the Ministry
o f Finance in 2003, was approved by the Council o f Ministers in 2004. By end-2005, it i s
intended that the GFMIS will be functional across the entire Ministryo f Finance, improving the
efficiency of financial management processes and providing a successful pilot for other spending
entities to follow. By end 2005, the government aim is that the overall quality and technical
efficiency of budget execution will be increased.

79.      The government under PAL-2 taking full account of the CFAA recommendations
achieved a significant strengthening of internal and external audit practices. The Public
Internal Financial Control Agency (PIFCA, which i s responsible for internal audit), had by
October 2003 located internal audit teams inall line ministries, 109 municipalities and a number
o f other government bodies. PIFCA had also under PAL-2 established guidelines for conducting
internal audits throughout government. PIFCA plans to ensure that internal audits are carried out
inall govemment entities, annually, accordingto a strategic plan, andthat internal audits areboth
reported on and leadto appropriate remedial action beingtaken by the Ministryof Finance. The
National Audit Office (NAO) under PAL,-2 completed development o f an approach for
conducting a pilot program and performance audit of the Ministryo f Environment and Waters. It
also developed a multi-year program for audit of operational and financial performance in all
government ministries and agencies. Increased attention is to be paid under PAL-3 to ensuring
that recommendations from the NAO and PIFCA are acted upon. By end-2005, the aim i s that
there will be improved internal and external accountability inthe public expenditure management
process. This i s expected to result inlower corruption and improved transparency. By end 2005
the government intends that there will be clear evidence that NAO and PIFCA reports are
leading to appropriate action (both remedial action and also system andprocess improvements).

80.      The    government     moved      under    PAL-2 to       strengthen   the   system for
intergovernmental finance.       It reached an agreement with the National Association of
Municipalities to liquidate outstanding local government arrears (with government funding for
arrears reduction being allocated on the basis o f a transparent formula and covering less than the
full amount of the outstanding arrears). The government made arrangements to fully fund all
centrally mandated delegated functions in the 2004 budget based on agreed expenditure
standards.    The government also adopted a transparent formula for allocating revenue
equalization grant for the 2004 budget. Thegovernment's aim is that the 2004 and 2005 budgets
should show that conflicts over unfunded mandates have been eliminated and hard budget
constraints imposed on municipalities.



                                                28

81.      The government made very significant progress inthe area ofjudicial reform under
PAL-2. The amendments and additions to the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria required
to take forward the judicial reform program were promulgated on September 26, 2003. This
constituted a major step forward inputting inplace an appropriate accountability framework for
the judiciary, particularly with respect to immunity, mandate, and replaceability. The amendment
to Article 132 of the Constitution now limits immunity for members o f the judiciary to acts
undertaken "during the exercise of their judiciary prerogatives". The addition o f a new Paragraph
5 to Article 129 of the Constitution on the issue o f mandates limits senior judicial appointments to
five years with eligibility for a second five year period in office. For other members of the
judiciary irreplaceability is conferred under amendment to Paragraph 3 o f Article 129 of the
Constitution by decision o f the Supreme Judicial Council after five years service and taking into
consideration a performance appraisal. Irreplaceability i s further limited in that dismissal will
occur on completion o f 65 years of age; resignation; entry into force of a prison sentence; or
"serious violation or a systematic failure to perform one's official duties, as well as actions
bringing disrepute to the judicial system".           The National Assembly enacted consequential
amendments to the Judiciary Act to bringit into line with the amendments and additions to the
Constitution inMarch2004.

82.      The government and the Supreme Judicial Council each moved ahead in a number
of other key areas of the judicial reform programwithin their respective remits under PAL-
2. A number o f surveys and studies to assess public perception of thejudiciary were carriedout2'
The 2004 budgetprovides for an increase inbudget as a percentage o f GDP to be allocated to the
judiciary in 2004 compared to 2003. Draft uniform standards o f service for the administrative
staff o f the judiciary have been produced.            The Supreme Judicial Council has approved
Regulations on the terms and conditions for the holding o f competitions for the appointment o f
magistrates. The Ministry o f Justice submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council a plan for the
reform o f the administrative court system (to be implemented under PAL-3). By end-2005, the
accountability, eficiency       and effectiveness of       the judiciary should have increased as
demonstrated through assessment of outcomes being secured under the new accountability
framework for judges; monitoring of case load per judge, securing an increase in the number of
judgments enforced, and a reduction in pending cases and in delays in hearing and resolving
cases.
Pillar 5: InvestinginHuman Capital and Strengthening Social Programs

 83.     The government has expressed its commitment to increasing human capital and
reducing poverty and social exclusion. It i s developing and implementingprograms to improve
the efficiency and fiscal sustainability o f the education system; improve quality and maintain
equitable access to education; improve the efficiency and fiscal sustainability o f the health
 system; improve the administration and targeting o f disability benefits; empower the disabled to
integrate fully in society; ensure successful implementation o f the pension reform; improve
coverage and efficiency o f social assistanceprograms; and reduce institutionalization of children
through helping families and fostering community based alternatives to institutional care.

 84.     The government has taken under PAL-%the first steps towards developing an
education reform program. The Council for Economic Policy at end March 2004 approved a
concept for the education reform strategy together with an action plan. The strategy i s designed
*'Asurvey  of magistrates' attitudes with respect to the currentjudicial system andplannedreforms and a
survey ofthe public on the situation inthe judicial system have beencarried out; and the new Internet page
of the MinistryofJustice now contains an electronic survey form to capture the opinion o fvisitors on
burning issues ofthe day.


                                                      29

to secure improvements inresource management and inthe quality o f teaching and learningwhile
strengthening equity (particularly for rural areas and minorities). The further development and
implementation of this reform, including through intensivepolicy dialogue, will be a major focus
O fPAL-3.

85.       Under PAL-2 the government in 2003 introduced changes to its approach for
financing education responsibilities delegated to the municipalities . These responsibilities
include general primary and secondary schools, vocational schools, and the staffing costs of all
day kindergartens. The reform involved moving from financing of inputs to financing based on
number of students. Significantly, by eliminating the automatic reimbursement o f salaries, the
new transfer formula reduces incentives for over staffing. Under PAL-2 the Council o fMinisters
also approved an updated resolution on per capita financing to municipalities which provides
incentives for increasing efficiency in staffing in grades 9-12 in municipal secondary schools.
The government's aim is to continue to improve the financing formula under PAL-3 to ensure
that it provides incentives to municipalities to optimize their network of schools and increases
incentives for improving quality and access o f schools, and using all inputs, including staff,
optimally. The government's aim is to raise the student-teacher ratio towards the average level
in OECD countries by end-2007, while raising class sizes to OECD levels. By end 2006, the aim
is also to be able to demonstrate evidence of improved resource allocation in higher education.

86.       The government also under PAL-2 began work on a plan to address quality and
equity issues in education while seeking to improve resource utilization and learning
outcomes. This work was undertaken in the context of declining education quality (including as
revealed by the 1995 and 1999 TIMSS international surveys3o in which Bulgaria had
participated).   The decline in assessment results reflects in the view o f the government the
pressures o f a severely strained education system.         Real outlays for education fell more
precipitously than those inother accession countries duringthe 1990s, and the share o f education
expenditures inGDP is lower than OECD and first-tier EUaccessioncountries. There appearsto
be significant scope for improving intra-sectoral efficiency Iresource utilization. To monitor the
impact o f the reforms, the government under PAL-2 began to develop measures for evaluating
quality in Bulgarian education, at the level o f the system, school, and student, which will be
implementedover the course of PAL-3. By end 2006, the aim is to see improvement in education
quality indicators as based on surveys such as TIMSS,PISA and national assessments.

87.       While the net enrollment ratios of 96 percent in primary3' schools in 2001-02
indicate that access to education at this level is not a problem, the government remains very
concerned about the relatively low ratios in lower secondary schools (84 percent) and upper
secondary" schools (68 percent).          High unemployment and the apparent perception that
secondary education i s irrelevant are felt by the government to be the possible causes o f the high
drop out rate, particularly inrural areas. Enrolment rates for children from poor families declined
from 84 percent in 1997 to 74 percent in 2001. Under PAL-2, the government introduced an
obligatory pre-primary school year starting from September 2003 to improve access o f children
from minorities and to help generally the preparation o f children for primary school that now



30 The most inclusive source of internally comparable data on what students learn is the TIMSS
international science and math assessment. Ths was carried out for a nationally representative sample o f
eighth grade students in 24 countries in 1995 and 39 countries in 1999. Nine EU accession countries
participated. While Bulgaria scored above the international average in 1995, its score declined to below
average in 1999.

starts relatively late at age 7. Given that minority children are more likely to drop out of school
and that under 5 percent o f Roma children continue to secondary education, under PAL-2 the
government paidparticular attention to childrenfrom minorities and developed tools to help them
acquire social shlls, better accommodate them inthe school environment, and better help them to
play and learn together with other children. The Council of Ministers under PAL-2 approved an
Action Planfor Protection Against Discrimination Against Minorities in the education system.
By end 2005, the government's goal is to increase the net enrollment rate in primary school to
97-98 percent, in lower secondary school to 86-90 percent, and in secondary school to 73-75
percent; and by end 2006 a reduction in the gap in enrollment ratesfor minorities.

88.      The government also under PAL-2 began to address the issue of reducing the
comparatively high number of children who are institutionalized in Ministry of Education
and Science institutions or who are referred to special schools for the retarded. These
children often fall behind in learning and social integration.       Under PAL-2 in 2003, the
government aligned the Ministry o f Education and Science legislation for placement of children
in residential care with the Child Protection Act. This was seen as a first step to allow the
government under PAL-3 to move aggressively in 2004 to implement its plans to reduce the
number o f institutionalized children and those in special schools. By 2007, the aim is to achieve
an increase in the number of children in specialized schools who are integrated into general
education schools.

89.      The government continued under PAL-2 to focus on improving the efficiency and
financial sustainability of the health system. Its aim i s to seek to improve the relatively poor
health status indicators and to use the available resources more efficiently. The reform is based
on the separation o f service provision from financing by strengthening the National Health
Insurance Fund(NHIF),which undertakes bothrisk poolingand health care purchasing functions
on behalf o f the population; and by redefining the roles and responsibilities of the Ministry o f
Health (MoH). The NHIF i s to be transformed from a passive buyer to an active and strategc
purchaser o f care, with increased capacity in quality assurance and medical audit with respect to
the providers with which it enters into contractual agreements. A long term hospital restructuring
strategy has been developed under PAL-2 to ensure adequate maintenance and upgrading o f
existing capital assets, and investment innew equipment and facilities, so that the quality of care
does not suffer. Once fully implemented under PAL-3, the reforms are expected to bring about
significant improvement in access to care regardless o f socio-economic status; in service use
according to need; and ultimately to leadto improved healthand consumer satisfaction. By 2005,
administrative costs of NHIF areplanned to be at less than 3percent of revenues.

90.      Under PAL-2 the government developed a concrete short-term action plan for
implementing its hospital restructuring strategy, together with a longer term strategy for
financing the capital requirements of the health sector. In2003 under PAL-2 the government
designed and implemented a new mechanism for financing essential public healthprograms such
as tuberculosis, immunization, and HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases.                 The
government also under PAL-2 designed a unified national policy, strategy and action plan for
pharmaceuticals, and developed and introduced an essential drug list to reduce inappropriate use
of pharmaceuticals and to contribute to improved overall resource allocations in the sector. The
government plans under PAL-3 to implement the hospitalrestructuring strategy, secure the long-
term financial sustainability o f the NHIF, and move towards institutionalizing the process of
setting standards for health care technologies and accreditation o f health facilities in order to
make the expected gains from the above reforms sustainable over the long-term. By end 2005,
the government's aim is to have completed a new cycle of accreditation of healthcarefacilities;
by end 2005 to have in place a systemfor periodic monitoring and evaluation of immunization,



                                                31

tuberculosis case detection and treatments/cure and HIVprevalence rates; and by 2006, to have
achieved an increase in the utilization of tracer preventive service (pap smear, mammography,
full immunization.

91.       The government under PAL-2 moved forward with measuresto preventworsening
of tobacco related health risks and problems. Under PAL-2 the government approved an
amendment to the Public Health Law to earmark 1 percent of the excise tax collected from
tobacco and tobacco products for fundingthe national tobacco control program. It intends under
PAL-3 to design and implement nationwide health programs for tobacco control.                             The
government under PAL-2 also movedto approve legislative amendments deigned to complete the
harmonization o f Bulgaria's tobacco control legislation with relevant EUdirectives. By 2010 the
aim is that Bulgaria will have achieved a gradual increase of excise duty on tobacco products
towards harmonization asper theEUdirective.

92.       The government approvedunder PAL-2 the National Strategyfor Equal Opportunity
for theDisabled and submittedto the NationalAssembly a draftAct on Integration of People
with Disabilities. These were designed to promote the full and productive integration o f people
with disabilities in society and labor markets; and to address increasing problems with
administering and targeting disability benefits. The government expects that as a result o f its
actions, people with disabilities in Bulgaria will have a radically improved access to education
(buildings,institutions and services); andthat the country thereby will be able to benefit from the
untapped humanpotential o f this diverse                  While the cost o f institutional care inBulgaria
i s high compared to the cost o f home based family care, the larger cost relates to the unrealized
potential of individuals as a result o f social isolation. The reforms launched under PAL-2 are
aimed at fostering the recognition and integration o f disabled people into mainstream
employment and social involvement.

 93.       To facilitate the objective of integration, the government also under PAL-2
prepared a strategy to improve the disability assessment process and to reduce
 inappropriateincentives to claim disability status. Under PAL-2 the Council of Ministers
 approved amendments to the Public Health Law to provide adequate representation to NSSI in
the Disability Assessment Committee (TELK). By end 2007, the government'sgoal is that the
number of new disability pensions will have been reduced compared to 2003; and expenditureon
disability based social assistance benefits will have been reduced. By end 2006, construction
standards will be being enforced to allow appropriate levels of access by the disabled.

 94.       The government continued to focus under PAL-2 on the implementation of the
 multi-pillar pension system. The system comprises three pillars: first, the publicly managed
pay-as-you-go system; second, the mandatory supplementary defined contribution universal (for
those born after December 31, 1959) and occupational (for those working under hazardous
 conditions) pension plans; and third, the voluntary supplementary plans. Under PAL-2 it was
 agreed that the contribution rate that will be allocated to the public and private pillars will be
 definedthrough a legislative instrument which will remain effective, by default, over a multi-year
period and not need annual approval by the National Assembly. The government ensured the
 approval under PAL-2 o f the NSSIbudget for 2004 including a 3 percent contribution rate to the
 second pillar. Also under PAL-2, a Social Security Code was enacted to create a conducive
 framework for the further development o f the multi-pillar system.                  The legal framework


 33The historical approach to disability inBulgaria established state owned institutions for residential and
 employment purposes, which created a high degree o f dependency betweenthe disabled, their family and
 the state. The focus was on separation rather than on integration.


                                                     32

concerning private pension plans and their supervision was amended under PAL-2 (Pillar 111) to
improve governance structures and supervision capacity. An institutional development plan was
also prepared under PAL-2 to continue building the capacity o f the Financial Supervision
Commission. Efforts continued to be made to ensure timely and accurate contribution reporting
and collection and thus enable NSSIto shorten the time needed to transfer funds to second pillar
institutions. It was also agreed that there would be a campaign to improve public understanding
o f the reform. By 2005, it is planned by the government that stability will have been achieved in
beneJit indexation, contribution base dynamics, and contribution rates.         By end-2007, the
mandatory contribution to the secondpillar will be 5percent.

95.      Further stepswere taken during PAL-2 by the government to improve the coverage,
effectiveness, and efficiency of social assistance programs in the framework of its new
National Strategy to Fight Poverty and Social Exclusion. This in turn was built on the
government's New Social Policy Strategy adopted in 2002. Under PAL-2 a number o f measures
were implemented to improve coverage and efficiency o f social assistance programs.            The
government under PAL-2 improved the effectiveness, efficiency and coverage o f the Guaranteed
MinimumIncome and the energy benefit programs and reformed the child allowance program.
Starting from 2003, as part o f its Fiscal Decentralization Program 2003-2005, and through an
amendment to the Social Assistance Act effective January 2003, the govemment assumed full
responsibility for most forms o f social assistance, including direct income support (the
Guaranteed Minimum Income) and the operation of orphanages and other institutions for
vulnerable populations. This reform aimed to provide better funding for these programs, and to
eliminate the problems o f arrears and in-kindpayments for the Guaranteed Minimum Income
program. The government also under PAL-2 introduced means-testing into the child-allowance
program, and the government made these allowances conditional on school attendance for all
eligible children between 7 and 16years, inorder to provide incentives for increasedparticipation
in educational institutions for children of compulsory school age.. To reduce the incidence of
duplication of benefits and other abuses o f the system, the inspectorates under the supervision o f
the Social Assistance Agency were under PAL-2 empowered to verify eligibility for social
assistance programs through spot checks. The government also carried through under PAL-2 a
reorganization of social services, developed minimumstandards for social services, and replaced
the previouslicensing procedure with a more open butbetter controlledregistrationprocess. The
reforms implemented under PAL-2 already allow for a much broader and more diverse
participation in providing social services by non-profit organizations, NGOs, commercial
providers and community groups.

96.      The government also moved under PAL-2 to strengthen the poverty monitoring
capacity of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy to track and assess the impact of
government policies and programs. This reform included the development of policies to
strengthen social assistance, reduce poverty, and increase living standards. Based on an updated
analysis of poverty from its multi-topic household survey and assessment o f the effectiveness o f
its social programs, the government plans under PAL-3 to further refine its strategy for reducing
poverty and social exclusion. By end-2005 the aim is to reduce the poverty rate of 2001 by at
least 50 percent and to reduce the number of people on social assistance, while securing
improved effectiveness of social assistanceprograms.

97.      Given the comparatively high levelof institutionalizationof children in Bulgaria the
government attached high importance under PAL-2 to measures to return children to their
families and communities. Under PAL-2 the government completed the alignment o f the
Family Code with the 2001 Child Protection Act. The government under PAL2 also adopted a

services, includingfoster care; and developed criteria for restructuring existing child institutions.
New ChildProtection Departments were established under PAL-2 inall municipalities to enforce
the new legislation. By the end of 2007 the government's aim is that there will be a demonstrated
increase in non-governmental alternative child care providers and in community based child
weware services. By 2007, the aim is that there will be a decline in the number of children in
specialized institutions and an increase in the number of specialized child care institutions which
have been restructured.



                                C. BANKGROUP         STRATEGY

Country AssistanceStrategy

98.      The proposed PAL-2 is fully consistent with the 2002-05 Bank Group Country
Assistance Strategy for Bulgaria which was reviewed by the Board of Executive Directors
on May 9,2002 (R2002-0067[IFC-R2002-0052]). The CAS focused on three main themes: (a)
promoting competitive private sector led growth; (b) strengthening the public administration and
tackling corruption; and (c) mitigating the social impact of restructuring and delivering social
services more effectively. Drawing from the lessons o f the previous CAS, the 2002-05 CAS
recognized the need for a comprehensive policy reform program to support the wide range o f
remaining policy and institutional reforms required for Bulgaria to be able to complete transition
to a fully competitive market economy. Under the CAS Bank support is to be provided over the
CAS period through the planned series of PALS. This approach was designed to enable the Bank
to be comprehensive in its approach, while at the same time maintaining a focus on ensuring
sustainability o f the outcomes beingpursued under this multi-year program.

99.      Bulgaria has satisfactorily met the CAS conditions to remaininthe base case. PAL-
2 supported the government in maintaining satisfactory progress in implementation of the
government program. The macroeconomic performance remains robust and satisfactory and
structural reforms remain on track.     Portfolio performance has improved recently following
concerted efforts by the government jointly with the Bank and a quarterly portfolio review
process i s now in place..      A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was
completed inDecember 2003 and the results acceptedby government. An update o f the Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) is expected by end 2004. The Bank has decentralized
procurement and set up a regional procurement unit in Sofia. The CFAA findings were accepted
by the government; and provided an important input to PAL-2; the CPAR update is expected to
informP A L 3 preparation.

Portfolio Quality

100.     The total Bank-assisted program in Bulgaria as of mid-April 2004 comprised 33
operations for a total original commitment of US%1,820.9 million equivalent. This includes
eleven adjustment loans (US$1,050.8 million equivalent), 19 investment projects (US$750.7
million equivalent), two Bank-managed Global Environmental Fund grants (US$17.4 million
equivalent), and one Bank-managed Prototype Carbon Fund grant (US2 million). Of these 33
operations, 24 have been completed, PAL-1 has been disbursed with the loan account closed at
endDecember 2003, andnine operations are under implementation.

 101.    The current portfolio is comprised of projects with commitments net of
cancellations totaling US%234.6 million, as of April 6, 2004, and complements the reform



                                                 34

agenda articulated by the government and supported by PALS. Inaddition, there are twelve
grants (PHRD, JSDF, MISC and a PCF operation) amounting to some U S $9.5 million
equivalent. The current portfolio o f projects was designed to upgrade health services, improve
child welfare, develop modem registration and cadastre systems, modernize district heating,
improve revenue administration, reduce unemployment, and support trade and transport
facilitation. For FY05 projects are proposed for forestry development, rural development and
roads infrastructure.

102.      The Bank also provides a range of analytical and advisory services as part of its
activities in Bulgaria.      The updated Poverty Assessment, the Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review, the review o f Issues inIntergovernmentalRelations and the CFAA provided
key contributions to the analytical base o f PAL-2 and are also informing P A L 3 preparation. A
Private Sector Assessment in FY04 will also be a key input for P A L 3 preparation. A draft
Bulgaria Gender Profile is also being finalized. The government received or i s receiving support
from a Japanese project preparation PHRD grant for eacho f the three PALs.

103.      The performance of the Bulgaria program has been satisfactory. There was some
deterioration inthe portfolio quality during 2002 and 2003 due to problems inthe education and
health projects. These issues were addressed during project supervision and joint portfolio
reviews. Based on progress achieved the health project was upgraded to satisfactory status; and
agreement was reached to close the education project with effect from 31 March 2004 in
unsatisfactory status. The current portfoliohas 100percent satisfactory performance.

104.      While portfolio quality is satisfactory, overall pace of implementation, as reflected
in disbursements, has declined since 2001 although this is in line with changes to the
structure and age of the portfolio. The disbursement ratio o f 13.5 percent for 2003 reflects a
portfolio structure composed entirely o f young projects; and young projects which are at an early
stage of implementation, when disbursements typically are low. Four o f the projects (50 percent
o f the portfolio) are younger than two years, and the oldest project i s 3.9 years old. Two o f the
newprojects, both0.8 years old, constitute 30 percent o f the overall portfolio. The disbursement
ratio in2003 o f 13.5 percent compares to that o f 18.8 percent in2002 and 21.5 percent in2001.

105.      Both the Bank and the government recognize the importance of portfolio quality for
the achievement of the CAS goals, and remedial actions to secure improved performance in
disbursements have been agreed. A system for proactive portfolio monitoring has set upby the
government, led by the DeputyPrime Minister and Minister for Economy. Quarterly monitoring
i s being undertaken against agreedtargets to addressdelays inproject implementation.

Cooperationwith the IMF

106.      The IMF Board approved in February 27,2002 a two year SDR 240 million Stand
By Arrangement (SBA). This was in February 2004 extended to March 15, 2004, when the
SBA closed.. The IMF is discussing with the authorities a new 2-year precautionary program.
The ability o f the government to fulfill its commitments under IMF programs depends to a large
extent on the structural and institutional reforms being supported by the PALs. Cooperation
between the Fundand the Bank has been strong, including the completion o f the joint Bank-Fund
Financial Sector Assessment Program for Bulgaria and the joint technical assistance initiative to
upgrade the Ministryof Finance's debt management capacity. Annex 7sets out in more detail the
roles of theBank and theIMF with respect to the government's economicprogram.

CoordinationwithDonors

107.     The government revised its mechanism under PAL-2 for better coordination of
donor activities. The coordination process is now based on the following thematic areas : (i)
business climate; (ii)living standards; (iii)governance and public administration; and (iv)
infrastructure and natural resources management. Workmg groups have been established ineach
of these areas, led by deputy ministers. The amendments to the Council for Economic Policy
(formerly Council for Structural Policy), introduced in end December 2003 specify that the
Council has the lead role indonor coordination, and provide for the establishment o f the thematic
workmg groups under the overall oversight o f the Deputy Prime Ministers. The Council of
Ministers' Directorate for European Integration and Relations with International Financial
Institutions acts as secretariat (coordination unit). The Bank has maintained under the PAL
Program very strong and effective joint working arrangements and relationships with donor
partners, particularly the EC, DFID(for Pillar IV)and USAID.

ProgramDesign

108.     PAL-2 is the second in a series of the three adjustment operations planned to be
implemented during the CAS period. As agreedat the time of Board approval of PAL-1, each
PAL operationis to be presented separately to the Board, within the overall framework developed
under PAL-1. As providedfor inthe CAS, PAL-1 focused inparticular on structural, regulatoiy,
and institutional reforms in the real andfinancial sectors (Pillars Ito 111). These were designed
to move Bulgaria towards a functioning market economy (now achieved and recognized by the
EUinthe November 2003 Regular Report). PAL-2, in addition to sustaining the reforms under
PAL-1, focuses inparticular onpublic sector governance, includingpublic administration reform,
anticorruption, public expenditure management and judicial reform (Pillar IV). P A L 3 will
continue to support the achieving o f outcomes from the PAL-1 and PAL-2 areas of focus,
particularly the comparativelynew agendaunderPillar IV;butwill also focus inparticular on the
social sector agenda (Pillar V), including education and health reforms (efficiency, quality,
access, inclusion and equity), pension reform (sustainability and equity), and social assistance
reform(coverage, targetingand efficiency).

109.     PAL-2 is to be structured as a two tranche operation. The proposedloan amount of
$150 million was converted to a loan amount of Euro 123.7 million during Negotiations. The
first tranche will be Euro 103.7 million. The second floating tranche o f Euro 20 million i s linked
to progress on Bulgartabak privatization and restructuringAiquidations. The PAL-2 closing date
has been determined as December 31, 2004 (subject to the Second Tranche Conditions having
been met by that date).

110.     The updated Letter of Development Policy (LDP) (attached as Annex 5) describes
progress under PAL-2 in implementing the government's medium term program. It also
sets out priorities for PAL-3, and the Triggers for PAL-3. The LDP sets out the intendedprogram
outcomes for the Program overall (Annex 6C sets out a summary o f progress to date against the
desiredmedium-term outcomes).

 111.    The government has taken a number of steps to put in place appropriate
institutional arrangements and structures to ensure the successful implementationof the



                                                 36

PAL program. The Council for Economic Policy (formerly the Council for Structural Policy)
under the Council of Ministers has proved to be a very effective program management and
government coordination institution over PAL-I and PAL-2. This receives well-organized and
effective support from the Directorate for European Integration and Relations with International
Financial Institutions o f the Council of Ministers. During PAL-2 preparation, the Council of
Ministers also set up a Council for State Administration Modernization, supported by the very
active and effective Directorate for State Administration of the Council o f Ministers. The
Anticormption Commission, chaired by the Minister for Justice, with the Minister for State
Administration as the Deputy Chair, i s supported by a very small but dynamic Anticorruption
Coordination Commission Secretariat. The government has received institutional development
plans from several of the newly established independent regulatory agencies and commissions.
The government i s also considering how to upgrade its communications strategy, including
making greater provision for involvement o f private sector participation, NGOs and service users
inthe designofgovernment policiesandreforms.

MediumTermActions andTriggersfor PAL-3

113.    The government has agreed to a set of triggers for PAL-3. It is intended that these
actions may be modified, made more specific or strengthened inthe course o f PAL-3 preparation.

                                               42

macroeconomic stability i s a precondition for PAL-3 and any further future PALS. Furthermore,
as discussed inparagraph 36 above, the CAS identified additional triggers for processing PAL-3.

Implementation and Monitoring

114.     Under PAL-2 the Council for Economic Policy has undertaken overall management
and coordination of the government program. The Council is chaired by the Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Economy and includes as members the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Transport, the Minister of Labor and Social Policy, the Minister of Regional
Development and Public Works, the Minister o f Finance, the Minister o f Agriculture and
Forestry, the Minister o f State Administration, the Minister o f Energy and Energy Resources, the
Minister o f Education and Science, the Minister of Environment and Waters, the Minister o f
Health, two Deputy Ministers o f Economy determinedby the Minister of Economy, and a Deputy
Minister of Finance determined by the Minister of Finance. As stated above, the secretariat
function is provided by the Directorate for European Integration and Relations with IFIs o f the
Administration o f the Council ofMinisters.

115.     The Council for State Administration Modernization chaired by the Deputy Prime
Minister responsible for this area was formed under PAL-2 and has been very effective under
PAL-2 in leading on the coordination and implementation o f the government's state



                                                 43

administration reform agenda. As stated above, this i s supported by the Directorate for State
Administration of the Council of Ministers.

116.     There are a number of other bodiesthat focus on specific componentsof the reform
program. These include : the Inter-ministerial Working Group for the Optimization of
Regulatory Regimes, the Consultative Council for Financial Stability, the Poverty Monitoring
Unit at the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, and the Labor Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS) Unit withinthe National Statistical Institute.

117.     The government has also developed mechanisms for participationby stakeholders
in the design and implementation of the reform program. Several forums have been
established with both private and public sector memberships to facilitate dialogue on thematic
issues, notably the Council on Economic Growth and the Tax Council.            There are regular
consultations with established private sector organizations such as the Chamber o f Commerce and
Industry,the IndustrialAssociation, andthe Employers' Association.

118.     The medium term program implementation plan includes several feedback
mechanismsto enable the government to track progress towards the desired outcomes. A
baseline Administrative and Regulatory Cost Survey (ARCS) was completed under PAL-1 and
the first repeat survey undertaken under PAL-2. The living standards survey i s to be undertaken
on a regular basis. To assess changes inpublic perception of the judicial system, a survey was
designed under PAL-2 for implementation later in 2004. Repeat public officials and pay and
benefits surveys will be run under PAL-3, together with a number o f service delivery surveys.
NGO anticorruption surveys and NGO monitoring o f access to information will continue to
provide important monitoring data.       A consolidated matrix on Progress Against Desired
Outcomes is attached as Annex 6C to this Program Document.

LoanAdministration

119.     Borrower and Loan Amount. The proposed PAL-2 loan amount of US$lSO million
equivalent was converted into Euro duringNegotiations. The loan amount i s to be Euro 123.7
million, disbursed in Euro, to be made to the Government of Bulgaria, represented by the
Ministryof Finance. The loan will be a two tranche variable spread loan with a first tranche of
Euro 103.7 million (to be disbursed on effectiveness) and a secondtranche o f Euro 20 million (to
be disbursed on closure). The loan has a 17 year maturity including a grace period o f 5 years.
The proposed PAL-2 i s the second of the three planned adjustment loans totaling up to U S 4 5 0
million equivalent as provided for in the CAS. The Borrower has expressed its intention to use
the loanproceeds for servicingthe Government's foreign currency debt.

 120.    Disbursement. Inaccordance with the February 8, 1996 Operational Directive on the
Simplification o f Disbursement Rules under Structural Adjustment and Sectoral Adjustment
Loans, funds disbursedunder the proposed PAL-2 will be released against satisfactory progress in
the reforms set forth in the loan. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, thus
evidence will not be needed to support disbursements, nor will procurement requirements be
necessary. Upon approval o f the loan and notification by Bank o f loan effectiveness, the
government will submit a withdrawal application.         The Ministry of Finance will open and
maintain aDeposit Account inthe BulgarianNational Bank (BNB). The Borrower has confirmed
that it will also open a related account, for its own internal purposes, in connection with the
Deposit Account. IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan into this Deposit Account at the
request of the Ministryo f Finance. Prior to that, the Bank will withdraw from the Loan Account
a front end fee amounting to 1 percent of the loan amount. If after the loan proceeds are



                                                 44

deposited inthe BNB account, the proceedsare used for ineligible purposes as defined inthe loan
agreement, IBRD will require the borrower to either: (a) return that amount to the Deposit
Account for use for eligible purposes or (b) refundthe amount directly to IBRD.

121.     Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date. The government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provisions o f the Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be
maintained ina form acceptable to the Bank. The extemal auditor of BNB will conduct an annual
review of the deposit account and related account opened by the government in BNB to
exclusively hold the loan proceeds. The terms o f reference o f the review have been agreed with
the Bulgarian authorities. The review will examine and report on the disbursements from the
deposit account and related account until such time that all the loan proceeds have been fully
utilized on eligible expenditures. Suchreviews will be submitted to the Bank within two months
o f the end o f the Borrower's fiscal year. The Bank may require a more extensive audit o f such
records by independent auditors. The PAL-2 closing date has been determined as December 31,
2004 (subject to the SecondTranche Conditions havingbeenmet by that date).

122.     CompliancewithBankPolicies. The loancomplies with all applicable Bankpolicies.

BenefitsandRisks

123.     Benefits. First, PAL-2 provides continuing assistance to the government as it seeks to
implement its medium term economic program to achieve sustained growth, and reduce poverty
and unemployment, while progressing towards EU accession.                 Second, PAL-2 supports
strengthening o f institutional arrangements required to ensure successful implementation,
coordination, monitoring, and evaluation o f the medium term program. Third, PAL-2 lays the
groundwork for PAL-3 and possible further future PALSthrough identifying specific outcomes to
be achieved over the period 2004-2007 and specific future critical actions to be supported by
PAL-3. Fourth, the proposed PAL-2 complements the current and planned investment projects
by establishing the enabling policy framework.       Fifth, the program supported by the loan is
expected as was previously the case under the SBA to complement and reinforce the new IMF
programnow under discussion.

124.     Risks. Implementationrisk has decreasedsince the beginningof the PAL program
as evidencedby the successfulcompletionof bothPAL-1 andPAL-2 and the improvements
in institutional capacity achieved to date under the PAL program.                     To address
implementation risk, under PAL-1 the government activated the Council for Structural Policy,
restructured in December 2003 into the Council o f Economic Policy, to improve program
coordination; and put in place approaches to implementing institutional strengthening programs
for critical offices and agencies. During PAL-2 preparation, the government also formed the
Council for State Administration to provide for coordination and implementation leadership
across government in this area. Current and planned investment projects mitigate this risk by
providing implementation support; and PAL-2 has also been designed to leverage off the
outcomes o f specific donor projects in the areas o f public administration reform and judicial
reform, which also mitigates this risk.

125.     Second, politicalriskremains high, although this is mitigatedto a significant degree by
the fact there is strong support fkom all political parties for Bulgaria's EU accession and NATO
membership which helps to provide an anchor for remaining structural, institutional and social
reforms. Inaddition, progress has beenmade over the periodofpreparation o f PAL-2 inreducing
unemployment from 18.1 percent in 2001 to 14.3 percent in 2003; and some progress has been



                                                 45

made inthe area of anticorruption, although initial government achievements inthis area could be
better communicated and disseminated. The social protection and assistancepillar of the reform
program i s designed to alleviate the adverse impact of the remaining structural reforms while the
business environmentpillar is designed to provide expanded opportunities for employment.

126.    Third, there may be shocks coming from the external environment, jeopardizing
macroeconomic stability. Bulgaria faces several sigriificant potential external risks. Bulgaria's
external accounts are sensitive to three key parameters: an increase in oil prices, higher interest
rates, and a prolonged slowdown inEUeconomies which are the destination o f over fifty percent
o f Bulgarian exports and the origin o f more than half the FDI inflows.            However, the
achievements to date, the better than expected performance from the last months of 2002 to the
endof 2003, and the active efforts to restructure andreduce external debt has enabled Bulgaria to
manage these external risks.     Continued maintenance o f strict discipline in macroeconomic
management, the measures in place to respond to potential risks, and acceleration o f structural
reforms will further substantially mitigate these risks. Overall, government performance over
PAL-2 has been consistent and strong across what i s a very broad and challengingprogram.

Mr.James D.Wolfensohn
President
International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment
Washington D.C.

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:

                                      Introduction

1.      We appreciate this opportunity to request continuing support from the
World Bank for the implementation of our medium term reform strategy which
aims to achieve sustainable growth and further reduce poverty, while moving us
towards EU accession. We responded to the 1996-97 economic and financial crisis by
completing the first generation o f economic reforms, which focused on achieving
macroeconomic stabilization and price liberalization, and completing the initial phase of
structural reforms. We are now well into the second generation o f reforms, where the
emphasis is on building institutions required to establish, strengthen and enforce market
rules and redefiningthe role o f government while buildingcapacity throughout the public
sector. We continue to believe that the Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALS) provide
the appropriate vehicle for Bank support in addressing our medium term policy and
institutionalreform agenda.

2.      In the course of preparingthe first ProgrammaticAdjustment Loan (PAL-
l),we definedandbeganimplementingmostofthe componentsofour reform
agenda. In the course of preparing PAL-2 we have developed the components of
our programrelatedto improvingpublic sector governanceand investingin human
capital and strengthening social protection in considerably more detail; and taking
account of the findings o f the Bank's economic and sector work such as the Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review, the Poverty Assessment and the Review o f
Intergovernmental Relations, as well as lessons from the (sometimes difficult)
implementation o f existing Bank operations such as the Education Modernization
Adaptable Program Loan (now closed) and Health Sector Reform Project. We remain
convinced that the programmatic approach provides us with the flexibility to make sound
adjustments in our program and build on new information and additional experience in
institutional design and implementation towards the successful achievement o f our
strategic objectives andprogramoutcomes.

3.      The government and Bank staff have worked together in developing the
components of the governmentprogramto be supportedunder the PAL series. The
reform program outcomes and the critical steps to achieve these outcomes are
summarized in the accompanying Performance Benchmark Matrix. We have
updated and provide herewith the updated medium-term Letter o f Development Policy
(LDP) for the overall PAL Program in the light of achievements to date under PAL-2.
The overall reform program continues to be based on the five pillars which support our

                                                                                 Annex 5
                           Government of Bulgaria PAL-2 Letter o f Development Policy
                                                                             Page 4 o f 55

strategy: (i)sustaining structural reforms focusing on the infrastructure sector; (ii)
establishing a market-friendly business environment; (iii)deepening the financial system;
(iv) improving public sector govemance; and (v) investing in human capital and
strengthening social protection. Program implementation during 2002 (PAL-1) and
2003/2004 (PAL-2) has already resulted in the completion of many o f the critical steps
towards achieving the desired outcomes across the different program components. It i s
on the basis of these completed actions, in addition to the reform program itself, that we
seek your support under the second PAL operation, PAL-2.

4.      At the time of PAL-1 preparation we defined the desired outcomes of our
program, and identified the monitorable indicators to determine whether the
outcomes are being achieved. We have revised a number o f the benchmarks in the
attached matrix - defined as the set o f actions needed to achieve the outcomes o f each
program component - to reflect our experiences under PAL-1 and progress under PAL-2
and to reflect our current understandingo f what actions are necessary under PAL-3 to
achieve the desired outcomes at the end of program implementation. As we continue to
accumulate learning by doing and as we digest the outputs o f analytical work and the
results from feedback mechanisms, we will continue to refine the benchmarks as seems to
us to be appropriate and necessary to ensure the successfid attainment of the outcomes.
Wehave nonetheless defined the specific benchmarks that are critical to theprogram and
we have identified these as the Board Conditionsfor PAL-2 and proposed triggers for
PAL-3.

5.      The following section provides details of the context within which the
program was developed and of recent economic developments. It also sets out our
reform objectives and identifies the strategic themes which we continue to use to ensure
intemal coherence as we continue to develop and implement our program.

                                      Background

6.      Following the economic and financial crisis of 1996-97, Bulgaria has achieved
macroeconomic stability and implemented the first generation of structural reforms.
Macroeconomic stabilization has been successfully maintained over the past four years
largely due to the Currency Board Arrangement (CBA) and a tight fiscal stance. After a
steep decline in 1996-97, output recovered and GDP growth averaged 4.7 percent in
2000-02, and 4.3 percent in 2003, with inflation contained to low levels. There have
been major structural changes inthe economy, with private sector share o f GDP reaching
64 percent in2002 as a result o f a major push inprivatization in 1998-99 and continuing
efforts thereafter.

7.      Although Bulgaria's per capita GDP has recovered since the crisis, it is still
one of the lowest among the EU accession countries. We intend to raise incomes from
the current low levels, which are 26 percent of the European Union (EU) average inper
capita terms (based on purchasing power standards). We believe that sustained growth
will help us make important progress in reducing unemployment and raising living

                                                                                            Annex 5
                                Government o f BulgariaPAL-2 Letter o fDevelopment Policy
                                                                                        Page 5 of 55

standards. The resumption of growth has been instrumental in reducing thepoverty rate'
by nearly two-thirds in 2001 compared to the level in 1997.

8.      We also recognize that participation in the benefits from growth over the
past four years has been uneven among the population. Economic restructuring,
which has been one o f the major drivers o f growth during the past four years, has been
dominated by the exit o f many non-viable state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and by
improvements inefficiency o f privatized enterprises, both of which have resulted inlabor
shedding.     As a consequence, our unemployment rate, based on data from our
Employment Agency, was one o f the highest inthe region at close to 18 percent in2000-
2002.   However, as a result o f improved economic performance, sustained levels o f
growth and net new employment creation in the private sector, supported recently by
active labor market programs, the unemployment rate declined to 14.3 percent in 2003.
Reducing unemployment on a sustainable basis remains one of the areas of major focus
of our economicprogram.

9.      Despitethe significant improvementsin reducingpovertysince 1997, poverty
remains higher than in 1995.               The nature of poverty has evolved, as recent
improvements inwelfare have not been equally distributed across the population. There

minorities - most notably Roma- and families with more than four children. Poverty also
are "pockets o f poverty" among certain groups, particularly the unemployed, ethnic

has a significant rural dimension. We are seeking to tailor our poverty reduction policies
to reach these groups so as to ensure that the benefits o f growth reduce poverty. In
designing our program, we are cognizant of the importance of broader participation in
the growth agenda, and the need to improve the efficiency and coverage of our social
assistanceprograms withinfiscal constraints.

10.     Buildingon the reforms of the past four years, our programfor the medium
term aims to sustain economic growth and reduce poverty. More specifically, our
revised target is to maintain an average annual growth rate of 4.5 to 5.0 percent over the
period 2002-06, while reducing the poverty rate by 50 percent by end-2005 compared to
the level at end-2001,and bringingthe unemployment rate from 18.1 percent in 2000 to
12-14 percent by end-2005. Our strategy for growth and poverty reduction revolves
aroundtwo major themes:

           creating an investment climate that promotes private sector investment,
           restructuring, andproductivity leadingto growth; and
           empowering the population, especially the poor, to participate in economic
           growth.

11.     Our strategy uses private sector initiative as the main engine for aggregate
growth. The private sector is also potentially the major provider o f opportunity to the

'The poverty rate is definedas the percentofthe population below two-thirds the mean 1997 consumption.

poor, especially the large number o f unemployed. Our strategy during the past few years
focused on the divestment o f the state's non-infi-astructure assets and the enforcement o f
financial discipline on the remaining SOEs, thereby creating space for the private sector.
Our current strategy is to unleash private initiative by establishing an investment climate
that will not only increase the level o f investment but also improve productivity o f
existing investments.    Our strategy focuses on the factors that drive investment and
productivity to result in growth, with particular attention to the role o f foreign direct
investments (FDI) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This requires a massive
effort to build credible market institutions, and a careful redefinition of the role of
government together with a significant upgrading of government capacity.

12.     Empowering the population requires investment in human capital in
education and health; and securingprogressin preventingdiscrimination,reducing
institutionalizationof children, and further strengtheningof social protection. Our
focus during the past few years was on designing and strengthening social protection
programs at the time when price liberalization and enterprise restructuring were having
an adverse impact on the poor, especially minorities and disabled who have a very high
representation in persistent pockets o f poverty. While we will continue to fine tune the
effectiveness o f our social protection programs - including the sequencing o f
implementation of an ambitious multi-pillar pension reform - we will broaden our
emphasis to include modernization o f our social services and aligning these with the
requirements o f EU accession together with the introduction o f more demand driven
programs which will allow a fuller participation of communities, NGOs, non-profit and
commercial organizations and the clients o f these services themselves.         We aim at
promoting a more vibrant society which confronts the challenges o f poverty and
exclusion at various levels and with a combination o f public, private and community
resources and increased private initiative inthe most efficient and effective way. We will
design the next stage of reforms ineducation, health, labor markets and social protection
with an explicit aim at promoting broad participation and humanrights and community
and private initiative. We are determined to avoid referring social problems related to
children, disabled andthe elderly to residential institutions inhealth, education and social
protection whenever it is possible by introducing new social care standards and by
encouraging the development o f alternative community based services. We recognize the
importance o f basic education to participation and productivity. Our program combines
structural reforms in education, health, pensions and social services, includingfurther
improvements in social assistance to address the transition needs of thepoor, with efforts
to reduce discrimination and institutionalization,

13.     To implement our growth and poverty-reduction strategy, we continue to
base our mediumterm reformprogramon five pillars:

            Sustaining structural reforms in the enterprise sector focusing on the
            completion o f privatization and on restructuring o f the energy, railway,
            telecommunications, andwater sectors;

                                                                                    Annex 5
                             Governmento fBulgaria PAL-2 Letter ofDevelopment Policy
                                                                               Page 7 of 55

           Establishing a marketfriendly business environment, focusing on reducing
            entry constraints, accelerating exits, securing deregulation and reducing
            regulatory costs, improving the delivery o f public services, and strengthening
            competition;
           Deepening the financial system, addressing the constraints to increased
            lending by the banking system and securing the development o f financial
           markets;
           Improving public sector governance, strengthening public administration
            capacity, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, strengthening
            accountability   and transparency,       strengthening    public    expenditure
           management, and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness o f the judicial
            system;
           Investing in human capital and strengthening social protection, improving
           quality, access and efficiency in education and health, continuing pension
           reforms, increasing social assistance effectiveness and providing for better
           integration o fthe disabled andreducing the institutionalization o f children.

14.     The effectiveness of the above program depends in large part on the
maintenance of macroeconomic stability, to which we are fully committed. We will
maintain the CBA at least until accession to the EU. The C B A has served Bulgaria well,
providing a stable monetary environment, contributing to low inflation, and boosting
confidence. We are filly committed to take all necessary steps to support it. We will
continue to implement a cautious and flexible fiscal policy, which is key to safeguarding
external viability under the CBA.      We aim to reach, and then maintain, a broadly
balanced fiscal stance inthe medium term, remainingprepared to adjust our fiscal policy
incase of hrther widening of the external current account deficit. The external current
account deficit has recently deteriorated from 4.3 percent o f GDP in 2002 to a projected
8.5 percent in20032 as a result o f faster import growth, fieled by rapid domestic credit
expansion.    Nevertheless, foreign exchange reserves continue to increase due to the
higher FDI inflows, mainly greenfield, and continuing repatriation o f bank assets held
abroad. The economy is becoming more competitive, and investment is increasingly
financed by private savings. We expect the external deficit to continue to be mostly
financed by FDI, and thus reserve levels to remain comfortable, and the debt-to-GDP
ratio to continue to decline. At the same time, inflation is expected to remain low, with
price increases relative to our trade partners limited to productivity catch-up and firther
adjustments in administered prices.     The IMF Board approved a two-year Stand By
Arrangement (SBA) on February 27, 2002, which following an extension to March 15,
2004, has been completed satisfactorily. A new two year precautionary agreement is now
beingnegotiated.

15.     In the section below we set out program objectives and progress for each of
the five pillars of the program. PAL-2 Board Conditions and PAL-3 proposed triggers
are highlighted inbold.

         Implementingthe PrivatizationProgram

16.      We will continuethe momentumof structuralreformswhich will providethe
foundation for sustained growth. We have completed the divestiture of around 95
percent o f non-infrastructure SOES.~Inaddition, with the sale of the State Savings Bank
(DSK) about 98 percent of the assets of the banking system and 100 percent of the
insurance sector are now inprivate hands.4 We are accelerating restructuring initiatives
in the energy, railway, and water sectors. We have determined which enterprises will
remain state owned, and we are doing our utmost to sell the remainder. We have
approved a new privatization strategy for the Bulgartabak Holding and the Holding has
appointed a financial adviser to assist it on privatization and restructuring o f the entities
o f the Holding. We are under PAL-2 preparation undertakingsocial impact assessments
ofBulgartabak privatization andrestructuring and o frailways restructuring. We will also
ensure that the reforms continue to be implemented in compliance with our
environmental policies.

17.      The next phase of the privatization and restructuring program focuses on
infrastructure SOEs. We have begun this phase of privatization which involves the
restructuring o f the energy, railway, telecommunications, and water sectors with the
objective o f improving efficiency of service delivery through greater private sector
investment and involvement within a framework o f market rules that ensure fair
competition.        To improve transparency, reduce corruption, and accelerate the
privatization process, the legal and institutional framework for privatization was
improved under PAL-1 with the enactment o f the Law on Privatization and Post
Privatization Control and the reorganization o f the PrivatizationAgency. By end-2005,
we expect that the only remaining state enterprises will be those listed in the Matrix of
Performance Benchmarks Annex 6A, reducing the size of thepublic sector to about 25-30
percent of GDP.

        Restructuring the Energy Sector

18.     Our program in the energy sector aims to reduce Bulgaria's energy intensity
and enable the private sector to assume an increasingshare of commercial risks. To
achieve these objectives, we have taken several steps to fundamentally overhaul the
sector. First, we have begunthe process of rationalizing energy prices to cover costs and
eliminate cross-subsidiesby substantially raising electricity and heating prices on July 1,
2002 and July 1,2003. Second, to improve the legal andregulatory framework, we have
passed a new Energy Act consistent with the EU energy directives, adopted key sector
regulations and market opening measures, and upgraded the institutional capacity o f the
State Energy Regulatory Commission.          Third, we have spun off from the National
Electricity Company the distribution and generation companies.            The distribution
companies are in the process of being privatized to strategic investors. Fourth, the
government's District Heating Strategy, which involves commercialization measures in
the short term and privatization in the medium term, i s being implemented. This also
provides for implementingtariff and subsidy adjustments. Finally, the gas sector, which
i s currently dominated by the state-owned Bulgargas, i s gradually being opened to the
private sector through licensing the development o f low pressure gas distribution
networks. Tenders for licenses for two o f the eight regions have been successfully
completed. The energy regulator is in process o f conducting two more tenders and i s

working on the preparation o f the procedures to award the remaining regional licenses
through a competitive process.. The energy reforms are expected to reduce Bulgaria's
energy consumption to GDP by 15percentin 2005 compared to the level in 2001.

 19.    In the railway sector, our restructuring program aims to increase efficiency,
ensure financial sustainability, and improve staff productivity, while significantly
decreasing subsidies to the railways sector. According to the new Law on Railway
Transportation adopted in November 2000 and in force from January 1, 2002, the
National Company "Bulgarian State Railways" was split into two separate enterprises:
the railway operating company ("Bulgarian State Railways" EAD) and the railway
infrastructure State enterprise (National Company "Railway Infrastructure"). We will
ensure that the new railway carrier operates independently and is guided solely by
commercial objectives. The new railway infrastructure state enterprise will prioritize its
expenditures on the basis o f economic criteria and in the course o f time it will contract
out most o f its activities. Market rules are being establishedthat will enable the entry o f
private firms and the eventual privatizationo f the railway operating company, and ensure
fair competition between all land transport operators.        The program also includes
introducing freedom to set tariffs for the railway operating company, rationalization o f
the railway network and services, introduction o f public service obligation (PSO)
contracts with the government to pay for the non-commercial services it does not want
terminated, termination o f loss-making services and the reduction o f the labor force. By
2005, we expect that the railway companies will reduce losses, improve the condition of
the rail network, and partially renew the rolling stock. By end 2004, the railway labor
force will be reduced by 20percent compared to the end-2001 level and by end 2005 the
railway operating company will have achieved afinancial working ratio of 105percent
(before subsidies and PSOpayments). By end 2005, operating subsidies (excluding loans
and grants for investment) will be reduced from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2000 to 0.2
percent of GDP.

        Liberalizing the Telecommunications Sector

20.     In the telecommunications sector, consistent with our EU accession
agreement we have liberalized the market, with limited exceptions, on January 1,
2003. We have signed a Share Sale Agreement with an investor and expect financial
completion o f the privatization o f the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC) in
2004 without extending its exclusive rights. A new Telecommunications Law was passed
by the National Assembly in September 2003.                This new law replaces the
Telecommunications Law of December 2001, and is consistent with best practice and our
EU accession agreement; reinforces the Communications Regulation Commission's
(CRC) independence, transparency, and accountability; ensures an effective legal
enabling environment for the liberalization o f the telecommunications market and for
effective and fair competition. We have a program for the institutional strengthening o f
the CRC, including ensuring its financial independence. To ensure a competitive market,
BTC will share its infrastructure with other market participants. W e are committed to
implementing the time-bound EUaccession commitments. In2004, we will undertake as
a priority an analysis of competition in the market to assess and be a W h e r guide
toward, inter alia, implementation o f our commitments to the EU, implementation of the
new Telecommunications Law, the extent of broadband access and competition, indirect
access, andprovision o f universal access. This analysis will form the basis o f an updated
sector policy and action plan. By the end of 2005, we will achieve a degree of
digitalization of transfer network of 100 percent, of exchanges 82 percent, and of
subscribers capacity 46 percent.       The number of households with telecommunication
services allowing internet access will be 94percent. Telephoneconnection waiting time
for new applications will not exceed one month.

        Modernizing the Water Sector

21.     In the water sector, our modernization program addresses the problems of
inefficiency, water losses, and lack of investment.         Under PAL-1 we approved
amendments to the Water Law which regulates the awarding o f concession contracts to
private operators for the Regional Water Companies (RWCs). We are now developing a
revised approach to securing private sector participation in the management o f the
RWCs. Under PAL-1 we submitted to National Assembly an amendment o f the Water
Law to restructure and decentralize the RWCs whereby municipalities are expected to
have full control over the assets within their territory. The government has also made
progress under PAL-2 in developing the framework for a water regulator to ensure that
quality services are provided at affordable prices. Further, under PAL-2 a Water Sector
Strategy has been prepared and approved by the government. By end-2005, we expect
reduction of the operating ratios (the ratio of operating costs including depreciation to
total revenues) of Regional Water Companiesto 80percent.

        ManagingEnvironmentalRisks

22.     We will continue the momentum in environmental reforms to meet the
challenges of EU accession compliance to environmental acquis. We will further
increase our efforts and improve environmental protection policy by harmonizing
environmental laws and regulations with those o f the EU and strengthening the capacity
o f environmental institutions and agencies to enforce environmental laws andregulations.
To this end, under PAL-1we adopted a new Environmental Protection Act which is fully
harmonized with EUacquis. UnderPAL-2 we sought to implement the provisions of the
EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, and to extend the
issuance o f integrated permits. To be able to preserve the integrity o f the national
environment we will improve our sector and regulations and will prevent
overexploitation, andguarantee sustainable utilizationo fresources. We will underPAL-
3 develop a Natural Resource Management Strategy which will ensure that land, forests
and biological resources are used inenvironmentally sustainable way. By end-2005, we
expect to issue 225 integrated environmental permits under the IPPC directive and by
end-2007, we will have issuedpermits to all enterprises covered by theIPPCdirective.

             Pillar 11: Establishing a Market-friendly BusinessEnvironment

23.     While the liquidation of loss-making SOEs and the implementation of the
privatization program have increased productivity, future growth will depend on
the emergence of dynamic private sector enterprises.             Experience in advanced
transition economies indicates that gains from further labor shedding and other defensive
restructuring measures will taper off over time.      New sources of growth will have to
come from increased investment by the private sector in both new as well as existing
enterprises. W e believe that attracting FDIand developing a dynamic S M E sector are the
best ways to expand private sector activity. We have undertaken measures to improve
the business environment focusing o n reducing entry barriers and regulatory costs,
improving public services to the business sector, and ensuring the stability of market
rules and regulations. We have also under Pillar IV of our programunder PAL-2 begun
developing detailed plans for comprehensive reforms that would result in improvements
inthe efficiency and effectiveness ofthe public administration andofthejudiciary. With
these reforms, we hope to attract FDI at an average annual rate of US$ 1.0 billion (of
which greenfield FDIwould be at least 50percent) during 2002-05; by 2005 increase the
share of SMEs' in value added and employment to at least 50percent; by 2005 increase
the private sector share of GDP to 70 percent; and during the period 2002-2005 to
increase totalfactor productivity by 2.5percent annually.

        Reducing Entry Constraints and Regulatory Costs

24.     We are streamlining the regulatory regimes that increase costs of private
sector transactions.       The Inter-ministerial Working Group for the Optimization of
Regulatory Regimes has reviewed 360 regulatory regimes and approved a program
eliminating 71 andmodifying 121o f these regimes. Under PAL-2 the original target was
that 40 o f these regimes were to be eliminated and 50 modified. Inpractice w e were able
to eliminate 52 and modify 92 such regimes under PAL-2. The company registration
procedure will also be simplified, reducing the time for company registration documents
processing by integrating the Bulstat, tax, and social security registrations. In addition,
the performance o f the regional courts in the company registration process will be
improved by integratingthem in the unified information system. To monitor the impact

o f these reforms, we are conducting annual surveys on regulatory regimes application
costs - we launched the second such survey under PAL-2 - and will use the results for
program evaluation and for further streamlining regimes if necessary. We envisage the
streamlining of regulatory regimes as an ongoing objective o f public administration
reform. An Internet-based public register o f current operative regulatory regimes was
also introduced under PAL-2.

25.     W e have also taken steps to ensure that the introduction of future regulatory
regimes is based on a clear rationale, an analysis of costs and benefits, and on
consultation with affected business parties. To control the future development of
regulatory regimes, we have developed and the National Assembly has enacted the Law
on Administrative Regulation and Administrative Control on Economic Activities which
defines the principles to underpin the introduction      o f new regimes and to guide
government actions. The C o Mis working on specific guidelines to central administrative
bodies regarding the design o f proposed new regulatory regimes, including the
identification and measurement of costs and benefits and the establishment o f a process
by which new regimes evolve from concept to implementation. By end-2005, we expect
at least 50percent of our currelit regulatory regimes to be either eliminated or modified
thereby significantly reducing the regulatory costs compared to the 2002 baselinefigure
as measured by the recently completed Administrative and Regulatory Cost Survey
(ARCS).

        ImprovingBusiness Service Delivery by Government Offices

26.     In parallel to the regulatory reform efforts, we are implementing reforms to
front line government offices and agencies to improve service delivery and increase
effectiveness and cost effectiveness. Institutional development initiatives are ongoing in
Customs, the General Tax Directorate, the Real Estate Registry Office, the National
Social Security Institute, and various regulatory agencies such as the State Energy
Regulatory Commission and the Communications Regulation Commission.                For the
regulatory regimes that are considered essential, the cost o f compliance will be reduced
by simplifying the administrative processes. A review has under PAL-2 been initiated in
three sectors - construction, tourism, and food processing - that account for about 10
percent o f GDP and are subject to a maze o f administrative requirements. The process
simplification initiative will be expanded to other sectors in the future. We have also
under PAL-2 piloted a performance standard monitoring system in government offices
that deal with the construction and labor services, after which we intend to expand the
monitoring system to other offices dealing directly with the private sector. Also under
PAL-2 we initiated the introduction o f the measures adopted at the TTSFE pilot sites at
other agreed border crossing points and internal customs offices. This will be rolled out
under PAL-3. Under PAL-2 we initiated the establishment o f the National Revenue
Agency. Finally, we are reviewing and prioritizing information system changes, which
will enable under PAL-3 the integration o f all corporate and govemment revenue
information.    By 2005, we expect the government offices to achieve a 90 percent
performance against standard during theyear.

       Ensuring Competition and Functioning Markets

27.    We are committed to creating a level playing field for economic activities and
functioning markets.      To improve the effectiveness o f the Commission for the
Protection of Competition (CPC), under PAL-1 we enacted amendments to the Law on
the Protection of Competition. These amendments expanded the prerogatives o f the
Commission and provided a detailed regulation of the procedure for the acquisition o f
pieces of evidence, including the option o f forced acquisition.      At the same time,

                                                                                 Annex 5

obligatory judicial control over all acts of the CPC was introduced. Under PAL-2 we
created conditions for the improvement and strengthening o f the institutional capacity o f
the Commission with technical assistanceprovided under an EUfinanced project. Under
PAL-3 we will implement a program to improve further the competitive environment.
We adopted under PAL-1 the Law on State Aid consistent with the EU acquis
communautaire. By end 2005 it is intended that based on survey evidence we will be able
to demonstrate increased competitiveness of the private sector compared to theposition
in 2002.

28.      In line with our commitments under ASAL 11, we will abstain from
establishing an agricultural commodity market stabilization facility, except an
intervention agency which is specially required to implement the EU's Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) as a condition for EU accession.              The Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) will give precise definition to these requirements,
demonstrating that they are the minimumrequired, and allowing a clear distinction to be
drawn between CAP interventions and non-CAP interventions.              Regarding stock
rotations, we will minimizetheir effect on marketsby makingthem more predictable and
transparent. To improve market entry in the private grain storage, the government will
pass legislation so that only one category o f warehouses is licensed and eligible to issue
warehousereceipts.

29.      In the area of agricultural finance, a level playing field will be promoted by
reducing the budget allocation for short term credit by the State Fund Agriculture
to zero starting in 2003, and ensuring that total 2003 short term credit extended
fromfunds repaidfrom previous years' loans were no more than one-half the total
amount of short term credit in 2002 (i.e. BGN 12.5 million, which is one-half o f the
2002 allocation o f BGN25 million), andwill reduce to zero in2004 and thereafter. Any
long-term credits (those with a maturity o f more than one year) will be allocated
according to transparent and widely publicized criteria; have well defined beneficiaries;
and be minimallydistorting. Finally, we will maintain stability inthe agricultural trade
regime, refraining from temporary import tariffs or exemptions, and from quantitative
restrictions. Any import duties applied will be incompliance with commitments with the
EUandunderGATT.

30.    Our New Social Policy Strategy aims at further aligning our labor market
with the requirements of EU accession. Our aim is to maintain and where possible
increaseflexibilityandfurther reduceunemploymentincludingthe shareofthe long
term unemployed. Our policies include deregulation of labor relations through changes
to the Labor Code; and devolution o f responsibility for determining the labor relations to
social partners, which entails adequate and genuine representation of employers and
employees insocial dialogue.

31.    We have approved and submittedto the NationalAssembly for enactmentof
amendments to the Labor Code under PAL-2 so as to include specific anti-
discrimination provisions. We also completed the enactment of a specific Anti-
discrimination Act. We are determined to free our labor markets from any form o f
discrimination so that all can have equal access to work. We are constantly monitoring
andevaluating the adequacy of the social safety net for displacedworkers and seeking to
design and implementwhere appropriate active labor market policies that would facilitate
the transition from old to new jobs and from social assistance to employment. Under
PAL-3 we will enhance the scope and quality o f employment services, such asjob search
assistance and counseling, by, inter alia, removing regulatory and bureaucratic barriers
for private service provision and by introducing the one-stop-shop process model in our
public employment services and deploying a larger part of staff o f the National
Employment Agency to work directly and on an individualbasis with each unemployed.
We have under PAL-2 created a Working Group in the Ministry of Labor and Social
Policy, specifically charged with monitoring, analysis and evaluation o f employment
programs, and we have changed our monitoring and evaluation procedures to focus on
outcomes andnet impacts rather than inputs. By end 2005, we intend to have achieved a
reduction in unemployment, in the share of long-term unemployed, and in youth
unemployment (based on laborforce surveys)

        Improvingthe Efficiency of the InsolvencyRegime

32.     To facilitate the exit of non-viable enterprises, we have sought to complete a
number of initiatives that aim to accelerate the insolvencyprocess. First, under PAL-
 1 we submitted to the National Assembly proposed amendments to Part IV of the
Commercial Code to simplify the insolvency procedure, establish shorter and binding
deadlines, and provide more powers to creditors.      Second, under PAL-2 we began an
overhaul of the Civil Procedure Code to streamline the cumbersome procedures that
cause delay in insolvency proceedings and in disposal of assets under liquidation. Third,
under PAL-1 w e developed a program establishing more stringent criteria for the
licensing and dismissal oftrustees, and, under PAL-2, strengthening their monitoring and
control by the Ministry of Justice and the courts. Finally, institutional reforms in the
judiciary, discussed in Pillar IV, will upgrade the skills of execution judges and improve
the efficiency of court administration.     We will develop a system of monitoring the

                       Pillar111:Deepeningthe FinancialSystem

33.     While Bulgaria has achieved significant progress in restructuring the
bankingsystem, financialintermediationremainslow but is rapidly increasing, and
financial markets are relatively undeveloped. About 98 percent ofbanking assets are
now in private ownership, mainly by foreign financial institutions, as a result o f an
aggressive privatization program in 1999-2001 and the privatization of DSK Bank in
2003 under PAL-2. Non-bank financial institutions do not constitute a major component
o f the financial system, and capital markets and micro-finance are undeveloped. The
government's objectives in this sector are to achieve a steady sustainable increase in
financial intermediation and to stimulate financial markets as described below. As a
benchmark, by 2005, we would like to see the M2/GDP ratio increasefrom 42percent in
2001 and 43percent in 2002 to 50percent.

        Improvingthe LegalFrameworkfor Lending

34.     The legal and institutional framework for lending is being improved to
encouragefinancialintermediationand ensure stability of the financialsystem. The
foreclosure provisions o f the Civil Procedure Code were under PAL-1 amended to help
reduce delays inenforcement o f valid claims. The Accountancy Act and the Independent
Financial Audit Act were enacted under PAL-2 to bring the current standards to
international standards thus improving the quality o f financial information. International

accounting standards are already applied by the financial sector and companies listed on
the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. Finally, we have enacted under PAL-2 the Law on
Measures Against Terrorist Financing and amended the Law on Measures Against
Money Laundering in line with international standards and good practices. We expect
that these reforms will be factors in achieving sustainable increases in private sector
loans to GDPfrom I 5 percent at end 2001 to levels which are sustainable and in line
with those in advancedtransition economies, whilemaintainingprudential standards.

       CompletingBankingReform

35.    We will sustain the implementation of the agenda for banking reform. The
privatizationof the State Savings Bank (DSK) was completed under PAL-2 during2003.
We reviewedunder PAL-2 the activities of the state-owned Business Promotion Bank -
which was establishedas a conduit for funds from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW)
o f Germany to SMEs - to ensure that the bank does not engage in functions that are
currently being performed by the private banks. The articles o f incorporation of the
Business Promotion Bank prohibit the bank from accepting deposits from the population.
We will work with the Bank in defining and designing appropriate activities for the
Business Promotion Bank. The Bank Bankruptcy Law has been enacted to improve the

exit process for insolvent and closed banks. The supervision powers of the BNB have
been strengthened under PAL-2 to enable BNB to identify and investigate direct and
indirect owners of banks. By end-2004, the private sector share of banking assets is
expected to be about 98percent;6 during 2004-05, we will ensure that the banking system
meets theprudential standards; and we will take the necessary actions to ensure that the
level of non-performing loans does not deteriorate.

         Developing FinancialMarkets and Improving Supervision Coordination

36.      W e are taking measures to stimulate capital markets. The development of the
pension fund and insurance sectors is intended to mobilize long term savings which could
be invested in long term financial instruments in the market.                 Other capital market
initiatives include under PAL-1 privatizing the dominant State Insurance Company
(DZI), and under PAL-2 strengthening the governance structures of private pension
funds, and legislating a higher and stable contribution rate to the mandatory second pillar
o f the pension system. To improve investor confidence, the CommerciaZ Code and the
Law on Public Offering of Securities have been amended under PAL-2 to address
deficiencies in minority shareholder protection and to strengthen corporate governance
provisions.   To protect investors, we have upgraded the supervision capacity o f the
Bulgarian National Securities Commission, the State Insurance Supervision Agency, and
the Insurance Supervision Agency, and later (inMarch 2003) moved over to consolidated
supervision o f the non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) by merging the three
supervisory & regulatory agencies.

37.      W e have established the Consultative Council for Financial Stability, a
separate body of senior officials from all financial services supervisory agencies to
ensure proper coordination and development of a system-wide perspective in
assessing and dealing with risk and vulnerability. This body serves as an information
sharing and policy oversight organ.            Information is shared among members of the


  The Municipal Bank (owned by the municipality o f Sofia) and the Business PromotionBank are the only
remaining non-private sector banks, and these two banks accounted for only 2.5% of banking assets as of
end-2003.

Council to plan and coordinate against any major vulnerabilities within the financial
sector, while improving investor confidence and buoyancy o f the market. Through such
sharing o f information, it is expected that the coordination of functions of the various
supervisory agencies can be improved, especially where supervisory functions over-lap
and where consumer protection and prudential regulation are of prime importance. By
end 2004, the combined pension fund portfolio is intended to reach 2 percent of GDP;
also by end 2004, pensionfund portfolio rate of return is intended to be higher than real
wagegrowth and state bondyields.

including strengthening the capacity o f the public administration, improving service
delivery, strengthening public expenditure management, reducing corruption, and
pursuing fundamentaljudicial reform.

        ReformingPublicAdministration

39.     Our public administration initiatives under PAL-1 focused on selective
                      .
government offices and agencies whose reforms were linked to sectoral strategies
and policies. The reforms indistrict heating, water, andrailways inPillar Ideal with the
areas o f public administration that receive large budgetary subsidies. We have also in
Pillar I1 given priority to the reform o f government agencies involved in revenue
collection, including the establishment o f the National Revenue Agency and the
strengthening o f Customs Administration. As described in the section on improving
market institutions in Pillar 11, we are now implementing initiatives to improve the
service provision o f government offices, including local ones, that deal directly with the
private sector. Inaddition, the supervisory agencies in energy, telecommunications, and
the financial sectors are being strengthened.       Under PAL-3 we intend to pursue the
restructuring o f the public institutions in the education and health sectors, which are the
main areas of public sector overstaffing. Finally, we are taking steps under PAL-2 and
PAL-3 to improve the efficiency o f delivery o f social assistance.

40.     We have adopteda comprehensiveapproach to public administrationreform
and have under PAL-2 approved an updated medium-term public administration
reformstrategyand actionplan         - the Strategyfor StateAdministrative Modernization -
from Accession to Integration. The strategy makes provision also for the setting up o f a
program o f fimctional reviews o f different ministries and agencies to align structures and
staffing with program priorities. We have also under PAL-2 implemented a rigorous
system for monitoring the outcomes o f our public administration reform program, and
have published the first set o f results in our third annual report on the functioning o f the
public administration.    We will begin under PAL-3 to monitor the outcomes o f our
program in the areas o f merit; depoliticization; implementation o f performance related
pay; implementation o f functional review recommendations; and performance against
service standards.

a broader inclusive process for the discussion of Public Administration Reform
issues. A Council for State Administration Modernization has been created, which is
meeting on a regular basis to coordinate the development andmonitor the implementation
o f the Strategy. Three working groups were set up under the Council dealing with central
government reform, local and regional government reform and service delivery, in
particular e-governance. These working groups track the implementation o f individual
measures under the strategy against set strategic objectives. The working groups under
the Council include the participation o f external experts and NGOs, such as the National
Association o f Municipalities. This will ensure the creation o f a broader participatory
process on issues o f administrative reform. By the end of 2006, the civil service at all
levels of government should be based on merit; be depoliticized; display a service and
performance orientation; have strong internal and external accountability frameworks;
be based on appropriate structures and be of appropriate size; be competitively
remunerated so as to be able to avoid serious recruitment and retention problems; and
have administrative capacity developed to an appropriate level for a1 key areas of EU
accession and integration.

42.     We have sought under PAL-2 to strengthen merit and depoliticization by
completing a set of major amendments of the Civil Service Law and of the Law on
StateAdministration. The amended versions o fboth laws provide for the introduction of
mandatory competitive selection for new entrants to the civil service.

43.     Secondary legislation that will define the mechanisms for competitive
recruitment was adopted in January 2004. This will ensure that the PAL-3 trigger
relating to the percent o f officials to be recruited by external competitive recruitment in
2004 can be achieved. At present, the option has been created to download and to fill up
the forms used to apply for the vacant positions in on-line mode within the Registry o f
administrative structures, with the objective to create equal opportunities for the persons
from isolated areas applyingfor positions inthe state administration.

44.     A planfor the conversionof all postshigherthanjunior expert inthe central
administrationfromLabor Code to CivilService status has been adopted inFebruary
2004 linked to implementation o f the new Classifier of Civil Service Positions under the
amended Civil ServiceLaw.

45.     The draft amendments to the Law on State Administration also providesthe
necessary clarifications of the role and the positionof political cabinets in the state
administration. This will define the distinction between political positions, in the
cabinets, and professional positions in the state administration. By end 2006, the civil
service will be increasingly merit-based; depoliticized; and rules-based; as demonstrated
through monitoring of positions filled though competitive recruitment; the results of
repeat public ofjcials surveys; demonstrated low turnover at change of government or
change of Minister; and monitoring of numbers and locations and changes in political
appointees.

46.     Under PAL-2 the performanceappraisal system was introduced in all core
ministries by the end of 2003 and will be extended to all first and second line
spending institutions under PAL-3 by the end of 2004. Pay reform measures have
been put in place, consolidating the different elements of civil service pay into a basic
salary and a supplement for years of service. In 2004 we have also introduced a new
system of performance-related pay and career advancement, linked to the results of the
performance appraisal system. Under PAL-3 we intend to make progress inmakingcivil
service pay in areas of recruitment and retention difficulty more competitive with the
private sector.   Also under PAL-3, performance-based wage determination will be
extended across the public sector. By end 2006, civil service employment conditions will
be increasingly competitive with the private sector as demonstrated through declines in
vacancy levels on areas of recruitment and retention dficulty; increases in civil service
pay; and increase in the internal decompression ratio (ratio of base pay for graduate
entrant to Deputy Minister).

47.     We.intend to proceed with the re-organization of all ministries along the
principlesset out in the amendedLaw on StateAdministration through a process of
functional reviews. These will align Ministry and agency structures, functions and
staffing with those required to deliver key government work program priorities andput in
place administrative capacity as required to meet the requirements of EU accession and
integration. Functional reviews were carried out under PAL-2 in 2003 for three pilot
ministriedagencies, the recommendations of which are to be implemented under PAL-3,
with a further ten pilots also to be completed under PAL-3. By end 2006, government
structures, functions, stafing levels and skills will be appropriate for the effective
delivery of priority government work program objectives and requirements of EU
integration.

48.     We have developed plans for improving service delivery under PAL-2. A
plan for an integrated system for the management of performance in the state
administration has been created Ministries will be asked to define their performance
objectives on an annual and tri-annual basis, and these in turn will be reflected in the
program budgeting system.       The performance objectives will then be linked to the
performance management and appraisal system for individual civil servants which has
been put in place for all first and second line spending institutions in 2003. Specific
performance standards for officials involved in delivering services to the public will be
adopted as a way to improve the quality of service delivery. Institutional performance
mechanisms for service delivery institutions will include service charters and will be
rolled out in 2005.      We have made it our goal to implement a comprehensive
performance management system by the end of 2007.

49.     A system for the delivery of administrative services built on the one-stop
shop principle is being introduced on a pilot basis in five central administrative
structures and six regionaladministrationsand they will be completedunder PAL-
3. Based on the preliminary results of these pilots as well as based on the results o f the
self assessment o f service delivery mechanisms conducted by all central state

                                                                                  Annex 5

administration bodies involved in public service delivery, the government has made a
decision for the phased introduction o f a program to determine and publish service
delivery andperformance standardsfor all lineministries, agenciesandmunicipalities.

50.      The system of professional development in the state administration is being
enhanced.      The problem o f the allocation o f premises to the Institute of Public
Administration and European Integration has been effectively resolved, which will
provide the Institute with an improvedbasis to provide a comprehensive range oftraining
programs. The programs of the institute reflect the needs o f the administration to build
capacity in key policy areas related to the EU accession process. In addition the
mandatory budget allocation o f training funds from the payrollbudgetso f individual state
institutions, currently set at up to 0.8%, provides an improved financial basis for staff
development policies.

51.      The government has adopted an Electronic Governance Strategy. Significant
progress has been made on the development o f the infrastructure required for the
effective operation o f on-line services to citizens. The optical cable network has now
been expanded and covers 60 percent o f the administrative buildings, even though at
present it embraces the administrations at the regional level only. The extension of the
network to the municipal level will be required to ensure an effective operation o f e-
services and is planned by the end o f 2005. The government is also finalizing the
electronic registry o f state institutions, including a database o f all existing business
regulations as well as on line forms for customs and tax claims and applications. The
register i s expectedto be accessible on line bythe end o f 2003 andwill constitute a major
step forward in creating a transparent and accessible administration. Based onfeedback
mechanisms to be designed, we expect to see continued improved annual trends in public
perception of our reform efforts.

52.      Under PAL-3 we aim to make a significant step forward through exposing
the provision of administrative services to competition and allowing for the
outsourcing of administrative services to the private sector, with both the framework
for this and a number of pilots havingbeen completed by the end of 2006. By end 2006,
improvement in quality of services being delivered should be being demonstrated through
results of service delivery surveys; self-assessments by agenciesproviding administrative
services; evidence of an increase in the morale of public officials from public officials
surveys; a significant increase in the number of e.services being delivered; an increase in
performance orientation on the part of civil servants as measured in public officials
surveys; and careful monitoring of the extent to which administrative services have been
subject to competition, and the degree to which outsourcing has been introduced.

        Reducing Corruption

53.     Under PAL-1 we adopted a National Anti-Corruption Strategy which took a
comprehensive and integrating approach to the problem of corruption. Tackling
these problems is a common feature of all components of our program. Under PAL-
2 we took the first steps to seek to translate this ambitious agenda into a sequence of
concrete actions that will allow the government to achieve demonstrable progress in
selected priority areas. Inthis context, we have prepared under PAL-2 concrete steps to
address issues relating to conflict o f interest and asset declarations; set up an inter-
ministerial commission to implement the plan; created a full time secretariat to support
the work o f the commission; and designed a monitoring system to track progress in
meeting the anti-corruption objectives.      Key Ministries and agencies have prepared
detailed and practical anticorruption action plans, including the Ministry o f Interior and
the tax andcustoms administrations.

                                                                                   Annex 5

54.     Going forward, based on our early experiences in this area, the Council of
Ministers has approved an Anticorruption Program for the period 2004 to 2005
which includes specific sectoral anticorruption strategies for education and health;
and the Supreme Judicial Council has approved an anticorruption strategy for the
judiciary. Under PAL-3 we will seek to codify administrative procedures to reduce
inappropriate discretion on the part o f civil servants.         We will amend freedom of
information regulations to provide for more timely access to information and for more
effective and transparent appeals mechanisms. We will also seek to develop further a
series o f joint approaches to specific areas o f anticorruption with business and investor
associations and with NGOs; and also develop curricular and public awareness material.
We will also seek to strengthen further our Regional Anticorruption Councils. By end
2006, our intention is that levels of state capture and administrative corruption will have
been reduced compared to 2001; with the public administration displaying a stronger
external accountability and transparency.

        ImprovingPublicExpenditureManagement

55.     We have under PAL-2 made good progress in strengthening public
expenditure management to increase allocative efficiency and transparency in
budget formulation; strengthen budget execution system and processes; strengthen
the effectiveness of internal and external accountability arrangements; and
strengthenthe system of intergovernmentalfinance. By 2007, center of government
decision-making and public expenditure management systems will demonstrate ability to
prioritize and allocate resources in support of key governmentpriorities.

56.     We are progressing well under PAL-2 in adopting program budgets. The
government's program budgetinginitiative began inthe 2003 budget year with one pilot,
the Ministry o f Environment and Waters. In the 2004 budget two more line ministries,
the Ministry o f Transport and Communications and the Ministry o f Labor and Social
Policy, also developed program budgets. Under PAL-3 four more pilots will be added in
the 2005 budget-the Ministries of Education and Science, Energy and EnergyResources,
Economy, and Youth and Sports. The goal i s to directly link programs, budgeted
allocations, objectives and actual performance targets. At the same time, the National
Audit Office will be releasing a report on the Ministry of Environment and Water's
program budget document, which will be published and presented to the Environment
and Waters Committee of the National Assembly. Inthis way there will be activity on
boththe technical side o f the reform (creating the budgets) and inensuringaccountability
inthe reformprocess andregardingthe reformproduct (on the evaluation side). By end-
2005, the public expenditure allocations process will be markedly improved in these
ministries, which will have an improved ability to prioritize, allocate and manage
resources in support of key government priorities.         The move towards a program
budgetingclassification, and improved detail of the objectives and goals of government,
i s also expected to enhance the transparency o f the national budget and to create
incentives for effective and responsive service delivery to the public, especially in the
area of education.

57.     The medium-term aim is to expand the program budgetinginitiative to all
spending entities in government, with all nineteen line ministries having program
budgets by 2007. To this endwe will be taking a number o f short-term steps to prepare
for future reform. These included developing draft guidelines for the creation o fprogram
budgets in 2003, which will be approved by the Council o f Ministers in 2004. At the
same time, a general strategy for broad program budgeting implementation will be
developed and approved within the Ministry o f Finance.          The general strategy is to
develop some successful pilots to ensure technical experience with the reform and
demonstrate o f the value o f the reform throughout govemment, while at the same time
pursuing a broader program o f distributing guidelines and educating all government
officials so that they will be prepared and accepting o f the reform when it is developed in
their entity.

58.     We are also movingahead under PAL-2 and PAL-3 with the developmentof
the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF).                   By 2006 for the 2007 budget
preparation cycle) the public expenditure management system will be based on the
medium-term MTFF and include elements of outcomes-basedprogram budgeting.

59.     We are improving our public sector capital expenditure management
processesand systems. The Ministry o fFinanceis takinga number o f steps to improve
the processes andpractices involved inplanning, appraising, monitoring and reporting on
capital expenditures.   The 2003 draft guidelines for capital expenditure planning and
appraisal were developed according to European Union standards, and distributed to all
line ministries. These were used as the basis for the guidelines that will be approved by
the Minister of Finance in 2004 to be used for analysis and prioritization o f capital
expenditures inthe 2005 budget. Further, the Ministry o f Finance is developing a system
that will allow for recording, monitoring and reporting on all capital expenditures. The
National Investment Division will be the agency responsible for coordination o f the
national investment policy inthe public sector. By end-2005, the processes for managing
capital expenditures will be standardized and institutionalized, facilitating improvements
in both the efficiency and effectiveness o f capital expenditures and enhanced
accountability.

60.     We are progressing well in implementing a new Financial Management
Information System (GFMIS). The GFMIS is nearly operational for five modules in
two pilot second level spending units inthe Ministry o f Finance (Central Administration
and the General Tax Directorate) and will be extended to all ten second level spending
units in the Ministry in 2004. The long-term aim is to expand the GFMIS to other
spending entities ingovernment. To this end, a number o f further short-term actions have
been taken under PAL-2 and will be continued under PAL-3.               Firstly, a steering
committee has been formed to oversee and manage the implementation o f the GFMIS in
all budgetary units.    Secondly, a draft strategy for full FMIS implementation was
developed by the Ministry o f Finance in 2003, leading to expected approval by the
Council o f Ministers in 2004.       Tied to these steps to improve budget execution

                                                                                  Annex 5

throughout government, we will also be developing procedures and a system for the
management o f EUpre-accession funds and we will be enacting and implementing a new
public procurement law. By end-2005, under PAL-3 the GFMIS will be functional
across the entire Ministry of Finance, improving the efficiency o f financial management
processes and providing a successful pilot for other spending entities to follow. The
government will have developed the capacity to develop this kind o f system and the
overall quality and efficiency o f budget execution will be enhanced. By end 2005, there
should be evidence of increased technical eficiency in budget execution.

61.     We are improving our internal and external audit practices. The Public
Internal Financial Control Agency (PIFCA), has already located internal audit teams in
many government entities and had, by October 2003, located these inall line ministries,
109 municipalities and various other entities. PIFCA has also under PAL-2 established
guidelines for conducting internal audits, which act as the accepted basis for internal
audits throughout government. In 2004 PIFCA will further expand its reach to ensure
that internal audits are carried out in all government entities, annually, according to a
strategic plan, and that internal audits are both reported on and lead to appropriate action
by the Ministry o f Finance. At the same time, the National Audit Office (NAO) will
under PAL-3 be conducting pilot program and performance audits (initially o f the
Ministry o f Environment and Waters), including with respect to quality and quantity o f
output, and developing a multi-year program for audit o f operational and financial
performance inall government ministries and agencies. There will be an increased focus
on ensuring that recommendations from the NAO and PIFCA are acted upon, including
through enacting amendments to the NAO Law to strengthen the responsibility o f
Ministries and agencies to take action inline withNAO recommendations. By end-2005,
there will be improved internal and external accountability in the public expenditure
management process. This is expected to result ingreater incentives for improved fiscal
and operationalperformance, lower corruption and improved transparency. By end 2005,
there should be evidence that NAO and PIFCA reports are leading to appropriate action
(remedial, system andprocess improvements).

62.     We are strengthening the system for intergovernmental finance. During
2003, we reached an agreement with the National Association o f Municipalities to
partially liquidate outstanding local government arrears. This was fully implementedby
the end o f the year. To discourage municipalities from running up arrears in the future,
debt reliefwas provided only to specific categories o f arrears. (The largest single itemo f
debt reliefcompensated for the underestimation o fhospitalcare costs.) The 2004 Budget
fully funds all centrally mandated delegated functions based on agreed expenditure
standards. We also adopted a transparent formula for allocating revenue equalization
grant for the 2004 budget. The 2004 and 2005 budgets should show that conflicts over
unfunded mandates have been reduced and hard budget constraints imposed on
municipalities.

State Gazette on September26, 2003. The amendment to Article 132 o f the Constitution
now limitsimmunityfor memberso fthejudiciary to acts undertaken "during the exercise
of their judiciary prerogatives". The addition o f a new Paragraph 5 to Article 129 o f the
Constitution on the issue of mandates limits senior judicial appointments to five years
with eligibility for a secondfive year periodinoffice. For other memberso fthejudiciary
irreplaceability is conferred under amendment to Paragraph 3 of Article 129 of the
Constitution by decision of the Supreme Judicial Council after five years service and
taking into consideration a performance appraisal; and irreplaceability is further limited
inthat dismissal will occur oncompletion of65 years ofage; resignation; entry into force
o f a prison sentence; or "serious violation or a systematic failure to perform one's official
duties, as well as actions bringing disrepute to the judicial system".      The Ministry o f
Justice developed The Law on Amendments and Additions to the Law on the Judiciary
that was approved by the Council of Ministers, submitted to the National Assembly on
December 17,2003, voted on first reading inJanuary 2004, and enactedinMarch 2004.

64.      Good progress has also been made under PAL-2 in other areas of the judicial
reform program. We have also under PAL-2 launching the reform o fthe administrative
court system to achieve greater specialization. With the assistance of the UNDP and the
EC Phareprogram, the draft o f a new Administrative Procedure Code is being developed.
The draft i s envisaged to be submitted to the Council o f Ministers by the end o f
November 2004. Under PAL-3 we will seek to upgrade the qualifications o f magistrates
in these areas.    A number of surveys and studies to assess public perception of the
judiciary have recently been carried out under PAL-2 (a survey of magistrates' attitudes
with respect to the current judicial systemand plannedreforms; a survey o f the public on
the situation inthe judicial system; and in addition the new Internet page o f the Ministry
of Justice now contains an electronic survey form to capture the opinion o f visitors on
burning issues of the day). The 2004 budget provides for an increase in budget as a
percentage of GDP to be allocated to the judiciary in 2004 compared to 2003. Draft
uniform standards o f service for the administrative staff of the judiciary have been
produced. The Supreme Judicial Council has approved Regulations on the terms and
conditions for the holding o f competitions for the appointment o f magistrates, and
another one for their performance appraisal. By end-2005, the accountability, eficiency
and effectiveness of the judiciay should have increased as demonstrated through
assessment of outcomes under the new accountability framework for judges; monitoring
of case load per judge, securing an increase in the number of judgments enforced, and a
reduction inpending cases and in delays in hearing and resolving cases.

         ImprovingQuality, Access and Efficiency in the Education System

66.      We have developed an approach to achieve reforms at all levels of education,
to improve quality of learning and teaching while strengthening equity, and to
improve the efficiency of resource utilization. We have prepared the concept for an
education reform strategy together with an action plan. As we move further forward
with implementation of our reform agenda, we will increase efficiency inexpenditures on
education as there are signs o f a decline in education quality, as measured by the 1995
and 1999 TIMSS international surveys7 in which Bulgaria participated. The decline in
assessment results reflects the pressures o f a severely strained education system, with
lack o f investments to maintain the system - let alone improve it. Our real outlays for
education fell more precipitously than those in other accession countries during the
1990s, and the share o f education expenditures inGDP i s lower than OECD and first-tier
EU accession countries.. To monitor the impact of our reforms, to make continuous
improvements, and to ensure that optimization o f our network o f schools does not
compromise access but leads to improvements in quality, we under PAL-2 developed
measures for evaluating quality inBulgarian education, at the level o f the system, school,
and student. For the latter, our aim i s to introduce a modernized matura examination at
the end o f the school cycle, as well as to introduce continuous diagnostic assessments at
grades below the final grade. By end 2006, we expect to see improvement in education
quality indicators based on surveys such as TIMSS, PISA and national assessments. By
end 2007, we also hope to achieve levels of expenditure on education that are closer to
OECDlevels.

67.      In 2003, under our Program for Fiscal Decentralization 2003-2005, we
introduced significant changes to the approach for financing education
responsibilities that we have delegated to the municipalities (including general
primary and secondary schools, vocational schools, and the staffing costs o f all day
kindergartens.) and for moving from financing o f inputsto financing based on number o f
students. Significantly, by eliminatingthe automatic reimbursement o f salaries, the new
transfer formula reduces incentives for over staffing. We will continue to improve the
financing formula under PAL-3 to ensure that it provides incentives to municipalities to
optimize their network o f schools and increases incentives for improving quality and
access o f schools, and using all inputs, including staff, optimally. Based on a review o f
management responsibilities and consultation with municipalities, schools and social
partners, we will under PAL-3 clarify the roles and responsibilities o f the Ministry of
Education and Science, municipalities, inspectorates, school directors and school boards
in the management of education. Inparticular, we will amend and enact legislation to
ensure that the responsibility for the decisions on staffing o f schools i s aligned with the


   The most inclusive source of internally comparable data on what students learn is the TIMSS
international science and math assessment w h c h was carried out for a nationally representative sample o f
eighth grade students in 24 countries in 1995 and 39 countries in 1999. Nine EU accession countries
participated, and while Bulgaria scored above the international average in 1995, its score declined to below
average in 1999.

incentives. With these measures, we expect to raise the student-teacher ratio towards the
average level in OECD countries by end 2005 and to improve educational outcomes. By
end 2006, we hope also to be able to demonstrate evidence of improved resource
allocation in higher education.

68.     While the net enrollment ratios of 96 percent in primary' schools indicate
that access is not a problem, we are concerned about the relatively low ratios in
lower secondary (84 percent) and upper secondary' (68 percent) schools. High
unemployment and the perception that secondary education studies are irrelevant are the
possible causes o f the highdrop out rate, particularly in rural areas. But little i s known
about the causes o f the large decline in attendance after primary education. We are
conducting in-depth studies o f the causes o f attrition and we will develop responses to
these. We introduced an obligatory pre-primary school year starting from September
2003 to help preparation o f our children for primary school that now starts relatively late
at age 7. We planto lower the start of elementary school to age 6 while maintainingthe
newly introduced obligatory pre-school year. We have been paying special attention to
children from ethnic minorities and have developed special tools to help them acquire
social skills, accommodate in the school environment and play and learn together with
other children as ethnic minority children are more likely to drop out o f school and under
5% o f Roma children continue to secondary education. By end 2005, our goal is to
increase net enrollment rate in primary school to 97-98 percent, in lower secondary
school to 86-90 percent, and in secondary school to 73-75 percent, by end 2006 we
expect to see a reduction in thegap in enrollment ratesfor minorities.

69.     We havepreparedplansto reduceunder PAL-3 the high numberof children
who are institutionalized in institutions under the Ministry of Education and
Scienceor who are referredto "specialschools'' for the retardedas these childrenoften
fall behind in learning and social integration. Under PAL-2 in 2003 we aligned our
legislation with the new Child Protection Act. This will allow us to move aggressively in
2004 in implementing our plans to reduce the number o f institutionalized children and
those in "special schools". By 2007, we expect to see an increase in the percent of
children in special schools integrated into normal schools.

         Improvingthe Efficiency of the Health System

70.      W e continue the fundamental transformation of the health care system to
improve the health status and to use the available resources more efficiently. The
essence of the health sector reform is the separation of service provision from financing
by strengthening the National Health Insurance Fund(NHIF),which undertakes bothrisk
pooling and health care purchasing functions on behalf o f the population and by
redefining the roles and responsibilities of the Ministry of Health (MoH). We will make
necessary amendments on both the revenue side and the entitlements under the NHIF and
voluntary health insurance schemes to make sure that the whole Bulgarian population
have access to essential services while ensuring its long-term financial sustainability. W e
will also develop a planto address segments ofthe populationwho currently have limited
or no access to either health insurance or health care due to socio-economic status or
ethnicity. Once fully implemented, the reforms are expected to bring about significant
improvement in access to care regardless of socio-economic status, service use according
to need and ultimately improved health and consumer satisfaction.                 By 2005,
administrative costs of NHIF will be less than 3percent of revenues.

71.      W e have developed a long term hospital restructuring strategy, and a short
term action plan, including capital investment requirements of the health sector.
W e plan to implement under PAL-3 the short term action plan to ensure adequate
maintenance and upgrading of existing capital assets, and investment in new equipment
and facilities, so that the quality of care does not suffer, especially inthe hospital sector.
In2003 under PAL-2we have designed anewmechanism for financingessential public
health programs such as Tuberculosis, Immunization and HIV/AIDS and Sexually
Transmitted Diseases; and developed and introduced an essential drug list. W e expect
that this list, together with the list o f reimbursable drugs that the NHIFhas prepared, will
reduce inappropriate use ofpharmaceuticals andwill improve overall resource allocations
in the sector.    We have under PAL-2 designed a unified national policy, strategy and
action plan for pharmaceuticals. We will under PAL-3 move towards institutionalizing
the process of setting standards for health care technologies and accreditation of health
facilities to make the expected gains from the above reforms sustainable over the long-
term. By end 2005, we aim to have completed a new cycle of accreditation of healthcare
facilities; by end 2005 we aim to have in place a system for periodic monitoring and
evaluation of immunization, tuberculosis case detection and treatmentshre and HIV
prevalence rates; by 2006, we aim to have achieved an increase in the utilization of
tracerpreventive service (pap smear, mammography,full immunization).

72.      W e have undertaken measures to prevent worsening of tobacco related
health risks and disease burden. Under PAL-2we decided to earmark 1percent o f the
excise tax collected from tobacco and tobacco products to fund the national tobacco
control program and will design and implement nation wide health programs for tobacco
control. W e are committed to staying the course on the gradual increase o f excise duty
on tobacco products untilwe reach levels described inrelevant EUDirectives. We have
also completed the harmonization o f our tobacco control legislation with relevant EU

and labor markets and to address increasing problems with administering and
targeting disability benefits. We have finalized a new framework embraced in the
Integration of People with Disabilities Act and will secure the enactment o f this under
PAL-3 in2004. We will fully align our primary and secondary legislation to support this
Act which will promote the introduction of European standards. W e expect that as a
result of our actions, disabled people in Bulgaria will have radically improved access to
education, buildings, institutions and services, and that the country will be able to benefit
from the untapped human potential of this diverse group. The historical approach to
disability in Bulgaria has been characterized as a legacy of the socialist society" which
established state owned institutions for residential and employment purposes. This was
accepted as the most appropriate option for disabled people - however this form of `care'
has fostered a highdegree of dependency between the disabled, their family and the state.
The focus was separation rather than integration and this has been at an economic and
social cost. The cost of institutional care in Bulgaria is high compared to the cost o f
home based family care."          However the larger cost relates to the unrealized potential of
individuals as a result of social isolation. Our disability related reforms are aimed at
fostering the recognition and integration of disabled people into mainstream employment
andsocial involvement.

74.      To facilitate the objective of integration, we prepared a strategy to improve
the disability assessment process with aim of shifting the assessment focus from
`disability' to `ability' and to reduce inappropriate incentives to claim disability
status. As a first step, we plan to amend the Public Health Law to provide adequate
representation to NSSI in the Disability Assessment Committee (TELK). Should that
strategy prove insufficient to improve control over disability claims, we shall consider
shifting the TELK function from the Ministry of Health to NSSI altogether in order to
align the assessment o f disability status with resource management responsibilities.
Duringthis shift we will review the substantial changes that are requiredinthe disability
assessment process to promote the objectives of the disability reform strategy. W e will
also develop draft legislation to delink social assistance based benefits from disability
pensions in order to best meet the individual support needs for each person. This will be
assisted by evolving the predominantly medical model o f disability assessment to
embrace key social factors inthe determination of an individual's specific requirements.

75.      The draft Law on the Integration of People with Disabilities envisages the
creation of an implementing agency which will operate at the national level. The
Agency is not envisaged to operate territorial structures across the country. This body
will oversee the ongoing development and implementation and enforcement of disability
related legislation. The Agency for Employment will be required to open and maintain
centers for the formation of vocational skills and in seeking employment. The Ministry

pillar and the second pillar which may mean that under PAL-3 we will need to
revisit sequencing of this reform. The system comprises three pillars: first, the publicly
managed pay-as-you-go       system; second, the mandatory supplementary defined
contribution universal (for those born after Dec. 31, 1959) and occupational (for those
working under hazardous conditions)         pension plans; and third, the voluntary
supplementary plans. We continue the implementation of the planwe developed in2002
to help ensure successful implementation o f the multi-pillar reform and which has the
following main components. First, the contribution rate that will be allocated to the
public and private pillars will be defined through a legislative instrument which remains
effective, by default, over a multi-year period and does not need annual drafting and
approval by the National Assembly. The contribution rate schedules and indexation rules
shall be established on the basis o f modeling the long-term fiscal effects o f various
scenarios. The modeling exercise will be undertaken under PAL-3 inthe course o f 2004.
Second, the legal framework concerning private pension plans and their supervision was
amended under PAL-2 to improve governance structures and supervision capacity,
introduce more flexibility inthe investment regime, and eliminate inconsistencies. Third,
additional regulations will be issued to complement legislation. Fourth, an institutional
development plan will be prepared in 2004 to continue building the capacity o f the
Financial Supervision Commission (FSC). Fifth, further efforts will be made to ensure
timely and accurate contribution reporting and collection and thus enable NSSIto shorten
the time needed to transfer funds to second pillar institutions. Sixth, there will be a
campaign to improve public understanding o f the reform. By 2005, stability will have
been achieved in benefit indexation, contribution rate dynamics, and contribution rates.
By end-2007, the mandatory contribution to the secondpillar will be 5percent.

        Reducing Poverty and SocialExclusionThrough improving the Coverage
        and Efficiency of SocialAssistance Programs and Access to Social Services

77.    W e will further improve the coverage, effectiveness, and efficiency of social
assistance programs in the framework of our new National Strategy to Fight Poverty
and Social Exclusion. The strategy i s built on the government's New Social Policy
Strategy adopted in 2002. Inthe spirit o f this strategy, we improved the effectiveness,
efficiency and coverage o f the Guaranteed Minimum Income and the energy benefit
programs and reformed the child allowance program. Starting from 2003, as part of our
Fiscal Decentralization Program 2003-2005, and through an amendment to the Social
Assistance Act effective January2003, we have assumedcomplete responsibility for most
forms o f social assistance, including direct income support (the Guaranteed Minimum
Income) and the operation of orphanages and other institutions for vulnerable
populations. This will ensure that funding for these programs will be assured, and
eliminate the problems o f arrears and in-kind payments for the Guaranteed Minimum
Income program. With the Law on Family Benefits for Children we have introduced
means-testing into the child-allowance program, and to provide incentives for increased
participation in educational institutions for children o f compulsory school age we have
made them conditional on school attendance for all eligible children between 7 and 16
years. Starting from January 1, 2004 all benefits paid by virtue o f the Law on Family
BeneJitsfor Children are paid by the Social Assistance Agency and the responsibility for
administration o f all benefits related to children was moved to the Ministry o f Labor and
Social Policy. To reduce the incidence of duplication o f benefits and other abuses of the
system, the inspectoratesunder the supervision o f the Social Assistance Agency are now
empowered to verify eligibility for social assistance programs through spot checks. The
amendedact has also supported a reorganization ofour social services in2003. We have
developed implementing regulations and minimum standards for social services and
replaced the previous licensing procedure with a more open but better controlled
registration process. This reform already allows a much broader and more diverse
participation inproviding social services by non-profit organizations, NGOs, commercial
providers and community groups.

78.    W e will continue overhauling our social assistance system by fully
implementing our '%ram Social Assistance to Employment Program" which created
over 100,000 jobs in 2003, reduced significantly the number of long-term
unemployed and led to the decrease in the number of claimants of social assistance
benefits very significantly. To make this happen we will continue the institutional
strengthening of municipal social assistance services, regional labor offices, and local
governments after we have reorganized them in early 2003. In 2003, we launched a
number of innovative, demand driven, community based programs that aim at helping
people in persistent pockets o f poverty, often ethnic minorities, with the help o f the
Social Investment Fund which is being supported by the World Bank through the Social

Investment and Employment Promotion Project (SLEP). A Department has been created
called the Policies, Analyses, and Forecasts Department, charged with carrying out
systematic monitoring and evaluation o f our policies aimed at reduction o f poverty and
social exclusion, and a Working Group in the Directorate for Labor Market Policy
specifically charged with monitoring and assessment of Active Labor Market Programs.
We have developed and will be implementingin 2004 a new mechanism for monitoring
and evaluating the outcomes and net impacts o f employment programs, including,the
"From Social Assistance to Employment" program, and we will continue to adjust our
programs to make them more effective and efficient, producing sustainable positive
outcomes. In the end o f 2004, a study will be carried out for the evaluation o f the net
impact o f active labor market programs and measures aiming at improvingthe efficiency
o f theseprograms and at enhancing the sustainability o ftheir outcomes.

79.     W e will also strengthen the Policies, Analyses and Forecasts Department
responsible for poverty monitoring in the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy to
track and assess the impact of government policies and programs, including the new
measures to strengthen social assistance, on poverty, incomes, and living standards. We
have implementeda multi-topic household survey which will permit this analysis. Based
on updated analysis o f poverty and the effectiveness of social programs, we will further
refine our strategy for reducing poverty and social exclusion. By end-2005 we expect to
reduce the poverty rate of 2001 by at least 50% percent and to reduce the number of
people on social assistance by 100,000.

        ReducingInstitutionalizationof Children

80.     Given the comparatively high level of institutionalization of children in
Bulgaria and the cost for our human and social capital formation we have started
energeticreformsto return childrento their families and communities. In2000, we
adopted a new Child Protection Act which makes institutionalization a last choice that
needs to be approved by the Court in each case and which decision will need to be
reviewed at regular intervals with a view of possible reversal. In2003, we have aligned
the Family Code and number o f pieces of other primary and secondary legislation with
this Act. W e have also adopted a Planfor the Reduction of the Number of Children in
Specialized Institutions during the period 2003 - 2005; introduced new standards for
alternative care services, including foster care; and developed criteria for restructuring
existing child institutions.   We established new child protection departments in all
municipalities to enforce new legislation and to help implement our energetic reforms in
this area.

81.     In 2004, we will continuethe implementationof the Planfor the Reduction of
theNumber of Children in SpecializedInstitutions duringthe period2003 -2005. We
will harmonize all remainingprimary and secondary legislation withthe Child Protection
Act, including transferring the residential institutions of the Ministry of Education under
municipal responsibility. W e will establish a monitoring system for child care services
and for protection o f children's rights at the State Agency of Child Protection (SACP).
The institutional capacity building of SACP and overall policy development in child
welfare is supported by a well coordinated effort o f the EC (twinning arrangement) and
the World Bank in the framework of the Child Welfare Reform Project. This project
helps us establish community child welfare services at local level in which will support
piloting alternative child welfare services.       By the end of 2005 there will be a
demonstrated increase in community based child welfare services. By 2007, there will be
a significant decline in the number of children in specialized institutions.

              CoordinationandMonitoringof MediumTermProgram

82.    Recognizingthe importanceof implementationto the success of the program,
we have continued during PAL-2 preparationwith the institutional arrangements
developed under PAL-1 to ensure effective coordination and monitoring of the
program. The central policy coordination h c t i o n has been performed by the Council
for Structural Policy established by Regulation No 58 of the Council o f Ministers and
chaired by the DeputyPrime Minister andMinister o f Economy. On December 29,2003
the Council o f Ministers adopted Regulation 326 which introduced amendments to the
Council for Structural Policy transforming it into the Council for Economic Policy
(CEP). Membership of the Council has also been broadened and it i s chaired by the
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister o f Economy, and composed also o f the Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Transport and Communications, the Minister of Labor
andSocial Policy, the Minister ofRegional Development and Public Works, the Minister
o f Finance, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, the Minister o f State
Administration, the Minister o f Energy and Energy Resources, the Minister o f Education
and Science, the Minister o f Environment and Waters, the Minister o f Healthcare, two
Deputy Ministers of the Economy determined by the Minister of the Economy, and a
Deputy Minister o f Finance determined by the Minister o f Finance. The Council is a
consultative body o f the Council of Ministers with coordinating, informational and
analytical functions related to the economic policy issues. It formulates the priorities o f
the economic policy of the country, coordinates the activities of the ministries and the
agencies inthe economic policy field, establishesthe priorities inthe accomplishment o f
the state policies related to the encouragement and the implementation o f private and
public investments, coordinates the activity o f the governmental bodies involved in the
implementation o f privatization and o f post-privatization control, and supervises the
overall implementationo fthe reformprogramsupported bythe PALprogram.

83.    The secretariat function continues to be provided by the team in the
Directorate for EU Integrationand Relationswith IFIs at the Councilof Ministers.
The Directorate team i s playing a key coordination role for all activities under the PAL,
both intemally among ministries and institutions involved and externally with
coordination o f donor activities supporting the government program. In addition, we
have established several working groups, among them: the Inter-ministerial Working
Group for the Optimization of Regulatory Regimes, the Consultative Council for
Financial Stability, the Poverty Monitoring Working Group at the Ministry o f Labor and

                                                                                Annex 5

Social Policy, and Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) Unitwith the National
Statistics Institute (NSI).   We also set up the Council for State Administration
Modernization, chaired by the Deputy PrimeMinister responsible for this area, which is
leading on coordination and implementation o f the agenda in this key Pillar IV
component.

84.     W e have established a mechanism for better coordination of donor activities.
In order to make more effective use of donor resources available for our reform and
development programs, we have started developing an enhanced approach to external
assistance by taking the lead in donor coordination. The new process seeks to organize
donor resources around the government's major development priorities. Four thematic
areas for donor support have been identified. These are (i) Business Climate; (ii)
                                                                                 Living
Standards Improvement; (iii)Governance and Public Administration; and (iv)
Infrastructure and Natural Resources Management. Under the new government-led
donor coordination mechanismthat was adopted, the relevant DeputyPrimeMinisters are
responsible for these broad priority areas. Various working groups in each o f these
thematic areas have been established to work at operational level. They are aligned with
government priorities and are ledby DeputyMinisters. The amendments to the Council
for Economic Policy (formerly Council for Structural Policy), introduced in end
December 2003, among other changes codify the Council's lead role in donor
coordination and the establishment o f sector working groups, which are based on the
already existing ones, under overall oversight o f the relevant Deputy Prime Ministers.
The Council o f Ministers' Directorate for EUIntegration and Relations with IFIs acts as
secretariat(coordination unit). We are currently reviewingthese arrangements inlight of
experiences underPAL-2.

85.     W e have developed strategies for participation by stakeholders in the design
and implementation of our reform program. We have regular consultations with the
business and investor associations with respect to the reforms on the business climate,
which have been institutionalized in forums such as the Council on Economic Growth
and the Tax Council which have private sector participation. The future amendments to
the Labor Code would define institutional arrangements to improve coordination and
communication among the government, labor, and employers. We have set up a data
users group to enhance public participation in poverty monitoring, analysis and policy
development. We will ensure local participation inthe governance o f the school system.
We will also establish specialized Administrative Courts to ensure more efficient
processing of complaints about improper imposition or implementation o f administrative
acts bythe government.

86.     W e have also developed several feedback mechanisms to enable us to track
the progress and effectiveness of our reforms.        We have completed the baseline

                          Bulgaria: IMF-WorldBank Relations

                     A. PartnershipinBulgaria'sDevelopmentStrategy

1.      The government's economic program has been underpinnedby a conservative fiscal
policy and significant progress with structural reforms. So far Bulgariahas made substantial
progress towards long-term macroeconomic stability-an      important step along the way to its
ultimate goals of improving living standards and accession to the EU. The wide-ranging
reforms in the government's agenda hinge on the continuing challenge o f macroeconomic
stability in the context o f the Currency Board Arrangement (CBA), sustaining structural
reforms and establishing a business environment conducive to growth, together with
improved governance, a deeper financial system, and investment in human capital and
physical infrastructure.

2.      The IMF has been leading in supporting Bulgaria's medium-term program in
maintaining macroeconomic stability.       Building on the achievements o f the three-year
Extended FundFacility (EFF) arrangement with Bulgaria, in February 2002 the IMF Board
approved a two-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)with Bulgaria. The SBA, with a reduced
scope and detail o f structural conditionality compared to the EFF, focused on medium-term
fiscal challenges and structural reforms with significant macroeconomic, typically fiscal,
implications.    Currently the IMF and the government are discussing a new 2-year
precautionary program.

3.      The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional
reforms aiming at (i)   promoting competitive private sector-led growth; (ii)    strengthening
market institutions and improving both corporate and public sector governance; and (iii)
mitigating the social impact o f restructuring and delivering social services more effectively.
InMay2002the BoardofDirectorsdiscussedthe CountryAssistanceStrategy(CAS) ofthe
Bankwhich outlined the roadmap for the Bank's country support for the period2002-04. In
addition to the Bank's ongoing lending operations in areas such as health, child welfare,
water, trade and transport, environment, land registration and cadastre, the CAS includes a
three-year programmatic adjustment lending (PAL) program of up to three PALSo f up to
US$l50 million each. In February 2003, the Board of Directors approved the first PAL
operation-it   aimed at advancing structural, regulatory, and institutional reforms in the real
and financial sectors. The second PAL, PAL-2, aims at supporting improvements inpublic
sector governance.     The Bank continues to undertake substantive country diagnostics
providing a solid base for policy dialogue and design and implementation o f its lending
operations inBulgaria.

B. IMF-WorldBankCollaborationin SpecificAreas

4.      Ingeneral, the Bank has the leadonthe dialogue on the core structural aspectsofthe
reforms while the Fund has the lead on the dialogue on the macroeconomic, typically fiscal,
aspects o f the reforms. There are a number o f areas where the IMF leads and its analyses
serve as inputs into World Bank policy formulation and advice, including policies to
maintain macroeconomic stability, fiscal policies, income policies and external sector

                                                                                       Annex 7
                                                                                         Page 2



policies. There are other areas inwhich the Bank and the Fund share responsibility and are
coordinating closely their policy advice to the Bulgarian authorities such as in the financial
sector, public expenditure management and budgeting, and tax administration.           In some
areas, the Bank has taken the lead but its analysis, country diagnostic work, and policy
recommendations served as inputs into the Fund's policy advice on the fiscal front such as
education, health care, pensions, social protection, energy, and railways. In areas such as
private sector development, strengthening market institutions (including entry and exit
policies, regulatory reform to enhance the business climate, judicial reform, labor market
reform), and improving governance the Bank has the lead and there has been no
conditionality under Fund programs. In addition to consultations early in the process o f
formulating and adjusting each institution's program with Bulgaria, the Bank and Fund staff
teams interact extensively during the review o f the progress achieved in the country and
coordinate closely their policy advice to the Bulgarianauthorities.

B.1.    Areas where the IMF leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the World Bank
policy formulation and advice.

5.      To achieve the objectives o f its economic program, the Bulgarian authorities are hlly
committed to maintain sound and flexible macroeconomic policies centered on a Currency
Board Arrangement (CBA) and implement an ambitious reform agenda. In particular, the
authorities have maintained a very tight fiscal policy since 1998 and, attaining a deficit of 0.4
percent o f GDP in 2003. The aim is to eliminate the deficit by 2005, conduct fiscal policy.
flexibly in the face o f shocks, and maintain a high level o f fiscal reserve assets. Given the
constraints of the CBA, the authorities see labor market policies as another key component o f
the broad policy strategy. A strict incomes policy for the state enterprise sector is enforced
and measures aimed at facilitating the adjustment o f labor markets are being implemented.
The structural and institutional reforms, which constitute the third pillar o f the policy
strategy, are focused on creating a filly functioning market economy that is competitive and
can flexibly adjust to shocks.

6.      Inthe context ofa 24-month Stand-By Arrangement that expiredonMarch 15, 2004,
the IMF took the lead in assisting Bulgaria in safeguarding macroeconomic stability and
promoting structural reforms in areas that are macro-critical and fall within the Fund's core
expertise.   To safeguard the CBA and ensure that it can continue to serve as the
macroeconomic policy anchor, the IMF set ceilings on the size o f the overall deficit of the
general govemment and quantitative floors on the balance of the fiscal reserve account. To
prevent threats to the currency board and macroeconomic stability that could arise from a
loss in competitiveness or excessive extemal financing requirements, Fund conditionality
also included ceilings on the wage bill o f those state enterprises that have the largest losses
and arrears, are monopolies, and receive subsidies, and on the contracting and guaranteeing
of public sector extemal debt.     A new 2-year precautionary program is currently being
discussed.

                                                                                                Page 3



B.2.    Areas of shared responsibility.

7.      FinancialSector. Inlate 2001, staff of the two institutions carried out ajoint IMF-
World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Bulgaria, providinga shared
perspective on the development agenda o f the country and on the prioritization and
sequencing o f reforms inthe financial sector. Key findings o f the FSAP are conditionalities
on financial sector policies under both the SBA and the PAL program.                     The LMF has
emphasized aspects related to the banking sector-mainly            on policies under the mandate o f
BNB and supervisory agencies-while            the World Bank is focusing on policies that affect
marketperformance and development o fthe financial sector such as improvingthe legal and
institutional framework for lending, restructuring o f the banking sector, strengthening
creditor rights, corporate insolvency and governance, and non-banking financial sector
issues. A focused update of the FSAP was undertaken by Fund staff in the context o f the
2004 Article IV consultation missioninMarch-April 2004.

8.      Since 1997, in the context o f two Finance and Enterprise Adjustment Loans
(FESALs), and now with the PALprogram, the Bankhas supported the government insector
restructuring of the financial sector. Privatization o f commercial banks has been a major
component o f the FESALs, while the Fund provided support for the institution building
efforts o f the BNB and its Banking Supervision Department in particular. Inthe financial
sector, the Bank has focused on banking, insurance, pension funds, and capital markets while
the Fundhas continued its focus on the BNB, bankingsupervision, andthe payments system.

9.      RevenueAdministration. The IMF and the World Bank have been carrying out a
joint effort since 1996 to assist Bulgaria inreforms aimed at the establishment o f an efficient
revenue collection agency.           Diagnostics consistently pointed to revenue collection
deficiencies including weak management, and problematic audit and enforcement o f
collection, which in turn facilitates low compliance. Supporting reform efforts, the World
Bank implementeda project to modernize the Social Security Institute, includingits revenue
collection activities. The IMF provided a long-term advisor to the Ministryof Finance, and
focused advisory services through consulting assignments. Joint World Bank-IMF efforts
resulted in a proposal for "Implementing a Modem Revenue Collection Agency" in March
2000, which i s now moving forward. The World Bank's Boardapproved on June 5,2003 the
Revenue Administration Reform Project (RARP, 3 1.9 million), developed with technical
assistance of the IMF, to support the establishment o f the national revenue agency (NRA),
which seeks to maximize the level o f voluntary taxpayer compliance, promote effectiveness
and efficiency, establish a professional workforce and approach to collection, and help
reduce the scope for corruption. The RARPbecame effective on August 7,2003.

10.     PublicExpenditureManagement. The Bank has taken the lead inthe dialogue on
the efficiency and effectiveness o f public expenditures and has outlined policy directions in
the context o f the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR)' which are being
further supportedby the PAL program. The PEIR has also been a useful input to the IMF
program. The P E R notes that notwithstanding progress to date, important challengesremain
'The  PEIRis entitledBulgaria: Public ExpenditureIssues and Directionsfor Reform, August 2002, The World
Bank, (ReportNo. 23979-BUL)

                                                                                       Annex 7
                                                                                         Page 4



in: (i)improving management and accountability in the use of public resources; (ii)
restructuring and rationalizing intersectoral public expenditure-particularly      energy and
railways, economic services, defense and security, and general services; (iii)   reallocation o f
intrasectoral priorities-especially  inhealth, education, and social protection; and(iv) higher
investment requirements in many sectors-infrastructure      and environment-some      o f which
are priorities for EU accession, and some o f which should involve the private sector. The
PER notes that Bulgaria's main fiscal challenges include working towards an improved
allocation o f expenditures, while gradually reducing the overall level of expenditures over
the medium term in tandem with Bulgaria's fiscal targets o f easing the overall tax burden,
especially payroll taxes.

11.     The IMF has provided long-term technical assistance on budgeting and expenditure
management. To ensure the fiscal discipline necessary to support the CBA, the government
has already initiated a number o f public expenditure management reforms. New budget
procedures were introduced in early 2002 and were implemented for the 2003 budget.
Despite this important progress, the PETR notes that there is a need to continue and broaden
the reform effort4apital expenditure proposals should be prepared under hard budget
constraints and as an integral part o f the medium-term budget frameworks; and the financial
management at the local level should be strengthened. These reforms are also supported by
the Bank through the PAL program.

B.3.    Areas where the World Bank leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the IMF
policy formulation and advice.

12.     Energy sector. The Bankhas played the lead role inassisting the government inthe
design of the reform program in the sector, and more importantly on its implementation.
After the completion o f the Energy Project at end-2000, the Bank has continued to support
the developmental objectives o f the sector to increase energy efficiency. Under the PAL
program, the government has strengthened the legal and regulatory framework and initiated
steps to enable the private sector to assume an increasing share of commercial risks. Policy
recommendations have been outlined in the Bank Energy and Environment Review
completed in 2003, which aimed at also evaluating alternative strategies to balance the need
for economic development and environmental protection. The Fund's and the Bank's teams
have worked collaboratively in close consultations with the government, and the SBA
included a performance criterion focusing on implementation o f the schedule for bringing
electricity prices to full cost recovery level, and two benchmarks-ne     on implementation o f
the new regulatory pricing regime, and the other on preparing a new Energy Act to
harmonize Bulgaria's legislation with EU Directives. In addition, in June 2003 the Bank's
Board approved two district heatingprojects to support the rehabilitation o f the Sofia andthe
PemikDistrict Heating Companies.

 13.    Railways.      The Bank has been the government's main external partner in the
transformation o f the railway sector, particularly through the Railway RehabilitationProject,
which was completed in June 2002.           This transformation is at present only half way
achieved.    Some essential measures have been implemented under the PAL program,
especially the divestiture of all railway ancillary activities, securing a major reduction in

                                                                                                Annex 7
                                                                                                   Page 5



staffing, and completing the institutional separation o f the national company into two new
infrastructure andrail services enterprises together with the opening ofrail services to private
operators. K e y remaining steps include tariff reform, reduction o f loss making services to
only those that can be socially justified and supported by state contracts (public service
obligations), further reduction o f staff, and improved corporate governance.                They were
refined in the context of the recent PER and are being supported by the Bank through the
PALs. Detailed assistance with the design o f these reforms will be further provided through
transport sector work inthe near future.

14.     Education. The reform efforts inthe education sector aim at improving expenditure
management in view o f the declining population, especially in school age, and at enhancing
quality and access to education.            The main priority in the education sector, including
universities, is to reallocate expenditures from surplus capacity in teaching staff and
underused facilities toward modernization and upgrading of curricula, textbooks, teaching
materials, schools, and other quality-enhancing education inputs. The Bank has supported
the government program in education through the Education Modernization Project loan
(closed on March 31, 2004), the PALs, and the analytical work done for the Poverty
Assessment, the PER, and the Inter-governmental Finance studg.                        Under PAL-2 the
government has developed a concept for an education reform strategy and action plan, the
implementation o fwhich would be supported though PAL-3.

15.     Health care.       Key reform priorities in the health sector include addressing the
concurrent problems of surplus capacity issues inhealth facilities, the serious deterioration in
the quality o f facilities and health services, and the inadequate modernization o f equipment.
At the same time, the government needs to ensure the financial integrityo fthe NHIF,which
is the central point ofthe reforms inthe sector. For a long time the Bankhas been supporting
the restructuring o f the health sector through the Health Sector Restructuring Project which
was closed at end- 2001. The follow-up Health Sector Reform project approved in late 2000
is under implementation and focuses on the administrative and information systems of the
NHIF,andsupportsthe ambulatorycare sector andthehospitalsector.

16.     Social protection programs. Social protection programs-pensions,                   labor market
programs, social assistance, and short-term and family benefits-have                   a wide coverage
among the population. Onpensions, one reform priority is to improve compliance with, and
coverage of, the public pillar, and define a clear rule for indexing pensions. During FY04,
the preparation o f a policy-oriented note will support the pension policy dialogue. On labor
market programs, there is a need to monitor these closely to improve their effectiveness and
long-term impact in stimulating labor demand.                  Subject to progress in key reforms,
consideration should be given to reduce the tax burden related to labor market policies in
order to curtail labor costs.3 Some social assistance and benefit programs have become more
pro-poor since the mid-1990s and are playing a major role in alleviating poverty. However,
giventhe plethora o fthese programs, andthe complexity ofprogram design inmany cases, a
constant challenge o f the social protection system as a whole is to examine opportunities for
'IssuesinIntergovernmental   Relations,the World Bank, January 27,2004, Report No. 25821-BUL.
  However, such fiscal adjustment requires lowering public expenditures to GDPbefore implementing tax
reductions.

                                                                                     Annex 7

consolidation and engage in systematic monitoring o f the programs, their costs and
effectiveness.

17.     The Bank has been the main partner o f the government in its efforts to address
poverty reduction and meet its social development objectives.      The main findings o f the
Poverty Assessment and the PER contribute significantly to the enhanced policy dialogue
with the government on its policy options to improve living standards in the country, and
increase the effectiveness and adequacy o f its social protection programs.      The Bank is
assisting these important reforms in the social protection system through providing grants
amounting to US$2.2 million. The latter focus on poverty monitoring and evaluation,
integration o f ethnic minorities, child development and building social capital in
disadvantaged communities. A Bank-financed Child Welfare Reform project helps address
the needs o f children in public care, while a Bank-financed Social Investment and
Employment Promotion (SIEP), which supports community and employment creation and
strengthening o f ALMPs, was approved in 2002.            Although not subject to structural
performance criteria or benchmarks, the IMF has been also monitoring the sustainability o f
the pension system andthe advancing o f the labor market reforms interms of their relevance
for the Fund's program objectives.

B.4.    Areas where the WorldBankleadsandthere is no directIMFinvolvement.

18.     Private sector development. Bulgaria has completed the divestiture o f about 95
percent (based on value o f assets) of its non-infrastructure state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
since 1995. To encourage the entry of new firms and the expansion o f existing ones, the
