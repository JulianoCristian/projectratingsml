continues the PAL Program support to the\n            Bulgarian government's medium term program, which aims\n            to achieve average annual growth rates of  4.5-5.0 percent\n            during 2002-05, reduce the poverty rate by half by 2005\n            compared to 2001, and  reduce the unemployment rate from\n            18.1 percent in 2001 to 12-14 percent in 2005, while making\n            substantial progress towards European Union accession, which\n            it is hoped will occur in 2007. The medium-term program\n            balances a strategy of  private sector-led growth while\n            reducing social exclusion and increasing empowerment to\n            ensure wide participation in growth. The program consists of\n            five complementary pillars: 1) Sustaining structural reforms\n            in the enterprise sector with emphasis on privatization and\n            restructuring of  the energy, railway, telecommunications,\n            and water sectors; 2) Establishing a market-friendly\n            business environment, focusing on reducing entry\n            constraints, accelerating exits, securing deregulation and\n            reducing regulatory costs, improving the delivery of  public\n            services to business, and improving the competitive\n            environment, through continuing labor market reform; 3)\n            Deepening the financial sector, improving the legal\n            framework for lending, completing banking reform, and\n            developing financial markets ; 4) Improving public sector\n            governance, strengthening public administration capacity,\n            improving service delivery, reducing corruption,\n            strengthening accountability and transparency, strengthening\n            public expenditure management, and increasing the efficiency\n            and effectiveness of  the judicial system; and  5) Investing\n            in human capital and strengthening social programs,\n            improving quality, access and efficiency in education and\n            health, continuing pension reforms, increasing social\n            assistance effectiveness, providing for better integration\n            of  the disabled and reducing institutionalization of\n            children. PAL-2, in addition to sustaining the reforms under\n            PAL- 1, focuses in particular on public sector governance,\n            including public administration reform, anticorruption,\n            public expenditure management and judicial reform (Pillar\n            IV). PAL-2 i s to be structured as a two tranche operation.\n            The first tranche will be disbursed immediately after loan\n            effectiveness. The second tranche i s floating and will be\n            disbursed on loan closure after the Second Tranche\n            Conditions have been fulfilled."}, "docdt": "2004-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
