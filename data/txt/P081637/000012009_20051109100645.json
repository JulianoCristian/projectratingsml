outcome, likely sustainability, and substantial\n            institutional development impacts, achieved through a\n            satisfactory Bank performance, and a highly satisfactory\n            borrower performance. Findings and implications indicate\n            that a) the advantage of broad-based country and political\n            ownership of the reform program cannot be underestimated.\n            The project provides evidence that the drive towards\n            European Union (EU) accession is a powerful impetus for\n            reform, and should be capitalized as necessary. Moreover,\n            this broad multi-sectoral policy-based operation can be\n            useful in signaling the Bank's \"endorsement\"\n            of the overall reform effort; and, in helping the government\n            coordinate a wide range of reforms across line ministries.\n            Nonetheless, focusing policy-based lending, only on those\n            areas/actions the Bank can contribute technically to ensure\n            the quality of the various reforms, remains important. To\n            this end, the Bank's advice on all areas of the reform\n            program, including those that are to be the focus of later\n            operations, should be fairly well crafted at the design\n            stage of the overall program, and a continuous dialogue\n            should be maintained."}, "docdt": "2005-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
