     receiving port and overland transport of crude oil by\n            pipeline to five inland refineries and to Hungary and\n            Czechoslovakia. On completion, the installations would have\n            a capacity of 20 million tons annually. The port facilities\n            would comprise: two marine berths and related equipment\n            capable of handling ships from 30,000 dwt to 350,000 dwt,\n            two 2,000 hp tugs and several launches, and one 612,000 ton\n            oil storage tank farm. The overland transport facilities\n            would include: 736 km of main pipeline varying in size from\n            12 to 36 inches and lateral pipelines to refineries, 7 pump\n            stations, 2 maintenance depots, 1 pressure reduction\n            station, 4 buffer oil storage tank farms (with a total\n            capacity of 153,500 tons), and an existing 16 inch pipeline\n            to be incorporated into the system. The project would also\n            include a supervisory control system using\n            telecommunications, telemetering and telecontrol systems and\n            engineering services for design, project planning and the\n            supervision of construction."}, "docdt": "1975-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
