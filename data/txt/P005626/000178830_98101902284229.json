Nebeul to the year 1990; and technical assistance. The four\n            major components are: (i) production facilities including\n            the Saida dam-reservoir, two pumping stations, transmission\n            pipelines and a water treatment plant; (ii) extension of the\n            distribution system in Greater Tunis including installation\n            of two primary mains, the expansion and improvement of the\n            secondary distribution network and upgrading of booster\n            pumping stations; (iii) the extension of distribution\n            systems including expansion of the primary systems,\n            improvement of the secondary distribution networks and\n            upgrading of storage and booster pumping in Beja,\n            Medjez-el-Bab, Pont du Fahs, and South Nabeul; (iv) study to\n            assist SONEDE in developing and adapting its management\n            structures (including its computer and information systems)\n            in accordance with the needs of its future expansion.
