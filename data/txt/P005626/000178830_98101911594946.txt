TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF THE
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a water supply project for five northern prov-
inces of Tunisia: Beja, Jendouba, Nabeul, Tunis and Tunis Sud, for which a
Bank loan of US$21.0 million is proposed. These five provinces are among the
socially and economically most active areas of the country and include the
largest urban agglomeration, Greater Tunis. Economic activities of the region
under consideration are quite diversified: Tunis is the nation's administra-
tive center and dominates the political, economic and cultural life of the
country; Beja is a semi-industrial area; Nabeul an attractive area for tourism
development and Jendouba a basically agricultural province. About 37% of the
country's total population live in these five provinces; more than 45% of the
urban population reside there.
ii.       Water is scarce in Tunisia and water supply works are becoming
increasingly difficult and expensive to implement. The available water
resources are located far from the urban centers and the waters are very
often of poor quality, necessitating sophisticated treatment before they can
be considered potable. This situation is so critical that application of
sound planning and engineering design, and of realistic pricing policies that
would assure a minimum supply to the poor at reasonable cost and at the same
time promote conservation of the scarce resources, become prerequisites
to further progress of the sector.
iii.      The Government is about to initiate implementation of its Fifth
Investment Plan (1977-1981), and as part of this plan, investments of about
US$367 million in new and improved water supply facilities are foreseen. The
proposed project is integrated within the Water Master Plan for Northern
Tunisia involving the collection and conveyance of the country's northern
rivers to meet potable, industrial and agricultural water needs to the year
2000. The project covers only the first construction stage of production and
distribution facilities which would have the capacity necessary to meet pot-
able water requirements in the five provinces up to the year 1990. It is a
regional scheme which once completed would allow to increase the percentage of
urban population now connected to the water network in the five provinces from
an average of 68% to 81% by 1985.
iv.       Since 1968 the Bank Group has become extensively involved in the
water supply sector and has already financed three projects (two loans and
a credit) of the national water supply authority, "Societe Nationale
d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux" (SONEDE), for expansion of water
supply services in the areas of Tunis, Sousse, and Sfax and 62 rural centers.
SONEDE's performance under the previous loans and credit has been good. This



- ii -
authority, which was set up only in 1968 as part of the first Bank project,
today is a financially viable company, with experienced and dedicated staff.
v.        The proposed loan would be made to SONEDE with the guarantee of the
Republic of Tunisia, and would continue a previous policy of strengthening
SONEDE's capability. SONEDE has already accomplished a remarkable work in
the sector, increasing the percentage of the country's urban population con-
nected to the network from 43% in 1968 to 62% in 1975, and almost tripling the
number of house connections in the same period. It is anticipated that con-
tinuing Bank involvement in the sector would help SONEDE improve its tech-
nical and managerial capability, speed up the execution of house connections
and implement adequate pricing policies.
vi.       The estimated total cost of the project is US$102.9 million of which
US$49.9 million is for production facilities, US$44.8 for distribution works
in Greater Tunis and US$8.2 million for distribution in other areas of the
provinces. The foreign exchange cost of the production component is estimated
at US$21.0 million, that of the distribution works in Greater Tunis at US$23.4
million, and that of distribution works in other areas at US$4.0 million.
About 34.5% of the project cost would be financed with SONEDE's internally
generated funds, and 22.4% with a Government equity contribution to SONEDE's
capital. The Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange expenditures for the
production component and would account for 20.4% of the project cost. Finally
it is expected that SONEDE would receive, under parallel financing, a loan of
US$23.4 million representing the balance of 22.7% of the total cost, from
other external sources; the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and the
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development may participate in the financing
of the distribution works in Greater Tunis.
vii.      Except for goods of less than US$150,000 and for civil works of less
than US$450,000, aggregating to not more than US$1,500,000, all contracts for
the production works would be placed through international competitive bidding
ln accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines for Procurement. For bid
evaluation a 15% margin of preference or the actual customs duties, whichever
is lower, would be allowed for equipment manufactured in Tunisia. Foreign
manufacturers are expected to win the supply of equipment for a new treatment
plant, of pumps and special operational equipment. Local contractors are
expected to win contracts for supply of large diameter pipes.
viii.     The Bank loan would be disbursed for the production items against
(a) the full CIF cost of all direct imports; (b) the foreign exchange cost of
consulting services for engineering design and construction supervision; and
(c) 39% of the total expenditures for civil works construction. Detailed
engineering design of the project is under way, and bidding is expected to
start in October 1977. Project construction would be carried out from 1978
through 1982.



- iii -
ix.       Water demand in the project area would soon exceed the supply capac-
ity presently available, and without the project SONEDE would have to stop its
expansion program of house connections. The proposed project is technically
sound and is the least cost alternative for providing the supply necessary to
meet water demand of growing population and to assure further growth of indus-
try and tourism in the five northern provinces. The project would also greatly
enhance environment quality and public health in these provinces. The tariffs
are efficient enough to ensure the long-run recovery of the proposed capital
investments.
x.        Agreement having been reached on the conditions outlined in Chapter
7 of this report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$21.0 million
to SONEDE for a term of 17 years including 3 1/2 years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF THE
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tunisia and the "Societe Nationale d'Exploitation
et de Distribution des Eaux" (SONEDE) have requested the Bank to help finance
a water supply project for five northern provinces of the country, namely
Beja, Jendouba, Nabeul, Tunis and Tunis Sud. The project involves the first
construction stage of a master plan designed to meet potable water needs in
these provinces to the year 2000, and includes the construction of a regional
water production complex and distribution systems in the urban agglomerations
of the provinces. The proposed construction, which with related studies, land
acquisition, project implementation and management consultants' services, is
estimated to cost US$102.9 million, is programmed to be carried out in the
years 1978 through 1982. A Bank loan of US$21.0 million is proposed to cover
part of the foreign exchange cost of the project.
1.02      Water supply systems in Tunisia are planned, built and operated by
SONEDE, a Government owned company, which would be the borrower of the pro-
posed loan. Since its creation in 1968, SONEDE has received two Bank loans
and an IDA credit. The first loan (581-TUN) of US$15 million, made in January
1969, was to finance water supply works for the regions of Tunis and Sousse.
In June 1970, the International Development Association made a credit (209-
TUN) of US$10.5 million to assist in financing the improvement and expansion
of water supply in eight areas of the country. Both of these projects were
jointly financed with the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA).
1.03      A second loan (989-TUN) of US$23 million was made in May 1974 to
help SONEDE finance the construction of water supply systems for the country's
second largest city, Sfax, and for 62 rural centers. In addition, the Bank
Group is also assisting in the financing of a tourism infrastructure project 1/
which includes a water supply component estimated to cost US$18.5 million.
Details of these loans, together with the status of procurement and project
completion, are given in Annex 1.
1.04      SONEDE's performance under the first loan and the credit has been
good, and the water supply sector has been substantially improved through the
execution of these projects. The percentage of urban population connected
to the systems, which was only 43% in 1968, reached 64% at the end of 1976.
About 77% of the rural population living in accessible villages is served
by public taps. During that period, SONEDE itself has continued to improve
its management capability and today is considered a financially viable public
authority.

1.05      However, in spite of this progress, further Bank involvement in
the sector appears necessary to (i) assist Tunisia in developing appropriate
mechanisms and techniques that could improve the planning, allocation, manage-
ment and use of scarce water resources, which are becoming a serious obstacle
to the economic growth of the country; (ii) help SONEDE improve project imple-
mentation; and (iii) assist SONEDE in developing and implementing improved
reporting systems. The Bank would also act as a catalyst for (a) the mobiliza-
tion of financing from other lenders to SONEDE; (b) closer coordination between
SONEDE and other Government agencies involved in urban development such as the
Tunis District; (c) the adoption of measures to encourage the urban poor to
connect their dwellings to the water supply systems; and (d) the adoption of
a realistic pricing policy that would foster self-financing potential for
expansion.
1.06      The Government would start soon to execute its Fifth Investment Plan
(1977-1981) and as part of this plan, SONEDE would invest about US$367 million
in new and improved water supply facilities. The project that is being con-
sidered accounts for about 28% of these investments and is vital to meet water
demand of the growing population, to provide better water supply services to
the urban poor and to assure further growth of industry and tourism in the
northern provinces of the country.
1.07      A mission composed of Messrs. Fritz Rodriguez and Johann Renkewitz
visited Tunisia in October 1976 and discussed technical aspects of the project
with SONEDE and two French consulting firms, Coyne and Bellier and SOGREAH,
which prepared the feasibility study of the project. The mission suggested
some changes and returned in December 1976 to appraise the project. This
report is based on the consultants' recommendations and the mission's findings.
2. THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Water Resources
2.01      Water is a scarce commodity in Tunisia.  Not only is the volume of
water available for urban, industrial and agricultural use limited, but the
exploitation of a large portion of it is impaired by a high content of
chlorides. The salinity 1/ of most groundwater sources is so high that they
cannot be used as such for domestic consumption, and are even unfit for irriga-
tion.  Most of the fresh surface water sources are found very far inland in
the mountains, mostly in the northern part of the country. Only limited
volumes of surface water are found in the coastal areas where the bulk of the
population is concentrated.
1/   In this report salinity is taken as the chloride content of the waters.
The Wlorld Health Organization (WHO) suggests imposing an upper limit of
600 mg/liter of chlorides for potable water.



- 3 -
2.02      Flow regime of the northern rivers is very irregular and construc-
tion of large impounding reservoirs is needed to increase their safe yields.
However, as water stored in these reservoirs dissolves chloride compounds
contained in the surrounding soil formations, the salinity of these waters
increases substantially, thus making their use more difficult. The flow
capacity of the northern rivers is also limited; with full development of
storage they might cover the water needs for both urban and agricultural use
up to the year 2000. Beyond that time it would become necessary to resort
to more sophisticated treatment methods such as desalination of sea water
and recycling of wastewaters to meet the demand.
2.03      Although some groundwater is available along the coastline, the
volume that can be extracted is often limited because of the progressive
intrusion of sea water into the aquifers. The salinity of most of the ground-
water found in the southern part of the country is higher than 600 mg/liter.
The tourism areas of Djerba-Zarzis along the southern coastal region are
supplied with slightly saline water. Bizerte and other nearby industrial
cities in the north are served with groundwater which is both of good quality
and available fairly near to these cities. Greater Tunis, the major urban
agglomeration in the country, and Sfax, the second largest city, are supplied
from surface sources located at more than 120 kms from these cities.
2.04      The Government is aware of the limitation of the water resources and
has already taken two major steps towards promoting their rational use. First,
it has prepared the Water Master Plan for Northern Tunisia for long-range de-
velopment and use of the country 's northern water resources, which would in-
volve inter alia the transfer of these waters to areas where they are most
needed and where the best use within the priorities can be made. Secondly, it
issued a water code I/ establishing usage priorities, regulating the collec-
tion and use of the water resources, and strengthening conservation of these
resources. In this regard the third Bank project includes a study of the
health and economic effects of distributing water of high salinity.
2.05      The Ministry of Agriculture manages all water resources in the coun-
try. The water code provides for the creation of a National Water Commission
to assist the Ministry of Agriculture in the management and allocation of
these resources. In addition, the code provides for the establishment in each
province of water-users' associations to review public waterworks programs.
Until now the commission and associations have not been very active.
Population Distribution
2.06      The latest census, dated May 8, 1975, recorded the country's total
population at 5.6 million, of which 47.5% or 2.7 million live in urban areas.
Of the rural population, which in that year reached 2.9 million or 52.5% of the
total population, only about one million resided in rural agglomerations or
1/   Decree No 75-16 of March 31, 1975.



- 4 -
villages. The remaining rural population was dispersed in isolated scattered
locations. The total population is projected to grow at an annual rate of
2.3% through the end of this decade. The urban population would grow at a
much faster rate (about 4.2% annually) than the rural population whose growth
is forecast to be less than 1% annually. Part of the urban population growth
would stem from rural migration to urban areas.
2.07      Population distribution between urban, rural agglomerated (villages)
and rural isolated, will continue to change in future. The rural population
living in isolated locations is steadily moving into rural villages which in
turn are loosing population to the urban areas. In effect, the population of
rural villages has not increased since 1966. It is forecast that by the end
of this century, the rural population living in isolated locations would
decrease from the present 34% to not more than 20% of the total population.
2.08      Most of the urban population and economic activity are concentrated
in the northern coastal areas; the south is almost wholly desert. The pro-
posed project covers an area in which about 45% of the country's urban
population live and from which SONEDE collects about 59% of its revenues.
Constraints and Priorities in the Sector
2.09      One of the major constraints to rapid expansion of public piped
water supply in Tunisia is the remote location of fresh water sources from
the main urban centers, requiring the construction of unusually long trans-
mission pipelines. The result is that both capital and operating expenses of
the transmission facilities are extremely high compared to similar costs in
other countries. This situation is further worsened by the fact that some
highly saline sources can only be used in conjunction with other fresh
sources. The cost of the transmission pipelines becomes decisive, as the
population size is small, making the per capita investments prohibitive.
2.10      Because of these high investments and of budget constraints, the
Government has long decided to give first priority to the urban sector where
it can get the maximum benefits with its limited financial resources. The
Government objective for this sector is to have 81% of the urban population
connected to the systems by 1985. The Government's second priority is to
provide the rural agglomerated villages with piped potable water at public
taps. The scattered rural locations have not yet received much attention,
because they are generally not large enough to warrant installation of a
public water supply system, which would result in high per capita investments.
These locations are supplied with water from shallow wells, irrigation canals,
cisterns or public taps at the nearest center.
Sector Program
2.11      Under the Fifth Plan, SONEDE is proposing to invest US$367 million
in water supply works, of which US$91.3 million is to complete projects
initiated during the Fourth Development Plan (1973-1976), and the balance of
US$275.7 million for new projects. Though SONEDE completed only 60% of the



- 5 -
works originally programmed under the Fourth Plan, most of the delays occurred
in the early years of execution. In 1976 SONEDE invested about D 27 million
(US$63 million). Based on SONEDE's latest performance, it is likely that it
will be able to carry out the Fifth Plan according to schedule, and may perhaps
exceed the proposed investments, details of which are given in Annex 2, which
also discusses the achievements of the Fourth Plan.
2.12      To execute the Fourth Plan, SONEDE received in addition to the Bank
loans and proceeds of the IDA credit, financial assistance from the Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA), Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau
(KfW) of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID). These agencies are expected to continue
their assistance during the Fifth Plan. SONEDE and the Government are also
actively seeking financial assistance from several external sources, including
the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development.
2.13      To determine the work program to be executed in order to reach
SONEDE's objective of connecting 81% of the urban population to the water
supply systems by 1985, the Bank developed a mathematical model by the least
square method, using SONEDE's 10-year record of water consumption and number
of customers, to express the relationship between population connected, water
sales and number of connections. Details of the procedure used and the form
of the equations are given in Annex 3. Those equations are illustrated in
Annex 4 and are represented by parabolic curves which fit well the historical
data. The model shows a rational trend and good correlation of population con-
nected, water sales and number of connections. Based on the expected future
population growth and SONEDE's past performance, the predicted water sales and
number of connections appear reasonable, and are likely to be met or exceeded.
2.14      Future water sales, including consumption from public taps, are
expected to grow at an annual rate of about 6%. This rate takes into account
the probable effects on consumption of projected tariff increases necessary
to meet SONEDE's financial requirements and to promote conservation. To keep
up the projected growth, SONEDE would have to execute annually a minimum of
36,000 house connections, a figure that SONEDE reached in the last two years.
Obiectives of the Project
2.15      The proposed project would help the Government and SONEDE achieve
their priority objective of providing at least 81% of the expected 1985 urban
population with house connections. More than a million people living in the
cities located in the project area, and some 200,000 dwellers in rural loca-
tions, would benefit from the project. Almost 80% of the water produced under
the proposed project will be consumed in Greater Tunis. The distribution
systems of the cities would be expanded primarily into the low income areas
and more than two-thirds of the new house connections would be executed in
these areas.
2.16      Under current legislation, a Government agency, the Greater Tunis
District, is responsible for planning the development of the Tunis metropolitan



- 6 -
area. More specifically, the District plans the development of housing and
land use in Greater Tunis, factors which have direct bearing on the planning
of water supply. Thus there is a need for close cooperation and consultation
between SONEDE and the District on programs that might affect urban development
in Greater Tunis. In this regard SONEDE should undertake to expand the water
distribution network of Greater Tunis only in areas designated by the District.
2.17      The proposed project provides the opportunity to define and estab-
lish the required cooperation between these two agencies. The design of the
proposed distribution facilities is based on the District's data and projec-
tions, and has been reviewed and endorsed by the District. It is most desir-
able that the execution of the distribution works be planned jointly with the
District and reviewed by it. Such cooperation, which is outlined in more
detail in Annex 6, needs to be set forth in a formal agreement between SONEDE
and the District. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that SONEDE
and the District will enter into such an agreement not later than December 31,
1977.
2.18      It is finally expected that the Bank's involvement through the
requirement of a fair return by SONEDE on its assets, would help assure imple-
mentation of an adequate pricing policy that would permit the generation of
funds needed for future expansion of water supply facilities, and the promotion
of improved use of scarce water resources.
3. THE BORROWER
Background
3.01      The borrower of the proposed loan would be SONEDE, the national
water supply authority, which was established in 1968 to replace the Regie
de Distribution des Eaux (RDE), in an effort to build up adequately the finan-
cial and managerial resources of the water supply sector. SONEDE is owned by
the Government and operates under the tutelage of the Ministry of Agriculture.
It has the status of an autonomous public enterprise, but is managed as a com-
mercial undertaking. SONEDE is the borrower and beneficiary of previous Bank
Group lending to the sector (Loan 581-TUN, Credit 209-TUN and Loan 989-TUN),
as well as the executing agency for the water supply component of the Tourism
Infrastructure project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN).
Past Performance
3.02      SONEDE has to date successfully implemented the two projects asso-
ciated with the first Bank loan and the IDA credit. Most of the project facil-
ities became operational in 1974 and water supply services in the project areas
have greatly improved. Execution of the project components financed under the
third Bank loan 1/ (989-TUN) is under way and progressing satisfactorily (see
1/   Report No. 369a-TUN, Appraisal of the Third Water Supply Project,
May 6, 1974.



- 7 -
Annex 1, paragraph 14). The establishment of SONEDE has also been successful
and has produced the reforms required for improving water supply operations
in the country. At the end of 1976 after 8 years of operations, SONEDE had
tripled its initial assets. Water sales increased from 63.4 MM3 in 1968 to
93.5 Mm3 in 1975; in the same period the number of connections increased from
102,000 to 242,000.
Organization and Management
3.03      Annex 7 shows the organizational structure of SONEDE.  A Board of
12 members chaired by SONEDE's General Manager supervises the activities of
SONEDE. Nine Board members are public officials and represent the ministries
and government agencies which have particular interest in the sector. The
remaining three Board members, though appointed by the Minister of Agricul-
ture, represent the private sector and the customers. The overall control
exercised by the Government, beyond the appointment of the Board of Directors,
covers major decisions such as approval of annual capital and operating bud-
gets, borrowings, tariffs levels, code of employment and major procurement,
but does not affect SONEDE's operational autonomy.
3.04      The General Manager is appointed by the Minister of Agriculture and
is responsible for the day-to-day operations which are grouped into five
departments - production and distribution in Greater Tunis, production and
distribution in the rest of the country, new works, engineering studies, and
administration and finance. Three divisions in charge of auditing and organ-
ization, operational control and general studies assist the General Manager
in preparing long-range planning and policies. Until now SONEDE's organiza-
tion structure has been largely adequate. However, future expected growth
may require some modifications of this structure, such as separation of admin-
istration and finance, and creation of a commercial department. These modifi-
cations will be implemented progressively as their need becomes apparent.
3.05      Under existing agreements, SONEDE is committed to consult with the
Bank before making any basic changes in its organization and administrative
structure. These assurances have been restated in the Loan Agreement.
Personnel and Training
3.06      At the end of 1976, SONEDE's staff numbered 2,500.  This corresponds
to an average of 1 employee per 1,000 people served, which is considered
adequate for SONEDE's decentralized organization. This ratio should decrease
slightly in future, as SONEDE is now sufficiently staffed with engineering and
administrative personnel to meet the requirements of further expansion of its
operations. SONEDE's salaries and conditions of service are competitive with
those of other sectors and are adequate to recruit and retain qualified
personnel.
3.07      In collaboration with the "Office de l'Emploi et de la Formation
Professionnelle", SONEDE is carrying out a training program for its rank
and file personnel on a continuous basis. In addition, a number of short



term seminars covering various aspects of its operations are arranged each
year by SONEDE for its staff. SONEDE has also arranged for overseas scholar-
ships for its engineers to specialize in sanitary engineering and other areas
related to water supply. At present, 12 staff members are studying at insti-
tutes in French-speaking European countries. Training of SONEDE's top managers
will also focus on the planning, financial and economic evaluation of projects.
They will be encouraged to follow specialized courses of the Economic Develop-
ment Institute of the Bank Group and of other advanced institutes.
Billing and Collection
3.08      SONEDE bills its customers on a rotating basis every three months
for the volume of water consumed and for a fixed charge covering meter rent
and connection maintenance.  Collection from private customers and the Govern-
ment offices is efficient; accounts receivable from those two groups of cus-
tomers stand at about 2.7 months of sales. However, accounts receivable from
the municipalities, for water consumed at public taps are presently at nine
months of sales (about D 0.7 million). Existing agreements commit the Govern-
ment to take all necessary steps to enable SONEDE to receive full payment
within 120 days of billing, but the financial weakness of the municipalities
has led to these high arrears.  The municipalities can generate few revenues
themselves, and it is unlikely that they would be able to pay the outstanding
bills without the assistance of the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of
Interior which controls their affairs.
3.09      The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior have recently
agreed to set up for the municipalities a payment system similar to the one
presently used by the Government agencies, whereby in the Government budgets
related to the municipalities' operations, a percentage of their forecast
water bills would be set aside and paid periodically. During negotiations,
the Government undertook to provide the municipalities, beginning with its
annual budget for 1978, with the financial means to make an advance payment of
at least 75% of their estimated water charges for each year beginning July 1,
and pay the balance of amounts due for such a year not later than four months
after the end of a fiscal year.
3.10      An understanding was reached that the Government will liquidate the
municipalities' arrears according to the following schedule: D 0.2 million by
October 31, 1977; D 0.1 million by December 31, 1977; D 0.4 million by April
30, 1978; and the balance of all charges for water consumed as of June 30,
1977, by June 30, 1978.
Accounting System
3.11      SONEDE's accounting system is comprehensive.  Its financial accounts,
billing of water sales, related charges and new connections, inventory con-
trol, and payroll are performed on a computer programmed and operated by its
staff. A cost accounting section monitors the c0st effectiveness of each sec-
tion and activity. SONEDE performs annual physical inventory controls and
recorded levels of inventories are reliable.



- 9-
Management Information System
3.12      SONEDE controls the execution of its budgets on a continuous basis,
and most of its financial activities are now computerized. However, the pre-
sent information system and computer programs need to be improved and devel-
oped to adapt them to the rapid expansion of SONEDE's activities. Also, the
information gathered (including financial reporting) is not presented in a
format which highlights the company's financial position and which management
needs for taking the appropriate decisions. In addition, better coordination
should be established between the various divisions involved in the prepara-
tion of the reports. SONEDE is aware of this and has agreed to carry out
studies to develop reporting systems which could provide more meaningful and
timely information to its management. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that SONEDE will retain management consultants acceptable to the
Bank, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, to assist in the
preparation of these studies, which should be submitted to the Bank not later
than June 30, 1978.
3.13      Tentative terms of reference for the management assistance are given
in Annex 8. The cost of these studies will be financed by SONEDE. The con-
sultants might also be retained to assist SONEDE in implementing an improved
reporting system.
Audit
3.14      SONEDE's operations are monitored by a technical controller and a
financial controller who are advisory members of the Board of Directors and
appointed by the Government. Existing agreements between SONEDE and the Bank
provide for the external audit of SONEDE's annual financial statements by in-
dependent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The agreements stipulate that the
audited financial statements should be submitted to the Bank within six months
after the close of each fiscal year. However, recent audits have been received
with some delays due to late submission by SONEDE of its statements to the
auditors, and the time needed for field audit of SONEDE operations not only in
Greater Tunis but in all of SONEDE's regional offices. The quality of the
audits has been adequate. SONEDE has taken the necessary dispositions to
finalize its statements shortly after the close of a fiscal year to ensure
that in future the audit reports are received within the time limit set forth
in the agreements.
Insurance
3.15      SONEDE carries insurances covering motor vehicles, fire damages for
buildings, third party liability and special coverage for damages caused by
polluted water accidentally distributed by SONEDE, all of which are considered
adequate. Until the end of 1975, workmen's compensation insurance was with a
private company. SONEDE is now self-insurer for such compensation and has
set up a special fund into which amounts equivalent to the previous insurance



- 10 -
premiums are put. An evaluation of the risks involved is under way to deter-
mine whether the present contribution towards this fund is sufficient. All
supply and civil works contracts for the project will be insured by private
companies against loss and damage in shipment, accidents, fire and property
damages.
Taxes
3.16      Water sales are subject to a sales tax of 4.3% which is collected
by SONEDE and paid to the Government. In addition, a 6.15% tax for services
rendered is levied on charges for meter rental, maintenance and the labor com-
ponent of the cost of house connections.
3.17      Since its creation, SONEDE has been exempted from income taxes in
accordance with existing legislation which allows 3 consecutive 5-year periods
of tax holiday. SONEDE's second 5-year tax exemption will expire by the end
of 1977. A request has therefore been submitted to the Government to obtain
another 5-year extension of the tax holiday. The financial projections dis-
sussed in Chapter 5 have been prepared assuming that the request will be
granted. Should the tax holiday not be renewed, higher tariffs than presently
anticipated would have to be implemented to comply with the rate of return
covenant.
4. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
Background
4.01      The proposed project constitutes the first construction stage of
SONEDE's long-range plan to meet potable water supply requirements in five
northern provinces - Beja, Jendouba, Nabeul, Tunis and Tunis Sud - to the
year 2000. The SONEDE plan is in turn integrated within the Water Master
Plan for Northern Tunisia, which involves the collection and conveyance of
waters of the country's northern rivers, for potable, industrial and agricul-
tural use. The first phase of the Master Plan includes the construction of
an impounding dam (Sidi Salem) to control and regulate the Medjerdah River,
and of a main canal (Medjerdah-Cap Bon) to convey water to the areas of Tunis
and Cap Bon. The proposed SONEDE project would draw raw water at first from
an existing canal (Medjerdah), and later from the Medjerdah/Cap Bon canal
after the Sidi Salem project is completed. Construction of the Sidi Salem
dam and the canal is expected to start soon. The Bank is considering a loan
of US$42 million to assist in financing the first phase of the Master Plan.
A second phase would involve the construction of additional dams (Djoumine,
Madene, Sedjenane) and of another conveyance canal (Ichkeul-Medjerdah), which
would also supply raw water to the proposed SONEDE production facilities.
Scope of the Prcject
4.02      The first stage of the SONEDE's long-range plan will have the capac-
ity to cover the expected 1990 water demand, though the major element of the



- il -
project, a reservoir (Saida) for storage of raw water, will be built in one
stage for its ultimate capacity. Map 12713 shows the area of the country in-
volved in the project. Presently the five provinces are supplied by two re-
gional sources, the El Lil and Kasseb Rivers which are part of the northern
river complex, and by minor local sources. Both regional rivers are impounded
very far from Tunis City and their waters are conveyed to the areas of con-
sumption through long transmission pipelines. The Kasseb waters are treated
in the Gdir El Goulla production facilities located in the western outskirts
of Tunis City. A detailed description of the existing water supply facilities
is given in Annex 9.
4.03      Total average production presently available in the project area
is 93.5 million m3 (Mm3) per year for a population which reached 1.6 million
in 1975. In that year about 68% of the population of Greater Tunis was con-
nected to piped water supply systems, while about 18% of the population in
Beja and Tunis Sud was served by direct house connections. This percentage
was about 12% in Jendouba and 20% in Nabeul. In 1975 a total volume of 79.1
Mm3 was distributed in the five provinces. At the present rate of consumption
it is estimated that demand would exceed the available water production by
mid-1979.
4.04      Future potable water needs in the project area are discussed in
Annex 10. SONEDE's objective is to serve at least 80% of the total projected
1990 population, with an average of 85% of the urban population provided with
house connections. It is forecast that water demand in the project area would
continue to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to reach about 170 Mm3/year
in 1990. The first water shortage in the project area is predicted to be felt
during the summer of 1979. Some of the proposed production facilities would
become operational by that time and would temporarily pump raw water from the
existing Medjerdah canal to meet the demand (see Annex 11, paragraph 10).

supervison.
C.   Distribution Systems in Other Areas
(i) Expansion of the primary systems in the cities of Beja,
Medjez-El-Bab, Pont du Fahs, and in South Nabeul;
(ii) increase of storage and booster pumping; and
(iii) expansion and improvement of the secondary distribution
networks.
D.   Studies
Review and improvement of SONEDE's information system and
computer programs to adapt them to the needs of the company's
future expansion.

4.06      A more detailed description of the project is given in Annex 11.
A general layout of the main facilities is illustrated in Map 12714. The
principal elements of production and distribution for Greater Tunis are
shown on Maps 12715 and 12716.
Cost Estimates
4.07      The estimated total cost of the project is D 43.7 million (US$102.9
million) of which D 21.2 million (US$49.9 million) is for production, D 19.0
million (US$44.8 million) for distribution works in Greater Tunis and D 3.5
million (US$8.2 million) for distribution in other areas. The foreign exchange
cost of the production facilities is estimated at D 8.9 million (US$21.0 mil-
lion), that of the distribution system in Greater Tunis at D 9.9 million
(US$23.4 million) and that of distribution vorks in other areas at D 1.7 mil-
lion (US$4.0 million). Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 13. Esti-
mated annual project investments are shown in Annex 14. A summary of these
costs is as follows:

4.08      The cost estimates are based on quantity take-offs from preliminary
plans and construction price levels prevailing in December 1976. A 15%
allowance for physical contingencies was added to the base costs. Final
design and construction supervision are estimated to account for about 8% of
the base costs. To provide for price escalation during project execution,



- 15 -
construction expenditures are assumed to increase annually by 15% until 1980
and by 12% in 1981. For equipment expenditures, the annual rates of increase
are forecast to be 9% in 1977, 8% in 1978 and 1979, and 7% thereafter. These
estimated rates of construction price increase appear appropriate for the
project and take into account the limited capacity of the local construction
industry. A study of the Tunisian construction industry to determine means of
increasing its capacity and associated training programs, is under way. This
study is partly financed under the Bank loan 1088-TUN 1/ and is being closely
monitored by the Bank.
4.09      The project provides for an estimated 480 man-months of consulting
services for studies, final engineering design and construction supervision.
The estimated cost of these services is about US$1.8 million or US$3,750 per
man-month. About US$1.2 million needed for final design and construction
supervision of the production facilities would be financed under the proposed
loan.
Financing of the Project
4.10      A Bank loan of US$21 million representing 20.4% of the total proj-
ect cost is proposed. The loan would finance the estimated foreign expendi-
tures for the production facilities. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Devel-
opment and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development may participate
in financing the distribution system for Greater Tunis (foreign exchange cost
of US$23.4 million or 22.7% of the total project cost). It is further expected
that SONEDE would be able to finance US$35.5 million or 34.5% of the total
project cost with its own funds. The balance of US$23.0 million or 22.4% of
the cost would be provided by the Government as an equity contribution to
SONEDE's capital.
4.11      Although the production facilities and the distribution facilities
are independent subprojects, the financial viability of the production com-
ponent is contingent upon the timely and efficient execution of the distri-
bution systems which will convey the additional water production into the
consumption areas and ensure sales. Since more than 80% of the production
would be consumed in Greater Tunis, assurances should be obtained that the
financing of these distribution facilities will be secured promptly. It was
agreed during negotiations that the signing of a loan agreement providing
SONEDE with sufficient foreign exchange (US$23.4 million) to execute the
distribution component for Greater Tunis will be a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed Bank loan.
4.12      In addition to those funds, the Government will have to make a con-
tribution of US$23 million of which US$1.2 million would be needed in 1977,
US$4.0 million in 1978, US$7.0 million in 1979, US$6.1 million in 1980, and
US$4.7 million in 1981. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
the Government will make these amounts available to SONEDE, and if necessary
will provide any additional funds needed to cover any cost overruns SONEDE
cannot meet. This Government contribution in the form of equity is accept-
able as customers already finance through their contributions and rather high

- 16 -
tariffs, about 45% of SONEDE's investment program.  An additional 27% of this
program would be financed by loans (paragraph 5.11).
Procurement
4.13      All major contracts financed by the Bank will be placed by means of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's Guide-
lines for Procurement. For bid evaluation a 15% margin of preference, or the
actual customs duties, whichever is lower, would be allowed for equipment
manufactured in Tunisia. Contracts for goods of less than US$150,000 and for
civil works of less than US$450,000, aggregating to not more than US$1,500,000
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and
in accordance with SONEDE's procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. The
distribution facilities will be procured and funded under parallel financing.
4.14      Foreign contractors are expected to win the contract for construction
of the water treatment plant, and the supply of distribution pipes of less than
600-mm diameter, pumps, motor drives, special valves, control and operational
equipment. Local contractors are expected to win pipe supply contracts for the
production facilities.
Disbursements
4.15      The Bank loan of US$21 million would be disbursed for the production
component against (i) the full CIF cost of all direct imports; (ii) the foreign
exchange cost of consulting services for final engineering design and construc-
tion supervision; and (iii) 39% of the total expenditures for civil works con-
struction.
4.16      Allocation of the loan proceeds to different types of expenditures
is given in Annex 11. Estimated quarterly disbursements of the loans of the
Bank and other external sources, and Government funds are shown in Annex 15.
The closing date of the Bank loan would be December 31, 1982.
Execution of the Project
4.17      The project would be executed in the years 1977 through 1982.
Detailed design and bid documents for the production facilities are being
prepared by a French consulting firm, Coyne and Bellier, whose selection
was accepted by the Bank. Another French consulting firm, SOGREAH, has been
retained to review the design of the distribution systems and to prepare
bid documents for the distribution works. It is expected that bidding would
begin in October 1977, so that construction can start by March 1978. A PERT
program of the construction activities of the production facilities is shown
in Annex 16. A bar chart for design, bidding and construction of the project
elements is illustrated in Annex 17.
4.18      The project is expected to be completed by July 1982.  An analysis
of the PERT program shows that a substantial slack of more than a year is
available and that the project can be completed earlier. An understanding was
reached during negotiations that the project planning will be prepared on the



- 17 -
basis of the PERT program and construction schedule. As part of its quarterly
reports to the Bank, SONEDE will be requested to review the time and execution
performance to date, in relation to the PERT program and construction plan.
4.19      SONEDE's engineering department is sufficiently well organized to
supervise competently most of the construction. Some of the project items,
however, such as the Saida dam and the treatment plant, would need to be
supervised by experts who are not available in SONEDE. Those experts will
be retained by SONEDE for periodic supervision of the construction of these
items. In addition, after the Saida dam is built, qualified and experienced
consultants should be engaged to inspect the dam at least once every year, to
ensure that no structural deficiency is developing in the dam and reservoir
banks. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that engineering experts
or special consultants acceptable to the Bank will be appointed, under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, (i) to assist SONEDE in construction
supervision; and (ii) to make periodic inspections of the Saida dam and related
structures, the first of such inspections to take place not later than July 1,
1983.
Water Drawing Rights
4.20      Raw water for the treatment plant will be drawn at first from the
existing Medjerdah canal which carries waters of the Medjerdah river diverted
at the El Aroussia outlet. Later raw water will be drawn from the proposed
Medjerdah/Cap Bon canal which will carry waters of the Medjerdah river im-
pounded in the proposed Sidi Salem reservoir, and from the projected Ichkeul/
Medjerdah canal which will convey waters of the Djoumine and Sedjenane rivers.
The existing Medjerdah canal is operated by a Government Authority, the
"Office de la Mise en Valeur de la Vallee de la Medjerdah" (OMVVM). The
Directorate of Studies and Hydraulic Works (DEGTH) of the Ministry of Agri-
culture will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the proposed
Sidi Salem dam and Medjerdah/Cap Bon canal.
4.21      Though in principle water allocation to SONEDE for urban use has
priority, SONEDE should be formally given the right to draw up to 40 Mm3
annually from the existing Medjerdah canal, and a total of 170 Mm3 from the
future canals. SONEDE should also be allowed to draw these volumes of water
uniformly throughout the year or only during six months, depending upon the
quality of the waters. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government that SONEDE will be authorized to draw the needed volumes of
water from the Medjerdah canals.
Land Acquisition
4.22      The production facilities, in particular the Saida dam, would be
built on land that SONEDE needs to acquire expeditiously. In addition, SONEDE
would need to obtain easement for land strips, on which the transmission pipe-
lines and distribution mains would be installed. During project construction,
SONEDE might have to occupy temporarily some land for the stockage of materials.



- 18 -
SONEDE would try to acquire the ownership of all land and rights through nor-
mal procedures. However, difficulties might arise, requiring that the Govern-
ment take special expropriation measures, in order to avoid substantial delays
in project execution. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that it will promptly take all steps necessary to enable SONEDE to
acquire expeditiously the land and easement needed for the project.
5. FINANCE
Background
5.01      SONEDE is owned by the Government.  The company enjoys a large
degree of operational autonomy, although certain major financial decisions
are subject to Government approval (paragraph 3.03). Practically all water
distributed by SONEDE is metered. New customers are required to pay for the
cost of the connection, to contribute to the capital cost of the distribution
network and to deposit an advance payment which covers about three months
of service. All customers also pay quarterly charges for maintenance of their
connections and meter rentals. In addition, SONEDE levies a government tax
of 4.3% on water sales and 6.15% on services rendered.
5.02      In the past, domestic customers had the possibility of paying for
the connection charges and contributions in interest free installments over
10 years. In order to ease SONEDE's cash flow, these credit facilities were
recently modified by shortening the repayment period to five years and levy-
ing interest at prevailing commercial rates. This tightening of credit terms
is not expected to cause a significant drop in demand for house connections,
as the changes in the amounts involved are not that substantial for individual
customers.
Past and Present Position
5.03      SONEDE's income statements, cash flow statements and balance sheets
for 1973 to 1976, together with the projections from 1977 to 1984, are shown
in Annexes 18 through 20. SONEDE has in the past consistently earned a sur-
plus. The average rate of return on its net fixed assets in operation was
7.7% in 1975 and 6.4% in 1976,(well above the average 4% achieved in previous
years), which was the result of a steep tariff increase in mid 1974. Yearly
consumption per connection decreased from 464 m3 in 1973 to 359 m3 in 1976.
Between 1973 and 1976 water sales increased at an annual rate of 6%; the
number of connections increased annually by 16% over the same period.
5.04      Over the past four years SONEDE has financed about 46% of its invest-
ment programs out of internally generated funds and customers' contributions;
the Government contributed 26% of the investments as equity capital. The
remaining 28% was financed by external lenders.
5.05      Part of SONEDE's initial equity was provided by the Government in
transferring the ownership of the fixed assets (less related debts) of the



- 19 -
Regie de Distribution des Eaux (RDE) to SONEDE. Completion of the evaluation
of these assets has been held up because of difficulties in establishing
titles, but is expected by mid-1977. The final value of the assets should
not differ significantly from the originally assumed book value as only minor
discrepancies have yet been found.  The fixed assets are depreciated at
realistic annual rates averaging 2.7%.
5.06      SONEDE's working capital (current assets less current liabilities)
improved from 1973 to 1975 with the current ratio rising from 0.88 to 1.01.
However, in 1976 its working capital dropped considerably, and the current
ratio was at 0.53, due to a substantial build up of accounts payable. This
build up was brought about by accumulating contract retentions and a large
increase in unpaid contract installments, as SONEDE's investments rose from
D 12.0 million (US$28.2 million) in 1975 to D 29.9 million (US$70.4 million)
in 1976, an increase in works which could not be properly funded.
5.07      About D 1.2 million (US$2.8 million) of SONEDE's liabilities repre-
sents a sum due to the Government in respect of pre-1968 revenues of the former
RDE, for which SONEDE is acting as liquidator. SONEDE's cash balances have
-been adequate for day-to-day operations until the end of 1976 when they were
reduced to D 0.43 million (US$1.0 million) which was too low.
Tariffs
5.08      The present tariff levels went into effect in mid-1974 following a
comprehensive study of SONEDE's financial obligations and future investment
programs. The study concluded that an average rate of 85 millimes would be
required in the years 1974 to 1977 to meet the rate of return covenants of
previous Bank Group loans (Loan 581-TUN, Credit 209-TUN, Loan 989-TUN), i.e.
5% on net fixed assets in 1973 to 1975 and 6% thereafter. The following rate
structure was selected out of various alternatives and approved by the Govern-
ment:
Millimes/m3
Tourism                                      150
Commercial and Industrial                     70
)    68 for first 160 m3/year,
Domestic and Public               )    then 90 for any excess
5.09      The existing tariff structure is adequate and fair.  It takes into
account the high cost of meeting peak demand of tourism facilities, which
SONEDE calculates to be about 130 millimes/m3 in capital costs alone. The
new tariffs increased bednight hotel operating costs by about only 50 millimes
(US$0.12). The tariffs for industrial usage also increased, but it is esti-
mated that the production costs rose by not more than 1%. The rates for small
consumers (about two-thirds of the residential customers) remained unchanged,
but increased for large consumers.



- 20 -
5.10      The present tariff levels are expected to be sufficient to meet, to
the end of 1977, the existing rate of return covenant of 6% on properly valued
net fixed assets, after deducting the assets in villages with less than 2,000
inhabitants and the cost of extensions for domestic customers in urban areas
financed by loans from SONEDE after January 1, 1974. In order to maintain
consistency with a recent Bank loan to the national power utility in Tunisia
(Second Power Project - Loan 1355 TUN), customers' contributions as well as
the assets in villages with less than 2,000 inhabitants, would from 1978 on-
wards be excluded from the rate base in calculating the rate of return. In
view of this change, the rate of return would be increased to 7.5% to provide
the same level of self-financing as under the previous rate of return covenant
(Loan 989-TUN). Additions to fixed assets, inflationary increases of operat-
ing costs and payment of corporate income taxes from 1983 onwards, would re-
quire periodic adjustments of the tariff levels. The average rate per m3 is
forecast to be 96 millimes in 1978, and to rise to 160 millimes in 1982.
These tariff increases would enable SONEDE to finance about 21% of its 1977-82
investment program out of internally generated funds. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that SONEDE would set tariffs adequate to earn a minimum
return of 7.5% in 1978 and subsequent years, on its net fixed assets properly
valued or revalued, and adjusted for the above deductions.
Financing Plan
5.11      The following table sets out SONEDE's estimated total funds require-
ments for the project construction period (1977-1982) and the sources from
which they would be met, assuming that the tariffs would be increased as
outlined in the above paragraph:

5.12      The proposed requirements include (i) US$351.4 million and US$51.8
million to cover SONEDE's capital investments during the Fifth Plan period and
in 1982 respectively; (ii) US$4.5 million to finance house connections and
pipeline extensions; and (iii) US$15.3 million that the Government would pro-
vide to SONEDE to compensate for the cost of relocating two main water pipe-
lines outside the area to be flooded by the Sidi Salem reservoir. SONEDE's
net internal cash generation would provide about 20.7% of the investment re-
quirements, and customers' contributions about 24.3%. The Government contri-
bution of US$117.6 million (D 50.0 million) would be to some extent offset by
revenues from taxes on water sales, US$11.5 million (D 4.9 million), over the
construction period, other taxes and customs duties on equipment and materials
procured by SONEDE for its investment programs (US$6.6 million or D 2.8 mil-
lion), and interest (US$3.5 million or D 1.5 million) on the IDA Credit 209-
TUN relent to SONEDE. The other proposed loans of US$56.5 million (D 24 mil-
lion) are proceeds of bilateral borrowings onlent to SONEDE to finance specific
projects such as the expansion of water supply in the Sahel region and rural
villages, and the tourism infrastructure program in Southern Tunisia.



- 22 -
5.13      The proposed Bank loan of US$21.0 million (D 8.9 million) would
finance the foreign exchange cost of the production component. The terms
assumed for the Bank loan are a maturity of 17 years including 3-1/2 years of
grace and an annual interest rate of 8.2%. The Government will guarantee the
Bank loan to SONEDE. An additional loan of US$23.4 million (D 9.9 million)
would be needed to cover the foreign exchange cost of the distribution works
in Greater Tunis.
Future Finances
5.14      SONEDE's forecast financial statements through 1984 are shown in
Annexes 18 through 20. The assumptions made in preparing these statements
are explained in Annex 21. The predicted cash flow during the next 6 years
is illustrated in Annex 22. SONEDE's financial performance is expected to
continue improving steadily. Financing of investments out of internally
generated funds and customers' contributions would gradually increase to reach
about 47% in 1980 and 63% in 1982. The current ratio would gradually improve
with a build up of cash reserves and the release of retention money. Fluc-
tuations caused by the implementation of the investment program should stab-
ilize by 1982, after which time the current ratio is projected to remain above
one.
5.15      Internal cash generation should cover debt service adequately.  The
debt service coverage is projected not to fall below 2.7. Existing loan and
credit agreements set forth limitations on capital expenditures without prior
consultation with the Bank, as well as limitations on incurrence of debt.
Under the latter, SONEDE is committed not to incur any long-term debt (except
for the projects covered by the agreements) without the Bank Group's concur-
rence, unless its net revenues at the time of incurrence, before depreciation
and interest, are at least 1.5 times the maximum future annual debt service on
the proposed loan and existing debts. This commitment has been restated in
the Loan Agreement.
Monitoring System
5.16      Annex 23 shows the indicators which would be monitored during the
execution of the project to measure the achievement of the technical and finan-
cial goals set for the proposed project. This Annex also gives the values
forecast for these indicators, which SONEDE will review and submit to the Bank
not later than December 31, 1977. Agreement was reached with SONEDE that the
evolution of the indicators will be reported to the Bank on a quarterly basis
during project execution, and on an annual basis for five years following
project completion, and that it will carry out any reasonable remedial actions
suggested by the Bank. During supervision missions, SONEDE's performance will
be discussed and evaluated with its staff on the basis of these indicators.
Risks
5.17      The measures proposed to be taken in the course of project execution,
such as the Bank's monitoring of key indicators of progress and assistance
of consultants for management and construction supervision, should minimize



- 23 -
the risks involved. Works similar to those scheduled have already been suc-
cessfully completed by SONEDE and, with the assistance of consultants, imple-
mentation of this project should pose no major problem. SONEDE is now a well
established organization which has already demonstrated its effective perform-
ance. Its staff is dedicated and the population living in the project area has
shown its willingness to pay for public services. Therefore, the risks of not
achieving the project goals are low.
6. JUSTIFICATION
Objectives of the Proposed Investments
6.01      The need for increasing water supply services in the project area
is critical. Less than 20% of the population in Beja, Nabeul and Tunis Sud
is served with direct house connections, and only 12% in Jendouba. While the
remaining urban population is generally served by public taps, only few people
in the rural areas receive such services. At present most medium - and high -
income families have their dwellings connected to the water systems. Basic-
ally it is the poorer urban population, which is today not connected to the
systems and has to carry its water from public taps, suffering not only incon-
venience but the risks of having it polluted before it is consumed, which
will benefit from the project.
6.02      The works under the proposed project are essential to raise the pre-
sent low percentage of population served and to provide the water supply needed
for further development of industry and tourism in the five provinces.  Under
the present consumption conditions, the available production capacity would be
sufficient to cover the demand only until mid-1979. SONEDE's objective for
the project area is to increase the percentage of the urban population con-
nected to the water network by 1990 to at least 87% in Tunis, 85% in Beja,
Jendouba and Tunis Sud, and 75% in Nabeul. Future water demand in the project
area is illustrated in Annex 12.
Least Cost Solution
6.03      The proposed use of the Medjerdah River is the least cost alter-
native to increase the water supply to the provinces included in the project.
Though this water source is closer to Tunis than existing production facili-
ties, its use was in the past deferred because of the poor quality of the
waters which are generally highly turbid and saline. The possibility now
exists to provide a supply of acceptable quality by using the Medjerdah waters
in conjunction with the existing fresh source of Kasseb. This solution be-
comes more attractive as it is being integrated in the Northern Tunisia Water
Master Plan involving the collection of Tunisia's northern rivers for indus-
trial, urban and agricultural use (paragraph 4.01).
6.04      Apart from the Saida dam, for which a single construction stage is
envisaged, all the other production facilities will be built in three stages.



- 24 -
The first phase is sized to deliver the expected 1990 flows. The second and
third phases, which are less important than the first one, will be executed
after 1990. For the distribution component, besides the facilities programmed
under the proposed project, additional distribution works would be executed
on a continuing basis as the demand increases and the network needs to be
expanded into new areas.
Economic Justification
6.05      The overriding justification for the proposed project is the neces-
sity for providing urgently needed water supply, the basic infrastructure vital
to orderly development of the urban agglomerations of the provinces. The
proposed project is the least cost alternative to provide this supply. The
economic justification is clearly implieà by the fact that the current aver-
age tariff is nearly equal to the long-run average incremental cost of water
based on a 10% opportunity cost of capital which is considered reasonable for
Tunisia (Annex 24). Because of the progressive tariff structure, large con-
sumers now pay more than the average incremental cost for their water. Thus,
these consumers have already demonstrated their willingness to pay the cost
of providing additional water, and with the contemplated tariff increases
(para. 5.10), the average tariff level will be brought up to the full marginal
cost.of water.
6.06      Using current tariff revenues as a minimal measure of project ben-
efits, the internal financial rate of return on the project is 8.6 percent.
A more meaningful economic rate of return is difficult to calculate, but
would certainly be higher due to the unquantifiable health and environmental
benefits which accompany improved water supplies.
Environmental Impact
6.07      One of the main objectives of the Government's Fifth Investment Plan
is to continue to equip the country's major cities with basic infrastructure
such as water supply, sewerage and drainage. The proposed project would help
the Government meet this objective in the five provinces.  Piped water supply
systems would be installed mainly in low-income areas and as a result, sanitary
conditions in these areas would be substantially improved. Provision of run-
ning potable water inside the dwellings would enhance living conditions,
which in turn would result in improved productivity stemming from better
environment and public health.
6.08      As a result of the project, the cities' wastewaters would increase
substantially and would need to be disposed of properly. Construction of
sewage collectors and treatment facilities for Greater Tunis is being partly
financed under the Bank Loan 1088-TUN.  There is no immediate need for sewage
treatment in the rest of the project area.
Institution Building
6.09      The establishment of SONEDE as an effective national authority with
the capability of efficiently managing the sector continues to be the Bank's



- 25 -
main objective. In this regard, the project includes a review and improvement
of SONEDE's information system and computer programs. Besides strengthening
SONEDE's organization, the Bank's involvement would aid the formulation of
proper policies, priorities and procedures that are necessary to accomplish
further progress in the sector.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECO0MMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the various issues re-
ferred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of this report, including the following matters
of particular significance:
(i) By December 31, 1977, SONEDE will enter into an agreement with
the Tunis District for their future cooperation regarding the
construction of the water distribution system in Greater Tunis
(paragraph 2.17);
(ii)  SONEDE will set and maintain water rates adequate to enable it
to earn a minimum return of 6% in 1977, and 7.5% in subsequent
years, on its net fixed assets in operation, properly valued
in a manner acceptable to the Bank (paragraph 5.10);
(iii) Beginning with its annual budget for 1978 the Government will
provide the municipalities with the financial means necessary
to assure timely payment of their water bills (paragraph 3.09);
and,
(iv)  The Government will make available to SONEDE a contribution of
US$23 million for the project, and if necessary, any additional
funds required to meet cost overruns, should SONEDE be unable
to provide them (paragraph 4.12);
7.02      Before the loan is declared effective, the Bank will be satisfied
that a loan agreement has been signed with external lenders in an amount of
US$23.4 million for the financing of distribution works in Greater Tunis
(paragraph 4.11).
7.03      Agreement having been reached on the matters outlined above, the
proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$21.0 million to SONEDE for
a term of 17 years including 3-1/2 years of grace.

TUNISIA
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
PREVIOUS BANK LOANS AND CREDITS IN THE SECTOR
Background
1.        The Bank's involvement in the water supply sector started in late
1966 when a mission visited Tunisia and discussed with the Government a pro-
gram of works for the improvement and expansion of water supply services in
the country's urban areas. In that year only 39% of the urban population
was connected to piped water supply systems which were operated or supervised
by the "Regie de Distribution des Eaux" (RDE), a division of the department of
"Hydraulique et Equipement Rural" (HER) of the Ministry of Agriculture. Under
a special arrangement with RDE, the Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du
Gaz (STEG), the national power authority, operated the distribution system
of Tunis City, the largest in the country. In addition, construction of
large systems was executed by another division of the Ministry of Agriculture
called "Grand Travaux".
2.        RDE was a Government office and as such its financial operations
were administered by the Treasury in conformity with complicated regulations.
RDE's budgets were not balanced and various kinds of expenditures such as
its debt service, were met directly by the Government. Depreciation was
not charged and RDE never prepared balance sheets.
3.        As a first step towards reorganizing the sector, the Government
created an independent authority which would assume responsibility for plan-
ning, constructing and operating water supply systems in the country. On
July 2, 1968 the legislature enacted Law No. 68-22 establishing the "Societe
Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux" (SONEDE). Meanwhile
the Bank had identified a suitable program of works and in 1969 made a first
loan to SONEDE.
Loan 581-TUN - National Water Supply Project, US$15 million, January 16, 1969
4.        Often referred to as the first Bank water supply project, this
project included 52% of SONEDE's investments in water supply works for the
period 1968-1973. The project covered 101 cities and towns located in the
northern and eastern parts of Tunisia and consisted mainly of: (i) the con-
struction of a transmission pipeline from the Oued Kasseb Dam to the western
outskirts of Tunis, and an extension of the distribution system of Tunis
City; (ii) drilling water wells for the Sahel area, doubling transmission
capacity and extending distribution systems in Sousse, Kalaa Kebira and
Msaken; (iii) drilling water wells, constructing reservoirs and intercon-
necting the distribution systems for the cities of Nabeul and Hammamet;
and (iv) supplying and installing meters in all the systems in order to
improve operational efficiency.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
5.        The total project cost was originally estimated at D 17.07 million.
Total expenditures for the project amounted to D 18.24 million. This repres-
ents a very small cost increase, less than 7% over the appraisal estimates,
in spite of some delays in project execution. The construction of the project
main components was completed in 1974, only a year later than originally
scheduled. The rest of the project was completed in December 1976. The loan
was closed on December 31, 1976.
6.        To finance the project the Bank made a loan of US$15 million
(581-TUN) to SONEDE, and the Swedish International Development Authority
(SIDA) approved a credit of US$5 million to the Government. It was a joint
financing which covered 61% of the total project costs; the balance of 39%
was financed by internal cash generation and Government capital contributions.
Both the Bank and the Swedish funds were fully disbursed as of February 28,
1977.
7.        Except for the delays already mentioned, the project execution has
gone fairly well. The most important item of the program, the Kasseb trans-
mission-pipeline, was put in operation in 1973 and water supply services in
Greater Tunis have since greatly improved. The establishment of SONEDE, which
was part of this project, has been successful and has produced the reforms
needed for improving vater supply operations in the country. Today SONEDE is
considered a fairly well run public authority. Except for the late submission
of audit reports (paragraph 3.12), all the loan covenants have been met.
Credit 209-TUN - Second Water Supply Project, US$10.5 million, June 30, 1970
8.        This credit was to finance the second phase of the national program
defined under the first Bank loan and basically covered eight subprojects for
four regions (Bizerte, Cap Bon, Sahel and Southern Tunisia) and four cities
(Beja, Gabes, Kelibia and Sfax), whose water supply systems needed to be re-
inforced and expanded. The subprojects for Sahel and Cap Bon were intended
to complement the construction program started under the first project. The
main features of these subprojects were the drilling of water wells, the
construction of transmission pipelines, pumping stations, storage tanks and
distribution trunks.
9.        The project cost was estimated in the Appraisal Report at D 10 mil-
lion. Total expenditures for the project amounted to D 10.5 million or only
5% higher than the original estimate. As in the case of the first Bank loan,
project completion, originally scheduled for mid-1973, was delayed to the
end of 1976. This late completion mainly stemmed from long delays experienced
in pipe delivery for two of the subprojects, due to the limited capacity of
the local pipe manufacturers.
10.       About 73% of the total project cost, or US$14 million, was jointly
financed by the International Development Association (IDA) and the Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA). The IDA credit (209-TUN) was
for US$10.5 million and the SIDA credit for US$3.5 million. The balance of
27% of the project cost was financed by SONEDE's internal cash generation
and Government contributions. Both credits have been fully disbursed.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
11.       The objective of the second project was to complement the works
initiated under the first project. In this regard the same comments made
on the first project can also be applied to the second one. Like the first
project, the execution of the second has been successful in improving water
supply services in the areas concerned. Strengthening of SONEDE has con-
tinued to progress under the second Bank project.
Loan 989-TUN - Third Water Supply Project, US$23 million, May 29, 1974
12.       This project was designed to improve potable water supply in Sfax,
the country's second largest city, in three villages close to Sfax - Agareb,
Mahres and bienzel Chaker - and in 62 rural centers.  The project includes
the drilling of water wells at about 165 km from Sfax, and laying of a trans-
mission pipeline between the well field and Sfax. The three villages which
are located along the pipeline would be served en route. Additional reser-
voirs would be constructed and the distribution systems in Sfax, Agareb,
Mahres and Menzel Chaker would be expanded.
13.       Approximately 93,000 dwellers living in the 62 rural villages would
be supplied with piped water networks. In addition, the project provides for
a study of the economic implications of using potable water with high levels
of salinity (paragraph 2.04).
14.       The total project cost was estimated in the Appraisal Report at
D 18.53 million. The Bank loan of US$23 million was intended to finance about
54% of this cost; the balance was to to be covered by internal cash generation
and Government contributions. It was at first anticipated that the capacity
of the aquifer, which would be used to supply the project area, was limited,
and for that reason the original scope of the project was to meet only the
peak summer demand until about 1980, a relatively short design period. How-
ever, after pumping tests revealed a much larger potential capacity of the
aquifer, it was agreed to modify the original project design to take advantage
of the volumes of water available, which are now considered capable of meeting
the demand to the year 1990. Consequently a larger pipe diameter and bigger
pump units were selected for the project. As a result of these changes, the
estimated cost of the project increased to D 27.6 million.
15.       Under the Fifth Investment Plan (see Annex 2, Table 2-1), the
Government is providing D 17.1 million to cover the increases in the invest-
ments, and no financial constraint is foreseen. Project completion is now
scheduled for the end of 1981 (instead of 1978 as originally anticipated),
due to the larger volume of works.
Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN - Tourism Infrastructure Project, US$24
Million, September 28, 1972
16.       This project was designed to provide necessary infrastructure in six
tourism areas of Tunisia. The infrastructure package which includes among
other things potable water supply, is now being implemented in the areas of
Tunis North, Tunis South, Hammamet, Sousse, Djerba and Zarzis. The estimated



ANNEX 1
Page 4
total project cost is US$55 million of which US$8. 18 million is earmarked for
water supply works in five areas. No major works were proposed for the
Hammamet area since the existing system has a capacity sufficient to meet
the water demand to 1981.
17.       The areas of Tunis North and Tunis South are presently supplied from
Tunis City's distribution system, and this supply would be reinforced with a
new 12-inch pipeline between Nabeul and the reservoir of Bordj Cedria. In
addition, a new storage tank and distribution mains would be built. In Sousse
the distribution system would be extended and reinforced; a new reservoir would
also be constructed. For Djerba/Zarzis groundwater resources would be devel-
oped and a 20-inch transmission pipeline would be installed. The distribution
networks in Djerba and Zarzis would be improved and extended, and storage capa-
city would be increased. A prefeasibility study for a desalination plant to
serve the Djerba/Zarzis area after 1979 would also be carried out.
18.       The Bank made a loan of US$14 million (858-TUN) and a credit of
US$10 million (329-TUN) towards the financing of the project.  As of January
31, 1977, US$7.8 million of the credit was disbursed. Disbursement of the
loan has not yet started. The Federal Republic of Germany also participates
in the financing of the project through its agency, Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau, which made a credit of US$12.4 million to the Government.
19.       The cost of the water supply component is currently estimated at
US$14.55 million, about 78% higher than the estimates of the Appraisal Report.
The works are expected to be completed by mid-1978, one year and a half later
than the appraisal estimate.
SONEDE's Future Performance
20.       Since 1968 the water supply sector has steadily improved, with the
percentage of population connected to piped water supply systems increasing
from 43% to 62% in 1975. Major administrative reforms have also been accom-
plished through the execution of the first two projects. However, to make
the sector progress further, higher capital investments per capita than those
already made would be required, because of the greater distances between the
water sources and the urban settlements, and the more sophisticated treatment
processes that will need to be applied to these sources before they can be
used for potable water consumption. This in turn calls not only for careful
engineering and financial planning, but most importantly, a realistic pricing
policy to encourage the optimum use of water which is a scarce commodity in
Tunisia.
21.       One of the objectives of the proposed project is to assist SONEDE
in forecasting long term needs of the sector and devising appropriate ways
to meet them. SONEDE's performance will continue to improve, provided it
acquires the capability for making the best use of its limited financial
resources. In this regard the proposed project provides for management
consulting services to review and improve SONEDE's management information
system (paragraph 3.11 and Annex 8).

TUNISIA
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SONEDE'S FIVE-YEAR INVESTM4ENT PLAN (1977-1981)
Present Situation of the Sector
1.        The latest national census in Tunisia, dated May 8, 1975, recorded
the country's total population at 5.6 million, growing at an annual rate of
2.3%. The census also put the urban population at 2.7 million or 47.5% of
the total population, with an annual growth rate of 4.2%. Of the rural
population, which in 1975 reached 2.9 million or 52.5% of the total popula-
tion, only 34.7% or about 1.0 million lived in small agglomerations; the
remainder was dispersed in isolated scattered locations. The rural popula-
tion was estimated to be growing at an annual rate of 0.9%. Some 4,305
rural villages (agglomerations) were tallied during the census.
2.        Tunisia's population distribution between urban and rural has been
changing in the last decade and will continue to change. The urban population
is growing at a much faster rate than the rural population because of higher
natural growth and rural migration toward the urban center. The 1966 census
found that 40.1% of the total population lived in urban areas as compared to
47.5% in 1975. Since 1966 the rural population residing in agglomerated
villages has remained unchanged. Thus there is continuous migration from the
rural agglomerations to urban areas, and from isolated locations to the rural
villages.
3.        Presently about 63% of the total population is served with piped
water supply systems. However, only 30% of this population is supplied
through direct house connections. About 64% of the urban population or 1.8
million people presently have their dwellings connected to the water supply
systems. The remaining urban population, and about 77% of the rural popula-
tion living in agglomerated villages, are supplied by standpipes. Public
water services are not organized in the isolated rural locations.
4.        Water supply services in Tunisia have considerably improved during
the execution of the Government's Fourth Development Plan (1973-1976). When
implementation of the plan started in 1973, about 56% of the total population
was served with piped water supply systems and less than 50% of the urban
population was connected to the public water networks. In 1971, 73.9 million
m3 of potable water was sold; 52.5% of this volume was for domestic use, 25%
for public use, 12% for industrial use and 7.5% for tourism. The percentage
of urban population connected to the systems increased by 14% to 64% at the
end of 1976. About 99.1 million m3 of potable water was consumed in that
year.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Execution of the Fourth Development Plan (1973-1976)
5.        SONEDE's objectives for the Fourth Plan were to increase the per-
centage of population directly served by house connections from 20% to 40%,
and to provide water supply services in 139 more rural villages (with popu-
lation above 500) at the end of the Plan. One of the objectives was to
provide Greater Tunis, Sahel, Cap Bon, Beja, Bizerte, Sfax and Southern
Tunisia with water supply infrastructure adequate to satisfy the water
demand forecast for these regions to 1981. The objectives took also into
account the regions' water supply needs for the projected growth of indus-
trial and tourism activities.
6.        To reach these objectives the Government and SONEDE allocated D 33
million (in 1972 prices) for water supply works needed in the areas described
above. Among these works, the Bank's second and third water supply projects 1/
and the tourism infrastructure project 1/ were programmed. Other works in-
cluded the improvement of production facilities and distribution networks in
Southern Tunisia (Medenine, Djerba-Zarzis), the installation of water supply
systems in 139 rural villages and the execution of 22,500 house connections
annually. In addition to the Bank financing, SONEDE and the Government re-
ceived the financial assistance of SIDA, KFW and local administrations of
the provinces.
7.        As previously discussed in Annex 1, the Bank's second project is
completed and all the facilities are in operation. For the third project,
30% of the work program was executed at the end of 1976, and its completion
is scheduled for the end of 1981. The project in Southern Tunisia is com-
pleted. Of the 139 rural villages originally considered, new works were
carried out in 89 of them, and improvement works were executed in 31. Overall,
though only about 60% of the original plan for expansion of the distribution
systems was executed at the end of 1976, some 27,500 dwellings were each year
connected to the systems, a 22% increase over the initial goal of the Plan.
8.        At the end of the Fourth Plan period, about 30% of the total popula-
tion had direct access to piped water supply, 10% short of the Plan's target
for the urban sector. In the rural sector the results have also been encour-
aging: the percentage of rural population served by standpipes increased by
35% by the end of 1976. SONEDE's financial performance during the execution
of the Plan has been good; it contributed 29% of the investment costs from
internal cash generation compared with the original estimate of 22%. From
1972 through 1976 water sales grew annually at a lower rate (6.2%) than fore-
cast (8%), in part because of lower levels of tourism activities than antici-
pated, and various tariff increases.
1/   Progress of these projects is discussed in Annex 1.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Objectives of the Fifth Investment Plan (1977-1981)
9.        The objectives of the Fifth Plan are to serve 70% of the expected
1981 total population with piped water supply, with at least 42% of this
population directly connected to the systems. Over the next five years SONEDE
is planning to execute annually some 36,000 water connections and to extend
the distribution systems each year by about 400 kms of secondary pipes. In
the rural areas SONEDE expects to construct potable water supply systems in
65 more agglomerations. Water sales are projected to grow at an average
annual rate of 6% to reach 126.2 million m3/year at the end of 1981.
Components of the Plan
10.       In addition to the ongoing works of the Fourth Plan, the following
projects are included in the Fifth Plan:
-    Water Supply Production for five northern provinces:  Beja,
Jendouba, Nabeul, Tunis and Tunis Sud.
-    Expansion of Distribution in Greater Tunis and the above
provinces.
-    Water Supply for Bizerte and Adjacent Localities.
-    Improvement Works in the Sahel Area.
-    Water Supply Production for Sahel.
-    Supply Improvement in Gabes Industrial Area.
-    Extension of Distribution Systems in other selected areas.
-    Water Systems for 65 Rural Villages.
The projects of the Fifth Plan together with the required annual investments
are listed in Table 2-1. The Plan will be submitted to the legislature for
approval in May 1977. The proposed Bank project covers the first two items
of the Plan and is conceived to meet the expected 1990 water demand in the
five northern provinces considered. The works proposed for the other regions
are also oriented towards meeting similar goals.
11.       SONEDE is budgeting D 156 million for the proposed works.  Of this
amount D 38.8 million would be used to complete the current projects of the
Fourth Plan. SONEDE is expected to be able to finance about 38.8% of the
investments with internal cash generation and through customers' contribu-
tions. This assumes that water rates would be adjusted to allow SONEDE to
realize a 7.5% return on its net fixed assets as specified in the draft loan
agreement, and that the conditions for granting loans to eligible new cus-
tomers would be changed, reducing the terms of payment of the connections
from 10 years to 5 and charging commercial interest rates on the loan balance.

TUNISIA
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
FORECAST OF WATER SALES AND NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS
Past Water Sales
1.        Volumes of potable water consumed in Tunisia have been recorded
since 1958. However, these records are considered reliable only from 1966.
after water meters were installed on most of the house connections and a
rigid water maintenance program started to be implemented. In 1966 water
sales amounted to 52.1 million m3 (Mm3) with more than 55% of this volume
for domestic usage. In that year about 39.5% of the urban population was
served with service pipes resulting in a per capita annual consumption of
72.5 m3 1/. In 1966 some 719,000 people, most of them in Greater Tunis,
were connected to the water supply systems.
2.        In the years following 1966 the percentage of urban population
with service pipes has been increasing rapidly. In 1975 about 1.6 million
people or 62% of the urban population was connected to the networks. In
that year 93.5 Mm3 of potable water was consumed amounting to a per capita
annual consumption of 56.8 m3. The evolution of water sales in the last
ten years is shown in Table 3-1. As can be seen in Column 6 of this table,
the per capita consumption steadily decreased as the water supply systems
reached increased percentages of the urban population. This decrease in
the average consumption can be explained by the fact that low income con-
sumers use less water than well-to-do customers. As the networks are
generally first installed in high and medium income areas and are progres-
sively extended into low income areas, the average per capita consumption
would continue to decrease.
House Connections
3.        The number of connections 2/ which were only 86,000 in 1966 also
steadily increased to reach 242,260 in 1975, an increase of more than 181%
1/   In the following computations the volumes of water consumed at
standpipes, representing less than 5% of the total consumption, are
not considered separately. All usages, domestic, commercial, indus-
trial, tourism and public are expressed as a per capita consumption
by urban people directly connected to the systems. The number of
water connections in rural areas is considered negligible.
2/   Apartment houses built before 1975 are supplied by a single connection
and water bills are shared equally by the tenants. The new apartment
buildings that are now under construction provide for an individual
meter for each apartment, thus allowing individual billing for each
tenant.

over the 1966 level. During the same period, however, water sales increased
by only 79% reflecting again the fact of higher population density and lower
consumption in low income areas. The evolution of the connections is shown
in Table 3-1. The average annual consumption per connection continued to
decline between 1966 and 1975. In 1966 it was about 606 m3; it decreased
to 386 m3 in 1975. The average number of people served by each connection,
which was about 8.4 in 1966 also declined to about 6.8 in 1975, reflecting the
predominance of single-family dwellings in small lots in low income areas of
the country.
4.        During the period considered various tariff increases were imple-
mented, which caused some reduction in demand. However, given the low per-
centage of urban population served, the assumed reduction is not believed to
have had a great effect on the trend of water consumption observed between
1966 and 1975.
Future Water Sales
5.        In forecasting SONEDE's water sales in the next 10 years it has
been assumed that the percentage of urban population directly connected to
the systems would increase from 62% in 1975 to about 83% in 1986. This would
represent an overall increase of 21% similar to that accomplished between 1966
and 1975. Observing the past trend of water sales and population connected, a
mathematical test of the historical data shows that if the population connected
Six" is multiplied by a constant factor "A", water sales increased by the same
factor raised at a constant power "n". The test also shows that the same pro-
perty exists between the population connected and the number of connections,
and between water sales and the number of connections. Observing further
that for zero population connected, water sales and the number of connections
should be nil, it becomes obvious that the relationships between the popula-
tion connected, water sales and number of connections can be expressed by
functions of the form y = Axn which are represented by parabolic curves which,
when plotted in log scales, are straight lines.
6.        To predict future water sales, a mathematical model of water con-
sumption vs population connected to the distribution network in Tunisia was
developed. This model is expressed by the equation:
x 0.66                                     (1)
Y     1.44
where "x" is the population connected in thousands and "y" water sales in
Mm3/year. The constants "A" and "n" of the equation were determined by the
method of least squares using the values observed for "x" and "y" between
1966 and 1975.
7.        Similarly a mathematical model relating water sales to number
of connections were derived from the observed data. This relationship is
represented by the equation:
x 2.11                                     (2)
Y      58.4



ANNEX 3
Page 4
where "x" represent water sales in Mm3/year and "y" the number of connections
in thousands. Both functions are graphically represented in Annex 4. As it
can be observed on this graph, the correlation of the historical data is
almost perfect.
8.        Water sales forecast for 1977 through 1985 are shown in Table 3-1.
It is predicted that the sales would grow in the next decade at an average
annual rate of 6%. This rate is projected assuming that 83% of the urban
population would be connected to the systems by 1986. The growth would be
slower if a lower percentage is to be reached by 1986. It should be noted
that equations (1) and (2) are independent of time, and years are introduced
in Table 3-1 only for estimating the number of house connections that SONEDE
should execute every year to realize the predicted water sales.
Future Number of Connections
9.        The relationship between population connected and number of connec-
tions in Tunisia is expressed by the equation:
x 1.45                                      (3)
182.1
where "x" is the population connected in thousands and "y" the number of
connections in thousands. This relationship was derived following the
same procedures used to develop the model for water sales. Equation (3)
is graphically represented in Annex 4. The predicted number of connections
appears in Table 3-1. Over the next five years SONEDE is expected to increase
the number of its customers by about 36,000 until 1980, and then to 50,000
after that year.
10.       The above equations give results which correlate remarkably.  For
instance, estimating the urban population connected to the network, equations
(1) and (3) will give the expected water sales and number of connections.
In a different approach, knowing the water sales, equation (2) will give the
number of connections. The results in both cases are very close with varia-
tions of less than 10%.
Trend of Per Capita Consumption
11.       As stated earlier, as more consumers are being connected to the
water network, the average per capita consumption would continue to decline.
After the entire urban population is connected, the average per capita con-
sumption will stabilize and will probably start growing. The first evolution
stage of the average per capita consumption "y" (in m3/year) may be related
to the population connected "x" (in thousands) by an hyperbolic function in
the form of y = b + c. Applying the method of least squares to the historical
data, the above function is expressed in the form:
y = 39.7 + 27-2                                 (4)
x

12.       Equation (4) is represented graphically in Annex 5.  It becomes a
straight line when consumption "y" is plotted against the reciprocals (1/x)
of the populations connected, using arithmetic scales for both variables.
As the percentage of urban population connected to the water systems keeps
increasing, the average per capita consumption tends towards a minimum value
of 110 liters/day which is considered realistic.

ANNEX 6

NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
OUTLINE OF FUTURE COOPERATION BETWEEN SONEDE AND THE TUNIS DISTRICT
Background
1.        The Greater Tunis District vas established by the Government in
1972 to be responsible for the urban development of the Tunis metropolitan
area. As such, the Tunis District plans, coordinates and supervises public
investment programs in urban infrastructure such as housing, public trans-
portation and roads. The District vas set up as part of the Tunis Urban
Planning and Public Transport Project (Loan 737-TUN/Credit 432-TUN) to pro-
mote better urban planning in Greater Tunis. It operates under the super-
vision of the "Conseil Superieur du District" and its role and authority
have been defined through administrative circulars.
2.        Planning of future development of water supply and sewerage in
Greater Tunis needs to be closely coordinated with the District whose policy
regarding land use in the area would determine the pace and priorities of
such development. In this regard any proposed expansion of water supply and
sewerage should follow zoning plans prepared by the District. This view has
already been accepted by the Government and is being emphasized through the
First Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1088-TUN) which calls for close coopera-
tion between the Sewerage Authority (ONAS) and the District. A similar type
of cooperation is envisaged for SONEDE which should coordinate the construc-
tion of its distribution works in Greater Tunis with the District's plans.
Areas of Consultation
3.        SONEDE and the District should consult each other on any investment
programs which might affect urban development in Greater Tunis. Specifically
the District should inform SONEDE of proposals for land development and use,
and assure that vater supply can be made available for such land at reason-
able cost. Proposed land use whether industrial, commercial, residential or
recreational, should also be made known to SONEDE. On its side, SONEDE should
coordinate its expansion programs vith the District and should install water
networks in areas recommended by the District. Consultation should also
cover future population, population density and type of housing projected
for a specific area. SONEDE's plans should be prepared on the basis of such
data. Per capita consumption and volumes of water to supply to these areas
should continue to be decided by SONEDE.
4.        The objective of the proposed expansion of the distribution system
is to cover the water supply needs of the 1990 urban population forecast by
the District. The general layout of the system, in particular the location



ANNEX 6
Page 2
of the primary mains, was reviewed by the District. Prior to the installa-
tion of these mains, the District's evaluation should be sought again. Any
proposed network extension and laying of secondary pipelines should also be
reviewed by the District.
Nature of Future Cooperation
5.        Future cooperation between SONEDE and the District should be
defined through a formal agreement which should provide for continuing dia-
logue between the two agencies to ensure that SONEDE's long-term plans are
consistent with the planned urban growth pattern and strategy for Greater
Tunis. The agreement should call for:
(i) the District's review and evaluation of SONEDE's long-range
programs for expansion of the water distribution network in
Greater Tunis;
(ii)  submission to SONEDE by the District of its long-range develop-
ment plans and proposals for land use;
(iii)  the District's review of SONEDE's annual investment works and
its recommendation of areas to be served with potable water;
(iv)  periodic consultation with the District on the scheduling of
SONEDE's distribution works;
(v) periodic review by SONEDE and the District of approved policies
and programs, their improvement and implementation;
(vi)  the District's assistance to SONEDE in coordinating its
activities with those of other agencies;
(vii)  procedures and arrangements for reviewing the execution of
approved programs and for agreeing on necessary changes in
these programs;
(viii)  the nature and extent of information collection, surveys and
studies that are needed by both agencies and which should be
undertaken jointly; and
(ix)  continuing exchange of information, views and planning concepts.
6.        The draft Loan Agreement provides for the signing of the agreement
between SONEDE and the District not later than December 31, 1977. The main
points to be covered in this agreement were discussed and agreed upon during
loan negotiations.

SUGGESTED TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR REVIEW OF
SONEDE'S MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM
Scope of the Review
1.        The proposed review includes a complete evaluation of SONEDE's
existing systems of reports prepared for its management with regard to all
aspects of its operations. The review will in particular cover SONEDE's
financial activities including procedures for budget preparation, budgetary
control, registration of new connections and deletion of cut-off connections
from SONEDE's master files, water sales, levels of accounts receivable, post-
ing of accounts, staffing and training.
2.        In reviewing the actual system, the consultant will pay particular
(but not exclusive) attention to the adequacy of information contained, as
well as of standards, the intervals at which these reports are prepared and
the distribution thereof. Based on his findings, the consultant will prepare
detailed proposals for necessary modification of the system of reports to be
submitted to SONEDE's top management.
Specific Areas
3.        The consultant will in particular review:
(i) the type of financial information that is regularly sent to
management. He will evaluate the presentation of this in-
formation and the intervals at which it reaches management.
He will ensure that the information is sufficiently concise,
readily understandable and truly reflects the company's
situation;
(ii) the adequacy of the information provided to management,
whether it monitors progress in a timely fashion and provides
the opportunity to take corrective actions when needed;
(iii)  the procedures that are followed in preparing the information,
the closeness and smoothness of cooperation between the various
departments involved in the preparation of the reports and
the possibility of cross-checking, for instance, data of the
Finance Department with those of the Statistics Division;
(iv) whether internal regulations defining the objective, function
and preparation of the information system exist, and the
degree of enforcement of such regulations;



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(v) the time limit accorded to management for analyzing the reports,
the follow-up actions expected by the departments and the es-
tablishment of the responsible levels for taking plans; and
(vi) whether the system provides for continuing evaluation of the
results, and defines responsibility for achievement of the
plans; and
(vii)  whether the system is sufficiently problem-oriented to
pinpoint the areas of weakness of a specific moment in a
particular situation.
Report to SONEDE
4.        The consultant will submit to SONEDE a review report covering the
above points, and will recommend specific actions on standards, responsibility
of preparation, frequency and distribution of the information reports. The
consultant will propose deadlines for preparation of the periodic information,
for comments and recommendations to be addressed to higher levels of manage-
ment and the time limit for management comments and actions. He will also
propose a system for monitoring the deadlines for the preparation of the
reports.
5.        The review is expected to be completed within six months of initia-
tion of the assignment. If judged necessary, the consultant will be requested
to assist SONEDE in implementing any suggested modifications of the information
system that would have been accepted by SONEDE. He will further review the
modified system after it has been in use for some time.

TUNISIA
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
EXISTING WATER SUPPLY FACILITIES
A.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AREA
1.        Presently Tunisia is divided into 18 Provinces (Governorates) and
136 Counties (Delegations). Five of these provinces, namely Beja, Jendouba,
Nabeul, Tunis and Tunis Sud, located in the country's northern region, are
included in the project (see Map 12713). Tunis, the most populated province,
is basically an administrative and residential center. The nation's capital,
Tunis City, is located in this province. Commercial and industrial activities
predominate in Beja and Tunis Sud (the latter was created in 1974 after new
boundaries were defined for the provinces of Tunis, Bizerte, Beja, Kairouan,
Sousse and Nabeul). Agriculture is still the main activity in Jendouba and
Nabeul, though tourism industry has been making rapid strides in the latter.
Some tourism development is also taking place in Tunis Sud.
2.        The populations of the counties included in the project area, as
recorded by the last census dated May 8, 1975, are given in Table 9.1. Except
for the provinces of Jendouba and Nabeul where only 32% and 75% of the respec-
tive urban populations are covered by the project, almost the entire urban
populations of the other provinces are projected to be served under the pro-
posed project. Only part of the rural population of the provinces is included
in the project. The census put the total population in the project area at
1.6 million growing at an annual rate of 2.2%. More than 68% of this pop-
ulation is considered urban. About 78% of this urban population lives in
Greater Tunis.
3.        Of the rural population, which in 1975 reached 517,000, only 253,000
or 49% lived in small agglomerations; the remainder was dispersed in isolated
scattered locations. The census results also showed that continuous migration
from the rural agglomerations to the urban areas, and from the isolated loca-
tions to the rural villages, had been taking place. It is anticipated that by
the end of this century, people residing in the isolated rural locations would
represent not more than 10% of the total population in the project area.
Therefore, no special effort is envisaged to serve this isolated rural popu-
lation, for as this population moves to the rural agglomerations, provision
would be made for its supply. The evolution of the populations together with
the percentages of these populations to be served in future under the project
are discussed in detail in Annex 10.
4.        A relatively mild climate prevails in the project area, though high
temperatures and heavy storms occasionally occur in summer.

B.   PRODUCTION FACILITIES
The Northern Complex
5.        Considered the most important water supply production facility in
the area, this complex exploits the water sources of Oued El Lil and Kasseb.
The Oued El Lil system which was put in service in 1954, consists basically
of an impounding reservoir (Ben Metir) on the El Lil River, from which water
is first turbined and then conducted to a stilling basin of 100,000 m3 located
at an elevation of 237 m. From there the water passes through 14 semi-slow
filters with an overall capacity of 1,750 liters per second, after which it
is chlorinated and transmitted by gravity to the service areas.
6.        The filtration plant (Fernana) is situated at about 131 km from a
junction basin at Gdir El Goulla located in the western outskirts of Tunis
City. The maximum capacity of the transmission pipeline between the Fernana
plant and Tunis is 44.15 Mm3/year. Available studies indicate that the aver-
age yearly volume of water regulated in the Ben 21etir reservoir is only
37.00 Mm3, resulting in a possible annual deficit of about 7.15 Mm3. This
deficit can be made up by pumping from the Bou Heurtma reservoir located 4 km
downstream the Fernana plant. Presently six communities (Ain Draham, Fernana,
Bou Salem, Beja, Testour and Tebourba) and two sugar factories located along
the pipeline are supplied with the Oued El Lil waters.
7.        The other system (Kasseb), part of the construction of which was
financed under the first Bank loan to SONEDE, includes an impounding reservoir
of 80 Mm3 built near the city of Beja, on the Kasseb River.  Water drawn from
the reservoir is first turbined through a small power plant and is then con-
ducted through a 121 km pipeline to a small reservoir at Gdir El Goulla.
Then it is treated in a conventional treatment plant whose average capacity
is 1,440 liters/second; the plant's peak flow is estimated to be 2,100
liters/second. The average yearly volume of water regulated through the
Kasseb reservoir is calculated to be 42.50 Mm3, slightly lower than the pipe-
line capacity estimated at 44.15 Mm3. There is no service en route on the
pipeline between Kasseb and Gdir El Goulla.
8.        The Kasseb waters are of good quality (low turbidity and color) and
are only filtrated and chlorinated year round, though the plant is equipped
for full conventional treatment. The only chemical used at Gdir El Goulla is
copper sulfate to control the blooming of algaes in the Gdir El Goulla reser-
voir. After their treatment, the Kasseb waters are mixed with the Oued El Lil
waters at the junction basin mentioned earlier and are then conducted through
two pipelines of 1,250 mm and 1,190 mm in diameter to the Ras Tabia reservoir
which controls the distribution in Greater Tunis. Volumes of water produced
are metered at Fernana, Gdir El Goulla and Ras Tabia. Flows in the Oued El
Lil pipeline are controlled downstream at Gdir el Goulla, while the control
for the Kasseb pipeline is upstream at its intake.

The Southern Complex
9.        Known as the first public water supply aqueduct for Greater Tunis,
the southern complex is made up of a multitude of water sources of which the
most important ones are the Oued Kebir, the springs and wells of Bargou, Kebir,
Djoubar and Zaghouan, and the well fields of Kheldia, Bakbaka and Manouba.
The only surface water source is Oued Kebir which is provided with filter
units. Except for the wells in Kheldia, Bakbaka and Manouba whose flow is
transmitted through three separate pipelines, all the other sources are con-
nected to a gravity aqueduct and a 900-mm pipeline which both discharge at
the Djebel Oust junction basin. From this point two 550-mm pipelines and an
aqueduct supply water to Greater Tunis. Two small urban centers, Pont du
Fahs and Zaghouan, situated upstream of the Djebel basin, are also supplied
by the southern complex.
Local Resources
10.       In addition to the northern and southern complexes, other local water
resources are used to supply potable water in the project area.  In Jendouba
about 28% of the actual consumption is provided by local sources which have a
capacity sufficient to continue supplying the same percentage in the future.
Two sources in Beja presently supply about 1.0 Mm3/year. In Nabeul there
are presently 25 wells, 4 springs and 1 surface water source producing about
3.15 Mm3/year. The total capacity of the actual local resources is put at
4.5 Mm3/year.
C.   DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES
Greater Tunis
Il.       The gridiron system of water distribution in Greater Tunis originates
at the junction basin of Gdir El Goulla from which two pipelines (0 1,190 mm
and 0 1,250 mm) of 8 km conduct filtered water to the reservoir of Ras Tabia
located in the western outskirts of Tunis City (see Map 12716). A pipe branch
of 0 500 mm connected to the 0 1,250 mm pipeline supplies the reservoir of
Manouba.  From Ras Tabia three main transmission lines cover Greater Tunis:
(i) the northern pipeline (0 1,190/800 mm) of 20 km supplies
the reservoirs of Ariana and Amilcar;
(ii) a central line of 800 mm of 1.4 km feeding the reservoir
of Belvedere; and
(iii)  the southern pipeline of 0 1,190 mm of 10 km connected to
the reservoir of Bir Kassa and supplying en route the reser-
voirs of Manouba and Mathildeville. This pipeline terminates
in Nabeul.



ANNEX 9
Page 5
12.       Tunis City is presently served by two main water networks:
(a)  The Lower Tunis System supplied from elevation 45 by three
reservoirs: Lower Belvedere, Sidi Abdallah and Lower Manoubia.
This system covers the center of the city (including the old
city) and the western part near Sedjoumi Sebka. This network
is in good condition and functions well; and
(b)  The Higher Tunis System fed from elevation 72 by four reservoirs:
High Belvedere, High Manoubia, Mathildeville and Manouba.  This
network extends from east of the airport to the town of Manouba;
on south it reaches the hills of Bir Kassa. This system is
loose and does not work properly.
13.       In the northern suburb, water services are provided by the Ariana
network supplied from elevation 63, and by a small network fed from elevation
146 covering exclusively the new Tunis University. Works are underway to
install an intermediate system at elevation 109. The suburban cities of
La Marsa, Sidi Bou Said, Carthage and La Goullete on the northern coast are
served by: (i) the Amilcar system supplied from elevation 77 by the Amilcar
reservoir, extending from the hills of Carthage to Cap Gamarth; (ii) the
Carthage system supplied from elevation 38, covering the town of La Goullete;
(iii) the Raouad system fed from elevation 56, supplying the tourism area
developed along Raouad Beach; and (iv) two small systems supplying the hills
of Gamarth and Sidi Bou Said, from elevations 91 and 131 by the reservoirs
of Marsa, High Gamarth and Phare.
14.       Five water networks provide service in the southern suburb.  Among
them the two important ones are (a) the South system supplied from elevation
50 by three reservoirs: Fochville, La Batie and Foundouk Choucha. This
network serves in particular the Tunis industrial area; and (b) the Hamman-Lif
system which is very old and needs to be reinforced.
15.       Most of the networks are now saturated and need to be expanded
in order to provide better service. Actually, the major constraint is the
limited capacity of the transmission pipelines between the networks. Total
storage capacity in Greater Tunis equals 160,000 m3 equivalent to the present
maximum day consumption.
Other Areas
16.       The capacity of the distribution networks in the rest of the project
area is also saturated resulting in low pressures in the systems and frequent
interruptions of service. Most of the systems are made up of a single network
in which adequate pressures cannot be maintained. In the city of Beja where
a change of topographic level of about 110 m is found, the system is divided
into various stages, but the pipelines are old and of limited capacity. The
distribution networks of Medjez El Bab and Pont du Fahs should be expanded to
cover new urban settlements.

17.       Potable water in the province of Nabeul is now partly supplied by
a 800-mm pipeline connected to the Tunis network at Bir Kassa. This pipeline
has the capacity necessary to supply the northern region of Nabeul (Cap Bon
Nord) up to the year 2000. At Grombalia where the pipeline diameter changes
in 600 mm and water is pumped to the southern region of Nabeul (Cap Bon Sud)
the capacity of the 600-mm trunk and pumping station is limited to about
8.5 Mm3/year which would meet the water supply needs in Cap Bon Sud until
1985. It is proposed that additional water demand in Cap Bon Sud after 1985
be covered by other local sources.

TUNISIA
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
POTABLE WATER NEEDS IN PROJECT AREA
Present Consumption and Production
1.        Present per capita water consumption differs widely in the five
provinces supplied under the proposed project. It varies from 158 liter/day
in Tunis to 112 liters/day in Beja. This difference essentially stems from
domestic consumption which averages 105 liters/day in Greater Tunis, but
only 49 liters in Beja and Tunis Sud. Daily per capita consumption for
commercial, industrial and public usages is similar in the five provinces,
about 60 liters. Domestic consumption by people supplied through public
taps averages 12 lpcd.
2.        The evolution of population served and per capita daily consumption
in the five provinces from 1972 through 1975 is shown in Table 10-1.  While
almost 68% of the total population in Tunis is connected to piped water
supply systems, only about 16% of the population in Beja and Tunis Sud is
served through direct house connections. This percentage is now about 12%
in Jendouba and 20% in Nabeul. The percentage of population connected to
the public water networks has been increasing at a rapid pace in the last
five years. Between 1972 and 1975 it increased by 10% in Tunis, 8% in Tunis
Sud, 7% in Nabeul and 4% in Beja and Jendouba. It is expected that these
growth rates will continue in future.
3.        In 1975 a total volume of 51.35 Mm3 was consumed in the five
provinces, amounting to an increase of 6.2% over 1974 consumption. However,
consumption in 1976 is estimated at 51.76 Mm3, an increase of only 0.8% over
the previous year's consumption. The annual consumption growth rates ob-
served since 1970 are shown in Table 10-2. The average annual growth rate
during the period 1970-1976 was 5.1%; this rate was 5.9% between 1970 and
1975.
4.        Unaccounted for water in the project area presently amounts to
35% of the total volumes of water produced. This percentage is considered
high. SONEDE has recently undertaken a special program of leak detection
in order to reduce the water losses to not more than 25%. The total volumes
of water produced since 1970 are shown in Table 10-2. Total production avail-
able in the five provinces is today estimated at 93.5 Mm3.

Composition of Demand
5.        Water consumption patterns also differ widely in the five provinces.
Essentially water consumed in Tunis is for domestic and public usage, thus
reflecting the administrative and residential character of the area. Such
usage is relatively low in Beja and Nabeul where agricultural activity pre-
dominates. More than 40% of the total volume of water consumed in Nabeul is
for tourism activity. Industrial water demand is only important in Beja and
Tunis Sud where it accounts for 33% and 27% of the respective volumes distri-
buted in these two provinces.
6.        A breakdown of water consumed in 1975 apportions the various uses
as follows:

7.        SONEDE's largest consumers with service pipes of 80 mm or more and
representing only 0.2% of the total consumers use about 23% of the total volu-
mes of water distributed in the project area. The largest users with service
pipes of 40 mm or more accounting for 1.7% of SONEDE's customers consume about
43% of the volumes of water distributed. The smallest consumers, with house
connections of less than 15 mm, representing more than 85% of the customers,
use only 33% of SONEDE's water production. The above distribution indicates
that any program for reduction of water losses inside the dwellings should
concentrate exclusively on the largest customers.
8.        There are presently about 128,000 service connections in the project
area. On average each water connection in Tunis serves about 6.2 persons; the
lowest density per connection is in Jendouba where only 5.2 persons are sup-
plied by a service pipe.
Forecast of Consumption
9.        Forecasts of water consumption in the next 30 years are summarized
in Table 10-4 and illustrated in Annex 12. Prediction of future consumption
is based on the method and data discussed in Annex 3. The percentages of
urban population directly connected to the water supply networks are deter-
mined on the basis of the number of connections that SONEDE might be able
to execute yearly in the provinces. It is anticipated that by 1986, except
for Nabeul, more than 83% of the urban population will be provided with direct
service connections. This percentage would reach at least 90% in all the
provinces by 2006. The per capita consumption of people served by public taps
is projected to be about 15 liters/day.

10.       Except for tourism consumption in Nabeul, water demand for commer-
cial, industrial and public usages is projected proportionally to the urban
population. Water demand for tourism in Nabeul is based on the number of
hotel beds projected for this province, and is estimated to reach 8.37 Mm3
by year 2006.



ANNEX 10
Page 5
11.       Water consumption is expected to grow at an average annual rate of
about 6% between 1975 and 1980, then at 5% up to 1986, and at 4.5% until 2006.
The average annual growth rate during the entire design period (1976-2006)
is estimated to be 5.0%. Assuming that the percentage of unaccounted for l/
water would progressively decline from 33% in 1980 to 25% by 2006, total water
production is forecast to increase from 101.67 Mm3 in 1980 to 285.09 Mm3 by
2006, thus growing at an average annual rate of 4.5%. This growth rate is
lower than the consumption growth rate because of the anticipated decrease
in water losses.
12.       The maximum day demand is calculated to be 30% higher than the
yearly average demand; the maximum hour consumption is projected to be 70%
higher than the average hour demand.
May 9, 1977
1/   Until now SONEDE has been unable to reduce substantially the water losses,
because of the impossibility of shutting off the transmission pipelines to
repair water leaks, due to small reserve available near Tunis. This situa-
tion will change after the Saida reservoir is built, which will remove
this constraint and make it possible for SONEDE to carry out the necessary
works.



ANNEX 11

TUNISIA
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
THE PROPOSED WORKS
A. Required Water Production
Existing Production Capacity
1.        A description of the existing production facilities was made in
Annex 9 and forecasting of water demand in the project area was carried out
in Annex 10. As stated earlier, at present more than 80% of water consump-
tion in the project area is supplied by the two northern regional systems,
Oued El Lil and Kasseb. Water for these systems is stored in the reservoirs
of Ben Metir and Kasseb, whose storage capacities are calculated to be 57.15
Mm3 and 81.70 Mm3 respectively. About 9 Mm3 of water lies below the lowest
invert of the Ben Metir outlet, thus reducing its useful storage to about
48 Mm3. The useful storage of the Kasseb reservoir is estimated at 80 Mm3.
The rate of silting-up in both reservoirs averages 0.21 Mm3 per year. Monthly
inflows recorded in the last twenty years are available.
2.        To determine the potential capacity of the northern regional sources,
a probabilistic operation of the Ben Metir and Kasseb reservoirs was carried
out, assuming that the probability of a 10% deficit or more in the average
capacity would not be more than 3%. Discounting the volumes lost by silting
and evaporation, it is estimated that up to the year 2000, an annual flow of
33.5 Mm3 would be available at Ben Metir. For Kasseb this capacity would
average 41.0 Mm3/year. These flows can transit through the existing trans-
mission pipelines which have higher capacity.
3.        Total average production capacity available, including the southern
complex and other local resources, today is put at 93.50 Mm3/year. This capac-
ity would meet water demand only to mid-1979. From that time through mid-1982,
when the planned Medjerdah/Cap Bon is expected to be in operation, raw water
will be drawn from the existing Medjerdah canal to meet the production deficit.
The temporary drawing is further discussed in paragraph 10 of this annex.
Water Quality
4.        Salinity of the waters stored in Ben Metir and Kasseb has been
monitored since 1969. The record of monthly measurements of salinity in
Kasseb indicates that the average yearly content in chlorides steadily de-
clined from 304 mg/l in 1969 to 270 mg/i in 1975. A similar trend has been
observed in Ben Metir whose content in chlorides averaged 151 mg/l in 1975.
For all purposes these salinities are considered acceptable. In contrast,
the salinity of the Medjerdah river (the project's water supply source) is
relatively high.  It fluctuated between 1,100 mg/i and 2,800 mg/i in the



ANNEX 11
Page 2
last twenty years. This salinity is projected to increase after the Sidi
Salem dam is completed. It is anticipated that the chloride content of the
Sidi Salem waters at times might be as high as 4,200 mg/l.
5.        The southern complex and other existing local resources supply fresh
waters of good quality. The chloride content of other northern sources that
will probably be used in the future for supplying the project area is rela-
tively moderate. Based on existing records, an average salinity of 900 mg/1
is predicted for Djoumine, and 700 mg/l for Sedjenane, Madene and Berrak.
The salinity of potable waters for the project is specified to be less than
1,000 mg/i with a 3% probability that it might exceed this limit by 20%.
6.        The Kasseb waters have very low turbidity, but are relatively odor-
ous and colored due to algae growth in the Gdir El Goulla reservoir. The
Medjerdah waters are highly turbid with high content of settleable solids.
Future Potable Water Needs
7.        Water demand forecasts in the project area are shown in Table 11-1.
The demands are projected separately for the areas located upstream and down-
stream of Gdir El Goulla. The former includes the provinces of Beja and
Jendouba, and part of Tunis Sud Province, and is being supplied by local re-
sources and the Oued El Lil system. Thus the volume of water available from
this system at Gdir El Goulla is the difference between the production at
Fernana Plant and consumption en route in the areas upstream of Gdir El Goulla.
These volumes will keep decreasing throughout the years since the demand for
service en route will be increasing with time. By the year 2006 only one third
of the average production at Fernana will reach Gdir El Goulla.
8.        Areas downstream of Gdir El Goulla include the provinces of Tunis
and Nabeul and the rest of Tunis Sud Province. They are at present supplied
with water by the balance of the Oued El Lil system, the Kasseb system, the
southern complex and local resources in Nabeul. From mid-1979 annual water
production at Gdir El Goulla would need to be increased progressively to reach
about 215 Mm3 by the year 2006. While the Kasseb source will provide about
41 Mm3, the balance of 174 Mm3 would come from the Medjerdah/Cap Bon canal,
which has been identified as the immediate and most economical supply source
for the project area. A computer model (ORSTOM) has been developed to simulate
river flows and water quality in the Medjerdah basin and the operation of the
Sidi Salem reservoir, and to forecast possible water shortage in the northern
region of the country.

ANNEX 11
Page 4
9.        The evolution of water production for the project area is illus-
trated in Annex 12. In projecting water demand in Nabeul, it has been assumed
that only part of the water consumption in this province would be supplied
from Gdir El Goulla. The average capacity of the Grombalia pumping station
and the 600-mm transmission pipeline presently supplying South Nabeul is put
at 8.5 Mm3/year. It is proposed that future supply from Tunis be limited to
this amount. The balance of water needs in South Nabeul would be supplied by
local resources.
10.       To provide for the expected production deficit until the construc-
tion of the Medjerdah/Cap Bon canal is completed, it is proposed to put in
service the existing Medjerdah pumping station, to increase its capacity from
11.4 Mm3/year to 14.0 Mm3/year (this would be accomplished by replacing one
of the existing pumps with a bigger unit) and to connect its effluent line to
the proposed Medjerdah pumping station (paragraph 11). This additional water
will be treated at the Gdir El Goulla plant whose installed capacity can meet
the projected demand up to the year 1981.
B. New Production Facilities
Description of the Works
11.       The proposed project is designed to meet potable water supply needs
in the areas involved up to the year 1990. It includes the construction of a
pumping station to transmit raw water from the planned Medjerdah/Cap Bon canal
(which will carry the Medjerdah River waters regulated at the proposed Sidi
Salem impounding reservoir) either to a proposed reservoir (Saida) or the Gdir
El Goulla treatment plant.  After raw water is drawn from the canal it will
first pass through a grit chamber where heavy suspended matter will settle.
Then it will be pumped through a 1,250-mm pipeline to a distribution basin
located at elevation 125 and at about 1,820 m from the pumping station. From
this basin a 800/600-mm pipeline will conduct water by gravity to the Saida
reservoir, while another 1,100-mm pipeline will transmit water to the Gdir El
Goulla treatment plant. A connection on the latter will allow deviation of
the waters to the existing Gdir El Goulla reservoir.
12.       The Kasseb pipeline will be interconnected to the Saida reservoir
where fresh waters from Kasseb will be stored together with relatively saline
waters from the Medjerdah river. Both water sources will be mixed in a small
basin prior to their discharge into the Saida reservoir. The salinity of the
resulting waters will be monitored at this basin. The Saida reservoir will
play a double role. First it will permit an improvement in the quality of
the Medjerdah waters by mixing them with Kasseb's fresh waters. Waters of the
Medjerdah canal at times when their salinity is low could also be drawn and
stored in Saida. Secondly, it will provide an emergency reserve in case of
interruption of the supply pipelines or a shutdown of flow in the Medjerdah/
Cap Bon canal. A 1,600-mm pipeline will connect the Saida reservoir to the
Gdir El Goulla treatment plant whose present average capacity of 1.4 m3/sec
will be doubled. The new plant module will be of the conventional type with
flocculation, sedimentation and filtration units.



ANNEX 11
Page 5
Sizing and Operation of the Facilities
13.       As mentioned earlier, one of the functions of the Saida reservoir
would be to provide an emergency storage for the Gdir El Goulla plant. Two
periods of time should be considered: the first one preceding completion
of the Djoumine reservoir and the Ichkeul/Medjerdah canal, and the subsequent
one when all the northern reservoirs become operational. In the first period,
which in the worst assumption might go until 1990, the Saida reservoir should
be capable of providing the maximum day flow coming from the canal for about
50 days which is the assumed time needed to repair or clean the canal. To
satisfy this requirement in 1990, total useful storage in Saida should be
about 10 Mm3. Assuming a total shutdown of all inflow supply to the Gdir
El Goulla complex, the 10 Mm3-reservoir would be able to sustain the maximum
day flow for at least 24 days which seems ample for making repairs.  After
1990 both canals should not be shut down at the same time, thus eliminating
the requirement to provide a reserve for such purpose. By year 2000 a 10 Mm3-
reservoir would be able to provide about 20 average days of supply which again
appears to be adequate. Adding some allowances for the dregs of the reservoir,
a total volume of 12 Mm3 is recommended for Saida.
14.       The treatment plant should have a capacity sufficient to meet the
1990 average demand of 2.8 m3/sec. As the existing plant has an installed
capacity of about 1.4 m3/sec, the new plant's nominal capacity should be 1.4
m3/sec. This plant should be able to deliver a peak flow of 1.8 m3/sec. The
1,600-mm pipeline connecting the Saida Reservoir to the treatment plant should
be able to supply the maximum volume of water that can be treated at Gdir El
Goulla in case of interruption of the Kasseb and Medjerdah transmission pipe-
lines, i.e. a flow of 3.6 m3/sec. A 2,320-HP pumping station will be installed
at the outlet of the Saida reservoir to provide that flow.
15.       The proposed 1,250-mm pipeline between the Medjerdah pumping station
and the distribution basin would deliver the 1990 maximum day flow of 2.8 m3/sec.
The pumping station is sized to supply twice the 1985 average flow assuming
that pumping from the Medjerdah canal might be limited to 6 months a year
(prior to the completion of the Sidi Salem scheme), due to bad quality of the
waters. This pumping station will have a capacity of 1,700 HP. The sizes of
the pipelines between the distribution basin and Saida and the treatment plant
were determined by simulating the functioning of the Gdir El Goulla complex.
A new 1,250-mm pipeline will connect the new treatment plant to the junction
box (NBC-5) which supplies the primary system of Greater Tunis.
C. Expansion of the Distribution Systems
Greater Tunis
16.       The proposed expansion of the primary system is designed to meet the
expected water demands up to the year 1990. The proposed system closely follows
the existing layout (see Map 12716) and includes two main lines:



AN4NEX 11
Page 6
(i)  The northern pipeline of 1,250 mm of diameter originating
from the Gdir El Goulla junction basin (NBC=5) and ter-
minating at Dar Bou Kheris in the northern coastal suburb.
This conduit will assure the supply of the reservoirs of
Manouba, Belvedere, l'Universite, Rouad, Gamarth, Marsa
Nord, Amiltcar and Carthage; and
(ii)  The southern pipeline of 1,400 mm connecting NBC-5 to Bir
Kassa in the southern coastal suburb and supplying the
reservoirs of Sidi Abdallah, Manoubia, Ilathildeville.
From Bir Kassa the pipeline, whose diameter is reduced to
1,100 mm, would continue to Grombalia in North Nabeul from
where water would be pumped to South Nabeul. The pipeline
will supply en route the reservoirs of Hammami-Lif and
Borj Cedria.
17.       The proposed distribution system will be equipped with four new
booster pumping stations.  The first one will be located on the inlet of
the Manouba reservoir and will lîft water to elevation 109. The second sta-
tion will pump waters from the reservoir of l'Universite to elevation 146.
At Dar Bou Kheris, a third one will lift water to the reservoirs of Amilcar.
Finally a fourth station at Hammam-Lif will pump water to elevation 100.
18.       No immediate increase in service storage is envisaged.  Total stor-
age now available in Greater Tunis amounts to 160,100 m3 representing 72% of
the average day consumption in 1980 and 56% in 1985. These percentages are
considered adequate. Construction of additional storage tanks should start
only after 1981.
19.       The proposed expansion of the secondary distribution system is
designed to allow for a minimum residual pressure of 35 psig at the farthest
end of the system.  After completion, the improved system will include 17 net-
works defined as follows:
(i) the lower Tunis section which is today functioning well and
for which no major changes are proposed;
(ii)  the higher Tunis whose service storage would have to be
increased after 1981 because of possible urban expansion in
the Gdir El Goulla area;
(iii) the northern suburb which would be served by four networks
covering the areas located respectively at elevations 63,
72, 109 and 146;
(iv)  the northern coast which would be supplied by the networks
of Rouad, Gamarth, Amilcar, Sidi Bou Said, lower Carthage
and elevation 55 North; and



ANNEX 11
Page 7
(v) the southern suburb which would be served by four networks
covering the areas located respectively at elevations 50,
72, 81 and 100. A fifth one would serve the region of
Hammam-Lif along elevation 50.
Other Areas
20.       The distribution systems in other areas involved in the project
will be substantially improved. In particular the distribution networks of
the cities of Beja, Medjez-El-Bab, Pont du Fahs, and in South Nabeul will
be expanded. Both the primary systems and service storage will be provided
with the capacity sufficient to meet the 1990 demand. The secondary systems
will be expanded progressively as new urban areas are developed. All the
secondary distribution systems will be designed to provide a minimum residual
pressure of 20 psig at the farthest end of the systems. Service storage in
all the cities would amount to about 50% of the average day's consumption.
D. Estimated Costs
21.       The total cost of the project is estimated at D 43.7 million of
which D 21.2 million would be for production facilities and D 22.5 million
for distribution facilities. Total foreign exchange expenses would amount
to D 20.5 million or 47% of the total expenditures. The cost estimates are
based on quantity take-offs from advanced preliminary designs and are detailed
in Annex 13. The unit prices used are those in effect in December 1976 and
are broken down into local and foreign expenditures. To take into account
possible variations in the estimated volumes of works and in their nature,
the original quantities are increased by 15%.  Final engineering design and
construction supervision are estimated at 8% of the original costs.
22.       Table 11-2 gives the annual inflation rates together with the fac-
tors that are used to estimate probable future price increases in the con-
struction costs. In projecting these rates, it is assumed that the present
trend in price escalation would continue during project execution. The rate
of exchange of the Tunisian Dinar to the US dollar is assumed to remain un-
changed in spite of the projected disparity between the assumed domestic and
foreign rates of increase in construction prices. Such a disparity is ex-
pected to be limited to the construction industry area.

23.       A summary of the cost estimates is shown in Table 11-3.  As stated
before, the foreign exchange cost (US$21.0 million) of the production facili-
ties would be financed by the Bank, while the foreign exchange cost (US$23.4
million) of the distribution facilities in Greater Tunis would be financed
by other external lenders. The local costs (US$50.4 million) of the produc-
tion facilities and distribution networks in Greater Tunis, and the total
costs (US$8.2 million) of the distribution systems in other areas would be
financed by SONEDE and the Governnent.

E. Project Execution
24.       The project will be executed in the years 1977 through 1982.  The
final design of the production facilities will be carried out in 1977; the
design of the distribution facilities will also be revised in that year. At
the same time, tender documents will be prepared for both components. The
first contracts are expected to be awarded in early 1978, so that construction
can start by mid-1978. Construction of all the works should be completed by
1981, and start-up and final disbursements should take place during the first
semester of 1982. Industrial production would begin by July 1982.
25.       Land and rights-of-way needed for the production facilities should
be acquired in 1977; those needed for the distribution facilities can be pur-
chased in 1978 after the distribution works have been identified in more detail.
Design and bidding documents will be prepared by engineering consultants, but
construction supervision will be carried out by SONEDE's staff with the assis-
tance of consultants.
26.       It is proposed that construction of the production facilities be
carried out through 10 contracts as follows:
Contract No. 1:    for constructing the Saida dam and related
structures;
Contract No. 2:    supply of pipes of diameter larger than 800 mm;
Contract No. 3:    supply of pipes of diameter less than 800 mm;



ANNEX 11
Page 10
Contract No. 4:    civil works construction of the Medjerdah
pumping station including installation of pump
units and piping header;
Contract No. 5:    civil works construction of the Saida pumping
station including installation of pump units
and piping header;
Contract No. 6:    supply of pumps and motor drives including motor
control equipment;
Contract No. 7:    supply of valves, pipe fittings and miscellaneous
equipment;
Contract No. 8:    construction of outside pipelines, including pipe
connections to the reservoirs and NBC-5, and junc-
tion and distribution basins;
Contract No. 9:    turnkey construction of the Gdir El Goulla treat-
ment plant module; and
Contract No. 10:   supply and installation of instrumentation system.
27.       It is also suggested that Il contracts be placed for the execution
of the distribution facilities in Greater Tunis, as follows:
Contract No. 1:    supply of pipes of diameter larger than 800 mm;
Contract No. 2:    supply of pipes of diameter less than 800 mm;
Contract No. 3:    supply of valves, pipe fittings and miscellaneous
equipment;
Contract No. 4:    supply of pumps and motors including electrical
control;
Contract No. 5:    civil works construction of pumping stations
including installation of pump units and inside
piping;
Contract No. 6:    construction of the northern pipeline;
Contract No. 7:    construction of the southern pipeline;
Contract No. 8:    installation of distribution pipes;
Contract No. 9:    installation of distribution pipes;
Contract No. 10:   installation of distribution pipes; and
Contract No. 11:   supply and installation of instrumentation system.



ANNEX 11
Page 11
28.       Though construction of the Gdir El Goulla treatment plant will be
carried out through a turnkey contract, engineering consultants will first
prepare a precise layout of the plant together with specifications and basic
requirements of the selected treatment process. Bidders will be allowed to
submit alternative designs which will be evaluated by the consultants. In
the other areas of the project, contracts for supply and installation of dis-
tribution pipes will be combined to make them attractive. Contracts for civil
works construction of the reservoirs will be placed separately.
29.       Contracts for supply of pipes would amount to about US$26 million
accounting for 26% of the total costs. This supply would be the single most
important item of the project. However, there is presently only one local
concrete pipe manufacturer. It would appear desirable that SONEDE and the
Government try to stimulate interest in the establishment of more pipe manu-
factures, so that local competition and consequently lower prices can be
secured. Procurement is expected to be completed by mid-1979.
30.       Table 11-4 shows the projected annual investments for various types
of expenditures. They are expressed in current prices and already include all
contingencies. Most of the investments in production facilities would be made
in civ-il works construction, which would amount to about 61% of the total ex-
penditures. Foreign expenditures, which would represent 16% of the total
costs, would principally cover the purchase of equipment for the treatment
plant and pumping stations. Most of the pipes would be procured locally.
For the distribution works about 49% of the total expenditures would be for
the purchase of locally manufactured pipes. It is anticipated that pipes of
diameter less than 600 mm would be imported.

the production facilities and distribution facilities in Greater Tunis would
be financed 100% with the loan proceeds. In addition, 39% of the civil works
costs for the production facilities would be financed under the proposed Bank
loan. It is further suggested that the loans from other external lenders
cover 45% of the local purchases and of the civil works costs of the distri-
bution facilities in Greater Tunis. The distribution works in other areas
of the project would be financed by SONEDE and the Government.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Projections of Water Sales
1.        Forecasts of future water sales by SONEDE are discussed in Annex 3
of this report. Future number of house connections is also evaluated in this
annex. It is estimated that water sales would continue to grow at an average
annual rate of 6% and that SONEDE would have to execute about 339,000 connec-
tions between 1977 and 1984 in order to keep up the predicted growth rate of
sales.
Revenues
2.        The tariff for 1977 is assumed to be the same as for 1976 as it
would generate a rate of return of 6% on net fixed assets after deducting the
assets in rural villages and the cost of extensions for low income customers
in urban areas (Loan 989-TUN). From 1978 onwards, the average tariff is
assumed to increase gradually in compliance with the modified rate of return
covenant, which calls for at least 7.5% on average net fixed assets in opera-
tion after deducting customers' contributions and the assets in rural villages
with less than 2,000 inhabitants. The steep increase in 1983 results from the
liability of income taxes from that year on. The forecast average rates are
as follows:
Year                    1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982   1983   1984
Average Tariffs in
Millimes/m3           85       96    117    132    140    160    222    222
Income Statement
3.        The following summarizes the assumptions for items appearing in the
Income Statement Projections other than Water Sales:
(i)  Other Fees and Charges.  Included hereunder are the meter
rental and the maintenance charge levied on all connections.
The average fee of D 4.02 includes D 2.49 for meter rental,
D 1.24 for maintenance, and D 0.29 for the 6.15% service
tax. The fee is calculated on the mid year average number
of connections.
(ii)  New Connections.  Connections are the property of the cus-
tomers. They are installed by SONEDE and their cost billed
to the customers. The 1976 average cost of a connection is
based on available data for materials used and time of
manpower needed. The cost is increased annually for price
escalation of the various components.



ANNEX 21
Page 2
(iii) Water Sales Tax. All water sales are subject to a 4.3%
sales tax which is included both as a revenue and an expense.
(iv) Other Income. Includes miscellaneous income such as late
charges and interest on credits for financing private house
connections.
Operating Expenses
4.   (a)  Personnel.  Personnel expenses are projected to increase
annually by 7%. In addition, it is assumed that on average
30 more workmen would be hired every year.
(b)  Energy and Fuel.  Vehicle fuel is projected to increase in
quantity by 3% a year, and power consumption for pumping,
by 6.3% a year over 1976 levels. All unit prices are
forecast to increase annually by 5%.
(c)  Chemicals.  Based on the evolution of production, the amounts
of chemicals used are projected to increase annually at 6%,
and subject to an additional annual increase of 5% in the
unit prices.
(d)  Materials.  Quantities are based on the estimated number of
new connections and lengths of main extensions. The average
cost of materials for a house connection is calculated to
be D 43.6 and that for an extension at D 3.84 a meter. These
unit costs are projected to increase annually by 5%.
(e)  Maintenance.  Provision for routine maintenance (excluding
replacement) is estimated to average at about 0.2% of fixed
assets.
(f)  Taxes.  Calculated in detail according to nature:  Tax of 4.3%
is levied on all water sales and 6.15% on services rendered.
(g)  Water Purchased.  Bulk purchases of raw water will become
necessary from 1982 onward at prices shown below:
Year                                       1982   1983   1984
Water Purchased in 10 6m3                   4.0    8.0   12.0
Millimes/m3                                  50     55      57
(h)  General and Administrative Expenses.  Assumed to increase
annually by about 1.5% and to be subject to a price escala-
tion of varying rates up to 6.5%.



ANNEX 21
Page 3
(i) Expenses Transferred to Assets. This represents the cost
of extensions (material, labor, overhead and tax) included in
the foregoing items and constructed by SONEDE.
(j) Depreciation. Depreciation is calculated at straight-line
rates based on estimated service lives of major assets compo-
nents. An annual average rate of 2.8% is used.
(k) Income Taxes. Existing legislation provides the possibility
for SONEDE to obtain extension of the tax holiday till 1982.
From 1983 SONEDE's net income would be liable to a 46% income
tax. However, only two-thirds of the tax liability must be
paid to the Governnent when due. The remaining one-third can
be paid in equal installments over a period of 40 years. The
impact of this tax liability is reflected in the income state-
ment, cash flow statement and the balance sheet. A substantial
tariff increase is required in 1983.
Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheets
Government Contributions
5.        Government contributions include two components:  (i) the contri-
bution towards financing the remainder of the Fourth Plan including the Sfax
Project (Third Water Supply Project); and (ii) the contribution for financing
the investment program under the Fifth Plan.
Customers' Contributions
6.        Customers (homeowners, industries and tourism facilities) contribute
to SONEDE's investment program in two ways: a fixed fee of D 1.5 per meter
frontage of up to 100 m, and the payment of actual costs of all extensions
required beyond the first 100 m. While the first is projected on the average
frontage fee to be paid by each new customer, the second is arrived at by past
averages on diameter, length and labor, adjusted for inflationary increases.
Long-Term Accounts Receivable
7.        Charges for new connections, provided they are incurred for single
residences occupied by their owners, can be financed over a period of five
years with interest charged at commercial rates on the outstanding balances.
Data on record were used to determine the part of new connections that would
be eligible for this financing.
Accounts Payable
8.        Accounts payable are variously projected as shown below:



ANNEX 21
Page 4
(i) Suppliers: from 3 months' capital expenditures in 1977 down
to 1 month's from 1979 onward, one and half month's of operat-
ing expenses (except personnel, taxes and depreciation).
(ii) Retention Money: 10% of work in progress at years end.
(iii) Customers' Deposits: increasing at D 5.0 per new customer
in 1977, thereafter adjusted for rate increases.
(iv) Miscellaneous: increasing at varying rates up to 6%.
Stocks
9.        Stocks are assumed to be at 8 months' value of supplies of materials,
chemicals and fuels, and then to decrease to 5 months' by 1980 and thereafter.
Accounts Receivable
10.       Private customers' arrears are assumed to be at 1-1/2 months' of
sales increasing temporarily to 2-1/2 months' of sales by 1983, due to the
projected large tariff increase. Arrears from public authorities are assumed
to decline to 3-1/2 months' of sales by 1980, and to increase temporarily to
4-1/2 months' of sales by 1983. Other receivables are projected to be in the
same range. Bad debt provision is maintained at 10% of arrears from water
sales and 5% of other receivables.
Other Loan for Proiect
11.       This loan is assumed to be repaid over 16 years after a 4-year grace
period, and to carry an interest of 7% per annum.
Other Proposed Loans
12.       These loans cover the proceeds from bilateral lenders, onlent by the
Government to SONEDE, and are assumed to carry an interest of 6% per annum and
to be repaid over 15 years after a 5-year grace period.

NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Long-Term Cost Recovery
1.        Calculations of the long-term economic recovery of the proposed
investments are shown in Table 24-1 of this annex. Net incremental revenues
are the income earned from water sales, connection fees and customers' con-
tributions, after deducting incremental operating expenses due to the project.
Capital costs are those of the proposed works and the subsequent investments
needed to fully utilize the project facilities in the next 50 years. All
costs are taken net of tax and inflation, but include physical contingencies.
2.        The following assumptions are made in calculating the long-term
economic cost recovery of the project:
(1) the average life of the major assets (dam, structures of
the pumping stations, pipelines) is 50 years. Provision
is made for replacement of equipment such as pumps and
motor drives which are expected to last 15 years on
average;
(ii) since the demand requirements would exceed the available
supply 93.5 Mm3 by mid-1979, all sales in excess of this
volume are credited to the project;
(iii) all values in the cost and revenue streams are expressed
in terms of the 1976 price levels. The additional quanti-
ties of water sold are valued at the present average tariff
of D 0.085 increased by the 4.3% sales tax;
(iv) only the incremental operating costs are charged to the
project. When the investments aim at improving the
services of existing customers, these are not charged
to the project; and
(v) raw water purchased in excess of 12.55 Mm3 (the volume
actually available to SONEDE) from OMVVM is charged at
D 0.030/m3.

3.        The internal economic rate of return on the proposed investments
is 8.55%. The calculated return is based on the prices that customers ac-
tually pay for their supplies, which are used as a surrogate to value the
benefits that these customers receive from the piped water supply systems.
These prices, however, do not reflect intangible benefits such as improve-
ment in productivity due to better environment and public health, increased
property values, which, were it possible to quantify them in monetary terms,
would have substantially boosted the benefits and therefore the economic rate
of return.
Average Incremental Costs
4.        Table 24-2 gives the long run average incremental costs of water
supply in the project area, calculated at discount rates varying from 2% to
14%. At interest rates of 2% to 8%, the average tariff is higher than the
long-run average incremental costs by D 0.032 to D 0.004. From 9% to 14%
the average tariff is only between D 0.003 and D 0.044 below the average
incremental costs. At the discount rate of 10% which is considered the rele-
vant value of the opportunity cost of capital in Tunisia, the tariff is only
D 0.010 lower than the long-run average incremental cost. This demonstrates
that the proposed allocation of capital expenditures is justified, besides
the social necessity for the project.

5.        Under the present tariff structure, low income families receive the
minimum needed volume of water at less than the average cost, while large con-
sumers are charged more than the average cost in order to encourage rational
usage of scarce water resources. The structure takes also into account the
high cost of meeting peak demand of tourism and industrial installations
for which higher tariffs are charged. These higher charges to hotels and
industries, however, represent marginal increases to their overall costs.

Sensitivity Analysis
6.        A sensitivity analysis of the cost recovery shows that the return
on the proposed investments is significantly sensitive to the levels of water
sales. Moderate increases in capital investments would not significantly
affect the expected return. As shown in Table 24-3, for each 5% decrease in
water sales, the return would decrease by about 0.9%; for each 5% increase in
the capital costs, the return would decrease by about 0.6%. Variations in the
operating and maintenance costs are not considered, since any increase in
these costs should be offset by a proportional increase in the tariffs.

Net Income    4.55  5.55   6.35  7.15  7.85  8.55  9.25  9.85 10.35  10.95 11.55
/1   The figures give the resulting rates of return if the percentages of
change shown occur on either the stream of costs or revenues.
7.        Under the most pessimistic conditions in which the investments
would increase by 20% and water sales would fall by 20%, the return would be
about 4%, which is still acceptable considering the social character of the
project. It is more probable, however, that water sales would be greater
than projected. The water supply projections take into account the possible
effects of expected tariff increases on consumption, and are based on a
realistic number of new connections that SONEDE can execute annually.
