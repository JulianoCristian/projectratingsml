1.01        Mm agrcultura rure bas of Mauti is extremely arow, with less tha 1% of
the land aea receving  ffciet rainfl to suppot rained agricu . Lvestock Is stl the dominan
mru  activity and in 1991 accound for 85% of mru  secto  DP (abou five times dta of agcultur
and 19% of tot GDP). Crop produecon is concent     along the souther border on the right bank
of th Sgal River where ran   Is also highest. Some 77% of the land aea is dest with less th
100 mm of rainfall. About 17% hu a rainfal of over 1S0 mm and therefor may be regarded a
pota pature, althogh both agrculture and livestock are both prcarious actes becau  of very
high clim     nbility. According to MDRE fgus, a tot of about 200,000 fami ar engaged in
agrculture and livestock, inluding some 29,000 nomadic pastoralists, 85,000 famiis in rbinfed
rulue (including about 8,000 In bottom land areas), 25,000 in flood recion agri re, and about
38,000 in oasb and other ty    of agiltur   hat leaves 22,00 in Irat  agultur. lbs fig
of 200,000 fm  *fai  is an ov ao sie some of them egage in several ypes of agricult
a  are counted twice.
1.02 a    lb  most seios problem facg Mariaia i tht of recurn drought. Proonged
perods of indqua  raifl were expieed between 1968 and 1973 and between 1983 and 198S.
k b estlmated th e 150 mm isoy  has ahfted southby some 100 km to a laue well outh of
Nouakchott. In 1965 apmaey 65% of he popuation consisted of nomadic pastrists; by 1987
teb proportion was less than 20%. Th carring capacity of the land has been so seriously reduced hat
the densy of human popuation in most rurd areas has actually decrased and the size of the national
cattle poput  has delined by half. There has been a massive migration of people to the towns of
NouachotU and Nouadhibou. Ibe popuaton of Nouahbott alone I now   im       600,000, double
its size in 1980. Women now outnmber mn i nrural are  and head slighdiy udr 20% of farming
households in the flemue and 20 to 30% elsewher. Mariaa prduce SO% of its gn needs in 1960,
while in the drought years of 1983    k was able to supply only 2%, (though in a year of 'normal"
ranfal It an probably sats  one third to one half of its needs). Drought has all but wiped out the
production of dats and gum arabic, two adional cash crops. lbe. gwh  of the hunan population has
shown no sign of aban, with a curnt anmal rae of about 2.9%. On the other hand, yields of major
crops are stagnant or even deasing, as in the case of irrigated rice in the prvaey delWed atea.
1.03         lbe adverse climatic conditions, coupled with high populaon growth, have combin6d
to produce sever environmental ress leading to deforeaon, soil erosion, overgrazig of pasture nd
deteoration of urban facilities. Reduced rainfall and declining flood recessions have put pressure on the
nbbon of irigable agriculual land north of the Senegal river, resulting in social and ethnic tensions.
1.04        In response to this deteriorating situation, a major expansion of irigation was begun In
the early 1980s, with the intensification of agriculture being seen as the best, possibly the only, pracdcal
response. Irrigated agriculure has grown rapidly durng the past decade frow only about 2,00 ha in



.2-
1980 to some 24,000 ha, altugh only 15,0 ha  crrenty ;xploited. It is im datdi tte pote-al
brigable ae l 135,000 to 155,000 ha.
1.05         Mm mala ehnic grups, widh he excepfin of t  Wolo are bigly stratified. Farming
acviies and access to resoures lncluding land isa fuction ofthe indivia's,ethnic group, socia class,
age, gender and wedth. Womes padcipai        icultura prdcton and the gendc divisions of
agricultura tas  :nd acdvities hae hnged fumlly during the last two decades. Diffenc
between etnic groups ad genders have broken down becae of the drougts in the 1970s and 19s,
.   ero of the nomad, and the exodus of mea n  serch of jobs dsewhere. Excet fr
wealthy white mauts, nur wma of all ethnic groups are now very acive griculturally and responsible

1.09         Extension coverage is very limited. It is estmated that less than 10% of fiumeri and
herders have had direct access to extension advice. AgriculturaI and livestock extesion is under the
overall responsiblity of the MDRE, but in practice it has been carried out more or less indepe ly
by several diffent ornizations with diffrent approaches. In the vlley of the Senega River, where
activity is most intense, three pricipal organizions have been involved in esion work in recet
years: SONADER, using the T&V management approach to extension since 1992; MDRE through its
fbrmer Departent of Agriculture, using a mparticipatory extesio approach' s rted by UNDPIFAO;
and a smal private extension service funded by the French Cooperation (AGErA). AGETA is a very
interesting initative that seelk to develop a private extsion service for commerci prdur. For the
time being, its area of intervention is limited to the bigger commercial rice growers in one part of the
Senegal Valley and it has less than 20 extension agent. So far, it is heavily dependent on extera

1.18        hMauritania's farmers and pastoaists are struggling with a hostile environment and
canges brought about by rapid population growth. Old ways of coping are no longer appropriate and
new solutions must be fud. Land is becoming increasingly scarce and the free movement of large her
of animals Is problematic. In this situation, producers need technical advice, backed up by well-
pro#,mmned research. IDA has beem workdr&g with Mauritania on improvng agricultural policies ad
on rsuct    and decetlizing ts agricull misy trough the Agricultural Sector Adjustmant
and Ivestment Project (Cr. 2093-MAU). In addion, IDA has encouraged extension reo    trough

regional and interational research. On an anual basis, CNRA will ensure that resources are allocated
according to the national priorities thus defined. 'Me national agricultural research policy was defned
in the context of the agrclural policy letter on extensionlresearch/training (Annex 3). it includes the
Govment's commitment to create NARC and its Scientific and Tecbnical Commision, to maintain an
adequate level of fiuding of the natn  agrculural research effor over the coming yeas, as well as
measures to attract and retain quafied researchers.
2.10         To improve the quality and relevance of the rearch bing carried out, CNRA will equip
itself with a Scientific and Technical Commission (CST). The CST will be composed of higher level
national and inernational scientists, selected for their knowledge and ewxpence, and not of ex-officio
members. The secretat of the CST will be provided by DRFV. The mandate of the CST will be to:
(a) screen annmuly new research programs submitted by CNRADA, CNERV, ISS, and the University
as to scientific quality and compliance with CNRA established guidelines; (b) review and allocate the
funds required for each such program; (c) select the programs to be fimded under the Research Fund
refered to below; (d) submit these programs first to IDA and then to MDRE for approval before DRFV
executes them; and (e) serve as general scientific advisor to MDRE. During negotiations, asramce were
obtained that the CNRA and CST would be established with membership, procedures and mandates
acceptable to the Association (para, 5.01(1i)).

component ta would buUd up the cpacity of MDRlE and SONADER to provide effecv extenson
sevices and of the rseach Institions, to borrow and develop appropriate techologies.  The
organiz       of firmers ino groups and the strengthenyig of famer assodat    woud increase the
caaiy to deal with credit issues, input suppliers and buyers of farm prouce, thus reducing in the log
n their dependence on extension staff for dealing with these aspects. MDRE's abilty to plan and
coordinate agricultural extenion at the nao    level would be greatly enhanced by the project.  ils

4.03         By brng more prductv and more stanable technology to the 1.0 milo rural
population, the project sbould increase their incomes and welfare. In conast to the peo  agricultural
service projects implemented by a nmuber of diffrent agencies, most of the ra populaon woud be

4.04         The ri8s foresen which are common to simflar projects supported by IDA, include:
(i) ineffcdve manageme  of research and extension peaonnel; (ii) low adoption rates of technical
one by fiamets and/or slow build-up of applicable technology by reseach, especialy given
Its dependence on outside sources of technology and informaion; and (Iil) the possible failure of
Governmn to sustin the long-tem commtmet required to achieve durable improvements In the
efecdveness of agricultural suppo services. la addition, there is the risk of socia tension along the

1.           C)urrntC Cosa. There are about 350 staff engaged on a full-dme basis in tedhnology
generation and dissemination in the public institutions in Maurkania charged with responsibilities for
extension and research. The tota cost of this staff, at an average salary and benefit cost of US$1,100,
is US$385,OOO0year. However, the funding for transport, traiDing and othe operaing costs is inadequate
for most of these staff to function well.
2.           Incemeal Co. As described in the project cost tables, the incremental reurent cos
of extension and research will be US$3.3 million over the five years, or an annual average of US$0.67
million, including vehicle and equipment maintece and replacement. These costs suffice to render
effectve 305 field staff. Icremental cost per field staff averages US$2,200 or about twice the salary and
benefit costs. Since the non-personnel cost involved in having mobie and well-trained staff is large, these
expenditures will have to be carefully managed and monitored.
3.                  m_.= Dgmgfti. Despite data limitaons concering the national accout
of Mauriatania, as well as general problems of aggregation in a country with consierable regiona
diversity, aggregate approach yields an order of magiude for breakeven benefis that can be a useful,
albeit imprecise, indicator of project benefits. With (i a totd rural population of 1.01 million, and vi)
rural GDPIcapta of US$185, project incremental costs are about 0.36% of mural GDP. Since the project
will cover most of the nrur  population, the project inremental costs are estiae to be about 0.36%
of the GDP of the target population. To break ev'en, the project must increase this target population's
income by 0.36% per year of what would be the case without the project. Ibis increase is eminy
attainable compared to the long-term growth of rur  income. If staff salary and benefit cows are also
included, total anna cost would increase by US$385,000 to US$1.39 million/year, or 0.74 % of the
rural GDP. Income increases of this magnitude aiso seem antainable.
4.           Bralse   efts X ff Fan EEad            el. As above, any attempt to average over
diverse local circumstances conceals the heterogeneity of local conditions and thereby provide a possbly
misleading indication of median incomes. Nonetheless, an average approacb to break-ev  enterprise
benefits yields a useful order-of-magnitude indicator of project benefits.

Thus:
Rural population                         (thousand)      1,014
No. of Farm Enterprises                  (thousand)       1695'
No. of Target Farm Enterprises (MFE)     (thousand)       169 k'
Incremental Cost per TFE                 (US$/Year)       5.3

high            (US$Iyear)      345'
al Assuming 6 people per enterprise.
kl Full coverage.
c/ Simplifying assumption: higher with animal traction, lower without.
di Low is 20% increase in value added.
el High is 40% increase in value added.
5.            These breakeven benefits show that the incremental cost (US$5.3/year) is well covered
if the Target Farm Enterprises put in an additional 0.25 ha test plot each yea. Clearly, some enterprises
will rapidly expand the test plot to most or all of their area, i.e. full adoption. Equally clearly, some
enterprises will not put in any test plots, because they have no labor, no manure, no traction caqty,
no access to credit or inputs, no security of tenure, and no means for risk-sharing. The median outcome
is indeed uncertain, and subject to different factor endowmens of different enterprises, but it suffices that
0.25 ha out of the 3 ha farm (or 8%) is farmed with test plot techniques each year to cover the
incremental costs. If staff salary and benefit costs are also Included, total cost per Target Farm
Enterprise would be US$1 1/year, and It would suffice that 10% of the land is put to test plots each year
to cover the fill cost.
6.            The uncertainties underscore the need for carefl nitoing of beneits - not only the
number of test plots (and new tests), but also the rate of expansion (or true 'adoption') of the technIques
tried out on the test plots. Costs must also be carefully managed and monitored so that best practices can
be identified and transferred to other areas and agencies. It will be by working on both the benefit m
cost sides of the breakeven calculation that the net benefit will be maximized.
7.           In addition to the benefits described above, important benefits will accrue from the
livestock sector. This sector is extremely importan both economically and socially in Mauritania
Improvements in the livestock sector through improved security of animal production will thus be of
considerable benefit to the country. Specifically, such benefits would be tbrough:

(a)   improved animal health, with better distrtion of inputs and training and extension in
the use of veterinary drugs;
(b)   better extension services in the peri-urban areas focussing on improved hygiene and
nutrition of animals (cows, camels and goats); and
(c!   improved management of naural resources through the pastoral associations established
under the Livestock II project, and which will contnue to receive supporL
8.           In addition to improvements in animal health which are expected to be considerable but
too difficult to quantify, an increase in the production of milk is also expected. A conservative estimate
of the incremental increase in milk production is 500 litres per animal (cow and camel) for 2000 animals.
This results in a total incremental increase in milk production of 1,000,000 litres, with a total retail value
( 100 UMllitre) of US$ 900,000, Netting out the cost of incremental animal feeds needed to produce
this milk 0 UM for I litre milk), the net inemental increase in income is esmated at around US$
718,000.
9.           Besides this increase in Income, the higher production of milk would also improve family
nutrition, particularly the mnition of women and children from the increased production of goats milk
(which is primarily a womas's actdvity).
