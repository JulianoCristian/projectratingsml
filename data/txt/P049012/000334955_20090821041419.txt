 The Project's global objective is to support long-term protection of international waters
and the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. The objective will be
achieved by financing incremental activities aimed at improving Argentina's capacity to
protect marine biodiversity and safeguard Patagonia's marine ecosystem from coastal
contamination.

          1. PROJECT CONTEXT, GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal


The Patagonia Marine Ecosystem (PME) is a highly productive area supporting a wide
variety of marine life. The PME covers approximately 600,000 square kilometers along the
coastal waters of the four Argentine provinces of Chubut, Rio Negro, Santa Cruz, and Tierra
del Fuego. This ecosystem hosts a large number of marine species, including the endemic
Magellan penguin, the Southern Elephant Seal, and the Southern Right Whale. The region
includes at least 46 wetlands sites with conservation value, 40 of which have been included
in the project. 52% of them have been declared as protected areas, including 6 provincial
reserves, 2 Ramsar sites (Bahía Samborombón y Bahía San Sebastián) and the first and
recently created coastal/marine national park in Argentina (Monte León).

The PME is an important region for Argentina's economy. Commercial fishing, oil
exploration, tourism, and a past national policy promoting industrial development (mining
and manufacturing) have shaped the process of human settlement along the coast. At
appraisal, the impacts of these human activities on the overall health of the marine ecosystem
were not fully known as monitoring and research was not sufficient to draw firm conclusions.
However, continued growth and risks involved in oil exploration and transportation were
considered as significant threats to ecological sustainability.

Main Sector Issues. At the time of project preparation, the main sector issues affecting the
sustainability of Patagonia's marine ecosystem were: (i) oil spills from tankers and cargo
ships; (ii) land based pollution, particularly during the tourism high season when population
doubles; (iii) unsustainable exploitation of marine resources, especially fish; (iv) insufficient
knowledge about the PME; and (v) weak institutional capacity. The issues of oil spills,
insufficient knowledge about the PME and weak institutional capacity were explicitly
addressed by the project.

The issue of unsustainable use of the marine fisheries resource was not originally addressed
by the project because there was a Sustainable Fisheries Management Project under
preparation (LIL). Though technical consultations were held and the LIL was approved on
September 18, 2000, that project did not materialize mainly due to political considerations.
With respect to the issue of land based pollution, investments in wastewater treatment and
solid waste disposal were already taking place in the Patagonian provinces and therefore
were not addressed under this project.

Rationale for World Bank Involvement. The proposed project complemented and built
upon experiences and lessons learned from similar projects implemented by the World Bank,
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP). The Government of Argentina saw the World Bank as a natural partner for this
project because of its wide range of practical experience from regional, coastal, and marine
management programs. This includes projects such as the Mexico Marine Parks Programs,
the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, and other projects developed in the Baltic Sea, the
Black Sea, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden. Additionally, the Bank's reputation allowed it
to serve as an honest broker among various project stakeholders. The Bank's participation in
this project was possible because the project was consistent with the Bank's Country
                                               1
Assistance Strategy, which supported the goal of promoting sustainable management of
natural resources and protection of biodiversity.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators


The project's Global Environment Objective was to support long-term protection of
international waters and the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. The
project financed incremental activities aimed at improving Argentina's capacity to protect
marine biodiversity and safeguard Patagonia's marine ecosystem from coastal contamination.

The Project Development Objective was to strengthen Argentina's efforts to reduce pollution
of the Patagonia marine environment and improve sustainable management of marine
biodiversity by: (i) improving oil spill prevention and response capacity and preventing ship-
based pollution; (ii) improving the knowledge base about the Patagonia marine environment
and its biodiversity; and (iii) building capacity and promoting regional knowledge sharing for
sustainable management of marine resources. The project's outcome and output indicators as
defined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) are listed in Table 1 below.

1.3 Revised Global Environment Objective (GEO) and Key Indicators and
Reasons/Justification

During the Mid-Term Review (MTR) carried out in June 2005, the Bank team evaluated the
objectives of the project and revised the output indicators developed for the PAD. The
evaluation was based on the country's priorities at that time and the existing CAS, where this
project complemented the objective of rebuilding infrastructure ports and ensuring pollution
control.

As a result of the MTR, the GEO, PDO and outcome indicators were not revised. However,
the output indicators for each Component and Sub-component were modified. These
indicators were modified so that the project could be monitored and evaluated in a more
effective manner by reflecting project outputs more accurately. The monitoring framework
developed by the MTR grouped output indicators into 3 categories: (i) indicators of state (i.e.,
at the biological resource level); (ii) process or management indicators (such as new
regulations established); and (iii) indicators of stress reduction (for instance, number of fines).
A table comparing the original and final indicators is provided in Annex 2.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

In addition, a number of initiatives in other countries in Latin America and elsewhere have
benefited from this Project. For example, officers from Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, and Brazil
have been trained at the Oil Spill Response Center in Ushuaia. The Prefectura Naval
                                               3
Argentina (PNA) and its local counterparts in Uruguay on the Rio de la Plata have been
collaborating in the prevention and analysis of oil spills. As a result, PNA and Servicio de
Hidrografía Naval (SHN) have provided technical support to their Uruguayan counterparts.

1.5 Original Components

The project, as approved by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), had 3 components: (i)
Maritime Pollution Prevention; (ii) Marine Biodiversity Protection; and (iii) Capacity
Building, Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management.

Component 1: Maritime Pollution Prevention. This component aimed at mitigating some
of the threats and impacts affecting the Patagonian marine environment originating from ship
based pollution and oil spills. This component addressed the need to strengthen institutional
capacity by (i) improving preparedness and response to oil spills and preventing ship-based
pollution, and (ii) reducing navigational risks by introducing a marine electronic
infrastructure program.

With regards to oil spill response and ship-based pollution prevention, the project focused on
strengthening the PNA in the following areas: (i) improving organization and analysis of
contingency plans using modern tools for data base organization, (ii) oil spill trajectory
modeling, (iii) extensive training for effective oil spills response, and (iv) improving
enforcement of International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
(MARPOL) regulations on waste discharges. Navigational risks were reduced by enhancing
the PNA's vessel tracking system and by supporting SHN in its efforts to develop
hydrographic maps of critical zones and by improving the electronic charts system.

Component 2: Marine Biodiversity Protection. This component aimed at improving the
knowledge base about marine resources to inform decision makers concerned with marine
protection and to build management capacity at the regional level. The component addressed
the need to better understand and document the specific effects and extent of impacts of
anthropogenic activities on the marine environment by: (i) improving the knowledge base on
the Patagonia marine ecosystem and identifying ecologically sensitive areas; (ii) developing
marine protection tools based on impact evaluations; and (iii) promoting capacity building
and regional knowledge sharing on marine biodiversity protection.

Regarding improving the knowledge base of the PME, the project (i) developed targeted
programs for understanding the dynamics of ocean circulation, production and environmental
degradation of key areas of the Patagonia ecosystem; (ii) carried out a Trans-boundary
Analysis of Patagonian Ecosystems, (iii) completed a sensitivity atlas; and (iv) supported the
inter-calibration of marine laboratories.

With respect to marine protection tools, the project envisioned, first, setting priority areas for
marine biodiversity and analysis of regulatory and technical aspects for piloting marine
reserves, and second, an evaluation of the incidental catches of birds, mammals and reptiles,
and the development of an action program based on the severity of impacts. The final activity
of capacity building and knowledge sharing was implemented as a Matching Grant Program
to support local pilot projects for innovation in resource use technologies and applied
research.

                                                4
Component 3: Capacity Building, M&E, and Project Management. With respect to
Capacity Building and Dissemination, the project addressed the need to strengthen the
marine resources management capacity of the local provincial and municipal governments
and help disseminate the information on Patagonia's marine environment generated by the
Project and available from other sources. Finally, the project supported the creation of a
Project Execution Unit (PEU) within Secretaría de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable
(SAyDS) and selected UNDP as executing agency.

1.6 Revised Components

During implementation, there were no formal revisions to the three project components.
However, a new activity, fisheries (US$0.615 million), to be financed by savings from other
activities and revaluation of the SDR, was proposed during the MTR (June 2005). However,
because of administrative constraints, the fisheries activity was not implemented. Instead,
during 2007, the activities originally proposed for the fisheries component were modified and
the following activities were executed under Component 3:

           Diagnosis and evaluation of the sustainability of artisan fisheries of crabs
           (centollas) in the Beagle Channel.
           Analysis and diagnosis of effluent discharges from the fish industry in Puerto
           Deseado-Santa Cruz area.
           Strengthening of Fisheries Management through (i) support to the Fisheries and
           Oceanographic Monitoring System (SIMPO), procurement of computer
                                              5
             equipment, boats and kits to test ballast waters, and printing of informational
             flyers.
             Strengthening of the Fisheries Research System through a workshop on the use of
             predictive models for the sustainable management of fisheries.


1.7 Other Significant Changes

Extension of Grant Agreement (GA). The project closing date was extended once at the
request of the GOA. The request for extension was received by the Bank on May 29, 2006.
The extension requested was for a period of 18 months, from December 31, 2006 to June 30,
2008. This extension was requested because the project had a very slow start, resulting from
delays associated with administration, and the conversion from SDR to USD.

Regarding the slow start, the Project was approved by the Board on June 26, 2001 and was
declared effective on October 4, 2002. The launch workshop took place 6 months after the
project became effective. The reasons for this delay are described in section 2.2. By the Mid-
Term Review (MTR) carried out in June 2005, the project had disbursed only 15% of the
total grant even though the pace of disbursements had accelerated. Other reasons for delays
were related to problems with the execution of contracts and the procurement specialist in the
PIU. Finally, by December 2005, disbursements had reached 51%.

With respect to the conversion from SDR to USD, the Bank informed the GOA that it would
consider its request to extend the GA once it was converted from SDR to USD. Since it was
not clear that the GOA would accept the conversion proposed by the Bank,1 and since the
GOA would have to finance any activities extending beyond December 2006, most of the
activities in the 2006 Annual Operational Plan were not initiated. Once the GA was
converted from SDR to USD, the Bank authorized the extension of the project. The Annual
Operational Plan was updated once the project was extended.

Grace period. The 4-month grace period was also extended by two months from October to
December, 2008. As reported by the PIU, this extension was requested because there were
delays associated with management of funds which in turn caused delays to the PIU. These
delays made it impossible for the PIU to document further disbursements from the grant in
respect of eligible expenditures made before the closing date.

Institutional changes. During project preparation and the first years of execution, the
SAyDS was located at the Ministry of Health. The SAyDS was subsequently moved to the
Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros. As a result of this change, the SAyDs obtained a higher
institutional rank, which in turn had a positive impact on the project. The institutional
changes did not affect the execution of the project. The project's national director was
changed three times while the project coordinator changed twice.

  The project was originally signed for an amount equal to SDR6.5 million, equivalent to USD8.35 million at
the time of signature of the Grant Agreement. At the time the project was converted from SDR to USD, the
SDR6.5 million were valued at USD9.5 million, but the Bank proposed to use the exchange rate at the time of
signing of the GA. On October 2, 2006, the GA was amended and the total grant amount was left at USD8.35
million.

              2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES


2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Lessons from previous environmental projects in Argentina were taken into account.2
The design of the proposed project was developed in parallel with and complemented by the
UNDP/GEF Argentina Coastal Zone Management Project (Phase II). In particular, the
environmental projects in Argentina highlighted two important lessons: (i) that there is need
for local ownership and expanded use of local or regional specialists; and (ii) that project
success largely depends on implementation capacity in the executing agency (in this case,
SAyDS). The project incorporated an extensive process of consultation and use of national
experts and its matching grant program continued to support local participation during
implementation.

Regarding project risks, it was expected that the incorporation of UNDP for procurement and
financial management would improve SAyDS's capacity to implement the project.
Throughout project implementation, the PIU informed the Bank about frequent delays
associated with management system. Nonetheless, throughout the project, both the PIU and
UNDP did everything possible to solve the issues that arose.

Participatory processes were an important aspect of the project both during project design
and implementation. The thirteen meetings held by the Project's Consultative Commission
documented in proceedings confirm the permanent involvement of provinces and co-
executors in the project, its decision-making process, governance and priority setting.

2.2 Implementation


The project had a very slow start due to a late effectiveness and other issues including: (i)
long negotiation period to reach an agreement with PNA and SHN to have counterpart funds
assigned within these institutions; (ii) administrative delays related to procedures and
changes in key staff, (iii) issues associated with a lack of knowledge of the Bank's/UNDP's
procedures at the local government level, (iv) problems with identifying suitable local
providers of goods and services in the Patagonian provinces which delayed the procurement
processes. By the MTR, the project had picked up its pace of disbursements. By that time the
status of the components was reviewed and new activities relating to fisheries were proposed.
Ultimately, these proposed activities were carried out as part of Components 2 and 3, as they
were compatible with both the biodiversity, and capacity building objectives.

Most of the components in the original agreement were carried out as planned--only the
work on Incidental Catch (component 2.2.B-57/58/59) for a total of USD 15,000 was not
carried out. This component focused on three types of animal groups frequently affected by
commercial fishing: birds, mammals, and reptiles. Though researchers were selected to study
each of these groups individually, it was not possible to reach an agreement between them to


2
  The projects taken into consideration during preparation were the World Bank's Argentina Pollution
Management Project, the IDB's Argentina Port Modernization Program and two UNDP/GEF projects: Maritime
Front Project and Argentina Coastal Zone Management Project Phase II.
                                                  7
develop a plan to mitigate incidental fishing that would make the 3 individual plans
compatible. By the end of the project, common ground was reached that would have allowed
the consultants to manage the development of this component. Unfortunately, the Terms of
Reference (TORs) for the final consultancy were not developed on time and this activity was
not completed.

At the time of project preparation, the GOA decided to include UNDP as financial manager
since it was considered a neutral party to receive and deposit the GEF grant funds and the
counterpart funds into a single project account (no Special Account was necessary) for timely
payments for project purchases and consultant assignments. UNDP provided this assistance
under a standard Cost-Sharing Agreement, which included, inter-alia, that the procurement
and financial reporting activities for the GEF funded portion of the project would follow
Bank guidelines. UNDP's administrative fee was covered as part of SAyDS's counterpart
funds for the Project.

To address the delays in implementation in the initial 3 years of implementation, the project
was extended for 18 months. As mentioned in Section 1.6, this allowed the GOA to complete
the activities of the program. This was a low risk project with a strong focus on capacity
building both at the local and federal level.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The ISR record indicates that the project faced considerable challenges and difficulty in
developing meaningful and practical project outcome and output indicators. The indicators
defined at appraisal were not reflected systematically in the ISR record during the initial
years of the project. This is due in large part to project implementation delays. In addition,
the system change over to ISR's in the Bank may have played a part.

The project's output indicators agreed at appraisal were modified based on the analysis
carried out during the MTR. During the MTR, the Bank and the project counterparts agreed
on the use of a more structured approach based on a new monitoring framework. It is
important to note that while the output indicators were changed, there were no changes in the
project's development or global environment objectives as a result of the MTR. New project
output indicators were agreed and documented in the MTR report in June 2005.

The ISR record does show that new output indicators were introduced into the Bank's ISR
system in June 2005 following the MTR mission and these indicators were updated
periodically as part of Bank supervision. However, while new indicators were reflected and
tracked, in the ISR record from June 2005 onwards, these indicators were not fully consistent
with those agreed and documented during the MTR mission. There is no indication in the
ISR record as to why the indicators proposed in the MTR were not officially adopted within
the ISR system of the Bank at that time.

In addition, two consultancies were carried out during March 2007 and June 2008 to further
improve the indicators originally defined for the project. Output indicators were established
based on guidelines established by GEF and the World Bank. These indicators were revised
during the Mid Term Review for the project (according to "Guidelines developed by the GEF
Secretariat Monitoring and Evaluation Unit for use by the three GEF Implementing
Agencies: UNDP, UNEP and the World Bank") and it was considered necessary to do an
                                              8
outcome evaluation in terms of the project's advances and impacts in the region and globally.
To that end, after five years of project implementation, a consultancy was undertaken to
evaluate the Institutional Strengthening and Project Impacts with a vie to formulate a
possible proposal for a follow-on operation. The consultancy was executed on 31 December,
2006 and the final report was analyzed by Bank experts during supervision missions, as
recorded in the two Aide Memoires in 2007. Once the Technical Evaluation for Institutional
Strengthening and Project Impacts was completed, and the closing date was extended to 30
June, 2008, there was a need to update work related to indicators by the new closing date.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project triggered two safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment (OP4.01) and
Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60). For Environmental Assessment purposes the Project
was classified as "C" because it did not cause direct or induce indirect negative or adverse
impacts on the environment. The information management equipment and training activities
for oil spill management, reduction of navigational risks, and improvements to the
knowledge base on marine biodiversity did not have an adverse environmental impact. No
civil works or remediation activities were financed under the Project. This environmental
classification and approach was endorsed by the Latin America and Caribbean Environment
and Social Quality Assurance Team--LCSES QAT--(Memorandum dated February 8, 2001).

The Projects in Disputed Areas safeguard policy was also triggered because the project
originally intended to cover fisheries management issues which raised concerns about
potential project activities in the area of the Malvinas/Falklands Islands, as well as the
appropriate sustainable sharing of fishing stocks between the U.K. and Argentina. However,
as mentioned previously, a fisheries component was not included in the project but was
included in a separate Sustainable Fisheries Management Project (LIL). Technical
consultations were held with the U.K. and Argentina both of which requested certain
adjustments to the scope of that project and the LIL was approved on September 18, 2000.

Regarding fiduciary compliance, an external audit of the project and two ex post reviews of
contracts were done annually. These audits were done according to terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank. In general, the GOA/UNDP met the conditions of the loan and the
applicable regulations.

In terms of financial management, the PIU (Project Implementation Unit) had skilled and
experienced staff. Although financial management procedures were missing in the
Operational Manual; procedures existed and were satisfactory to the Bank. The information
system applied did not provide information related to sub component execution and needed
to be complemented with Excel worksheets. Financial management missions reported some
complexity. Despite, the identified weaknesses, the FM arrangements provided reasonable
assurance that the grant funds were used for the intended purpose.

In terms of procurement, the PIU demonstrated overall experience and knowledge to conduct
procurement process. However, some of the ex post reviews concluded that filing systems in
placed had some deficiencies. Files did not include all the contents to document the entire
procurement process, including copies of payments, final reports, etc. The PIU addressed
these issues during project implementation.

                                             9
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Sustainability of the activities initiated under the project is encouraging, but mixed. As
discussed in section 3.2, the Consultative Commission continues to meet semi-annually
under the guidance of SAyDS. Additionally, a Strategic Action Plan was developed in line
with GEF guidelines and there is political commitment both at the national and provincial
level to implement most of the actions identified as part of this plan.

 Regarding the PIU, there are only two individuals out of the original 12 closing the project.
The remaining group of individuals that composed the PIU was absorbed by two different
groups working on the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands and other marine topics, such as
International Whaling Commission, respectively. The SAyDS is expecting to get a budget of
approximately USD 30,000 for year 2009 to continue promoting the sustainable management
of marine resources and other activities initiated under the project (i.e., workshops).

Both PNA and SHN have obtained budget to carry out the activities that were started during
the project. This includes, at the PNA, continuing with the training courses at the Ushuaia Oil
Spill Prevention Training Center (currently offering 4 courses per year), funding to maintain
the equipment received, and the construction of a new building to house the Patagonian
training center. Similarly, the SHN has budget assigned to carry out the oceanographic
campaigns, to carry out training on Q-Map, and to set the buoys back in the ocean again (this
will happen during the February 2009 campaign). After the project closed in June 2008, there
were no more resources available to fund the residual PIU that were left to close the project.
The salaries of the remaining members were covered by UNDP.


                                3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The activities developed by the project are in line with Argentina's current national
sustainable development priorities. The areas identified during project preparation and
described in Section 1.1 are still critical to the sustainability of the Patagonian Marine
Ecosystem. For example, pollution from oil tankers and cargo ships still pose a threat to
marine and coastal life; land based pollution related to the tourism industry and other
industries, as well as the lack of adequate facilities to treat sewage and dispose solid waste
have localized impacts along the Patagonian coast; insufficient knowledge and capacity to
manage Patagonia biodiversity are challenges which still affect the ability to manage the area
sustainably.

The 2006-2008 CAS identifies the tourism industry as an important source of income for the
country, but one that is increasing its pressure on natural resources (water quality and solid
waste disposal). The Patagonian provinces have become important tourism and living
destinations for both locals and foreigners. In both cases, the pristine nature of the Patagonian
environment has been affected, and it is important that appropriate management strategies are
developed. In this sense, the project has contributed to the appropriate management of this
topic by developing and distributing a tool to measure the effectiveness of the management
of National Protected Areas and ensure proper implementation.

                                               10
The outcomes of the project contribute to help the country meets its international
commitments. From the point of view of Argentina's international commitments, the country
is a signatory of the following conventions and the project was carried out in the framework
of these conventions including: Convention on Biological Diversity, ratified by the GOA on
November 22, 1994; International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
(MARPOL); Ramsar Convention; and the ACAP Agreement

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives and Sustainability


As described before, the project's global environmental objective was to support long-term
protection of international waters and the conservation and sustainable use of marine
resources. The project's development objective was to strengthen Argentina's efforts to
reduce pollution of the Patagonia marine environment and improve sustainable management
of marine biodiversity. These objectives were achieved by financing incremental activities
aimed at improving Argentina's capacity to protect marine biodiversity and safeguard
Patagonia's marine ecosystem from coastal contamination.

The PDO addressed three specific objectives of the pollution control and marine biodiversity
management. The first objective aimed at improving oil spill prevention and response
capacity and preventing ship-waste pollution. State of the art technology (software, hardware,
buoys, multi-beam sonar, boats, emergency response equipment) was acquired for PNA,
SHN, and local governments. Training for staff was also provided. These institutions have
internalized the equipment and training they have received by assigning part of their budget
to keep the activities going. Relatively recent incidents at "Caleta Cordova" and the Rio de la
Plata are proof that the objectives of this project component were met (see accompanying
text box). Regarding ship-waste pollution, a system to collect data on waste discharges at the
port is now in place and is being continuously monitored by the PNA. Additionally, a waste
treatment plant for port use was designed under the project and still awaits government
funding for its construction.

The second objective under the PDO aimed to improve the knowledge base of Patagonia's
marine environment and its biodiversity. Under this component, an Environmental
Sensitivity Atlas 3 was developed and has been made available to the public. This Atlas
provides information on key areas via interactive maps and a wealth of information on seven
different topics.4 Additionally, oceanographic data were collected in 5 different areas using
both the coastal and the marine buoys. These data are also available from the SHN. Maps of
the access channels to two ports were developed, as well as five electronic charts (two are
IHO certified).5 These maps and charts are also available for sale at the SHN. Their use
reduces the risk of accidents. A technical center for biodiversity conservation, with a strong
focus on animal rescue, was updated in Chubut. Finally, a methodology was developed to
establish priority areas for protection.

The final objective under the PDO aimed to build capacity and promote regional knowledge
sharing about sustainable management of marine resources. There are four key activities that
were developed in this context: the Sistema de Información Costero Marino (SICOM); the
matching grants subproject; the inter-calibration of laboratories; and environmental training
for school teachers. Additionally, the project invested an important amount of time and
resources on training programs (both for government officials and the public in general) and
seminars that served as meeting points to exchange the latest knowledge on biodiversity
management.6

SICOM is a computer software platform to exchange information developed by the project
and is available to the public.7 Focal points were trained at the provincial level to upload
information on marine biodiversity. The focal points continue uploading information even
though the project has concluded, thus ensuring the sustainability of this component. The
matching grants subcomponent was developed based on the needs of the local provinces. A
total of 47 pilot projects were developed in the four Patagonian provinces (see Annex 10).
Information on these projects was also uploaded into the SICOM and is available to the
general public.

Regarding the building of analytical capacity, a total of 21 laboratories have been accredited
and meet the highest international standards to analyze chemical composition and determine
the existence of pesticides in water and soil samples, among others. Finally, the
environmental training initiative was carried out in conjunction with the Ministry of
Education. 8 More than 240 teachers were trained and given manuals on environmental
education.

Target Group       Benefits from the project
National           The National Government benefitted from the project in that (i) an inter-
government         institutional (with SHN and PNA) and inter-jurisdictional dialogue was started,
                   (ii) the GoA gained experience in the management of complex projects, (iii)
                   key topics related to the coastal-marine environment are now part of the
                   SAyDS agenda, and (iv) the country now has a Strategic Action Plan to deal
                   with the new priorities of the Patagonian Marine Ecosystem.
Governments in the The provincial governments received both equipment and training that allows
4 Patagonian       them to better manage their natural resources. The matching grants component
Provinces          was developed based on the Provincial government's needs, therefore these
                   research projects improved the local government's decision making process. As

Table 3. Summary of Direct Project Beneficiaries and Benefits
Target Group       Benefits from the project
Executing agencies Both the SHN and PNA had their capacity strengthened. These institutions
(SHN; PNA)         benefited from the project by receiving state of the art technology to reduce
                   pollution from oil spills and to improve the sustainable management of marine
                   biodiversity. These institutions also benefitted in that their ties were
                   strengthened and they now work together in order to model oil spills.

                         The SHN received software that allows them to model tidal waves used in the
                         simulation of oil spill trajectories. It also received 2 buoys that allow them to
                         collect data on water quality, and a multi-beam (sonar) used to conduct
                         oceanographic measurements.

                         The PNA had 14 of its officers trained internationally on oil spill emergency
                         response. These officers became trainers upon their return to Argentina. It also
                         received state of the art equipment that was used in the establishment of a
                         regional training center on oil spill response (in Ushuaia). It received
                         specialized software to model oil spill trajectories. A database on contingency
                         plans was also developed. The PNA also received new hardware and software
                         to track ships more accurately.
Municipalities and       The Puerto Deseado municipality benefited from a Clean Production
Non-target               Consultancy that developed a strategic plan to deal with the pollution from the
Provinces                fish factories located on the coast.

                         Buenos Aires province benefited from the project as it managed to increase the
                         coverage of the Environmental Sensitivity Atlas thanks to an agreement with
                         the Fundación Vida Silvestre Argentina/WWF.
Conservation             National and provincial institutions responsible for protected areas benefited
Agents                   from the preparation, training, and application of tools designed to measure the
                         effectiveness in the management of protected areas.
Research                 Research institutions benefitted directly from the project with the development
Iinstitutions and        of the SICOM and the Competitive Subprojects (Matching Grants) component.
NGOs                     They received partial funding for their research and were given access to a tool
                         used to disseminate information and enhance the knowledge of the PME.
Educators                School teachers benefited from the project as an agreement was reached with
                         the Ministry of Education to accredit them after taking the training courses on
                         Environmental Management.
Maritime shipping        This industry benefited from better navigational aids such as improved charts
industry                 and maps. These instruments and the new vessel tracking system help improve
                         traffic safety.


Performance monitoring indicators

As mentioned in section 2.3, project performance indicators were modified during the MTR
but the PDO, GEO remained unchanged. In order to evaluate compliance with the PDO, the
outcome indicators in Table 4 below were monitored by project counterparts throughout the
project. Though this was a very complex operation that required the interaction of many
different actors9, and one that took place in a region of the country that is relatively isolated
(i.e., with little experience working with international organizations, with restrictions in

terms of the availability of high quality local consultants, and with strong restrictions in the
number of technology suppliers).

It is important to note that while the project ended with a substantial unused balance of
approximately USD $550,000, the majority of activities originally planned were completed
by the project. Only one of the more than 80 activities10 was not completed as planned.
Annex 2 provides a list of the output indicators by project component and their status of
implementation by the end of the project. The unused balance is in part a reflection of the
already-mentioned delays. In addition, the Bank's request to the government to convert the
project from SDRs to USD caused delays in execution. The combined effect of both requests
meant that an incidental catch study was not carried out as planned; a workshop was
cancelled; and a report on impacts as well as a national strategy was not completed.

                                         being operated by the PNA. By project end, the PNA was
                                         capable of tracing contamination plumes; and the
                                         Hydrographic Service was handling information on
                                         environmental sensitivity areas for priority setting. OilMap
                                         software has been upgraded.
Improving preparedness and response      By the end of the project, 14 officials of the Prefectura
to oil spills                            Naval Argentina were trained at leading world centers.

                                         A training program, including handbooks, was developed at
                                         three different levels (operator 1, operator 2, and
                                         instructor).

                                         The equipment described in Annex 2 was purchased and is
                                         in place and installed.

                                         Training was completed for 130 people, including
                                         participants from four different South American nations.

                                         Four additional auxiliary ships were purchased, as well as
                                         10 field laboratory kits for ballast analyses.

                                         Five hundred handbooks (first ever in Spanish) were
                                         printed and delivered for additional training.

                                         Contingency Plans are now in a geo-referenced database.

                                         The regional training center on oil spill prevention
                                         established in Puerto Madryn is a leading regional
                                         institution.

                                         The PNA has internalized all the training, hardware, and
                                         software received by dedicating some of its budget to keep
                                         the training courses going, and currently has budget
                                         assigned to improve the infrastructure of the training center
                                         (a new center is expected to be built).

                                         The oil spills of Caleta Cordova and the Rio de la Plata in
                                         Uruguay, and the response by the stakeholders involved
                                         (see text box below) are a clear indication that this outcome
                                         indicator was achieved satisfactorily.

                                       ballast waters.

                                          In order to monitor pollution from ships, the project
                                          developed an electronic system (database) to collect data on
                                          waste discharges at local ports. This database is being
                                          continuously monitored and updated by the PNA. The
                                          above information is complemented by a surveillance
                                          system.

                                          By the end of the project, effectiveness of surveillance was
                                          estimated at 75%. This was achieved by implementing new
                                          software as described in Annex 2.

of global and local relevance.            current operation focused on establishing a methodology to
                                          evaluate the management not only for those areas but also
                                          for the whole system and coastal and marine protected
                                          areas in Patagonia.

                                          By the end of the project, four regional workshops had been
                                          conducted on methodologies and tools for effective
                                          management of coastal and marine protected areas.

                                          A toolkit was developed and institutionalized procedures

The project allowed the GOA to break a situation of static inertia, generating a virtuous circle
of inter-institutional actions. The project has also achieved collective awareness about the
importance of preventing marine pollution and preserving biodiversity, as well as enhancing
inter-institutional cooperation, as shown in box 1:

       Box 1. Oil Spill and Government Response at Caleta Cordova

       On December 27, 2007, an oil spill occurred at Caleta Cordova. After the oil was
       spotted reaching the coast, an "Emergency Commission" was formed. This
       Commission was chaired by the mayor (Intendente) of Comodoro Rivadavia. Its
       members included representatives of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
       Development of the province of Chubut, the Secretariat of Hidrocarbons of the
       Province of Chubut, the PNA, and private oil companies (YPF, CAPSA, Tecpetrol,
       Pan-American Energy, Termap, OXY and Sipetrol). The personnel that were trained
       at the Puerto Madryn "Patagonian Training Center" funded by the project also
       participated in the clean up.

       The SHN and PNA used the software purchased under the project to identify the point
       of origin of the oil spill in the sea. Additionally, the GIS database funded under the
       project with the oil spill action plans and location of equipment was also used to help
       with clean up and containment. Given that the oil spill affected several birds and
       mammals, a rehabilitation center including specialists and volunteers from NGOs was
       established at Caleta Cordova. The response to this accident suggests that the project
       met at least 3 of the outcome indicators described in the table above.



Additional impacts. An important impact of the project is the strengthening of local
governments, PNA and SHN. This strengthening should not be measured only based on
training and equipment provided, but also on the synergies that were developed among the
above-mentioned institutions. The synergies can be better understood using the case of
Caleta Cordova (See Box 1), where all institutions joined forces to deal with a crisis. This
level of cooperation might have been achieved without the project, but it would have taken
longer and might have occurred in a less effective manner. The project brought about a
harmonized development of all actors.

An additional impact of the project was the involvement of different NGOs and academia in
the project area of influence. Whether this involvement was achieved directly through the
competitive projects or indirectly through analysis of emergency plans prepared by PNA, a
process has started in which both public and private actors are sharing the responsibility to
care for the environment. Both sides now have a much better understanding of the needs and
objectives of the other.

A third important impact of the project is the development of institutional links, not only
between the key actors (PNA, SHN, and provincial governments), but also with the scientific
community and the information that the project has generated. There is also a great
appreciation and interest among from the scientific community regarding the possibility of
having all information in one central place that the beneficiaries can access online (i.e., the
SICOM). Availability of information improves quality and makes decision-making more
transparent.


                                                 17
Regarding the component on Protection of Biodiversity, the Sensitivity Atlas establishes an
important baseline for the different areas of investigation that have started to be developed on
the Patagonian coast and sea platform. This product was also important because it is linked to
other projects carried out by NGOs, and it allowed the local governments to establish clear
objectives regarding Natural Protected Areas and to set bases to manage these areas more
effectively. In particular, the extension of this Atlas towards the coast of Buenos Aires
province (not originally envisaged) was an unintended but very positive impact which
ensured the coverage of the entire maritime Argentina coast with this product.

Finally, more than 240 teachers were trained and given manuals on environmental education
by the dissemination of booklets, brochures and books prepared by the project.


3.3 Efficiency

The economic loss associated with a deterioration of the marine environment in Patagonia is
difficult to ascertain because of the lack of data on the highly complex processes and
linkages involved. The only exception is the direct loss caused by overfishing: at the time of
project preparation, the sustained collapse of the hake catch was valued at US$1.67 billion on
a net present value basis (1997). Excessive extraction of marine resources causes reductions
in primary and secondary productivity of the oceans, which leads to alteration in the food
chain. Pollution impacts materialize over the long term with increased mortality or morbidity
and transport of toxic compounds across species. These impacts undermine the health
conditions of marine species on which the tourism and fisheries industries depend; however,
the specific economic losses are very difficult to predict.

The results of the GEF incremental cost analyses (see Annex 3) indicate that the "baseline"
activities represent the course of action chosen by Argentina without explicit consideration of
global benefits. By complementing these baseline activities with incremental resources for
prevention of maritime pollution and enhanced capacity for protection of marine biodiversity,
additional global benefits would materialize.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was rated unsatisfactory during its first two years of execution because of delays
in its startup. These delays were caused by a series of factors discussed in section 2.2. After
the MTR, the pace of execution increased substantially and activities were carried out
satisfactorily. Given the government's commitment to turn outputs into outcomes, the
project was rated satisfactory over its final two years of implementation. Given that the
project is still relevant (see section 3.1), that it met its GEOs (see section 3.2), and that the
participating institutions have adequately internalized the equipment, training, and
processes/methods designed to prevent pollution and improve the knowledge base, it is
considered that this was a satisfactory project.




                                               18
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

One of the outputs of the project was to prepare, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Education learning material (books and CD-Roms) and provide training on environmental
education. An important outcome of this activity was that teachers received credit for taking
this training thereby allowing for improvement of their pay-grade.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

As discussed in section 3.2, both the SHN and PNA have taken full advantage of the training
and equipment received from the project. Both institutions have responded appropriately to
the Caleta Cordova and the Rio de la Plata incidents described in Box 1, suggesting that
strong cooperation ties have been built that will ensure the success of the project in the long
run. The Consultative Commissions are also a key space that was created by the project to
bring together policy makers from all sectors of society. This is one of the activities that is
actively being supported by SAyDS after the project concluded.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

A very important unintended outcome of the project was that it leveraged important
resources from an NGO (Fundación Vida Silvestre) to extend the Environmental Sensitivity
Atlas (ESA) to cover the Province of Buenos Aires. By including this province, the ESA now
covers the entire marine coast of Argentina, and not only the coast of the four Patagonian
provinces. A second unintended outcome is the certification of teachers taking the courses on
Environmental Education prepared by the project in conjunction with the Ministry of
Education. This certification has a positive impact on the teachers and raises their level of
qualification.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops


Annex 6 includes the minutes of the 12th meeting of the Consultative Commission. This
meeting took place on August 21, 2008. An additional meeting (Number 13) was carried out
in September, 2008.

               4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME (DO)


Rating: Low Risk

Three types of risk that could negatively affect the PDO were identified during project
preparation and are discussed below. These risks were mitigated, and as a result, the risk to
the DO is considered low.

Poor/Inefficient Project Administration. This risk was mitigated by selecting an institution
(UNDP) that was independent of the government to do the financial management of the
project. Though there were some issues that caused delays in the operation, these were solved
and achievement of the PDO was not compromised. Additionally, there was a clear division
of responsibilities established in the Operational Manual, all procurement decisions and
project clearances on behalf of the GOA were taken by the SAyDS, training on Bank
procurement guidelines and financial management was provided to the PEU before project
launch, and supervision missions were carried out periodically.

Inadequate Institutional Absorption of Project Outputs. During project preparation, the
team worried that projects with a high technological and informational content may be
insufficiently absorbed into the normal functioning of the institutions they are intended to
strengthen. In order to mitigate this risk, specialized training on oil spill contingency was
conducted at world-class centers in Spain and France. Additional training and equipment was
purchased to ensure that the technological improvements proposed for navigational aids for
the maritime shipping industry operating in Patagonia was also provided. The project
included a highly participatory design where beneficiaries provided input about the scope and
level of sophistication desired for each tool. Therefore, the detailed training programs and
specifications for equipment and systems supported under the project took into consideration
the beneficiaries' needs.

Counterpart Funds May not Materialize. In order to mitigate the risk of not having
counterpart funds for the project, the following measures were taken: (i) the implementation
agreements with PNA and SHN required a pari passu disbursement schedule with the
counterpart funds so that project funds were not drawn down when counterpart funds were
cut, and, (ii) an up-front deposit of each year's counterpart was required as part of the
Agreement with UNDP. Since deposits are made to a third party, subsequent budget cuts
during the year did not affect Project implementation.

                5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

During the preparation phase, Bank staff worked closely with SAyDS to ensure proper
identification, preparation and implementation of the project. The Bank's team conducted

                                             20
missions and field trips to the project area. Missions were well - staffed with specialists
covering the following disciplines: marine biodiversity and pollution, natural resources
economy, financial management, procurement and operations. Project preparation was
completed in time. During preparation, risks associated with the proposed were identified by
the Bank's team. Three types of risks required special attention during implementation: (i)
Poor/ inefficient project administration; (ii) Inadequate institutional absorption of project
outputs (training programs and specifications of equipment and systems were key to ensure
the absorption); (iii) Counterpart funds may not materialize (allocations made at the
beginning of the project were constrained due to the national economic crisis, causing delays
until the counterpart funds were made available).


(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Bank staff worked closely with SAyDS to conduct periodic supervision missions during the
project. The Bank frequently visited the different provinces where the project was being
implemented to ensure execution was advancing adequately and to conduct on the ground
checks. At the same time, the PIU supervised and assisted project participants throughout
implementation. Ten supervision missions were held during project implementation.
Extensive aide memoires were prepared after each mission and ISRs were continuously
updated to ensure the most pressing issues were under control by the task team management.

This project had five task managers, each of them with different backgrounds and
experiences which brought benefits to the project.. Even though the technical qualifications
of the Bank's task managers helped the project to substantially achieve its DO, the large
number of task managers that worked on the project affected the pace of project
implementation.

The Bank team and the counterparts did recognize the challenges and difficulties inherent in
the project's performance indicators and made strong efforts to develop a more systematic
and structured approach during the MTR. However, there was not a strong link made
between the indicators which were being monitored by project counterparts and the
indicators used within the Bank's ISR record keeping. Though largely compatible with
agreed indicators, the indicators entered into the Bank's ISR record in June 2005 were not
entirely consistent in the wording agreed in the MTR. For this reason and the rotation of task
managers cited above, Bank performance in supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

During the last two years of project implementation, the project benefited from WB staff
working in the Buenos Aires country office and specifically assigned to the grant. This was
vital to ensure the follow-up of several activities and project needs during a period when the
project implemented quickly.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The project helped Argentina improve its capacity to prevent and respond to oil spills,
including the establishment of a training center in Puerto Madryn that sets standards at the
regional level. Given the high quality of technical preparation as well as the frequency of
well staffed supervision mission along with the continuous support from a Buenos Aires
based environmental staff, overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory.


5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance (SAyDS)

Rating: Satisfactory

Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable de la Nacion was the main counterpart
during project preparation and implementation. Throughout the project life-cycle, the SAyDS
showed commitment, availability of in-kind counterpart funds, and the capacity to take
decisions quickly. In particular, it was fully demonstrated that, by means of the National
Director, SAyDS was capable of leading the federal dialogue involving four participating
provinces in the Consultative Commission. This achievement was essential to support the
project implementation on a participatory basis, addressing the needs at the provincial level.
For this reason, Government performance is rated as Satisfactory.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance (PIU, SHN and PNA)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

After a slow start in project execution, the PIU worked hard to complete the project activities
and ensure that objectives were met. This was a complex operation with many
subcomponents and many different actors (SHN, PNA, local governments). Each of these
institutions was in charge of executing a portion of the grant under PIU supervision. The PIU
did a good job at bringing them together through the Consultative Commission to establish
priorities and to supervise the adequate execution of the program. However, the project
presented several issues associated with financial management and procurement discussed
elsewhere in the ICR that caused delays to the project. For this reason, PIU performance is
rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

The PNA and SHN were very active counterparts of the project, participating in decision
meetings and ensuring that the equipment they received was appropriately internalized by the
institution. The activities under their responsibility were met, though an extension of the
project was needed for the reasons described before. For this reason, PNA and SHN
performance is rated as Satisfactory.




                                              22
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

As outlined above, Borrower performance was Satisfactory except for the administration.
Nonetheless, the project objectives were completed largely achieved and only one extension
of the project grant was needed. The example of Caleta Cordova (section 3.2) shows that the
project met its intended outcome.

                                  6. KEY LESSONS LEARNED


General Comments on Implementation

Participatory and consultation process are vital in countries with federal administrations.
The "Consultative Commission" (composed of SAyDS, PNA, SHA, Rio Negro, Chubut,
Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces) provided an institutional framework that was
both "organic and dynamic", and that helped achieve the objectives of the project. This
Commission is still active after project closing, and is expected to provide institutional
leverage that may give long term sustainability to the project. The creation of this
institutional space is important because political changes associated with periodic elections
tend to change the key actors in public institutions, particularly at the decision-making level.
The Consultative Commission is somewhat independent of these political changes. The
SAyDS has requested budget from the central government to maintain the Commission
during 2009.

Federal states involve complex relationships and governance issues in terms of sub-
national collaboration. Therefore, projects require greater supervision and coordination
for successful implementation. Federal countries such as Argentina add a dimension to
project management by including various levels of governments and institutions. If these
levels are not well coordinated, projects can quickly become uncoordinated or transparency
may be questioned if participation is not full. This process requires leadership and clearly
defined roles as well as rules that are accepted and managed by consensus among the
stakeholders. The Consultative Commission has been a good example to mitigate these risks.

Projects with external financing need to be better internalized within counterpart agencies.
The long term incorporation of the technologies and training provided by the project was
assured at the local level within the SHN and PNA. At the SAyDS level, an important lesson
for the future is that an important part of its PIU was paid by the project. This implied that
when the project closed, the project team was disbanded and only two of the members
remained at SAyDS, though it must be stressed that they are still working on topics related to
marine pollution and biodiversity. The capacity building that was done within the Secretariat
of Environment was limited. It is preferable that the government create the capacity within its
institutions by covering the costs of the PIU so that there can be continuity when the projects
conclude.

Complex projects with scientific components, covering vast geographic areas and dealing
with specific issues require detailed procurement planning in advance. The complexity
associated with procurement processes for goods and services differed significantly between
the provinces and the capital of the country. The distance between the provinces and the
capital is a significant factor that must be considered before procurement processes are
started. This project faced many problems because the more remote areas in the provinces
lack equipment providers, therefore equipment purchases had to be done in Buenos Aires.
This presented difficulties to the selection process and caused delays, many times for basic
reasons such as incomplete documentation. It is also worth noting that consultants needed
more time than originally expected to monitor and manage selection processes. This affected
the project's implementation speed. This problem was exacerbated by the lack of a consultant
database in the provinces. Identification of consultants/providers was very difficult.
                                              24
In order to avoid unnecessary delays and to promote institutional strengthening, projects
should create financial and procurement capacities in their own agencies. As reported by
the PIU, the management of financial and procurement process were not very efficient. Some
institutional changes that occurred during project implementation caused delays that were not
expected from an institution that was brought into the program to ease its execution.

Monitoring and evaluation processes cannot be a "paper" process overlooked during the
project's design stage. They should be utilized primarily as a means to provide feedback
and understanding to project participants during the entire project cycle. Monitoring and
evaluation can be used for several purposes related to project development, management, and
oversight. Defining the M&E and how data will be gathered and used is important not only at
the design stage, but also during implementation.

Specific Comments on Components

Public-Private partnerships added value to project implementation. Even though
multidisciplinary work many times implies more difficulties due to the large amount of
collaborators, the establishment of clear rules and directives allowed this component to be
completed in a satisfactory manner and within the established time limits. In the particular
case of the Atlas of Ecological Sensitivity, more than 40 actors from the public scientific
sector participated in the project. The Atlas brought about an unexpected gain, as it leveraged
funds from the non-governmental sector to cover the coastal area of Buenos Aires Province.
This addition implies that the Atlas now covers the entire coastal area of the country, instead
of only the four Patagonian provinces.

Involving sector actors without a clear diagnostic from the very beginning could be an
obstacle to project success. One of the conclusions of this exercise was that there were some
problems because some laboratories were not able to carry out the inter-calibration exercises.
This was due mainly to lack of experience of the participants. The big differences in capacity
shown by the laboratories to execute an inter-calibration was not due to professional capacity,
but mainly to lack of funding. A possible activity for a next phase would be to increase
institutional capacity, guided by additional funding for leveling, recovery of capacity and
continuous improvement of all analytical processes within laboratories.

Cooperation between agencies has been successful after establishing a common ground
during project implementation (oil spill modeling). This was one of the most important
components in terms of success, and was very much in evidence during the oil spill that
occurred at Caleta Cordova.

Management models with sub-national participation are difficult to implement in the
short-term, of strengthening is not provided from the very beginning. The lack of these
management skill and capacities in provinces may not permit rapid disbursement and
advance in project activities. However, the active participation of provinces in the project
added legitimacy, transparency, as well as quality.

Scientific technical assistance in GEF funded projects continues to be a key contribution
for environmental management in Argentina. The project provided for many research
projects (matching grants) that were developed to address real knowledge needs. Beyond the

                                              25
dissemination of these very useful projects, they represent a vital contribution to coastal and
marine management.

 7. COMMENTS ON ISSUES RAISED BY BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES/PARTNERS


(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

From José Maria Musmeci, SubSecretary of Planning and Environmental Policy

The Bank's ICR contents have been reviewed and there are no comments to provide. Annex
10 includes a copy of the Letter No. 546/08 sent to the Bank on Tuesday 9 December, 2008.

Annex 7 includes a summary of the Borrower's ICR. The following achievements are
reported: PNA as well as participating provinces institutional strengthening. This
strengthening was based on equipment purchases and training financed by the project. In
addition, information provided by the Competitive Sub-projects on Technology Innovation
was an in important input to support environmental management decisions along the
Patagonian coast in Argentina. Tools such as the Environmental Sensitivity Atlas were
extremely useful for users demanding information regarding biodiversity in the Patagonian
Marine Ecosystem. In particular, on December 27, 2007, an oil spill occurred at Caleta
Cordova. After the oil was spotted reaching the coast, an "Emergency Commission" was
formed involving all the parties participating in this GEF project. The SHN and PNA used
the software purchased under the project to identify the point of origin of the oil spill in the
sea. Additionally, the GIS database funded under the project, together with the oil spill action
plans and location of equipment, was also used to help with clean - up and containment. As
lessons learned, the Recipient's ICR stresses the good interaction between the Project,
scientific community, PNA and SHN). Regarding administrative issues, the ICR highlights
the need to improve the overall system not only at PIU level but also in provinces.. Finally,
the Recipient's ICR highlights the importance to continue with activities started by this
operation under a second - phase project.

As a result of the MTR that took place in June 2005, the output indicators were modified,
though the activities and objectives remained the same. This annex describes each of the
project's components, their objectives, the original indicators and revised indicators, and the
status of each component at project closing. At the end of the chapter, a table with the project
budget and funds disbursed is included.

Component 1. Marine Pollution Prevention. The objective of Component 1 was to prevent
marine pollution by: (i) improving the preparedness and response to oil spills and preventing
ship-waste pollution, and by (ii) reducing navigational risks by introducing a marine
electronic infrastructure program. The expected outputs from Component 1.1 were the
creation of a database containing oil spill contingency plans, training of high ranking officials
for oil spill response in international facilities, and developing oil spill modeling capabilities.
The status of each component is described below.

Component 2. Marine Biodiversity Protection. The objective of the second component
was to improve the knowledge base about marine resources to inform decision makers about
marine protection and to build management capacity at the regional level by: (i) improving
the knowledge base on the Patagonia marine ecosystem and complete identification of
ecologically sensitive areas; (ii) developing marine protection tools; and (iii) promoting
capacity building and knowledge sharing on marine biodiversity protection. With respect to
sub-component 2.1, the key outputs are the development of the Environmental Sensitivity
Atlas, the establishment of the SICOM which allows provinces and interested parties to have
access to environmental information online, and the inter-calibration of laboratories to
improve the quality of the analysis. The outputs of each of these components are summarized
below:

                      ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

This annex re- examines Incremental Cost Analysis prepared during project design. This
scenario was presented in the PAD, following the criteria to determine the value added of co-
financed GEF operations.

Incremental cost

The difference in cost between the Baseline Scenario and the proposed GEF alternative was
estimated at US$ 18.74 million. Of this amount, it was estimated that about US$ 4.33 million
would be contributions from the GOA, US$ 6.06 million would be contributions from the
beneficiaries of the matching grant programs. It was estimated that an Incremental Cost of
US$ 8.35 million would be incurred to achieve global environmental benefits through the
improved management of international waters. This amount would therefore be eligible for
GEF support

Baseline scenario during project preparation

At the project preparation stage it was assumed that the international waters of the Patagonia
marine ecosystems were subject to a number of pressures from human activities. In the
absence of GEF assistance, Argentina would continue to support the development of the
productive sectors of the economy with limited consideration for the environment.
Unsustainable practices were common in industries characterized by a "frontier mentality"
such as oil and mining.

For the purpose of this project, the baseline was originally calculated at US$ 18 million and
consisted of the following investments:

           In the field of sustainable fisheries management the Secretariat for Agriculture,
           Livestock, Fisheries and Food, SAGPyA would be implementing a Learning and
           Invocation Loan (LIL) of US$ 8.5 million, including a US$ 5 million IBRD loan
           that did not materialize.
           Regarding Land Based Sources of Marine Pollution the main public investment is
           the IDB financed Port Modernization Project. The environment component of this
           project would purchase equipment and improve management in some of the
           bigger ports in Argentina. The value of the environmental investments was
           US$ 6.6 million.
           A number of provincial programs valued at $2.9 million were under way during
           project preparation to build the knowledge base of the marine ecosystems in
           Argentina. This included the Institutional Development Fund Grant to a local
           NGO and a Bank supported program on public involvement in municipal
           environmental management. The IDB-funded Environment Institution
           Strengthening Project also provided support for information management through
           a national network of environmental information.
           Monitoring and evaluation of project management was largely a project specific
           activity, as a result there is no baseline available for this component.




                                             37
GEF Alternative

With the GEF assistance for addressing the international waters objectives, the GOA was
able to undertake an ambitious program that generated both national and global benefits. The
GEF alternative comprised the baseline scenario, described above (fisheries management,
basic oil spill equipment and limited information sharing), enhanced by expanded marine
pollution prevention capacity and establishment of a marine electronic highway structure and
the implementation of pilot activities in fisheries management and marine conservation. The
total amount for the GEF alternative is calculated at US$ 36.76 million (US$ 18 million,
baseline scenario + US$ 18.76 million, GEF project including other co-financing
contributions).

The GEF alternative catalyzed additional development resources, beyond the baseline
scenario, totaling US$ 18.76 million including the GEF contribution of US$ 8.35 million and
an additional US$ 10.40 million, primarily for various aspects of the establishment of the
marine electronic highway, improvements in maritime safety and piloting various programs
to reduce marine pollution and improve marine resource management. These resources were
only available under the GEF scenario. Due to limitations in the administration of funds by
UNDP, the GEF alternative could not finance some pilot studies of how to reduce the
biodiversity impacts from the fishing sector, and set the stage for policy changes that would
include biodiversity considerations in the fishing sector.

The GEF alternative had a significant effect on reducing maritime traffic risks and the
associated damage that can affect the marine environment. The improvements under the GEF
alternative provided practical management experiences to the key government agencies
(SAyDS, PNA and SHN) responsible for managing cutting edge technology and international
collaboration. The GEF alternative cost US$ 11.03 million.

To improve sustainable management of resources in Patagonian waters and enhance the
knowledge base there were significant global benefits including the testing of a methodology
to evaluate the effective management of coastal and marine protected areas and the
enhancement of the global knowledge base of the resources and calibration of the Argentine
institutional laboratories with the international standards, on a continuous basis. There were
also some domestic benefits from the GEF alternative including the strengthening of
Patagonia - based institutions and the human capacity to manage the marine resources. As
was demonstrated in this report, the project also fostered a better climate for collaboration
between the key actors.

Finally the monitoring and evaluation activities and project management generated some
global benefits including the lessons from project implementation, a good baseline for future
work and design experiences for future projects.

Based in the accomplishments described above, the Incremental cost Analysis prepared
during project preparation stage was sound. The impediments to implement a fisheries
component as well as the changes made in the biodiversity component did not affect the
project contributions towards the development objective as well as its contribution to the
global environmental objective.

      ANNEX 7. SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR


 El Proyecto "Prevención de la Contaminación Costera y Gestión de la Diversidad Biológica Marina"
se sustenta en una donación del GEF Bloque B Nº 28491 aprobada en diciembre de 1997 que tenía
por objeto la preparación del citado Proyecto.

La información aportada en los Talleres de preparación y recabada a través de diagnósticos
preliminares realizados por consultores nacionales e internacionales y los aportes realizados por la
Prefectura Naval Argentina, el Servicio de Hidrografía Naval y los consultores de la Unidad de
Preparación, constituyeron la base sobre la que se preparó el Manual Operativo (MOP) y su
correspondiente Plan Operativo Anual (POA).

El ámbito geográfico del Proyecto es la zona costera y la plataforma continental patagónica argentina,
abarcando la costa y aguas jurisdiccionales de las provincias de Chubut, Río Negro, Santa Cruz y
Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur y aguas bajo jurisdicción del Estado Argentino.

La donación provista por el Fondo para el Medio Ambiente Mundial (GEF), ha sido destinado a
lograr beneficios ambientales globales que ponen en marcha medidas de precaución para la
protección de las aguas internacionales, así como al apoyo prioritario para el mejoramiento de la
seguridad en la navegación en la región y un programa efectivo orientado a la prevención. Además, la
financiación del GEF es usada para catalizar inversiones iniciales del Gobierno y empresas privadas.

Los objetivos fundamentales de este Proyecto fueron: "Contribuir a la conservación de la diversidad
biológica y a la prevención y mitigación de la contaminación costera, con el fin de mejorar la
calidad de vida de los habitantes de la región".

Los desafíos principales del Proyecto eran: 1) Resolver el déficit de capacidad institucional en las
administraciones provinciales a fin de posibilitar la fijación de objetivos realistas y la determinación
de actividades que coadyuven a superar problemáticas concretas, que resulten fácticamente
evaluables y sean susceptibles de seguimiento técnico y contable. 2) Fortalecer a las instituciones
responsables del control de la contaminación, formando y capacitando personal relacionado con este
tipo de incidente y 3) Proveer del equipo y equipamiento necesario para tales tareas, ya que las
actividades antrópicas pueden originar impactos ambientales negativos tales como: la contaminación
proveniente de embarcaciones, del continente (turismo, efluentes, desechos, lixiviados, etc.) y de
actividades "off Shore", la sobrepesca y las prácticas pesqueras con métodos no selectivos, entre otras.

Se trabajó en tres componentes siendo estos 1) Prevención de la Contaminación 2) Componente de
Conservación de la Diversidad Biológica. 3) Implementación del Proyecto y Fortalecimiento
Institucional.

Las Instituciones participantes como beneficiarias fueron la Secretaría de Ambiente y Desarrollo
Sustentable (SAYDS) y las Provincias Patagónicas, mientras los Coejecutores eran el Servicio de
Hidrografía Naval (SHN) y la Prefectura Naval Argentina (PNA).

Los logros del Proyecto pueden resumirse en haber logrado el Fortalecimiento Institucional tanto de
los actores que tienen responsabilidad en la Prevención de la Contaminación Marina como es el caso
de Prefectura Naval Argentina, como de las Provincias Patagónicas beneficiarias del Proyecto. Dicho
Fortalecimiento se ha basado en equipamiento y capacitación. Asimismo entre los desafíos que han
sido cumplidos acabadamente pueden mencionarse la información generada por los Subproyectos
Competitivos de Innovación Tecnológica e investigación aplicada, a través de los cuales se ha
generado la información necesaria para que los decisores puedan respaldar sus decisiones en cuanto al
cuidado ambiental.

                                                  46
Herramientas tales como el Atlas de Sensibilidad y el SICOM, son de gran utilidad para todo usuario
interesado en la información existente en cuanto a lo relacionado con la biodiversidad, y con el
ambiente marino patagónico.

Un hecho destacable es la puesta en acción de lo realizado por el proyecto ante un evento real como
fue el siniestro de derrame de hidrocarburos ocurrido en Caleta Cordova en el año 2007. No sólo se
puso en práctica lo aprendido en los cursos de capacitación realizados por este Programa sino que se
ubicó en terreno el sistema de control de derrames y el de simulación de este que permitió tener
información anticipada de lo que eventualmente ocurriría ante el incidente petrolero.

Finalmente pueden extraerse las Lecciones Aprendidas, en las que se destacan como principales: La
buena interacción generada entre las partes tanto ambientales (SAyDS, Provincias, PNA y SHN),
como la científica y las áreas de decisión. La necesidad de mejorar el sistema administrativo tanto de
la totalidad del Proyecto como el sistema administrativo de las Provincias en cuanto al Proyecto se
refiere. La necesidad de darle continuidad en el marco de la Etapa II de este Proyecto, a las
actividades generadas.
