Some lessons learned included:\n            Federal states involve complex relationships and governance\n            issues in terms of sub-national collaboration. Therefore,\n            projects require greater supervision and coordination for\n            successful implementation. The complexity associated with\n            procurement processes for goods and services differed\n            significantly between the provinces and the capital of the\n            country. The distance between the provinces and the capital\n            is a significant factor that must be considered before\n            procurement processes are started. This project faced many\n            problems because the more remote areas in the provinces lack\n            equipment providers, therefore equipment purchases had to be\n            done in Buenos Aires. In order to avoid unnecessary delays\n            and to promote institutional strengthening, projects should\n            create financial and procurement capacities in their own\n            agencies. Monitoring and evaluation processes cannot be a\n            'paper' process overlooked during the\n            project's design stage. They should be utilized\n            primarily as a means to provide feedback and understanding\n            to project participants during the entire project cycle."}, "docdt": "2008-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
