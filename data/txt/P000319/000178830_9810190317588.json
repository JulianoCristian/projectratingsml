the construction of a new deep-water quay, approximately\n            200 meters long and 8.5 meters deep; (b) the construction of\n            a shallow-draft quay and of sloping concrete aprons; the\n            paving of 20,000 square meters of roads and timber-stacking\n            areas; and the shifting of an existing 20-ton overhead crane\n            to the edge of the new shallow-draft quay; (c) dredging of\n            approximately 100,000 cubic meters in front of the\n            log-handling area to facilitate movement of barges and\n            floating logs; (d) acquisition of a small suction-cutter\n            dredger to carry out dredging work and to maintain attained\n            depths; (e) installation of buoys to form three mooring\n            stations for timber-loading ships; (f) acquisition of mobile\n            and floating log-handling equipment; (g) a feasibility study\n            of alternative schemes for timber handling; (h) elaboration\n            of a modern, accrual-basis accounting system for the port of\n            Douala-Bonaberi, and preparation of an inventory of its assets."}, "docdt": "1970-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
