APPFCISAL OF FIRST DOUALA PORT PRCJECT
SUImea
i.        This report appraises a project for developing facilities in the
port of Douala. It is designed as an urgent interim solution to provide
additional port capacity for the rapidly growing log exports and clinker
imports, pending the findings of a French-German group of consultants.,
OCCR/SOGREAH/DSBI, who are now studying Cameroon's long-term port develop-
ment needs. The consultants' recommendations will only be available in
late 1971.
ii.       The project is kept to a minimum so as to avoid conflict with
the results of the ongoing studies. It comprises the construction of a
quay for imports of industrial raw materials at Douala-Bonaberi and the
improvement and expansion of log-handling facilities. Consulting services
for project supervision, the introduction of cost accounting and a feasi-
bility study for new solutions of the log-handling problem are included.
Total cost of the project is CFAF 778 million (US$2.8 million equivalent).
The proposed Credit of US$l.5 million, covering the foreign ehange coin-
ponent of civil engineering works, a small suction cutter dreOger and
consultants' services, would be made to the Government. Log-Iiandling equip-
ment, which is part of the project and is estimated at about us$o.6 millior,
will be financed by a new log-handling company.
iii.      The project is based on detailed designs made by the consultants
referred to in paragraph i. The Directorate of Ports and Navigable Water-
ways, Ministry of Transport and Communications, will be responsible for
the execution.  Consultants acceptable to the Association will assist the
Government in preparing tender documents, evaluating bids and supervising
the construction of the Bonaberi quay. Contracts will be awarded on the
basis of Association guidelines.
iv.       Port operation and administration is unsatisfactory in various
respects. Specific measures designed to remedy some shortcomL7gs in accor-
dance with existing legislation were agreed upon during negotiations, but
further  organizational reforms should be postponed until the conclusions
and recommendations of the ongoing study are available.
v.        An effective costing and budgetary control system will be intro-
duced and an asset inventory prepared. During negotiations the Government
agreed to accumulate adequate cash resources to meet the local currency
costs of expected future port expansion and to improve the efficiency of
operations so that operating ratios shall not exceed the rates agreed with
the Association.



- ii -
vi.       t.og-handling is being reorganized by establishing a new handlin g
company. Draft legal instruments governing the operations of the new com-
pany were reviewed during negotiations and are acceptable to the Association.
vii.      The proposed project will alleviate current difficulties in ex-
panding industrial production and log exports and will contribute signifi-
cantly to Cameroon's economic development.  Economic benefits are calculated
to yield an overall economic return of 24% on the total investment.
viii.     The project is suitable for an IDA Credit to the Government of
the Federal Republic of Cameroon of US$1.5 million equivalent. Issues on
which agreement was reached during negotiations are summarized in Chapter 7.



FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF CANEROON
APPRAISAL OF FIRST DOUALA PORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Cameroon's port capacity can no longer keep pace with the country's
economic development. Increasing congestion of the port of Douala, which
handles over 85% of Cameroon's foreign trade, threatens the growth of vital
economic activities.
1.02      Because Douala, situated some 30 km from the coast on the Wouri
River, has many natural drawbacks and can be further expanded only at
considerable expense, the Government appointed a French-German consulting
group, OCCR/SOGREAH/DSBI, to undertake an extensive study of alternative
port development programs. The consultants' investigations, called the
Cameroon Port Study, center around a comparative analysis of port development
schemes in Douala and Victoria and will be completed during the second half
of 1971. The Association advised the Government on the consultants' terms of
reference and indicated its readiness to consider participating in financing
the resulting investment program.(for details of the Cameroon Port Study,
see Annex 1).
1.03      Recent traffic growth at Douala demonstrated that before a long-
term investment program can be implemented, short-term measures are
urgently required to keep traffic moving. The Government therefore asked the
Association for immediate financial assistance for an interim project at
Douala, to consist of constructing an industrial quay at Douala-Bonaberi and
expanding the log-handling installations. The total cost of the proposed
project is US,2.5 million e4uivalent and the proposed credit of US$1.5r million
equivaLent would finance the foreign exchange component of civil engineering
works, a small suction cutter dredger and consultants' services and would be
made to the Government. The project is kept to a minimum so as to avoid
conflict with the results of the ongoing Cameroon Port Study: the industrial
quay will be required for the newly-established industrial zone at Bonaberi
even if fu.ture port developments were to take place in the Victoria region;
additional log-handling capacity will be needed in Douala even if the
consultants' studies included in the project were to demonstrate the
feasibility of installing supplementary log-loading facilities at Manoka,
some 20 km downstream from Douala.
1.04      In fiscal 1970, tlfo Dank/IDA operations for the development of
Cameroonts transport sector were approved: the First Cameroon Highway
Project (180 CM-663 CM), a combined Bank/IDA operation, to improve roads in
southern and central Cameroon, and the First Railway Project (687-CM) to
provide for the relaying of track on the Douala-Yaounde line and the
acquisition of additional rolling stock. The rapidly growing timber traffic
is an important aspect of both the First Railway Project and the proposed
First Port Project.
1.05      This project wias appraised by a mission consisting of MIessrs.
Fateen (Engineer), Grosdidier de Natons (Port Specialist), Oursin (Economist)
and Rodley (Financial Analyst) who visited Cameroon in April 1970.

2. BACKGROUtD
2.01      The Federal Republic of Cameroon (Map 1), situated slightly
north of the Equator on the west coast of Africa, has about 5.7 million
inhabitants and covers an area almost as great as that of France. A
description of its economic situation and of its transport sector was
given in Chapter 2 of Appraisal Report No. PTR-50a, which was approved by
the Board on May 26, 1970 (First Cameroon Railway Project, Loan 687-CN).
No relevant changes have occurred since then and the above-mentioned
description is therefore repeated in Annex 2 of this report. Details
concerning the forest industry and ports and internal navigation, of
special imnportance to this project, are given below.
A. The Forest Industry
2.02      Over the past 15 years, increases in log exports from Cameroon
averaged about 10% per year and reached 380,000 tons in 1969. The granting
of three nillion hectares of new logging concessions in eastern Cameroon
during the past four years and the opening of the first section of the
Trans-Cameroon Railway from Yaounde to Belabo in 1969 are expected to
raise exports between 16 and 20% annually over the next five years.  By
1975 log exports are expected to reach about 1.1 million tons, of
which approximately 80p will be shipped through the port of Douala.
2.03      According to the last Bank Economic Ilission to Cameroon, the net
standing volume of the 14 most important exploitable timbers is estimated
at about 130 million m3. This large reserve will allow Cameroon to
increase its production of logs and timber products for many years.
B. Ports and Internal Wlavigation (Map 1)
2.04      Traffic through Cameroon's ports from 1966 to 1968 was as follows:
(000 tons)
1966      1967     1968
Douala               1,173     1,385    1,536
Victoria/Tiko          134        96       105
Kribi                   59        62        77
Campo                   10        15        30
Garoua                  62        -         -
The figures for Douala include bulk oil traffic which was 231,000 tons
in 1968.



-3-
*.05      Traffic through Victoria/Tiko is gradually declining in favor
of Douala, mainly due to inadequate port facilities and the recent opening
of a highway from Douala to Tiko. The lighterage port of Victoria has an
almost constant water depth of 10 m but insufficient land for shore
facilities.  Tiko, wfhich handles mainly bananas, is situated on an estuary
15 km in the interior and, at high tide, accepts ships drawing 6.1 m; it
is served only by a narrow gauge railway line.
2.06      Kribi, and the snall private port of Campo, are lighterage ports
south of Douala used mainly for log exports. Traffic through Kribi is
expected to grow with the development of the forestry industry in southern
Cameroon and will require some improvements of lighterage and log-handling
installations.
2.07      The river port of Garoua, in northern Cameroon, is connected to
Nliger Delta ports in Nigeria by the Benue-Niger system. The Benue River is
only navigable for three months a year and prior to the Nigerian civil war
about 50-60,000 tons were handled annually at Garoua. Current traffic is
nil. IJith the expansion of the Trans-Cameroon rail and road system from
Douala to Garoua it is doubtful whether the Benue navigation will regain
its former importance.

3.  PORT FACILITIIS, ORGAFIZATION AI%D OPERATIONS
A.  Facilities (Maps 2 and 3)
3.01      Douala port is located on the Wouri River, some 30 lon upstream
from the ocean, and the port's main problem is the insufficient depth of
the long navigation channel. At the entrance to the river depths are 13
to 14 m but in places totaling about 9 km, the river is only 5 m deep.
At high tide ships of up to 6.5 m draft (3,500 dwt) can use the chamnel.
3.02      The port has a land area of about 720,000 m2 of which 130,000 m2
are allocated to the log-handling depot, 30,000 m2 are used for sorting and
stacking general cargo and 60,C00O mi for transit sheds. In Eonaberi, part
of the port land area was recently allocated fo the future indastr_al zone
leaving a shore belt 90 m wide for port facilities; this is considered
adequate.
3.03      The port has eleven deep-wTater quays at Douala totaling 1,700 m
in length and one q;uay at Boneberi on the coposite bank, which is used
mainly for banana exports and butare gas Lmports.  A1l quays have an apron
of 25 m, two railway lines and at least one row of mcdep- trrnsit sheds which
are served by fairly wida roads. The transit shcds can handle about 2 million
tons of general cargo ainually.  An instrean petroleum iaooring station is
under construction and is expected to be completed in mid-1971.
3.04      The Port Directorate owrns mobile equipment, mainly for log-handling;
floating equipment for pJlotage, towing, lifting and dredging; workshops and
repair facilities. Further details of port facilities are given in Annex 3.
3. Organization (Chart - Annex 4)
(i) Adriministration
3.05      Cameroon's Port Directorate is a Department of the Federal Ministry
of Transport and Colmmunications. The Director administers all maritime and
river ports and is responsible for constructing, maintaining and developing
maritime structures and buildings, for conservancy, marine service, naviga-
tional aids and dockyard operations.
3.06      In December 1569, Decree 69/531 placed the Directorate under the
close administrative and financial control of the Ministries of Transport and
Finance in Yaounde by withdrawing the Director's powers to make decisions on
contracting, recruitment and discipline of personnel and the granting of con-
cessions and authorizations to port operators. The Director now exercises only
delegated powers within limits set by the Ministries; he cannot adequately
coordinate the agencies providing port services (Customs, Labor Control Office)
and he lacks influence over port users. A consultative board and a standing
committee of port users exist, but they have very limited powers and responsi-
bilities and rarely meet. This situation is unsatisfactory.



- 5 -
3 .07    The establislment of an autonomous port authority in lieu of
the existing departmental structure controlled from Yaounde, would be
advisable. The consultative board recently passed a resolution in favor
of such an authority and the Association was informed during negotiations
that the Government intends to pass the necessary legislation. However,
no actiab is expected before the consultants' findings concerning future
port organization become available and during negotiations the Government
undertook to consult the Association on any substantial change in the
organization of its ports.
3.08     Nevertheless it was agreed that, without preempting the
consultants' conclusions and recommendations, limited action to improve
organizational arrangements in the port could already be taken in
accordance with Decree 69/531.  The Government, therefore, undertook
during negotiations, to delegate to the port director, not later than
April 30, 1971, the powers required for flexible and efficient manage-
ment of the ports in accordance with sound administrative, financial
and engineering practices.
3.09     The position of Port Commander, with responsibility for pilotage,
berthing, rendering bills for toll fees, fire-fighting, policing the
port, enforcing port regulations and controlling operations, is vacant.
Because the police are ineffective at port gates and on the river,
pilferage is habitual. During negotiations the Government agreed to
appoint a Port Commander as soon as possible.
3.10     The Directorate's staff and labor force at Douala number about
840., over 600 of them employed in three technical service divisions,
namely: Works and Maintenance, liorkshops, and Equipment and Navigable
Waterways (responsible for waterways conservancy). These divisions are
considered over-staffed by 15 to 20% and the consultants are studying
the problem.
(ii) Budgetary Control and Accounting System
3.11     The annual operating and capital budgets of the Port Directorate
are a separate annex of the federal budget. Net operating income does
not revert to the federal budget but to a port renewal fund for capital
repairs and development. Port accounts are kept by the Directorate on
a cash basis. The Treasury receives all monies from port users for
rates and charges, and pays all bills on behalf of the port. Mechanical
punch card equipment is used for keeping accounts, preparing payrolls,
issuing bills to users (other than wharfage bills for cargo which are
issued by the Customs Department) and preparing port statistics.



-6-
3.12      Day-to-day cortrol of port finances is exercised by a finiancial
cnmptroller on behalf of the Minister of Finance. No asset inventory is
maintained and depreciation is not accounted for. Expenditure is inade-
quately detailed in the annual report which compares actual with budgeted
results. No costing system exists to provide an effective monetary control
of port performance and a sound basis for revising rates and charges. A
yearly audit is performed by the Treasury but this is not sufficiently
effective, as not enough attention is given to variances between budgeted
and actual results.
3.13      In view of the ongoing OCCR/SOGREAH/DSBI study and the Government s
intention to take action towards granting autonomy after the study is com-
pleted, it is premature to impose far-reaching reforms now. Ideally, the
port should operate on an accrual accounting basis, record all its assets
and liabilities to permit preparation of a balance sheet and have an effectiva
cosbing and budgetary control system designed on commercial lines, all subjeot
to independent audit.  These objectives should be achieved when the port is
made autonomous.
3.14      Action now agreed with the Government is confined to improvements
which can function in parallel with the present accounting and budgetary
system without undue work duplication.  A costing and internal budgetary
system will be installed to provide a basis for revising rates and charges
and a monetary measure of operating performances. Most data would be common
to both systems and could be integrated for processing by the Government's
computer, due to be installed in Douala in 1971. To achieve these improve-
ments it was agreed during negotiations that the Government engage a cost-
ing advisor not later than May 1, 1971, for a period of not less than 18
months under terms of reference and contract satisfactory to the Association.
Draft tenns of reference are given in Annex 5. In addition, it was agreed
that an asset inventory will be prepared by the Port Directorate and that tae
assets will be realistically valued, residual life estimated and annual depre-
ciation calculated. Completion of the inventory is expected by September 30,
1971.
(iii)   The Log Depot
3.15      Until now the port's log depot has been operated by a private comn-
pany, the Societe de Gerance et d'Exploitation du Parc a Bois (SOGEX) under
a Government contract. According to the contract, the Port Directorate pro-
vides all investment in fixed and mobile assets and undertakes maintenance.
The division of responsibility between SCGEX, in charge of operations, and
the Port Directorate in charge of purchasing and maintaining equipment, is
unsatisfactory because it does not provide SOGEX with controlling influence
over the acquisition of equipment which it must ultimately use.



3.16      Until recently., unloading and sorting operations were handled
using slow-moving traveliig cranes which led to immobilization of vehicles
and slow turnaround of railway wagons.  The introduction of log stackers in
April 1970 improved operations. Logs are delivered alongside ships by
straddle trucks and trailers; deliveries are slow and ship turnaround time
consequently affected. In 1969/70 the depot was closed twice for about 15
days because of congestion. Overside loading from barges was recently
introduced on a small scale and is expected to improve handling speed.
3.17      Present difficulties in the log depot system atem mainly from
the confusion of responsibilities between SGGEX and the Port Directorate.
It was therefore agreed during negotiations that a new log-handling company
will be established not later than April 30, 1971. The company will have
the full and exclusive responsibility for operating the log depot on a
sound commercial basis and will own and maintain all mobile equipment.
Draft articles of association of the new company and a draft concession
agreement, governing the operations of the company in the port of Douala,
were reviewed during negotiations and are acceptable to the Association.
The Government, represented by the Port Directorate, will exercise control
over the performance of the company in its capacity as grantor of the con-
cession but will not interfere with day-to-day operations.
3.18      During negotiations the Association was informed that the Govern-
ment decided to contribute 35% of the share capital of the new company and
that a number of established stevedoring companies have agreed to contribute
the balance. The company will finance and procure the mobile and floating
log-handling equipment which is included in this project (para. 4.02).
(iv) Bonaberi Industrial Zone
3.19      In view of the fact that the future industrial zone of Bonaberi
will be adjacent to the port limits, it was agreed with the Government
during negotiations that the Port Directorate will have adequate represen-
tation on the Board of Directors of the proposed corporation operating the
industrial zone. It was also agreed that the Port Directorate will be con-
sulted before land is allocated for industrial purposes.
C. Operations
(i) Cargo-Handling
3.20      Cargo-handling on ships and/or shore is undertaken by shipping
agents and stevedoring companies using their own mobile equipment. Ships
are loaded and unloaded using ships' gear. Transit sheds are owned by the
Port Directorate and are leased to the stevedoring companies. Consignees
collect incoming cargo from the transit sheds and open storage areas, using
their own labor.



-8-
3;2I      Stevedoring of general cargo is satisfactory.  Work is on a two-
shift, seven-day-a-week basis. In some cases, ships work three shifts, but
regular work on this basis is impeded by the inadequacy of port security and
the reluctance of labor and same shipping lines to work at night.  Shore-
handling is hindered by log-loading alongside which causes congestion on
the quays. In addition, efficient movement of goods is obstructed becauLe
ships are sometimes not berthed facing their agents' sheds. Goods are then
transported across the wharf to the proper shed or ships may be moved after
cargo-handling has started.
3.22      Sheds and stacking yards are congested, principally because transit
areas are used as warehouses. The Port Directorate has not established con-
ditions for use of its sheds and stacking yards but leaves control of opera-
tions to lessees and Customs. Penalties for excessive storage are too low
to discourage offenders. This situation is unsatisfactory and it was, there-
fore, agreed during negotiations that the Government will institute, not
later than on June 30, 1971 and after consultation with the Association,
adequate rules covering the use of storage facilities in the port of Douala-
Bonaberi and fixing storage time limits, and penalities for extended storage
periods.
(ii) Dredging
3.23      The port owns a cutte  suction hopper dredger ("Garoua") capable
of dredging up to 2.0 million m  annually, operated under a Government
contract by a private commercial company with no dredging experience. Ac-
cording to the contract the Port Directorate meets all running expenses,
including fuel, labor, maintenance, spare parts and the company's administra-
cGive overhead expenses. The contract does not guarantee a minimum output for
the dredger and output has always been very low compared to capacity.
3.24      The company can, at its'choice and for its own account, use the
dredger in any African country for a maximum period of three months annually,
in which case it pays the Government an agreed fee per day. In 1969 the
dredger worked in Gabon for over three months and was under repair from
October 1969 until April 1970. Using the dredger outside Cameroon is unwise
since every effort should be directed to dredging Douala channel. The Gove±n-
ment realizes the negative consequences of the present situation and under-
took during negotiations to have the dredger operated with the efficiency re-
quired to ensure adequate dredging of the port and its approaches.

4. THE PROJECT
A. Description (Maps 2 and 3)
4.oa     The project, designed to increase Douala's handling capacity
of industrial raw materials and logs, consists of:
At Bonaberi:
(i) construction of a new deep-water quay, for handling
industrial materials, 200 m long and 8.5 m deep;
(ii)  provision of engineering consulting services for
supervision of the above work;
At Douala:
(iii) in the log-handling area, construction of a shallow-draft
quay for loading logs in barges, 30 m long and 2 m deep,
60 m of sloping concrete aprons foK launching floatable
logs, the paving of about 20,000 m' of roads and timber-
stacking areas and shifting an existing overhead crane of
20-ton capacity to the edge of the proposed shallow-draft
quay to be used in loading logs on barges;
(iv)  dredging about 100,000 m3 in front of the log-handling
area to facilitate movement of barges and floating logs;
(v) installation of buoys for three mooring stations for
timber-loading ships;
(vi)  acquisition of a small suction cutter dredger to carry out
dredging work required in the project and to maintain
attained depths;
(vii)  provision of consulting services for preparation of tender
documents for the dredger;
(viii) a feasibility study for a long-term timber-handling scheme
comparing Douala with a proposed alternative site at
Manoka;
(ix)  provision of a costing advisor; and
(x) mobile and floating log-handling equipment.



- 10 -
4.02     The cost of the mobile and floating log-handling equipment
(x) is estimated at CFAF 166 million (US$600,000 equivalent).  It will
be financed and procured by the new log-handling company. The Govern-
ment has undertaken to finance the equipment as an integral part of
the project should the company be unable to do so.
B. Subsoil Conditions
4.03     Borings made on the site of the new industrial quay indicate
layers of sand and gravel mixed with different types of clay. The quay
will be of anchored steel sheet piles. No hard strata are located
above the dredged depth.
C. Engineering Consultant Services
4.04     Consultants acceptable to the Association will be employed to
assist with preparation of tender documents for the dredger, supervision
of the industrial quay and to carry out the Douala/Manoka feasibility
study (Annex 6). The Government intends to retain OCCR/SOMREAH/DSBI
for the Douala/Manoka study, which would be acceptable to the
Association.
4-o5     Final drawings, tender documents and supervision of civil
engineering work for the log-handling facilities will be undertaken by
the Port Directorate who are competent to do this work.
D. Cost Estimates
4.o6     The total estimated cost of the project, including log-handling
equipment, is CFAF 778 million (US$2.8 million equivalent). Cost
estimates are based on the consultants' reports and are reasonable.
They take into account the known cost of labor, materials and equip-
ment to be imported; 20% is included for contingencies, excluding
consulting and advisory services (10% for quantities and 10% for prices).
Price contingencies are based on rates of price increases on local and
imported goods in recent years. A summary of the estimate follows
and Table 1 gives details.

An IDA credit of US$1.5 million is proposed to finance the estimated
foreign exchange component  of all items, excluding the log-handling
equipment (para. 4.02). The Government will provide the local currency
component estimated at CFAF 194.4 million from the port renewal fund.
Retroactive financing will not be required.
E. Construction and Procurement
4.07     The Port Directorate will be responsible for execution of the
work. Construction contracts will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. However, the work
for the log-handling facilities consists of a number of small items (see
Table 1, B) which cannot be grouped to attract international competition
and local advertising would therefore, be acceptable.



- 12 -
4.08      Disbursement from the Credit Account would cover the estimated
foreign exchange component of 65% for all civil engineering works, the
c.i.f. cost of imported equipment (excluding log-handling equipment) and
the actual foreign exchange cost of advisory and consulting services.
4.09      Construction is expected to start in mid-1971 and the project
should be completed by the end of 1972. Disbursement, excluding log-
handling equipment, is expected to be approximately as follows and a
further breakdown is given in Annex 7:
Foreign Exchange
CFAF Million
1971                   250                    900
1972                   167                    600
417                 1,500
Since it is normal practice for contractors to submit letters of guarantee
in lieu of retention money, the phasing of expenditure does not allow for
disbursement of any sums for this purpose after completion of work.
4.10      In addition to expenditure on the project and independent of the
consultants' recommendations on long-term development, the port is expected
to incur CFAF 1,795 million on other capital works during the six-year
period fiscal 1970-1975. About 55% is for new facilities such as a petro-
leum mooring station and 45% for rehabilitation and replacements, all of
'Which is considered justified. These expenditures will be met from the
port renewal fund (para. 3.11).
F. Future Port Development
4.11      The consultants are expected to complete their study of a long-
term port development program (Douala/Victoria) in mid-1971. Discussions
with them suggest that a complete shift of Cameroon's principal port from
Douala to deeper water at Victoria is not expected. The Victoria region's
capacity to accommodate a big general cargo port is limited on the landward
side, transport facilities are lacking and the costs involved would be very
high. The establishment of a new deep-water port there will probably depend
largely on the development of a bulk commodity trade, such as >azxite and/or
petroleum. After receiving the consultants' recommendations tlhe Government
is expected to start a new development program to accommodate the forecast
traffic. The program is expected to comprise mainly improvement of depths
in the Douala channel, additional berths for general cargo at Douala and
a long-term solution for log-loading.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic
5.01      Douala's traffic has grown steadily, from an average of 830,000
tons during the years 1957-1959 to an average of 1,525,000 tons during 1967-
1969 (Table 2). The annual increase during this decade averaged 6% and was
as high as 12% during the last three years. The composition of imports and
exports reflects the country's stage of industrial development: imports of
consumer goods, petroleum products and construction materials account for
about three-quarters of total imports; exports consist mainly of agricultural
products such as logs, coffee, bananas and cotton.  Exports of logs are the
largest single item and reached 300,000 tons in 1969 (para. 5.09).
5.02      In 1969, about 760 tons of cargo, excluding petroleum products,
were handled per meter of quay. Compared with other ports on the African
coast (Table 2), and taking into account the heavy rains in Douala for
about six months of the year, this figure is satisfactory. Berth occupancy
ratio reached 85% in 1968 and over 90% in 1969 and ship waiting time is
building up sharply.
5.03      OCCR/SOGREAH/DSBI have made a detailed analysis and forecast of
Douala's traffic, broken down into major groups of import and export com-
modities (Table 3).  Beyond 1975, two sets of forecasts, "high" and "low"
were presented. After discussions in the field and consideration of actual
development since the consultants' forecasts were finalized, the lower
traffic forecasts appear more realistic and have been adopted for this
appraisal. According to these assumptions, total import and export traffic
will grow approximately 11% per year until 1975 and 6% thereafter, mainly
as a result of the reduced increase in timber exports. In absolute figures,
this means a total traffic volume of 3.1 million tons in 1975 and of 4
million tons in 1980. Most spectacular of all will be the growth in log
exports: they are expected to reach 0.9 million tons in 1974. Obviously,
this increase in traffic can only materialize if additional port capacity
is provided.
B. The Industrial Quay
Use of Facilities
5.04      Two industrial plants are already established in the Bonaberi
industrial zone: a veneer factory which started production in April 1970,
and a cement factory scheduled to come into operation by the end of 1970,
using imported clinker. Land is being reserved for construction of a
fertilizer factory expected to start production in 1974. However, because
the veneer plant has independent access to the waterfront and the produc-
tion plan of the fertilizer plant is not yet known, the following economic
evaluation of the industrial quay is based on the requirements of the cement
factory only. No allowance is being made for using the industrial quay for
general cargo traffic. Although increasirg congestion on the left bank
berths might lead to some transfer of traffic to Bonaberi, this is not
expected to become a regular operation in the absence of handling and stor-
age facilities there.



- 14 -
5co5      The cement factory will produce about 130,000 tons of finished
product in 1971 and production is expected to reach over 200,000 tons by
1977. The layout of the factory, situated about 100 m from the proposed
quay, provides for the mechanical transfer of clinker on conveyor belts
directly from the ship to the silos. This equipment cannot be used directly
from ships berthed at the adjacent banana quay.
Economic Benefits
5.o6      In principle, analysis of the investment should combine construction
of the cement factory and the quay. However, construction of the factory and
the related handling system is virtually complete.  Under these circumstances,
the following cost-benefit analysis is based on a comparison of handling costs
at the new quay with those at the banana quay as the least expensive alter-
native.
5.07      This comparison reveals three principal savings from discharging
clinker at the proposed industrial quay rather than at the banana quay:
(a)  Shi -service time:  Unloading productivity will increase
from 60 tons hour to at least 150 tons/hour and ship-
service time wll be reduced by about four to five ship-
days per 10,000 tons of clinker. The cost of a ship-day
of this type of bulk carrier is estimated at US$1,000/day.
(b)  Handling:  The stevedoring rate for clinker using ship's
gear is CFAF 350/ton. Savings from using the mechanical
equipment are estimated at CFAF 150/ton.
(c)  Losses of clinker:  Unloadirg clinker at the banana quay
with shipts gear and trucking it to the beginning of the
conveyor belt system is estimated to result in clinker
loss of 3%. Clinker is presently rated at about CFAF
4,000/ton, cif Douala.
5.08      Calculated over an estimated economic life of at least 20 years for
the new quay, these savings are estimated to yield an economic rate of return
of 18%. The assumption underlying the above analysis is that the banana quay
could handle all banana and clinker traffic without additional ship-waiting
time. This is optimistic and leads to an underestimation of the economic
benefits of the proposed quay; future use of the new quay by other industrial
companies will also add to the economic benefits.
C. Log-Handling Facilities
5.09      Cameroon's logging industry is presently on the verge of a con-
siderable boom. Log exports through Douala increased from about 200,000 tons
in 1966 to some 300,000 tons in 1969 and are expected to reach 900,000 tons
in 1974. According to the findings of the Bank Economic Mission in early
1970, this volume could be produced and sold without great difficulty. The
critical question is whether rail and port capacity are sufficient to handle
the increase.



- 15 -
5.10     iNost of the logs will continue to be transported to Douala by rail.
With the help of the First Cameroon Railway Project, the capacity of the
Cameroon Railways is expected to meet requirements until 1975/76. Engineering
and economic studies are under way to determine the feasibility of partially
realigning the Douala-Yaounde line to adapt its capacity to the Yaounde-
Ngaoundere extension.
5.11      The ongoing Cameroon Port Study, supplemented by the feasibility
study of the Manoka timber-handling scheme (Annex 6) will determine
the most economical solution for loading logs on ocean-going vessels. The
investments included in this project will increase log-handling capacity
and efficiency in the port of Douala and will bridge the gap until a new
scheme can be implemented at Douala or Manoka.
5.12      It is assumed that some 85% of total log exports through Douala will
be handled by the port's installations and that, after a transition period,
about 60% of this volume will be floatable timber. Based on comparable
conditicns in Abidjan, the proposed 4nvestment is expected to result in the
following development of handling costs:
(a)  Loading of non-floatable logs from barges rather than
from the quay: no reduction in handling costs.
(b) Loading of floatable logs directly from the water rather
than from the quay: reduction of at least 300 CFAF/ton
in handling costs.
Calculated over an average eight-year economic life of the new assets for
an annual handling capacity of up to 800,000 tons, the cost reductions will
yield an economic rate of return of about 35% on the total investment.
5.13      This economic rate of return does not cover all economic benefits
of the proposed project.  Loading logs from the water rather than from the
quays will facilitate the flow of general cargo between ships and sheds and
thus increase port productivity. Withdrawing 350,000 tons of logs or more
from the general cargo berths will also enable the port to handle traffic
increases until the long-term development program can be implemented in
about 1974/75.
D. Conclusion
5.14      Both components of the project are well justified and are of
first priority for the development of the port of Douala. The overall eco-
nomic rate of return on the whole project is estimated at 24%.

6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Present Financial Situation
6.01      Using the bases and assumptions listed in Annex 8 and a fixed
asset inventory prepared by the Association (Table 4), the earnings and
financial situation of Douala port in fiscal 1969 and the preceding three
years are summarized below. As the major assets, apart from land, were
procured during the last seven years and original costs are known in most
cases, the inventory is considered sufficiently reliable for broad financial
evaluation purposes. Detailed income and expenses and pro forma balance
sheets are shown in Tables 5 and 6 respectively.

6.02      Between fiscal 1965 and 1968 Douala barely broke even.  The
return on net fixed assets in use was less than 1% and the operating
ratio exceeded 90%. A principal cause of these poor results wias over-
staffing (para. 3.10).  However in the same period, cash resources, which
are held by the Government in the port renewal fund, increased from CFAF
166 million to CFAF 516 million. The fund represents the cash resources
of Douala and the three minor ports of Kribi, Victoria/Tiko and Garoua.
Withdrawals by any port are not limited to individual contributions to
the fund. Consequently, to finance capital investments during this
period, the minor ports withdrew CFAF 117 million more than their joint
contributions of cash resources, mainly to purchase port installations
at Victoria from the Cameroon Development Corporation (see para. 6.15).
Despite this, the fund rose because Douala's capital expenditure was much
lower than its cash generation.
6.03      In 1969, increased activity at Douala substantially improved
results to yield a net income of CFAF 226 million, reduce the operating
ratio to 76%, raise the return on net fixed assets to 51fl, and the port
renewal fund by CFAF 198 million to CFAF 714 million. The year there-
fore closed with Douala in a sound financial position although the rate
of return is lower and the operating ratio higher than can be expected
from tariff levels in operation.
B. Rates and Charges
6.04      Douala's rates (Annex 9), which do not include cargo-handling
since this function is performed by private companies, have remained
largely unaltered since 1963. Compared with other similar West African
ports, overall rates are high.
6.05      Rates can be altered by Presidential Decree.  Present wharf
landing rates for import cargo are levied according to a commodity code
which classifies over 1,500 items into nine rate categories.  There
appears to be no justification for such a complex rate structure (with,
for example, biscuits, dynamos, electrodes and tricycles in one category
while bicycles, eggs, tinned milk and locomotives fall in another and
cheaper category). A simple, more easily applied structure should be
devised. The basis of charging for work performed in the port's work-
shops was last related to costs over 10 years ago; subsequently, rule



- 18 -
of thumb methods have been used to ta2ke account of cost increases. The
cost advisor to be appointed 'i-ll assist in introducing a costing system
which will enable future rates and charges to be reasonably based upon
costs.
C. Future Earnings
6.o6      Based upon traffic projections and on the current rates and
charges (Annex 9), the estimated results during the next six fiscal years
1970-1975 are summarized below, with 1969 figures shown for comparison.
Detailed forecasts are in Table 5. Bases and assumptions used are in
Annex 8.

6.07      Despite a steady rise in income during the period, the operating
ratio is expected to deteriorate slightly. Labor costs are again the main
problem. Besides general pay increases and annual increnents, the Directorate
is overstc.ffed  and   staff costs (exclusive of private stevedoring and
'wharf labor ) are more than 50% of total expenditure (excluding depre-
ciation) which is excessive. Unless remedial action is taken the operating
ratio will remain higher than 80% until 1974.  Howxever, it is hoped that
the consultants' study due at the end of 1971 will provide a solution for
better use of fewer employees.



- 19 -
6.08      A further problem is the cost of maintaining the Maritime Service
Division which performs port clearance duties, registration of local ships
and seamen, annual and safety inspection of ships and the training and exa-
mination of seafarers, which far exceeds the income derived from related
charges. Costs almost trebled between 1966 and 1970. By 1975 direct costs
are expected to total CFAF 51 million and yield income of only CFAF 8.4
million. Such services are rarely self-supporting and in most countries
the net cost is met out of the state's fiscal budget. Should these services
continue to be performed by the port authority when given autonomy, they
should be suitably reimbursed annually by the Government.
6.og      To ensure a reasonable rate of return without increasing tariffs
which are already high, costs must be controlled and overstaffing avoided.
To this end the Government undertook to improve efficiency so that operating
ratios shall not exceed 80%, 78%, 76%, and 74% in the years beginning July 1,
1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974 respectively, such ratios to be suitably adjusted
in agreement with the Association upon completion of the costing advisor's
assignment.   The Association will be consulted prior to any modification
of port charges.
6.10      The financial rate of return on net fixed assets in use (as valued
by the Association) falls to 3.7% in 1970/71 but recovers to 6.2% in 1975
when a high utilization level of the new facilities provided by the project
will be attained.  This should increase to 7.0% if the operating ratio is
improved as recommended. Until the asset inventory is completed it is in-
appropriate to negotiate a rate of return on net fixed assets in use.  This
would, however, be required if a further loan is negotiated to finance more
extensive port development.
6.11      Debt service coverage is not expected to fall below 6.7x and is
adequate.
D. Future Financial Situation
6.12      Considerable cash resources will be required around 1974/75 to
meet capital expenditure arising from the implementation of long-term
development plans now in preparation.
6.13      Pro forma balance sheets and projected cash flow for the period
fiscal 1970-1975 are given in Tables 6 and 7 respectively and show a generally
satisfactory position. They are summarized below:

6.14      The port reneDral ffund is expected to rise to CFAF 1,lb8 miJlion
by 1974 and CFLF 1,399 million by 1975. The fund's growth depends upon
two factors, besides Douala's level of net income. Firstly, there are
withdrawals by the Government. At the end of 1969, CFAF 345 million con-
sidered no longer required for capital investment in the ports was with-
drawn. Because of Douala's needs, no further withdrawal will be possible
before 1975. Secondly, the minor ports of Kribi, Victoria/Tiko and Garoua
draw from the fund: it is assumed that net drawings between 1970 and 1975
will not exceed CFAF 25 million. To establish this figure it has been
necessary to calculate the financial effect of operations in the minor
ports. Table 8 shows actual and forecast operating income and expenses
in fiscal 1965 to 1975. Table 9 gives the contributions to and withdrawals
from the port renewal fund during the same period, while Table 10 gives
actual and forecast traffic through Kribi and Victoria/Tiko on which the
financial projections are based. Garoua is now inactive and its future
uncartain.
6.15      The capital expenditure of the minor ports during fiscal 1965-
1969 exceeded their total net income by CFAF 218 rmillion.  However, this
pattern is not expected to continue because the heavy expenditure for
Victoria/Tiko resulted primarily from the purchase of port installations
from the Cameroon Development Corporation. Victoria/Tiko traffic is de-
creasing and substantial investment there will not be required unless
Victoria is selected for new deep-water port development (para. 6.11).
Apart from works recommended by the consultants to improve access to the
lighterage basin, further large capital expenditure in Kribi will only
be required if timber traffic increases substantially. No capital expendi-
ture is forecast for Garoua. The Government agreed during negotiations
to take all measures possible to ensure equilibrium in the account's related
to the operation of the ports of Garoua, Kribi and Victoria/Tiko.
6.16      To ensure that adequate cash resources are available to meet
local currency costs of major port expansion expected to be required in
the near future, the Government undertook to maintain a sound financial
s-ituation in accordance with accepted financial practices and, by June 30,
1574, accumulate cash resources representing the balance of the port
renewal fund of not less than CFAF 1,000 million. The funds so accumulated
may be used prior to 1974 for major expansion works established in consul-
vation with the Association.



- 22 -
7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was obtained on the following
principal points:
(a) consultation with the Association on any substantial
change in the organization of Cameroon's ports
(para. 3.07);
(b) delegation to the port director of the powers required
for flexible and efficient port management in accordance
with sound administrative, financial and engineering
practices not later than April 30, 1971 (para. 3.08);
(c)  establishment of a new log-handling company not later
than April 30, 1971 (para. 3.17);
(d) operation of the dredger t"Garouall with the efficiency
required to ensure adequate dredging of the port and
its approaches (para. 3.24);
(e) improvement of port operating efficiency so that
operating ratios will not exceed agreed rates, and
consultation with the Association prior to modifica-
tion of port charges (para. 6.09); and
(f) accumulation of adequate cash resources to meet local
currency costs of major port expansion expected in the
near future (para. 6.16).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$1.5
million equivalent.

FIRST DOUALA PORT PROJECT
The Cameroon Port Study
(Study of a nng:rernm Pot DevProgram)
1.        Because of the steadily increasing traffic at Douala and the
difficulties encountered in maintaining adequate depths in the channel, the
Government employed a group of consulting engineers, OCCR/SOGREAH/DSBI, in
January 1969 to carry out a feasibility study of long-term port development
program in Cameroon.  At the Bank's recommendation, the consultants' terms
o' reference were amended in October 1969.  The main item of the study is
the feasibility of developing Douala port as compared to constructing a
new deep-water port at Victoria, Ambas Bay (Map 3). Completion of the
study is scheduled for September 1971; however, conclusive results are
expected by March 1971.
2.        The ccnsultants' assignment includes:
(a) a study of short-term development projects, namely:
(i)  a new industrial quay at Bonaberi, improving
handling equipment at Douala, Victoria and
Tiko, and improving Kribi and Garoua ports.
(b)  a study of long-term development projects, namely:
(i) an economic study to justify the need for
major port development;
(ii)  a model study and site investigations for
Douala channel;
(iii) site investigations for the Victoria zcne;
(iv) comparison of possible development projects;
(v) technical and economic study of the recommended
project;
(vi)  a financial analysis of the existing and new
port facilities; and
(vii)  a study of the organizational nroblems of
Cameroon ports.

3.        The consultants have oanpleted the following work:
(a)  Traffic study, the estimation of the actual and potential
capacity of the existing ports and the global needs for
new facilities;
(b) site measurements and analysis of data in the Douala
channel, at Kribi and Victoria;
(c) a program for the mathematical model study;
(d) a study for improving handling equipment in Douala,
Victoria and Tiko, including timber handling;
(e) tender documents for the industrial quay at Bonaberi
including specifications, bill of quantities and drawings;
and
(f) a study for improving Kribi port.
14.       The following is work to be completed by the consultants and
expected dates of completion:
(a) Garoua port study - August 1970;
(b) model study of Douala channel - October 1970;
(c) evaluation of alternative projects - March 1971;
(d) economic and financial study of recommended project -
July 1971;

Project (Loan No. 687-CM).
2. BACKGRWND
A. Economic Setting
(i) The Country (See Map 3)
2.01      The Federal Republic of Cameroon, formed in October 1961, com-
prises the part of Cameroon previously under French mandate and the southern
part of the former British Cameroons. It is situated slightly north of the
equator on the west coast of Africa and covers an area of 1h75,000 ki2,
almost as great as that of France.  The coastal and southern areas are
suitable for tropical crops such as coffee, cocoa, palm oil, rubber and
bananas. Tropical rain forest spreads over 150,000 km2 tithin the southern
half of the country. In the north conditions are suitable for cultivation
of cotton, groundnuts, rice and other cereals. Between these areas lies a
sparsely populated high plateau with good grazing potential. Population
(about 5.7 million) is growing at about 2.2% per annum; it is concentrated
in the coastal southwest in which is situated the economic capital of
Douala, in the north, and around Yaounde, the administrative capital.
(ii) Economy
2.02      About three-quarters of the working popuiation are engaged in
agriculture, predominantly on a smaLlholder basis. There are a few large
plantations, mainly in West Cameroon. Prices for cocoa and coffee are
established through a stabilization fund, operated by a governmental
marketing board. Apart from a bauxite deposit near Ngaoundere, the country
has few known minerals and few manufacturing industries, a notable excep-
tion being an aluminum plant at Edea, which converts alumina imported from
Guinea into aluminum ingots for export and for the manufacture of roofing
sheets and household goods for the local market. Development efforts have
been focused mainly on increasing agricultural production and special
emDhasis has recently been placed on the expansion of timber logging.
Buoyant  prices for Caneroonts main exports on the world marklt han:e permit-
ted imports in recent years to advance in quantity faster than exports
without detriment to the balance of payment. Foreign trade accounts for
about 40%"of gross domestic product (GDP) which now represents per capita
about US$175'er annum and is growing at an annual rate of 6,5% at ccnstant
prices.  Cameroon is a member of UDEAC (Union Douaniere et E onomique de
l'Afrique Centrale), which includes also Central African Republic, Gabon
and Congo (B).
2.03      Cameroon is well placed for handling foreign trade in transit for
Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR). In normal times Chad can
also use the Nigerian Railway from Maiduguri to Lagos or the Benue and Niger
e up-dating by Economic Mission, May 1970: 45%

Rivers to Burutu, but at present neither of these routes has recovered from
the effect of the recent hostilities. The CAR can use the trans-equatorial
routes to Bangui, the Oubangui and Congo Rivers to Brazzavifle and the Congo
Ocean Railway to Pointe Noire. However, lower transport costs in Cameroon,
resulting from rail and road improvements and construction of the Trans-
Cameroon Railway, should attract additional traffic to the Trans-Cameroon
route. The construction of a possible railway line from Yaounde to
Yokadouma as a first section of the railway connection to Bangui (CAR) has
been recommended by consultants who are making a CAR-Cameroon Regional
Transport Survey financed by UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. If
justified, this project would open new territories to development in
Cameroon and CAR and provide another access to the sea from CAR.
(iii) Timber
2.04      (Deleted; see Chapter 2)
B. Transport System
2.05      The transport system of the country is highly oriented toward
external trade. It serves mainly to export agricultural products and bring
in imports of consumer goods, raw materials, and capital goods for produc-
tive investment.  From the various transport projects planned, it appears
that Cameroon will continue to invest heavily in its infrastructure during
the third five-year Development Plan (1971/72 - 1975/76) /  For the secona
Plan (1966/67 - 1970/71), public and private investment in roads, ports,
railways and motor transport amounted to 33% of a total investment of 165
billion CFAF (US$595 million).
(i) Railway
2.06      The railway network consists of two main lines originating at
Douala: (a) the northern line to Nkongsamba (172 km) with a branch from
Mbanga to Kumba (29 kim) in West Cameroon; (b) the central line to Yaounde
(308 Ian) with a branch from Otele to I4balmayo (37 km).  A 628-km extension
from Yaounde northward towards Ngaoundere, known as the Trans-Cameroon
Railway, is under construction.  It was opened to traffic to Belabo (293 km)
in April 1969, and the remaining 335 km to NIgaoundere will probably be ready
for use in 1974.  The system, which is publicly owned and operated by Regi-
fercan, will be more fully described later in this report. Annex 1 presents
a historical review of railway development in Cameroon.
1/ The Railway Development Plan is for the six years 1970/71 to 1975/76,
beginning one year earlier than the Government Plan. This deviation from
the normal five-year planning period has been made necessary by unforeseen
increases in traffic, accelerated wear and tear of track and the threatened
failure of the Japoma bridge.



AISE_ 2
Page 3
2.07      The railway carries over two-thirds of all traffic into and out
of Douala port. The increase in timber traffic in recent years has been
made possible only by the availability of cheap railway transport; future
targets of greatly increased production from areas more distant from the
port will depend even more heavily on this factor.  In the past, the de-
velopmental potential of the railway has been limited to a relatively
small area, its farthest pere tration of the hinterland being to Yaounde,
a distance of only 308 km from the coast. The productive regLons of north-
ern Cameroon and southern Chad have been isolated from their natural outlet
to the sea by distance and high transport costs, and economic development
of these regions has depended upon the capacity of alternative and cheaper
rail and river routes through Nigeria. These alternative routes, for a
variety of reasons, have always been inadequate and unreliable with the
r_sult that the development of a large area of high potential has been
retarded.  'Wnen the extension of the  Cameroon  Railways to Ngaoundere has
been completed and the roads northward from the railhead have been improved
(for which purpose Bakc and IDA finance has already been made available),
a new and powerful incentive to development will be provided.
(ii) Roads
2.08      The direction of the main national roads is fran the coast, at
Douala, to the northern part of the country. A main axis connects Douala
to Nkongsamba and to Ngaoundere where it converges with a road frcm Yaoundie
to continue toward the north up to Chad. The total length of the road net-
work is about 20,700 kmi, 17,500 km in East Cameroon and 3,200 km in West
Carc::--on.  Only 1,200 km are caved, about 10,000 km have gravel or laterite
surfaces with various standards and traffic densities, and 095500 lkm are
eartlh tracks with vehicle counts lower than 10 per day.  The vehicle fleet
nlubs>l about 30,000 in East Cameroon and 6,500 in West Cameroon.  The dis-
trit. :.-Lon by type is about 20% trucks, 19% light deliv-ery vans, 52% passen-
ger c.r s and 9% motorcycles.  The overall road netuwork and iYs maf_rtenance
are In need of improvement.  Development forest roads are be§ng planmed in
the southwest. A Bank, loan of US$12 million and IDA Credit of US$7 million
were approved in February 1970 for improvement of the Ngaoundere-Garoua and
Tiko-Victoria roads.
(iii) Ports and Internal Navigation
2.09-2.11 (Deleted; See Chapter 2)
(iv) Aviation
2.11      Intermational air service is provided by UTA (Union de Transports
Aeriens) and by Air Afrique through Douala. Connecting services are pro-
vided by Air Afrique and a number of small companies to Yaounde, Tiko,
Ngaoundere, Garoua, Maroua, Foumbam, Kribi, Yagoua and Batouri.  There are
15 flights per week in each direction between Yaounde and Douala. Air
freight is limited to high value goods and perishables, and is minimal in
comparison to total freight traffic.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.13      At present, railway transport, ports and civil aviation are reg-
ulated by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications whereas
road matters, construction, maintenance, road transport licenses and
tariffs come under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works at
the Federated States level. No Federal Mrinistry has full responsibility
for the coordination of various transport modes, investment priorities,
highway and bridge construction standards, collection of compatible and
reliable transport statistics and vehicle registration.
2.14      There appears to be no legislative protection of transport modes
from one another. The limitation of gross -ehicle weight to five tons on
the road between Edea and Yaounde, for reasons of low standards of construc-
tion, works in favor of the railway, but with the exception of the Douala
to Nkongsamba section, where road/rail competition does exist, the two
modes are generally complementary.
2.15      During negotiations of the recent highway development credit
agreement, assurances were obtained that the Cameroon Government will study
the appropriate institutional modifications to ensure the coordination and
the strengthening at the federal level of all measures related to the trans-
port sector. During negotiations of the proposed loan, assurances were ob-
tained that the railway will introduce, not later than July 1, 1971, a
costing system to determine marginal profitability by lines and commodities
and thus vrovide a basis for a pricing policy appropriate to operations in
the increasingly competitive environment that is inevitable as the economy
develops.

navigation channel. Depths at the entrance of the river are 13 to 14 m
whereas about 9 km of the channel leading to the port facilities are
relatively shallow; these were dredged to a depth of 4.2 m in 1947 and to
a depth of 5.7 m in 1952. Maintaining the latter depth in this part of
the channel by occasional dredging has proved very difficult because
siltation of improved depths is rapid; the minimum depth now is about 5
m. Mqaximum tidal range is 2.5 m and mean tidal range is 1.5 m; consequentlY,
ships of up to 6.5 m draft can use the channel at high tide. About five
kilometers of the channel are 5 to 6,m deep, 6 km are betwee'n 6 to 8 m deep
and 19 km are over 8 m deep.  Minimum width of the channel is 150 m.  The
channel is stable and has no difficult bends.
3.        A 7.0 m deep bar in the open sea 15 km from the river entrance
allows ships of 8.5 to 9.0 m draft to pass during high tides. The bar
was surveyed in 1956 and 1962 and was found to be stable in position and
depth. Any future deepening of the channel should allow for the depth of
this bar.
B. The Wharves
4.        Douala port has 11 deep-water quays, all in line on the left
bank of the river. Four quays 550 m long and 8 to 10 m deep, of steel
sheet piles, were completed in 19643 the others were built in 1954 of
concrete blocks and are 1,150 m long and 5 to 8 m deep. In addition,
there are some 60 m of shallow quays for floating equipment, 165 m for
fishing boats and 1,330 m for small vessels and harbor craft.
5.        Of the 11 main quays only one is specialized.  It is used for
importing alumina and exporting aluminum ingots. The same quay is also
used for tankers discharging petroleum products into a pipeline leading
to storage tanks.  The other deep-water quays are for timber, general
cargo and dry bulk cargo; all have an apron of 25 m, two railway lines,
at least one row of modern transit sheds and are provided with fairly
wide roads and anple areas for parking and maneuvering road vehicles.



ANNEX 3
6.        In Miarch 1970, the Government contracted with H. Courbot (French)
to construct a petroleum mooring station 200 m from the fishing quays, at
a cost of CFAF 145 million (US$O.52 million equivalent).  The structure,
of two steel dolphins, can accommodate tankers of 8 m draft. Wlork is
expected to start in mid-1970 and be cormpleted in a year. The petroleum
companies will finance construction of the platform for cranes and flexible
hoses and the submerged pipelines; the estimated cost is CFAF 40 million
(US$0.15 million equivalent).
7.        Bonaberi is opposite Douala, on the right bank of the IWlouri
River. A railway and a road bridge connect the river banks upstream to
Douala. Bonaberi has one quay 140 m long and 7.5 m deep for exporting
bananas, and a shallow-draft quay 70 m long for barges.
C. Transit Sheds - Sorting Areas
8.        In Douala, the port land area is 3,600 m long and 100 to 200 m
wide. It contains 15 transit sheds for general cargo with a total area
of about 55,000 m2 and average dimensions of 40 x 100 m x 6 m. All sheds
open at both sides, are served by railway lines, paved by concrete slabs
and can accommodate loads of 2 tons per m2. Shed area is sufficient for
handling traffic of about 2 million tons of general cargo annually; the
forecast general cargo traffic for 1975 is 1.4 million tons.
9.        Total area for sorting and stacking is about 30,000 m2 for
general cargo and 130,000 m2 for timber. These areas are generally
flooded with water during the rainy season and the lower layer of
goods is often damaged.
D. Handling Equipment
10.       For Timber:
(a)  Six overhead cranes, 9 m high, two 20-ton and four 10-ton,
on rails 170 m long and 25 m apart; forward speed 30 m/mr.
and lifting speed 5 r/mn. One crane is new and the other
five purchased in 1954. The foundation is unstable and
rails require occasional realignment and leveling;
(b)  One overhead crane, purchased in 1969, of 20-ton capacity
on rails 280 m long and 44 m gauge; forward speed 60 m/mn
and lifting speed 6 r/mn. This crane offers very limited
service mainly because of its unsuitable position in the
log-handling area;



ANNEX 3
Fa =e 3
(c) Fourteen straddle trucks of 6 to 12-ton capacity, 10
to 20 years old, all in fair condition; and
(d)  One stacker, two loaders, four tractors, and 12 trailers
of 20-ton capacity; all purchased in 1970.
11.       For general cargo:  the port has no quay cranes.  The Port
Directorate owns four forklifts which it rents to stevedoring firms.
Stevedoring firms owtn 44 cranes of 3 to 5-tons, a1 forklifts of 2 to
10-tons, 21 tractors and 63 trailers.
E. Floating Equipment
(a) One 1,050 hp suction cutter hopper dredger built in 1963,
of 500 m3 capacity which can dispose spoil in barges,
through bottom doors, or discharge through a pipeline
55 cm in diameter. Dredging output is about 280 m3 per
hour. Dredging speed is three knots and maximum speed
is eight knots. Maximum draft loaded is 4.0 m and
maximum dredging depth 15.0 m;
(b)  One hopper barge 200 m3 for use with the dredger;
(c)  One floating dock of 1,200-ton capacity built in 190h,
62 m long and 17.3 m wide;
(d) Five tugboats of 50 to 240 hp built in 1940-1948; seven
pilot launches of 50 to 240 hp built in 1949-1963; two
floating cranes of 10 and 100 tons built in 1949 and
1953 and one waterbarge of 80-ton capacity built in 1953,
all in fair condition.
P. Workshops
'2.       There are eight shops:  Mechanical - 300 m2; foundry - 150 m2;
electrical - 210 m2; carpentry - 100 ml2; painting - 300 m2; motor - 300 m2;
building - 500 i2; buoys - 150 m2.  The workshops also -include general
stores - 150 m2, a garage - 440 m2 and a slipway of 100-ton capacity.
Generally, all machines are kept in good condition.

FIRST DOUALA PORT PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference of Costing Advisor
1.        The existing costing and budgetary system is designed to meet
Federal Budget Annex requirements and therefore oriented to Governmental
accounting methods and objectives rather than port management needs. Im-
provement is required in the collection and presentation of data to provide
a basis for revising rates and charges and a monetary measure of operating
performances. To achieve this, it has been agreed between the Banlk and the
Cameroon Government that a osting dvisor will be appointed for a period
of about 18 months to establish a port costing and budgetary control system
on commercial lines. Re-organization of the port management structure
is expected to occur within the next few years; a financial analysis of
port facilities and a study of operational problems is now being undertaken
by CCCR/SOGREAH/DSBI. It is anticipated that an autonomous port authority
will eventually be created. Meanwhile, the new system will serve port
management as a supplement to existing  udget nnex requirements.  It should
therefore be capable of correlation with general accounting records, whether
the port is a Government department (as at present) or an autonomous public
body (as envisaged in future). The assignment will be carried out with the
full cooperation of the Cameroon Government.
Scope
2.        The duties of the advisor will be to:
(a)  introduce procedures for costing port services and activi-
ties to facilitate cost estimation, measurement and control;
(b)  introduce procedures for budgeting revenue, recurrent and
capital expenditure and cash flow;
(c)  introduce a system of financial reporting to divisional
head and director levels of management which highlight
variances between budgeted and actual results;
(d)  liaise closely with the EDP study unit responsible for
planning Government computer bureau services in Douala
which are expected to be made available to the port by
1972;
(e)  prepare an operational manual for staff guidance concerning
procedures (a) to (c) above,
(f)  train staff in costing and budgetary control techniques to
enable them to maintain the new procedures effectively; and
(g)  help sirplify the wharfage rate structure applicable to
unloaded cargo.

Outline Terms of Reference for Feasibility Study
of Timber-Handling Solutions
(Douala/Mianoka Study)
1.        Forecast log exports through Douala are expected to exceed one
iLllion tons in 1975.  These quantities cannot be handled rith present
and planned facilities. The purpose of the proposed feasibility study
is to analyze ways and means to increase the log-handling capacity in
the greater Douala area, in particuLar, to compare the Douala and iianoka
solutions. The solution finally recommended by the consultants kill be
taken into account in the long-term proposals for the development of
Cameroon's deep-water port facilities.
2*        The Douala solution would consist of modernizing and extending
existing facilities at Douala.
3.        The Manoka solution would consist of establishing a new log
depot at Japoma bridge where the railway line betwJeen Douala and Yaounde
crosses the Dibamba River (IAp 3), organizing a system of log transport
(rafts and barges) in the river between Japoma and PIanoka and loading
logs on ships anchored in lanoka Bay.
4.        The studj will include:
(a) analysis of available marine data for the Manoka region:
tides, waves, wind, etc.;
(b)  site measurements at Japoma, in the Dibamba River and in
the MIanoka Bay. These include water depth and currents;
(c) evaluation of navigation conditions between Japoma and
Manoka, and loading conditions in the HIanoka Bay;
(d) estimation of dredging required;
(e) technical studies for handling and transportation systems
for both solutions, including handling equipment, barges,
tugs, etc.;
(f)  updating log export forecasts;

Bases and Assuiptions Used in Financial Projections
1.        That an IDA Credit of US$1.5 million equivalent will be made
to the Government, effective March 31, 1971 and that the port renewal
fund will be debited with such debt service charges as would apply to
loan of the same amount at an interest rate of 7Vt% per annum for a
period of 20 years, including 2 years grace.
2,        That the principal amount outstanding of Government (FIDES)
debt for Douala port was CFAF 944 million as at July 1, 1965, and that
the average rate of interest thereon is h% per annum.
3.        That the Government will continue to reimburse the Douala port
for Wouri Bridge maintenance costs and that the bridge wdll not be
included in the assets of the port.
4.        That there are no port liabilities other than those included
in the pro-forma balanlce sheets given in Table 7 and that sundry debtors
as at June 30, 1969 amounted to not more than CFAF 87 million.
5.        Financial forecasts of earnings are based on the Port Direc-
torate's current rates and charges and it is assumed that during fiscal
1970 and 1975 any rate adjustments consequent upon a review and relation
to costs will not reduce the overall level of the rate structure.
6.        The fixed assets inventory in Table 7 was prepared by association
staff. Apart from land, the original cost price was ascertainable for the
most expensive assets and, as they are acquired during the past seven years,
this was used as a basis of valuation. Land is valued at half what it
would be were it based upon recent prices prevailing for small, well-
located corimercial plots in Douala City. The value of other assets of
unknown cost is an estimate of likely market value if sold. Asset life
estimates take account of the type of structure and climatic and working
conditions based upon Bank staff experience in West Africa and is the
basis for depreciation on the straight line method. No account is taken
of likely current replacement costs. Cumulative depreciation relates to
actual life expired in most cases, or estimated where actual acquisition
dates are unknown.

However, a modest growth has been assumed for financial forecast purposes.
