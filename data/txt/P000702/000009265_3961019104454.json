for the Sixth Education Project\n            for Ethiopia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory,\n            project sustainability was likely, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was deficient. Some\n            lessons learned included: the time projected for physical\n            construction should be realistic, and should take into\n            account factors such as weather, natural calamities and\n            availability of construction materials. Apart from security\n            problems, it was known that the Project Management Office\n            (PMO) was also involved in other projects financed by other\n            donors and could hardly comply with the timing established.\n            The Government's financial obligations and the\n            deterioration of the economy were not properly evaluated.\n            Discussing Government priorities in assigning funds is\n            essential. It might be necessary to adjust the share of\n            Government's contribution, and even revise the project\n            scope. Procurement and import regulations both were a\n            serious handicap for the project. Implementation started\n            moving when Government decided to make local regulations\n            more flexible. The Bank's direct site supervision and\n            monitoring of the implementation process is a normal\n            procedure. It should be waived only when the successive\n            supervision missions are confident that they can be made\n            responsive for their supervision work and would remain\n            accountable for their reports."}, "docdt": "1995-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
