Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) this project has proven that the rehabilitation of\n            an old hydroelectric plant is feasible and economical. By\n            reinforcing the civil works and mechanical equipment of the\n            dam, and by replacing equipment the obsolete components of\n            the turbines and generators, and their auxiliaries and\n            metering and control systems with state of the-art, the\n            useful life of an hydroelectric station can be extended in\n            several decades beyond its original life; 2) advance\n            commitment of project financing sources is a key factor for\n            expediting project implementation. In this case, the\n            negotiation, approval and effectiveness of the additional\n            financing required for the rehabilitation works of Gabriel\n            Terra delayed the contractor to start field work by about\n            two years; and 3) co-financing of an investment project\n            through a B-loan can help a country with quick loan\n            disbursement to cope with difficulties in serving external\n            debt, but it involves complex negotiations and approvals\n            that can impact negatively on the implementation of an\n            investment lending operation."}, "docdt": "1998-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
