institutions\n            (commercial banks, land development banks, regional rural\n            banks, and state cooperative banks) over the three year\n            period, mid 1986 to mid 1989. Through the association with\n            NABARD's ongoing refinancing of rural credit, the\n            project will also help to increase agricultural production,\n            rural income, and employment; in particular, it will\n            emphasize assistance to small farmers."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
