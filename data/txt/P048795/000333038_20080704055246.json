Some lessons learned included: strong central\n            coordination is necessary to ensure delivery of results in\n            regional projects. Even when dealing with countries and\n            institutions with good capacity, such as in this project, a\n            dedicated, empowered project manager is still needed to\n            coordinate activities across the various countries,\n            components, and local institutions. Limited global\n            environment facility (GEF) resources can still have a major\n            impact. If the policy environment is conducive, and\n            participants are committed, a great deal can be achieved\n            with a relatively small financial allocation by leveraging\n            local skills and resources and contributions from\n            development partners. The implications of political-economic\n            changes must be assessed, even for environmental projects.\n            In this case, major political-economic shifts, such as four\n            of five beneficiary countries joining the European Union\n            (EU), created both opportunities and challenges for\n            implementation, and it is important to recognize such\n            factors during design in order to effectively harness such forces."}, "docdt": "2008-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
