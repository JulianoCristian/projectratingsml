The design phase shall consider project selected\n            roads for routine maintenance works, limited to the existing\n            right-of-way, and, include waste collection in accordance to\n            current regulations. In case of archaeological finds, the\n            related archaeological authorities shall be informed, who\n            should proceed to its preservation. Procurement documents\n            will include provisions to ensure embankment stabilization,\n            particularly around bridges, and culverts, through\n            re-vegetation practices, and technologies to contain\n            unstable slope terrains; while drainage discharges will be\n            monitored to reduce erosion. During construction,\n            contracting precautionary clauses shall specify the required\n            materials - from asphalt plants, stone quarries, and borrow\n            pits - to be environmentally valid, and licensed for use.\n            Transport, and operating equipment will be required to use\n            covers, or spray truck loads, which should be transported at\n            off peak hours to minimize traffic congestion. Construction\n            activities will be limited to daylight working schedules, to\n            reduce noise, and dust pollution. Construction debris will\n            be disposed of in accordance to local environmental\n            regulations, and at selected sites, while sediments, and\n            solid wastes will undergo toxicity testing prior to\n            appropriate disposal. During the operation phase, periodic\n            maintenance will be subjected to a Safety Audit, and a\n            review process by the consultant road safety specialist, in\n            line with a road workers protection policy to be adopted."}, "docdt": "2002-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
