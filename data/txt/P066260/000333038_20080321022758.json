for the Road Maintenance Project\n            for Albania were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was high, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The\n            selection of the project's rural roads was done by a\n            consultant study, which started by collecting a list of\n            priorities from the Circles and the Communes. At\n            implementation, while the procurement process was\n            centralized by General Roads Directorate (GRD), every\n            individual contract was signed by a senior authority in the\n            Ministry of Local Governments or its successor the Ministry\n            of Interior (MI). Yet, during project implementation and\n            even at project closing there are indications of unhappiness\n            in the MI that selection was not always the highest\n            priority. There is also unhappiness with the design\n            standard, where an asphalt surface was desired. This\n            situation points to the need for a stronger participation of\n            the local communities and the MI in all stages of the\n            project cycle. It also points to the need for an even\n            stronger participation or consultation with the MI or local\n            authorities when such authorities change during the course\n            of the project. In fact, part of the perception of the\n            current MI authorities may stem from the fact that many\n            decisions were taken by the preceding authorities. Lack of\n            ownership, if real, may have serious consequences when the\n            road improvement or maintenance work is completed, and it is\n            up to the local authorities to assume responsibility for the\n            maintenance of the roads."}, "docdt": "2007-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
