1. Country and Sector Background
The total length of the road network is about 16000 km. Table 1 provides
a breakdown of the road network.Table 1 Length of different road types in
kilometers 200lType of RoadLength Institution ResponsibleNational Road

EntitiesTOTAL16,0000nly 8 km of the main national road network (between
Tirana and Durres) can be called motorway, with standards not in
accordance with those of European motorways. The condition of the roads is
in general poor for all categories of roads. Only few kilometers of road
have a satisfactory condition. A substantial backlog in periodic
maintenance exists. The rehabilitation of the two main corridors has
started back in 1994 and is still in process. For the next 5 years there
are no plans for new construction of motorways. Only reconstruction and
rehabilitation of existing roads are planned. The Ministry of Local
Government oversees the municipalities responsible for about 1000 km of
urban streets, and local government organizations responsible for the
remaining 12 000 km of secondary and tertiary roads including 4126 km of
rural roads recently separated from GRD. The road subsector has become an
increasingly important part of Albania's transport system in the last
decade, with rapid growth of vehicle traffic at the expense of other
transport modes (see Table 2). Table 2     Total number of vehicles over

bania has been the recipient of substantial amounts of foreign assistance
directed to the improvement of the road network, including four IDA
projects. In spite of this, the road network is in very poor condition



(see Table 3) and is verging on being a major constraint to the
Government's growth strategy as expressed in the Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper mentioned above. The Government recognizes this, and has
requested IDA assistance to improve the country's road maintenance
capacity. Specifically, in a letter from the Minister of Transport dated
June 22, 2000, the Government confirmed to IDA that it considers the
proposed Highway Maintenance Project to be a high priority for the
country, and also confirmed its concurrence in an overall strategy for
restructuring the management of road maintenance to make it more
effective.Table 3    Percentage of different types of roads conditions in

maintenance and investment activities in Albania takes place according to
the following principles. The State Roads are at present financed via the
state budget and foreign loans. The Regional Road Directorates prepare
requests for annual budgets that are collected and vetted by GRD. GRD
through the Ministry of Transport to the Parliament for approval then
submits a combined road budget. After approval of the Government budget,
the Ministry of Finance sends funds to GRD and directly to most RRDs
through a District Authority Bank. The Rural Roads are financed through
the state budget and local budgets in some cases supplemented by foreign
funding. Only limited central government resources are being made
available for rural roads at present. Urban roads and streets are
financed by the City Councils and the Municipalities through the state
budget.Table 4    Government Budget for the Transport Sector (in million

Authorities (Districts, Regions)563529661321756739The country's present
tax structure is generally in alignment with European Union requirements,
but still needs some adjustments (see Country Report Albania-Road
Transport Charges, NEI Transport for PHARE, 1999). What are seriously
needed are vastly improved tax collections feeding the general revenues of
the government and a mechanism that assures good budgeting of adequate
funding for timely maintenance that is then turned over to the road
authorities to maintain the desired performance of the public network. At
this stage the Government is not pursuing the establishment of a Road Fund
for Albania. As was mentioned above, the funds to the General Road
Directorate are coming directly from the national budget. Besides the
budget funding the GRD has also funding from foreign loans and aids. The
national budget is only a one-year budget, which seriously hinders
multi-annual planning of maintenance and reconstruction works. There is
also no straight relation between budget and costs. GRD has two budgets:
Investment and Maintenance. The investment budget includes all works that
need to be tendered. This included construction, rehabilitation (see table
6) and also periodic maintenance. Periodic maintenance is contracted out
-2 -



in Albania, whereas Regional Road Directorates carry out routine
maintenance (see table 7). As the Regional Road Directorates mainly carry
out the routine maintenance works, the maintenance budget of the GRD is in
fact that of the RRD's. A substantial part of the total maintenance
budgets of the RRD's is used for salaries of officials, equipment and
housing.Table 6    Rehabilitation expenditures over the last 5 years on

because of the transfer of Rural Roads network from MoT to MLG, National
Roads expenditures no longer include expenditures related to the Rural
Roads. This explained the decrease in figures from 1998 to 1999.Traffic
safety is a major environmental hazard in Albania. The number of
fatalities/10,000 vehicles (24.1 fatalities/10,000 vehicles) is the worst
in eastern Europe and about ten times the EU average. The traffic police
has determined that the main causes of accidents include poor road
condition, lack of safety features (e.g., signs, pavement marking, traffic
lights), high speed, and high alcohol levels. Improving road safety and
traffic management are included to support further development of the Road
Safety Program for Albania, in view of the continuance of seriously high
accident rates, and to introduce standardized traffic signs and road
markings for improved traffic management on all roads. Improving
enforcement is also a major issue especially because the traffic police
lacks of equipment for control of speed, blood alcohol level. Another
first requirement is to collect and analyze data on accidents. The record
keeping practices of local authorities and police should be improved to
allow a proper analyze as good quality accident data is essential for
decision making. There is no central data bank on traffic accidents.
2. Objectives
The proposed project seeks to improve the overall maintenance of Albania's
road network, including both the national and rural roads, both in the
near term and on an ongoing basis. Improvement of law enforcement and
accident black spots would reduce the number of accidents and minimize the
offsetting effects of improved road conditions and expected higher traffic
speeds. It will have the following specific objectives:Improving the
efficiency of the management of the national and rural road network by (i)
restructuring the national road administration (GRD), and (ii)
strengthening the rural road administration unit in MLG.Improving road
safety by (i) developing the institutional capacity in MOT/GRD and MLG to
identify hazardous locations and to design and implement physical measures
to reduce road accidents at these locations, and (ii) providing technical
assistance and equipment to the traffic police to improve law enforcement.
3. Rationale for Bank's Involvement
Albania has received substantial amounts of financial support for road
improvements from the European community and from international
organizations. However, it still lacks the administrative capacity to
administer this assistance in an effective manner. The Bank's broad
experience in assisting in the institutional strengthening of road
administrations and support of traffic safety policies and its ability to
coordinate with a large number of co-financiers puts it in a unique
- 3 -



position to fill this role. Also, its experience with road financing
arrangements will provide useful background for assisting the Government
in this area.
4. Description
The project will include the following components:
1. Civil works to improve the road network, including:
a. About 300 km of roads and bridges of the main road network, based on
HDM analysis of the highest priority 1,200 km of the network (US$21
million).
b. About 600 km of roads and bridges of the rural road network based on
the selection of the road sections with the highest priority based on
economic evaluation (US$10 million).
c. Improvement of 10 priority accident black spot locations (US$2 million)
2. Goods:
a. Equipment for road survey for GRD and MLG, office equipment, vehicles
and supplies for the PIUs.
b. Road safety equipment for GRD and MLG such as reflectorized traffic
signs and reflectorized thermoplastic paint for road marking.
c. Equipment for the Traffic Police such as radars and blood alcohol
tests, and to establish a central data bank on traffic accidents.
3. Training and technical assistance:
a. Training and consultant services for MoT/GRD/MLG to assist in:
- the restructuring of the national, district and local road authorities;
- designing an appropriate road user charge legislation, collection
mechanisms, and distribution arrangements for financing road maintenance
operations; and
- identifying black spots, development / implementation / monitoring /
assessment of remedial measures, and introduction of safety audit
procedures.
b. Consultant services to prepare the engineering design and assist the
Government during supervision.
c. Training for the private road construction industry.
d. Training, technical assistance and consulting services to assist the
traffic police to enforce traffic laws and in designing a central data
bank on traffic accidents.
e. Technical assistance to improve the franchising system for bus
operations

6. Implementation
The cooperating agencies would include the General Roads Directorate (GRD)
under MOT, the Ministry of Local Government (MLG) and the traffic Police
under Ministry of Public Order (MPO). Generally, the GRD would be
responsible for National Roads policy and technical standards, and
directly for the portions of the project that affect the main road
network, and the MLG would be responsible for the rural road network.
However, during project preparation it will be necessary to determine the
level of involvement of the District and municipal governments, and the
implementation capacity of these organizations for carrying out road
-4 -



improvements. The road safety component, excluding civil works, would be
the responsibility of the NRSC, with support from MOT/GRD and the traffic
police. The project would have two Project Implementation Units (PIU), one
for GRD and one for the MLG, consisting of about five persons each with
skills in general management, procurement, highway engineering and
accounting to keep the project accounts, open and operate a Special
Account, prepare reports as required for the project, and to coordinate
with all of the Government agencies involved in the project and IDA. It is
proposed to strengthen the PIU for the Emergency Road Repair Project to
implement the national roads component of the project. This would avoid
creating a new PIU. It is also expected that GRD should be able to help
the MLG in project implementation, as GRD already has experience in
implementing Bank-financed projects. As mentioned, the road safety
component, excluding civil works, would be the responsibility of the NRSC,
with support from MOT/GRD and the traffic police but would be implemented
procurementwise through the GRD PIU.
7. Sustainability
It is not possible to assess the sustainability of the project at this
time, since this will depend on the degree of Government commitment to the
restructuring of the road maintenance administrative structure
demonstrated during project preparation. Sustainability will be assessed
during preparation, and will be fully addressed in the PAD.
8. Lessons learned from past operations in the country/sector
The World Bank has had extensive experience in road maintenance in many
places around the world, and in many of the Eastern European countries as
well. One important lesson learned many years ago is the importance of
giving priority to maintenance over new construction when financing is
constrained, based on the superior rates of return that almost invariably
are achieved by the maintenance operations. As a number of the Eastern
European country operations are now at or near completion, there are
number of other important lessons that emerge.First among these is that
contracting is more efficient than force account operations. Virtually all
Bank/IDA operations now provide for periodic maintenance to be carried out
on a contract basis. Routine maintenance is more problematic since the
work tasks are more difficult to define precisely. Nevertheless, there is
growing experience in European countries such as Finland and Sweden where
routine maintenance is being carried out on a contract basis, frequently
with significant savings compared to the force account operations that
preceded the change. It is now timely to consider contracting for routine
maintenance more widely. Furthermore, the successful use of
performance-based specifications in several countries have indicated that
this approach may be preferable to the traditional "bill of quantities"
approach to contract out routine maintenance.The Bank's experience with
the provision of financing for road maintenance is more mixed, but several
lessons are clear. First, it is important that the road users be assessed
for the cost of maintaining the roads, just as other basic infrastructure
charges for its services, as in the case of electric power or telephone
service. The most appropriate charges are those most directly related to
the use of the roads, with fuel taxes as the largest contributor in most
cases. Second, while there are frequently conceptual objections from the
IMF to the establishment of a Road Fund, with specific road user charges
dedicated to placement in the Fund for use only for roads, it is clear
that this mechanism leads to a higher level and more consistency in
- 5 -



financing than if the funds are provided from the general budget. The
agreement reached between the World Bank and the IMF for conditions under
which Road Funds could be considered acceptable should be given attention
when using this mechanism. The World Bank has had extensive experience in
traffic safety in many places around the world. Designing and implementing
a Road Safety Policy is a difficult and long term process. From all the
involved agencies as well as other government bodies, it requires: (i)
increasing awareness of traffic safety issues, (ii) good coordination,
(iii) strong ownership, and (iv) adequate funding. All of these lessons
are or will be incorporated into the design of this project.

10. Environment Aspects (including any public consultation)
Issues     :   There should not be any serious environmental
issues, since the civil works will be limited to improvements of existing
roads and bridges. However, an environmental review will be carried out
during preparation, and an Environmental Management Plan will be prepared
that should adequately address any problems that can be anticipated.
