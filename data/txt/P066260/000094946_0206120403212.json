"The development objective of the Road\n            Maintenance Project is to reduce transport costs on priority\n            sections of the main road network, reduce accident rates,\n            and provide better access to, and basic services for rural\n            areas. The two main project components are: 1) Civil works\n            will conduct periodic, and routine maintenance on paved\n            roads of the national road network, including urban\n            sections. Routine maintenance works will be contracted by\n            the private sector, to include pavement, drainage systems,\n            road signaling maintenance works during an overall period of\n            three years. Periodic maintenance works on pavement, and\n            bridges of the rural road network, shall be based on an\n            engineering analysis, and assessment of socioeconomic\n            conditions. Under this component, equipment for road\n            surveys, vehicles, office equipment, and computers will be\n            supplied. Training and technical assistance (TA) will be\n            provided for the restructuring, management organization and\n            systems of the main national and rural roads, which includes\n            design and recommendations on road user charges,\n            disbursement mechanisms, and financing. 2) Traffic safety\n            remedial works will include horizontal, and vertical\n            signalization, improvements of road pavement and shoulders,\n            and installation of roadside barriers, and bridge parapets.\n            Hardware and software will provide database and analysis\n            systems to the Traffic Police to facilitate road safety\n            measures, and, TA and training will support these efforts."}, "docdt": "2002-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
