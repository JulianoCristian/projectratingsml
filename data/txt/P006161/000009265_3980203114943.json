sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            timetable of project execution was affected by delays in the\n            contracting of consultancy services and procurement\n            procedures because the personnel of the executing agencies\n            were unfamiliar with the World Bank procurement regulations.\n            Early systematic training of personnel will have reduced the\n            delays significantly. The continuity of qualified personnel\n            in the executing agencies and of the Project Coordination\n            Units was fundamental to the success of the project. After\n            an uncertain beginning, the Borrower and International\n            Development Association (IDA) agreed on a new strategy for\n            the project which was formalized by the fourth amendment.\n            Since December 1992, the more stable context facilitated the\n            execution of the reforms and of the execution of the\n            project. The continuity and the strong sector experience of\n            Bank staff in charge of project management and supervision\n            has been a key factor in establishing a consistent policy\n            and in engaging the Government and the executing agencies in\n            an open policy dialogue, which considerably helped in\n            maintaining the focus on the achievement of the project\n            objectives. The integration of restructuring and technical\n            components in the strengthening of the Public Mining\n            Institutions (PMIs) has been key to their success by\n            ensuring a strong connection between the development of a\n            functional organization and its products."}, "docdt": "1997-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
