1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background

1.      Rwanda emerged from a genocide and civil war that took place from April to July 1994,
which inflicted incalculable harm to the social and economic fabric of Rwanda, in particular the
economic infrastructure. The ability of Rwanda’s economic infrastructure to fulfill the country’s
needs was undermined by lack of maintenance for over 10 years after the end of the civil war,
resulting to decline in quality of the country’s entire infrastructure. With the support of the donor
community, some infrastructure was rehabilitated 10 years following the end of the conflict but
much still remained to be repaired. Furthermore, direct effects of war and social disruption led to
other indirect consequences in terms of loss of staff in utility companies and ministries, including
many in senior managerial positions. The resulting loss of institutional memory, including the
destruction of records and management systems, had not been fully replaced.

Sector Background

2.      Rwanda is a landlocked country about 2,000 km away from the nearest sea port, and its
transport costs represented as high as 40 percent of export and import values. Given its
mountainous terrain and the excessive rain fall, erosion is particularly severe on the country’s road
network, whose maintenance cost was twice higher than that of most Sub-Saharan countries. At
appraisal, Rwanda had a road network of 14,000 km, spread over 27,000 square km of national
territory, is among the densest in Sub-Sahara Africa, and its management far exceeds the country’s
human and financial capabilities. Only 23 percent of the 1,100km of Rwanda’s asphalted network
in 2005 was in good condition, while barely 5 percent and 2 percent of the secondary and
communal networks were in good condition, respectively. As high as 85 percent of the paved
network required heavy rehabilitation or periodic maintenance, and most of the secondary and
communal roads had not been maintained for over a decade.

3.      The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) of 2006 identified five transport sector objectives, namely
to: (i) improve international transport connections; (ii) upgrade key road networks to paved
standards to facilitate the country's access and its social and economic reintegration; (iii) ensure
better management and financing of the road network in general; (iv) improve road safety; and (v)
improve rural feeder roads to lower transport costs for farmers and facilitate the development of
market-based agriculture.

Rationale for Bank and Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF) Assistance

4.     Rwanda had shown strong economic performance consistently since emerging from a
devastating genocide. Since 1994, Rwanda had been able to maintain overall macro stability and
implemented extensive reforms that contributed to the high levels of growth observed during the
post-conflict decade of recovery and beyond. New borrowing had been less than was projected at
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point. Most constraining trade barriers had

                                                 1
been lifted. Country Policy and Institutional Assessment ratings had been consistent over the years.
Consolidating these gains depended on how policies in key sectors, like transport, were directed
to support the macroeconomic agenda of the government. The TSDP supported transport policy
development.

5.      The involvement of both the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF) and International
Development Association (IDA) was in line with both the Country Assessment Evaluation (CAE)
conducted by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) in 2003 and the Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) of the previous Bank-supported operation, the Rwanda
Transport Sector Project (RTSP), which recommended that future IDA support should focus on
rebuilding Rwanda’s depleted institutional and road maintenance capacities. The ICR proposed
continued support by external donors in reducing the backlog of road maintenance and
rehabilitation works. It further recommended the increased use of labor-based construction
approaches in order to promote employment, particularly in rural areas. This would build
partnerships with rural communities and guarantee the sustainability of roads maintenance by
incorporating it in agricultural activities. The project was a direct response to a request by GoR for
much needed assistance to the country coming out of a devastating civil war and genocide, both
of which affected production and infrastructure, including transport.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.      The PDO of the Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP) were: (a) to improve the
quality of Rwanda's paved road network and (b) to generate sustained employment in rural areas
through road maintenance works. The project aimed to improve road quality by: (i) restoring parts
of major road corridors to good conditions through rehabilitation works on the Kigali-Ruhengeri
road and maintenance works on about 50 percent of the paved road network of 1,100 km; (ii)
establishing a system for sustainable financing of road maintenance; and (iii) improving
management and operational efficiency in sector institutions through the establishment of
management information and statistical systems, and targeted training.

7.      The key performance indicators as specified in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
have been categorized into transport sector indicators and project indicators. The transport sector
indicator was the average transport time between Kigali and the ports and cities of Mombasa, Dar
es Salam and Goma. This indicator was based on the higher transport objective in support of
Rwanda’s EDPRS. The key project indicators were: (i) improvements in the road network
condition, (ii) permanent employment generation, and (iii) improved effectiveness and efficiency
of use of public resources.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

8.      Following the Mid-Term Review (MTR) and Additional Financing (AF) the project was
restructured. The original PDO remained unchanged. The Results Framework (RF) was updated
and revised as part of the restructuring to reflect the changes. The RF and Performance Monitoring
Indicators (PMI) was revised and the following indicators were included: (i) functional RTDA, (ii)
adopted formulae for disaggregation of road maintenance funds amongst executing agencies, (iii)

                                                  2
completed Road and Bridge Designs and Standard Specifications manuals, (iv) share of rural
population with access to an all-season road (core indicator), and (v) direct project beneficiaries
(core indicator). The changes mainly aimed to simplify the indicators better aligned with actual
data collected, and targets that were achievable and made sense to work on under the existing state
of transport sector in Rwanda.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.      The key beneficiaries to the project were identified as the GoR, the road industry (private
sector), national and international road travelers, agricultural producers, local businesses, roadside
communities and road workers.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.   The project consisted of four (4) components, namely: (i) Paved Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance; (ii) Sector Governance and Policy Support; (iii) Sector Analysis and Planning
Support; and (iv) Project and Program Management Support.

11.     Component 1: Paved Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance (US$62.4 million): This
component supported the rehabilitation of approximately 83 km of Kigali-Ruhengeri section of
Kigali-Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road and maintenance of approximately 550 kilometers of paved trunk
roads, including sections of Gatuna-Bugarama, Gitarama-Kibuye, and Rusumo-Gisenyi roads,
through execution of multi-year output-based management contracts.

12.     Component 2: Sector Governance and Policy Support (US$2.6 million): This
component supported Sector Governance improvement through the provision of technical
assistance to the RA, following its establishment, the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF), the Vehicle
Technical Inspection Center, the Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority, and the National Public
Transport Agency, in support of preparation and implementation oversight of long-term
performance agreements that were concluded between these agencies and the government. It also
supported Transport Policy Implementation through (i) Stakeholder workshops and seminars
relating to transport policy implementation and regional transport cooperation; (ii) Provision of
technical assistance to the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA) in support of program
development and carrying out of strategic studies for transport policy implementation; (iii)
Provision of technical assistance in support of development and implementation of road safety
action plan, improvement of data collection, and establishment of accident database in the Planning,
Policy, and Capacity Building Unit; (iv) Development and implementation of transport sector
HIV/AIDS prevention strategy; and (v) Provision of technical assistance in support of
establishment and training of LCAs of roadside dwellers in labor-intensive road maintenance.

13.     Component 3: Sector Analysis and Planning Support (US$2.2 million): Transport

and Capacity Building Unit (PPCBU) in support of establishment of transport database and
monitoring and evaluation systems relating to Project and Program performance, transport costs,
transport industry standards, and other transport performance indicators; (ii) Transport data
collection for planning and monitoring systems; (iii) Acquisition of information technology

                                                  3
equipment and materials for monitoring and evaluation systems established under Component 3(a)
(i) above. Capacity Building (i) Financing of the services of an international university and a local
university to provide long-term in-country training to professional staff of the road agencies, local
entrepreneurs, and unemployed graduates, leading to Masters’ degrees in Road Engineering and
Management and Transport Economics and Planning; (ii) Financing of a local consultant to
provide management support to the in country training program.

14.     Component 4: Project and Program Management Support (US$1.2 million): (i)
Financing of Operating Costs of the Planning, Policies and Capacity Building Unit, the Transport
Projects and Program Management Unit (CGPT), and the Road Agency (RA) following its
establishment; (ii) Provision of technical assistance to Infrastructure Planning, Policies and
Capacity Building Unit, Transport Projects Management Unit, RA following its establishment,
and the Road Maintenance Fund in support of Project and Program technical audits; (iii) Provision

Projects Management Unit, RA following its establishment, and Road Maintenance Fund in
support of Project financial audits; (iv) Training of Project and Program management staff in
accounting and financial management, procurement and contract management, and budget
preparation and disbursement.

1.6 Revised Components

15.    The revised project components comprised the following:

16.    Component 1: Paved Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance: The maintenance of the
Huye-Kitabi road was dropped and was rehabilitated through other financing arrangements
undertaken by the GoR.

17.    Component 2: Sector Governance and Policy Support. Remained unchanged

18.     Component 3: Sector Analysis and Planning Support: The additional activities
included: (i) human capital development through training on road management tools; (ii)
preparation of design and specifications manuals for roads and bridges; (iii) introduction and
customization of road management tools including Roads Economic Decision Model (RED),
Highway Development and Management Model (HDM) and Road Network Evaluation Tool; (iv)
provision of technical assistance (TA), training and Information Technology equipment for RMF,
was transferred from Component 4 to Component 3, while RMF was expected to conduct technical
audit of maintenance contracts from its own resources.

19.     Component 4: Project and Program Management Support: (i) Provision of technical
assistance (TA), training and Information Technology equipment for RMF, was transferred from
Component 4 to Component 3, while RMF was expected to conduct technical audit of maintenance
contracts from its own resources.




                                                 4
1.7 Other significant changes

20.      Additional Financing (AF): The GoR, by a letter dated October 18, 2010, requested the
World Bank for an Additional Financing (AF) to cover the financing gap due to cost overrun of
the contract for the rehabilitation of Kigali-Ruhengeri road. The Bank provided an additional
credit in the amount of US$11 million to help finance the costs associated with the financing gap.
The AF was approved by the Bank on June 16, 2011, and became effective on December 20, 2011.
The main changes to the project brought about by the AF were: (i) crystallization of activities
carried out as part of the strategic studies and design of limited feeder roads under Component 3;
(ii) reallocation of grant proceeds among components; (iii) vesting in the RTDA the responsibility
of implementation of the project; (iv) extension of the closing date of the IDA Grant and the ACGF
Grant; and (v) modification of the arrangement for handling the GoR’s contribution to the project.

21.    Project Restructuring: The project was restructured five times. The first restructuring
was conducted in order to reallocate percentage of expenditure from ACGF Grant for Part 1(b)
and remove the withdrawal condition for Part 1 (b). An amendment to the ACGF Grant Agreement
was done on September 10, 2008 to reflect these changes.

22.     The second restructuring was prompted by provision of AF by the Bank. The closing date
of the original IDA Grant (IDA-H3310) and ACGF Grant (TF090451) was extended from June
30, 2012 to December 31, 2013 and October 31, 2013 respectively, and it was approved on June
16, 2011. This was done in order to: (i) allow the maintenance activities under the project to be
completed; (ii) cater for defects liability period and unexpected extension of the construction time
because of rains and emergency works. The third restructuring was conducted on July 8, 2011for
the amendment and restatement of the Financing Agreement (FA) to provide the AF and reflect
extension of the project closing date.

23.     The fourth restructuring was done to enable completion of all the remaining ongoing
activities and thus achieving the PDO. A no-cost time extension of the closing date of the original
project and AF for one year was approved on December 12, 2013 from December 31, 2014 to
December 31, 2014, making a cumulative extension of 30 months. This was a Level Two
restructuring, an approval in Principle for the request to extend the closing date was received on
October 2, 2013.       The restructuring also included revision to the results framework and
reallocation of funds. The fifth and final restructuring was conducted on December 16, 2013 in
order to amend the amended and restated FA to reflect the above changes.

24.     Implementation Arrangements: MININFRA had the overall responsibility of the project
during design and implementation. The responsibility of project implementation including all
fiduciary aspects was transferred to the Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA) following
the AF. The RTDA became operational in 2011 and took over the functions of MININFRA and
was assigned the responsibility of implementing the TSDP and other road projects and specifically
performed the functions of an RA. Following the change in the implementation arrangement, a
Subsidiary Agreement between GoR and the RTDA, and a Project Agreement between IDA and
the RTDA was signed.




                                                 5
25.   Final Project Cost: The final project cost at completion was US$83.54 million comprising
US$38 million spent under ACGF Grant, US$20.87 million spent under IDA Grant/Credit and
US$24 million GoR financing. This represents an overall increase of 21 percent at completion
compared to the appraisal estimate of US$ 69 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis

26.     The TSDP drew lessons from recommendations by the IEG review and the Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) of the previous Bank-supported operation (Rwanda
Transport Sector Project -RTSP 2002), both of which emphasized the need for future IDA support
to help rebuild Rwanda’s depleted institutional and road maintenance capacities following the
conflict in 1994. Both assessments rated past IDA operations in the transport sector as satisfactory
but concluded that they had been complex and had failed to accommodate the government’s
financial and human absorption capacity. The TSDP was also prepared with the recommendation
from the RTSP ICR of the increased use of labor-based construction methods as a means of
promoting employment, particularly in rural areas.

27.     The project design was also influenced by the growing focus on governance and workable
public-private partnership arrangements in infrastructure maintenance and development. It out
sourced road maintenance to the private sector and road-side communities based on experiences
in Rwanda’s immediate neighbors Burundi and Uganda. The design drew lessons from best
practices for second generation road funds and successful privatizations of road maintenance
works in a good number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The project design included a sub-
component on governance improvement through which autonomous government agencies charged
with the management of sector operations were rendered more accountable and result-oriented by
the enforcement of performance agreements. This is consistent with the Africa Action Plan.

Project Preparation

28.     The project was prepared in such a way that MININFRA had the overall responsibility for
implementation through the PPCBU, the CGPT, the RMF and the RA. The overall responsibility
for road and transport policy in Rwanda was devolved to the MININFRA through the PPCBU
which was also responsible for transport related regulation enforcement. The RMF was responsible
for road maintenance financing. It programed, mobilized and disbursed funds for road
maintenance. The RA was responsible for road transport investments and maintenance policy
implementation. It also programed and oversaw the execution of road transport contracts. The
CGPT was established in 2005 to fill a missing gap within MININFRA in project management.
The PPCBU was responsible for the technical implementation of Components 1, 2(b) and 3 of the
project until such a time as the RA would be established. The CGPT was responsible for the
implementation of components 2(a) and 4 of the project, financial management under Parts 1(a),
2, 3, and 4 of the Project, and procurement for the entire project.



                                                 6
Assessment of the Project Design

29.     The project design was Satisfactory. The TSDP was designed to support Rwanda’s Vision
2020 with a fundamental concept of restoring and improving the country’s core economic
infrastructure. The EDPRS which is the medium term development strategy of Vision 2020, strived
for the transformation of Rwanda from an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based
service economy by 2020. The transport sector was identified as a mechanism for rural
development and regional integration, hence the relevance of the TSDP.

30.     This project was intended to be part of a five-year transport improvement program which
was integral to the government’s EDPRS. The objectives of the program as defined in the
government’s transport policy matrix were to: (i) improve transport links internally and
internationally; (ii) reduce and keep transport costs under control; (iii) improve the institutional
framework and strengthen the capacity of partners involved in the sector; (iv) improve road safety;
(v) achieve sustainable financing of road maintenance; and (vi) sustain the preservation of roads
rehabilitated or constructed.

31.     To achieve growth targets that would help increase the standards of living of the population
and therefore reduce poverty, the government focused on identifying key sources of growth and
competitiveness. In this regard, the objective for transport was to ease related constraints that affect
growth. The TSDP contributed to the achievement of this objective by improving the quality of
key international and domestic road corridors as part of a wider strategy to reduce transit times for
tradable goods and to improve regional connectivity.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

32.    The GoR was fully involved during design, preparation and implementation of the project.
Key project staff took part right from design of the TSDP and after creation of the RA,
implementation continued despite a number of challenges. The GoR through the RMF contributed
about US$24 million counterpart funds towards the project. A detailed discussion of the GoR
commitment is discussed under Government Performance in Section 5.2.

Assessment of Risks

33.     The project risk assessment and classification was carried out during preparation and the
overall risk of project was rated high given the post conflict environment. The key risks identified
are summarized as follows: (i) Political inertia and lack of political commitment which could have
undermined or delayed the implementation of the policy arrangements targeted by the project; (ii)
Counterpart funding shortfalls given the budgetary constraints in the country; (iii) War in the Great
Lakes Region which could have disrupted project execution or compromised government
financing; (iv) Weak and unstable institutional setup; (v) Weak fiduciary capacity; (vi) Weak
Technical Implementation Capacity of the agencies envisaged to implement the project; (vii) Cost
overruns in civil works contracts; and (viii) Weak Financial Management Capacity of the RMF.

34.    The risk mitigations measures were as follows:: (i) preparation of a new transport policy
and draft legislation intended to support the reforms targeted by the project; (ii) counterpart

                                                   7
contribution derived from RMF’s steady income of fuel levy and the government ensured that
agreed amounts of the resources raised locally were maintained in a separate project account
managed independently by the RMF; (iii) substantial provision for on-the-job training of project
staff in areas relating to its implementation; (iv) the establishment of performance agreements
between the government and the three sector agencies (RTDA, RMF and MININFRA; (v)
recruitment of professional and experienced staff early enough so that they could receive
appropriate training and gain exposure to Bank fiduciary and safeguard processes prior to project
effectiveness. (vi) establishment of the RA; (vii) including specific requirements in the
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which the government concluded with donors as part of a
programmatic approach; (viii) recruitment of an environmental specialist and a procurement team
to reinforce the team in CGPT, and the RA when established; (ix) limiting works to the
improvement of the existing right-of-way, and in addition, the unit costs recommended under the
project were derived from similar road works conducted prior to preparation of TSDP; and (x) the
capacity of the RMF was strengthened under EC support, including ad hoc advisory support from
outside consultants, to better prepare it for project start-up. The project’s overall risk rating was
assessed as “Moderate”.

35.   Quality at Entry: The project’s quality at entry was not reviewed by the Quality

36.     The project was approved by the Bank on August 28, 2007 for an IDA Grant amount of
US$11 million. The Financing/Grant Agreements (FA/GA) were signed on October 5, 2007 for
both IDA-H3310 and TF-90451 and the project became effective immediately for TF-90451 and
on December 28, 2007 for IDA-H3310. The project original closing date was June 30, 2012. The
FA was amended and restated on July 8, 2011 to provide additional financial assistance (Credit
IDA-49680) in support of the project. The amended and restated financing agreement became
effective on December 20, 2011 with a closing date of December 31, 2013. Furthermore, at the
request of the GoR in a letter dated September 13, 2013 requesting for extension of the closing
date, reallocation of the proceeds of the financing and changes in its project activities, an
amendment to the amended and restated agreement was made on December 16, 2013 with the
closing date to the agreement extended to December 31, 2014.

37.    Mid-Term Review (MTR): The MTR of the project was conducted on October 25, 2010.
During the MTR a revised funds requirement for each activity was conducted and this was
considered as the basis for the reallocation among components under the AF.

38.      Additional Financing and Project Restructuring: These are covered under section 1.7
of this ICR.

39.     Engagement of Local Community Associations (LCAs): MININFRA through the TSDP
recruited two local consulting firms, in 2008, to set-up local community associations (LCAs) that
were assigned the responsibility of routine maintenance of the national road network. This was at
the same time meant to empower them economically and socially to alleviate mass poverty and
health risks in rural areas. In addition, the selected firms were given the task of developing a routine

                                                   8
maintenance manual in Kinyarwanda, 1 an HIV/AIDS sensitization pocket book, a typical
maintenance contract between districts and LCAs, a typical legal statute for the LCAs and the
preparation of a list of LCAs/roads to include in the pilot phase of the routine maintenance works.
The achievements realized through the use of LCAs is further discussed in Annex 2, Output by
Components.

40.     Technical Audit: A technical audit team engaged by the project conducted investigations
to identify failures on the Kigali-Ruhengeri road and remedial measures. The defects/failures
observed by the technical audit included: (i) rutting on steep gradients; (ii) major slides caused by
heavy rain; and (iii) longitudinal and transversal cracks on specific locations on embankments
along relatively flatter areas of the road and frequently affected by water infiltration. The
recommendations included maintenance measures that would take the road to its design life time,
including multi-year maintenance contracts, and long term suggestions that called for a complete
redesign of the road to upgrade it to stand the challenges of slides, embankment retrofitting to
stand the water infiltration problems, and coup-up with the fast increasing traffic level.

2.2.1 Major Factors Affecting Project Implementation

41.      Slow Implementation and RTDA Capacity Building: Implementation of the project was
initially hampered by the low capacity of MININFRA in terms of procurement, and contract
management. The quality of documents submitted was often weak and MININFRA did not
systematically follow up on ongoing contracts. In 2011, the RTDA was established with support
from the TSDP AF. RTDA inherited a backlog of delayed procurement of the consultancy services.
Furthermore, RTDA’s continued weak procurement capacity and its inability to hire procurement
capacity initially continued to hamper implementation progress. A procurement specialist was
finally engaged in 2013 to assist with the remaining procurement activities and to provide on-the-
job training.

42.     Retention of Trained Staff by RTDA: A number of staff moved from the RTDA to other
public and private agencies in search for better paying jobs. RTDA has completed a Human
Resource Development exercise that identified its short and long term developmental needs in-
terms of staffing policies, training, and retention of the enhanced capacity. A Special Project
Implementation Unit (SPIU) has been established by RTDA under its restructuring efforts to
support all externally-funded projects. The establishment of the SPIU was aimed at improving
efficiency of RTDA by attracting experienced staff with improved remuneration packages. It is
anticipated that these measures may help RTDA sustain and retain enhanced capacity.

43.     Cost Overrun: During the course of implementation of the project, the GoR requested to
widen the Kigali-Ruhengeri road from 6.2m to 7m, to be within the standards of trunk roads in the
region. The widening of the road and inflation due to delayed implementation, partly resulted to
cost overrun. There was US$7.78 million financing gap for the road contract that was realized in
December 2009 during the signing of the works contract, and for contingencies. The total contract



1
    Kinyarwanda is the local language spoken in Rwanda.


                                                 9
price was US$45.78 million for both works and supervision against US$38 million that was
earmarked for this activity at appraisal. The additional cost was related to unforeseen and extra
works, including slide protection, raising the level of side drains, provision of culverts, sealing and
widening of shoulders. Other causes of the cost overrun included indirect cost increases from
inflation and exchange rate fluctuations and studies to support the preparation of future projects.

44.     Price Escalation: The technical audit had recommended re-evaluation of contractor’s final
price adjustment invoice, which had already been approved by the supervision consultant. The
expert’s review was completed in May 2014 by an individual consultant, who recommended to
reduce the final invoice from US$4.14 million to US$2.61 million. On August 13, 2014, the
contractor responded to the revision with additional information and a claim that the review had
misinterpreted the contract and miscalculated the price adjustment. The contractor claimed that
actual invoice amount was Rwanda Francs (RWF) 2.74 billion (US$4.81 million). Based on the
additional information provided, the claim was re-analyzed and a re-calculation resulted in RWF
2.11 billion (US$ 3.71 million), which was settled before closure of the project.

45.     Landslides: Field inspections carried out during the preparation of the Environmental and
Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) revealed that landslides/rockslides from the top of the hills
would be a potential problem as a result of the geo-technical nature of the areas through which the
Kigali-Ruhengeri road passes. Major slides occurred along the completed road and RTDA carried
out repair works. Slides could still be a major challenge along the rehabilitated road. The landslide
problem is a natural challenge that has to be dealt with through the programmed maintenance
budget. RTDA conducted cleaning of culverts, maintained slide protection structures, and engaged
a contractor to carry out slide clearing and repair works during the rainy seasons.

46.     The RTDA has recruited an international consulting firm after closure of the project to
prepare a post-construction maintenance program for the Kigali-Ruhengeri road as recommended
by the independent technical auditor in 2013. The maintenance program covers works such as: (i)
slope stabilization to prevent landslides from occurring; (ii) proper drainage to protect the road
pavement structure; (iii) increase of road safety measures; and (iv) correct defects, if any.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

47.     M&E Design: The project was designed in such a way that data collection to support the
monitoring and results assessment of the project were to be conducted in the form of surveys at
three intervals during implementation that is, at the beginning of the project, prior to the MTR, and
in the last year of the project. The first survey together with data collected during project
preparation, were to improve the baseline data for the project. The second survey was to facilitate
the MTR, while the third was to provide material for end-of-project assessments, including for the
ICR. It was expected that the three surveys would also have generated data required to complete
the sector’s medium and long-term financial and physical indicators. In light of this, the project
also included provision to help establish an M&E system within MININFRA. Given the weak
capacity of MININFRA at the time of project preparation, it was agreed that data collection was
to be administered by external consultants, notably a technical auditor whose primary role was to
preemptively identify implementation issues and propose solutions. The project’s Results



                                                  10
Framework, as laid out in the PAD was adequate for monitoring progress towards achievement of
the PDO.

48.     M&E Implementation: Road Database has been established and condition data collection
was regular during project implementation. The progress of the project was monitored monthly,
quarterly and yearly by a team comprising members of RTDA, PPCBU, CGPT, technical auditors
and consultants. During implementation the RF and PMI for the project was updated and revised
as discussed in Section 1.3. The M&E performance rating of the project has been Satisfactory.

49.    M&E Utilization: The road database that has been established including the data is being
used by the RTDA in the planning, programming and management of interventions on the national
road network.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

50.    Environmental and Social Safeguards: No negative long term environmental and social
impacts were foreseen with regard to this project. The project rating remained Category B as
assessed during appraisal. An Environmental Specialist position was added to the project
management team, within the implementing institution to monitor potentially adverse
environmental and social impacts of project operations. The specialist was deployed and monitored
environmental and social safeguards compliance for all road investment operations in the sector.
The Contractor observed the Environment and Social Management Plan (ESMP) requirements and
the implementing institution fulfilled its oversight responsibilities.

51.     OP 4.11 (Physical Cultural Resources) was triggered for this project following the AF; the
Environmental Impact Assessment/ESMP for the Kigali-Ruhengeri road was updated to ensure
that the civil works carefully avoided existing cultural assets, such as burial and archeological sites.
The widening of the road pavement from 6.2 to 7 meters was contained within the existing road
width and right of way, and did not involve changes to the original ESIA. The rehabilitation and
maintenance works were carried out along existing road alignment and there were no major social
and environmental impacts and the AF did not involve land acquisition/involuntary resettlement
(as was the case in the original project). Existing borrow/quarry sites were used for sourcing
materials.

52.    Guidelines for “chance finds” procedure was integrated into the contracts for construction
and road maintenance consultants. These included development of a cultural property management
plan if physical cultural resources were found, in accordance with the GoR’s policies and
guidelines. This updated document was disclosed in country as well as in the InfoShop on April
21, 2011.

53.     The ESIA prepared was disclosed in-country on January 15, 2006 and submitted to
InfoShop on January 14, 2006. The overall safeguards compliance rating for the project is
Satisfactory. Implementation of the ESMP was Satisfactory. The rehabilitation of the Kigali-
Ruhengeri road did not cause any negative impacts, except for naturally occurring landslides
observed along some sections of the road. All quarry sites were restored and replanting of
vegetation was done. RTDA conducted an Environmental and Social Safeguards Audit. Overall,

                                                  11
the Environmental Audit was conducted quite well and it did not discover any major issues during
project implementation. However, it did not address some points that were stated in the audit
objectives. The report could have been improved by a more detailed discussion on the actual
application on the ESIA such as whether the document was relevant to the project scope and
whether there was a dedicated staff on the contractor site overseeing the environmental issues.

Fiduciary

54.     Financial Management: An assessment of the financial management arrangements for
the project was conducted at appraisal to determine whether the existing arrangements were
suitable for the project and to determine whether the CGPT and the RMF had acceptable financial
management arrangements. The financial management assessment identified a moderate risk for
the project.

55.     During implementation, the auditors expressed unqualified audit opinions of the financial
statements for the project. They also expressed an unqualified opinion that the designated account
statements presented a true and fair view in accordance with IDA and ACGF Grants requirements.
The project continued to prepare and submit satisfactory unaudited interim financial statements.
The Financial Management (FM) arrangements of the RTDA met the Bank’s minimum
requirements for project FM as per OP/BP 10.02. The overall financial management ISR rating for
the project was classified as Moderately Satisfactory. The overall financial management risk for
the project was Substantial.

56.     Procurement: The procurement activities of the project were initially carried out by CGPT
and the PPCBU was responsible for the technical aspects of procurement and contract management.
The National Tender Board (NTB) was also involved in project procurement and played roles in
national procurement by directing the procurement process for contracts above a certain threshold
and participated in the review of contracts below it. An assessment of the capacity of the
implementing agencies involved in procurement for the project was carried out at appraisal and
reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the
project’s staff responsible for procurement and MININFRA’s relevant central unit for
administration and finance. The overall project risk for procurement was high at appraisal. All
aspects of procurement procedures were managed professionally during implementation. A
procurement TA supported the project within the RTDA from 2013 to the close of the project. The
overall procurement performance rating for the project was classified as Moderately Satisfactory.

57.     Procurement and Anti-Corruption Guidelines: The original grant agreements (Grant
H331-RW and TF090451) were amended to include the January 2011 procurement guidelines.
The Recipient, through the implementing entities, carried out procurement activities in accordance
with Section I of the “Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” published
by the World Bank in January 2011 (“Procurement Guidelines”), in the case of goods and works,
and Sections I and IV of the “Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers” published by the World Bank in January 2011 (“Consultant Guidelines”) in the
case of consultants’ services. Review by the World Bank of Procurement Decisions was carried
out in accordance with the new guidelines. The original grant agreements were also amended to
include anti-corruption guidelines as follows: The Recipient, through the implementing entities,

                                               12
shall carry out project activities in accordance with the provisions of Article II of the Standard
Conditions, the “Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects
Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants”, dated October 15, 2006 and Revised in
January, 2011.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

58.     Given the strong need to maximize connectivity to rural areas, raise agriculture production
and increase commercialization by the GoR, a new project funded by the Bank, the Rwanda Feeder
Roads Development Project (FRDP), for a credit amount of US$45 million was prepared, approved
by the Bank on March 21, 2014, and became effective on June 19, 2014. The new project continues
to build upon the achievements made under this project with an objective to enhance all season
road connectivity agricultural market centers in selected districts. It contributes to the overarching
goal of increasing agricultural production, ensuring food security, and enhancing agricultural
marketing.

59.     The FRDP is building on the good experience under the TSDP of involving local
communities and engaging micro-enterprises, which also use local population in road maintenance.
The project will support training and organization of LCAs and promote community based multi-
year output based maintenance contracts. The project will also build on the experience of the multi-
year maintenance contracts under TSDP by applying such methods to the feeder road contracts in
a form of construction including multi-year maintenance contracts in hilly terrain roads and back
to back construction and maintenance contracts on flatter roads, and when the source of funding
is separate for the construction and the maintenance.

60.    A Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for Feeder Roads has been established at the Bank.
The Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have signed an
Administration Agreement (AA) and USAID has contributed US$50 million to the MDTF to
stimulate the large, multi-donor, coordinated effort necessary to undertake responsible feeder road
development in Rwanda. The Bank will administer the funds on behalf of the USAID and other
such contributing donors to prepare projects with the GoR using separate Grant Financing
Agreements following Bank procedures.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

61.     The relevance of the project development objective is Substantial. 86.6 percent of the
population of Rwanda lives in rural areas; however transport connectivity to the domestic, regional
and global markets remains a challenge. Rwanda has made significant progress in maintaining a
stable macroeconomic framework, growth however is suffering from weak rural transport
infrastructure in general. The project design incorporated the above key objectives and the
completion of the project indicated that the relevance of design remained high. The project
objectives remained relevant to the ongoing Country Partnership Framework (CPF) which was
aligned to the government vision and strategy under the EDPRS 2 approved in March 2013. This
therefore shows a clear linkage between the project objectives, GoR’s vision and the CPF.

                                                 13
62.     The relevance of project design is Substantial. The project was designed in a simple and
straight forward manner and included global priorities such as road safety and combating
HIV/AIDS. The road safety management is relevant to the United Nations (UN) Decade of Action
for Road Safety Improvement. Combating HIV/AIDS through creating awareness and public
campaigns are as well relevant to the Millennium Development Goals.

63.     The relevance of implementation is Substantial. The implementation of the project
contributed to the improvement of the paved road network and provided reliable access. The
Engagement of LCAs for the maintenance of the national road network provided employment
opportunities for road side communities. The project provided support towards the formation of
the RTDA which is aimed at ensuring sustainable management and monitoring of transport sector
activities. The project also contributed to the higher level objectives of NIS and ISN (2006) by
placing transport investments among the key priorities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

64.     The achievement of the PDO is rated Substantial. The PDO of providing improved
condition of the paved road network and generating sustained employment in the rural areas
through road maintenance works has been substantially achieved. About 62 percent of the paved
roads network continues to remain in good condition, and the project has surpassed its intended
original target of 50 percent. The completion of the Kigali to Ruhengeri road rehabilitation has
contributed to the objective of providing reliable access to about 2.1 million people living along
this main regional corridor. A Transport Sector Master Plan has been prepared. A master’s
program in transportation studies has been successfully delivered. The engagement of LCAs for
the maintenance of the national road network has helped to provide employment opportunities for
3,041 inhabitants along the roads. A detailed implementation overview of the four components
under the TSDP is presented in Annex 2, Output by Components.

65.     The project has achieved more than the PDO. Given the high agricultural productivity and
tourism potential of the project influence area, the rehabilitation of the Kigali-Ruhengeri road has
contributed to agricultural development through improved utilization of land and hence output as
well as tourism through provision of quick and reliable access to national parks. It has also boosted
trade both within the territory of Rwanda and with neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). The improved road network condition now generate time and cost savings to national and
international road travelers, as well as additional savings to agricultural producers and local
businesses relying on road transport. As demonstrated by the economic analysis, the project has
resulted to increased traffic, hence rise in volumes of trade.

66.      Furthermore, a beneficiary assessment survey (Annex 5) conducted after implementation
of the project reveals that there has been significant improvement in wealth of the population in
the project area, increase in number of education facilities and enrolment rates, increase in price
of land and housing, and improved access to credit facilities and other employment opportunities
inter alia.




                                                 14
3.3 Efficiency

67.    The efficiency of the project is rated Modest. At appraisal a cost benefit analysis was
conducted for the Kigali - Ruhengeri road rehabilitation works, using the Vehicle Operating Cost
(VOC) model which is based on the HDM and which calculated VOCs based on the road roughness
and other technical parameters. The costs were discounted at a rate of 12 percent, the net present
value (NPV) was RWF 4,314 million; and the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) was 13.5
percent, which confirmed viability of the original planned investment.

68.     The comparison of economic appraisal between pre and post project implementation
analyses that despite the increase of project cost by 28.9% due to widening of the road, actual
economic benefits after the implementation of the project are much higher in comparison to the
predicted economic benefits at appraisal time in 2007. However, there were shortcomings despite
achievement of the economic benefits and the Bank had to provide AF to cover financing gap and
the project closing date was extended by thirty (30) months. Details of the economic analysis are
presented in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

69.     With relevance of rated Substantial, achievement of the PDO substantial and efficiency
modest, the overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory. As per guidance of the ICR review
meeting, this evaluation does not merit a disbursement-weighted split rating for the PDO. This
decision is based primarily on the fact that the PDO remained the same throughout the project.
Further, only one indicator target was revised downward and the ICR does not rely on this indicator
for the outcome rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.     Poverty Impacts: The development of the road network greatly enhanced the local
economy and supported overall poverty reduction through creating job opportunities, increased
access to agricultural markets, emergence and development of small local markets, establishment
of businesses and promotion of tourism.

71.    Gender Aspects: The project benefited females living along the rehabilitated road
influence area. Out of the 2.1 million living along the Kigali-Ruhengeri road, 48.5 percent are
females implying that the project positively impacted on their lives as well.

72.     Social Development: The rehabilitation and maintenance works were carried out along
existing road alignments and there were no negative impacts on human settlements and the AF did
not involve land acquisition/involuntary resettlement. The project provided improved access to
health centers, schools, markets, and enabled the development of business activities along the
corridors. Road workers and road side communities also benefited from anti Human
Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune-deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) campaign
implemented by the project.

                                                15
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.     The project contributed to the long term in-country training in transportation studies
delivered by Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) that was completed in December
2014. Overall 52 students completed master’s degree with 30 students in Highway Engineering
and Management and 22 students in Transportation Studies. These graduates are now rendering
valuable services to both the public and private sector. The project facilitated the establishment of
Roads Act (2011) and the RTDA Act (2011). RTDA is lead agency responsible for
implementation of transport infrastructure projects and is now fully operational with adequate
number of professional staff. The project also contributed to the establishment and training of
LCAs in maintenance of the national road network through the provision of technical assistance.
The LCAs will continue to provide the longer-term road maintenance. The road maintenance has
also restored and developed private sector capacity in the national road industry.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Not Applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

74.   Below are the key findings of beneficiary assessment surveys, with detailed presented in
Annex 5:

(a)    The travel characteristics of all categories of motor vehicles in the zone of influence of the
       project area were increased whereas travel times and number of days lost due to bad
       weather decreased;
(b)    The key parameters related to agricultural activities have shown remarkable improvement
       after the implementation of the project;
(c)    The key non-agricultural activities and both on and off farm employment per household
       achieved significant improvement;
(d)    Significant increase of overall wealth in the project area has occurred in the order of more
       than 100 percent;
(e)    Both price of land and housing have increased significantly ranging from 95 to 250 percent
       providing indirect benefits of transport improvements to the people in the project areas;
(f)    Significant improvements in access to credit and employment opportunities have taken
       place in the range of 225 to 422 percent;
(g)    Numbers of schools, student enrollment rate, number of teachers and regular available
       supply for school have improved. Meanwhile, drop-out rates for both male and female
       students have decreased significantly;
(h)    Effectiveness and efficiency of public resources, capacity for planning, budgeting and
       financing have improved significantly;
(i)    Majority of the respondents did not totally agree that TSDP had improved participation of
       private sectors and timely implementation of programs;
(j)    Most of the students of the postgraduate training programs were of the view that the
       program was successful. In regard to different components of the program, they opined
       that on balance overall courses were adequate, appropriate and useful for practical life; and

                                                 16
(k)    The project was successful in ensuring better statistics for transport strategy and policy
       making, improving continuous M&E of road transport programs and projects, improving
       information sharing and effectiveness of M&E system and overall Management
       Information System (MIS) for the road transport sector of Rwanda

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

75.     The risk to the development outcomes is considered Moderate. The project was initially
implemented by MININFRA who had low capacity in procurement and contract management and
often experienced delays in procurement. In 2011, under the AF support the RTDA was established
and has taken over responsibility of transport infrastructure development in the country. RTDA
continued to show weak procurement capacity and was not able to hire procurement support, which
hampered progress of the activities under the project. More so, the RTDA is facing the challenge
of retaining trained staff. In order to counter the issue of staff retention, RTDA has identified its
short and long term development needs in terms of staffing policies, training and retention of
enhanced capacity. An SPIU has been established to support all externally-funded projects and it
is anticipated that these measures may help RTDA to sustain and retain enhanced capacity. The
RMF successfully provided over US$24 million of government funding towards the maintenance
of the paved road network under the project. The project has created cooperatives of roadside
dwellers (LCAs) to carryout routine maintenance works. Funding of road maintenance will
continue to be provided by the RMF through districts and the LCAs will be engaged for regular
routine maintenance. Subsequent to the adoption of the law on axle load control, the traffic on the
whole Rwanda paved road network will be subject to weight controls to avoid early defects
resulting to overload.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

76.     The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
The project design was highly relevant to the development priorities of the country. The project
objectives and design were also supported by the CPF and aligned to the government vision 2020
and strategy under the EDPRS 2. The project design included the development of institutional and
road maintenance capacities and relevant global priorities such as road safety and combating
HIV/AIDS. There were adequate fiduciary and implementation arrangements provided at project
design, given the weak institutional capacity at project preparation as it was a post conflict
environment. The project design provided for the establishment of FM systems as a condition of
effectiveness and the recruitment of environmental specialist and procurement team to reinforce
the team at the CGPT. Social and environmental assessments were carried to ensure no livelihood
and persons were affected as a result of implementation of the project. M&E arrangements were
put in place including hiring the services of external consultants to identify implementation issues
and propose solutions.




                                                 17
77.     The overall project risk at appraisal was assessed as high and the Bank put in place adequate
mitigation measures including institutional and capacity building activities, the establishment of a
RTDA, project management support by external consultants and monitoring of projects by
international firms including an independent technical auditor.

78.    However, despite the effort of the Bank to provide adequate support at preparation, the
implementation challenges faced by the project, such as landslides, could largely be attributed to
inadequate geological investigations ex ante leading to suboptimal designs. Low impact, high
frequency geo-hazards of this type are not unique to Rwanda. Further support as to how to identify
and mitigate the risks, could have been provided to the implementing agency, , particularly in the
design stage, could have negated some of the procurement and other implementation challenges
which together resulted in significant time and cost overrun for the civil works.

(b) Quality of Supervision

79.     The Bank performance in ensuring quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory. The
Bank team continuously provided technical, fiduciary and safeguards support to the client during
project implementation. Regular implementation support missions were conducted and key issues
were often highlighted with appropriate follow-up actions. The adequacy of the implementation
support provide by the Bank team was clearly indicated by contracting of all the activities planned
both under the original project and the AF and disbursement of 98 percent of the project funds.
The intensive support from the Bank team resulted in satisfactory achievement of the PDO.

80.    Substantial procurement delays at start of the project resulted in generalized overall delays
in project time table. The Bank team was responsive and subsequently exerted extra effort to
improve procurement performance of the project which pushed up disbursement ratio. There was
increased project supervision by the Bank, and the Bank team commissioned external consultants
who conducted independent technical and safeguards audits that resulted in improved
implementation performance ratings of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

81.     Given the support provided by the Bank both at entry and implementation of the project
that resulted in satisfactory achievement of the PDO despite the major challenges experienced
during implementation, the overall performance rating for the Bank is assessed as Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

82.    The performance of the government is rated Satisfactory. The GoR was committed to
the project from inception and was fully involved during project design, preparation and
implementation. The project was designed in such that the GoR would finance road maintenance
through the RMF. The GoR committed US$20 million as co-financing to the project during
preparation. By project closure, the RMF had contributed about US$24 million which exceeded

                                                 18
their commitment level during preparation. This was an indication of the government’s strong
commitment in ensuring that the paved road network is in good condition. The GoR also showed
commitment in implementing institutional reforms for better management of the road sector and
enacted the Road Act in 2011. The GoR also established the RTDA in 2011 as an agency
responsible for the development of transport infrastructure projects and is now operational. This
ensured delivery of better transport infrastructure projects in the country.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

83.     The implementation agency performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
Implementation of the project was initially hampered by the limitations in the capacity of
MININFRA in terms of procurement and contract management. RTDA also suffered from
limitations in procurement capacity and was unable to hire appropriate procurement capacity after
its establishment, resulting in delay in procurement and implementation of the project. A
procurement specialist was recruited towards project closure to assist with the remaining
procurement activities and to provide on-the-job training, which led to a marked improvement.
Similarly under financial management there were delays in some instances in submission of audit
reports as well as inaccurate preparation of IFRs at some instances.

84.     Despite the challenges, the project has attained its objectives with improvements in reforms
by the RTDA. The issue of institutional capacity and staff retention was addressed by establishing
an SPIU with the responsibility of implementing project mainly financed by development partners.
The establishment of the SPIU was aimed at improving efficiency of RTDA, by attracting
experienced staff with improved remuneration packages, to reduce staff turnover. The set-up of
SPIU and upgrading the salary scheme, both symbols of the commitment of the GoR, have
attracted new and competent staff. For instance, the procurement personnel has increased from 3
to 9 people including 3 consultants (2 locals and 1 international) and improvement is
significant. The institutional status of the RTDA is attached as Annex 10. By project closure, the
majority of RTDA staff (mostly newly recruited SPIU staff) underwent a procurement and contract
management training for three weeks to build their project management capacity. RTDA still
continues to provide on-job capacity building for procurement staff as well as for the Internal
Tender Committee after closure of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

85.    Despite the commitment of the GoR in the project and substantial achievement of the PDO
outcomes, there were concerns about the limitations in institutional capacity of the RTDA in
financial management and procurement. The overall performance rating for the Borrower is
assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

86.     Donor Engagement with RTDA: Drawing from findings discussed under various sections
in this ICR, it is considered necessary that the Bank and other development partners should
continue providing further institutional support to RTDA, to further improve its capacity and
operational efficiency. Particular areas in need of further support include, financial management,

                                                19
procurement and contract management. Such capacity-building and institution-strengthening
should form an important component of any future projects, with development partners ensuring
that approaches to capacity building are well coordinated on the donor side.

87.     Engagement of LCAs/Job Creation: With already 62 percent of the paved road network
in good condition, the GoR needs to sustain the engagement of LCAs in road maintenance to
ensure that the gains obtained during project implementation are not lost after closure of the project.
Rwanda has successfully implemented the use of LCAs in road maintenance, which is an important
aspect they need to take forward, not only on the paved road network, but also on the unpaved
roads network. The LCAs are currently employed by districts along the national road network to
conduct routine maintenance.

88.     Policy and institutional reforms: The lesson learned from this project is that institutional
reforms conducted in parallel to project implementation causes delays. It is to be learned that
establishment of new institutions require longer time than anticipated for transition, which greatly
impacts on implementation progress, and needs policy consultations and commitment as part of
the preparatory work by both the Bank and government.

89.     Human Resource Capacity Development: Restructuring an agency at the same time of
implementation is challenging. The development of human capital to an acceptable and stable
stage is a continuous process. It is therefore essential for the GoR and development partners to
continue providing support to build RTDA’s capacity as discussed in paragraph 86 above, to
enable them establish sustainable management systems and help reduce the turn-around time for
project implementation. It is also vital to keep the dynamics of human resource development,
inclusive of recruiting and training staff in various disciplines in order to build better capacity for
management of the transport infrastructure. This should not be only applicable to the SPIU but the
entire RTDA structure.

90.     Use of Innovative Longer-term Contracting: Applying innovative and cost saving
methods, including contracting road rehabilitation works under Output and Performance-Based
Road Contracting (OPRC) and/or contracting maintenance works for many years is an option that
should be practiced to ensure continued maintenance of the classified roads. This is crucial in
situations where there are no appropriate measures or adequate financial resources put in place for
road maintenance funding, especially in post conflict countries.

                                Annex 2: Output by Component

1.    The project consisted of four (4) components, namely: (i) Paved Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance; (ii) Sector Governance and Policy Support; (iii) Sector Analysis and Planning
Support; and (iv) Project and Program Management Support.

2.      Component 1 – Paved Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance: Handover of the Kigali
– Ruhengeri road was carried out on September 18, 2012 and defects correction was completed
during the defects liability period. The three multi-year maintenance contracts with a total length
of 277 km were completed in November 2014. MININFRA, under the TSDP, has created a total
of 283 cooperatives of road side dwellers and trained 11,322 rural people to carry out routine
maintenance works since 2008. The engagement of LCAs, local communities and micro
enterprises on 801 km of the national road network has helped to provide employment
opportunities to 3,041 (51.5% men, and 48.5% women) road side dwellers exceeding the target
(3,000). The Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) had deposited in the special project account, over
US$24 million exceeding the commitment of the Government to contribute about US$20 million
for maintenance under TSDP.

3.      Component 2 – Sector Governance and Policy support: Establishment and training of
LCAs; sector level HIV/AIDS prevention strategy; and Preparation of Transport Master Plan have
been completed. Performance agreements between MININFRA and RTDA and MININFRA and
RMF were signed. Provision of technical assistance in support of establishment and training of
LCAs of roadside dwellers in labor-intensive road maintenance was done through use two (2) local
consulting firms. The topics covered in the training were mainly routine maintenance, HIV/AIDS
awareness and the environmental protection. A routine maintenance manual in Kinyarwanda, a
draft legal statute and a typical maintenance contract between districts and cooperatives were
prepared. Terms of reference were also developed to recruit a technical assistance to supervise the
pilot phase of 1,035 km that are part of the national road network. In total 283 cooperatives of road
side dwellers have been created and trained on the whole national classified road network. These
cooperatives are made of a total manpower of 11,322 people and provided employment
opportunities for about 3,041 inhabitants directly under Bank supported maintenance projects.

4.      To sensitize central and local authorities as well as the public on the use of routine
maintenance LCAs, radio programs were prepared and broadcasted. Moreover, MININFRA held
several meetings with the Ministry of Local Government and district authorities and urged them
to use LCAs in their road development programs. Official use of LCAs in routine maintenance
started with the fiscal year of 2012/2013 in some districts of Rwanda. Since 2012, 119 LCAs were
used in conducting routine maintenance in 26 districts on a section of the road network of 2,962
km including components financed by the Bank like the Kagitumba-Kayonza-Rusumo (208 km)
and Gitarama-Kibuye (78km) periodic maintenance.

5.      The LCAs are currently employed by districts along the national road network to conduct
routine maintenance. Funding of their activities is done by the RMF through districts. In addition
to the initial trainings conducted under TSDP, the RTDA regularly organizes refresher courses in
road routine maintenance, environmental protection and protection against HIV/AIDS and sexual
transmitted diseases. These trainings are organised through supervision mission contracts for

                                                 23
different on-going road projects. For instance, such training is underway for the just completed
Kigali-Gatuna road project under the financing of the European Union (EU).

6.     A road database has been established for the RTDA and is being used in the planning,
programming and management of interventions on the national road network that will gradually
gain in efficiency and efficacy with the completion of the national road design manual and
standards.

7.      Component 3 – Sector Analysis and Planning Support: The project contributed to the
long term in-country training in transportation studies delivered by Kigali Institute of Science and
Technology (KIST) that was completed in December 2014. Overall 52 students completed
master’s degree with 30 students in Highway Engineering and Management and 22 students in
Transportation Studies. The feasibility study and ESIA for feeder roads was completed in August
2013. Implementation of the activities, namely: (i) Reviewing the Road Maintenance revenue
allocation formulae; (iii) preparation of roads and bridges design standards and specification, and
introduction of road management tools; (iv) conducting Road Safety audit and preparation of an
action plan; (v) Laboratory equipment for KIST; (vi) Technical Assistance for Price escalation,
and (vii) Procurement training of RTDA staff were completed in December 2014.

8.     Component 4 -Project and Program Management Support: This component was
designed to support: (i) Operating Costs of the Planning, Policies and Capacity Building Unit, the
Transport Projects Management Unit, and the RTDA, and (ii) provision of technical assistance to
the same units and the Road Maintenance Fund in support of Project and Program technical audits.
The issue of institutional capacity retention at RTDA has been addressed through the creation of a
SPIU from July 2014 as part of the restructuring of the agency. The restructuring process was
aimed at improving the efficiency of the institution by attracting experienced staff with improved
remuneration package. The total number of RTDA staff stands at 98 among which 61 are Engineers
including managerial positions and the remaining 37 are in the corporate services. Specifically, the
SPIU will be in charge of implementing projects that are mainly financed by the Development
Partners. The SPIU recruitment process was completed in end September 2014.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      In order to compare post implementation economic benefits with respect to predicted
economic benefits at the time of appraisal, a comparative Economic analysis was conducted using
the typical and classical cost benefit method with determination of the internal rate of return and
the NPV.

2.      Economic analyses are based on real cost, that is, net of inflation for both pre and post
project appraisal scenarios. The real discount rate applied is 12 percent. This rate is commonly
applied to determine the rate of return of road projects funded by international donors, such as the
European Development Fund and the World Bank.

3.     Evaluation of the economic profitability indicators (NPV and EIRR) were evaluated by
comparing situations of implementation of the project “Without” and “With” rehabilitant option
based on the following factors:

              Economic costs of investments;
              Economic costs of maintenance in the “without” and “with” situations of project
               implementation; and
              VOC in the two situations (economic benefits).

Comparative analyses were done to assess actual benefits accrued due to the projects and hence to
compare the actual results after the implementation of the project and hence to compare the same
with the predicted benefits at the time of the appraisal.

4.     The analysis was conducted using the 1.3 version of the HDM-4 software.

Parameters of the Economic Analysis

5.     At the time of appraisal, cost-benefit analyses for paved rehabilitation work for Kigali-
Ruhengeri and Ruhengeri-Rubavu (Gisenyi) links were conducted using the VOC model which is
based on the HDM. The model calculates vehicle operating costs based on the road’s roughness
and other technical parameters. However, Ruhengeri-Rubavu section of the road network was built
long before the start of the construction work of Kigali-Ruhengeri road in 2010. It might not be
appropriate to include Ruhengeri-Rubavu portion in the post implementation economic appraisal
of Kigali-Ruhengeri road.

Alternatives

6.      Post implementation economic evaluation was conducted using traffic data of 2010 and
2013. All the VOC parameters were updated using VOC surveys of different studies in 2013 and
2014 in the Ministry of Infrastructure and Rwanda Transport Development Agency. During the
appraisal two alternative assumptions were considered for the economic and sensitivity analysis
of the completed road. The alternatives scenarios considered were:


                                                25

        For the post economic analysis only one alternative was considered as follows:
             Alternative 3: Coating with BB and reinforcement with ES + widening to 7.00 m +
              existing road geometry.

Economic coefficients

7.      All economic costs and benefits are expressed in the USD representing actual resource
costs and it does not transfer” payments such as taxes, charges and customs duties. The price of
any tradable product is based on its international “border price”, that is Cost, Insurance and Freight
for imports and Free on Board for exports. The conversion rate of 550 RWF with USD at March
2005 at appraisal. On the other hand the conversion rate of RWF with USD in April, 2015 is 710.
The economic coefficients of different elements of costs, which were used in the present study, are
given in Table 3.1.

Vehicle Operating Costs

8.      Calculation of vehicle operating costs is done using the HDM-4 model. At appraisal,
parameters for calculating vehicle operating costs were defined in Rwanda by two previous
studies, namely preparation of the Sector Framework and Scetauroute Investment Program
(August 2001) and the Socio-Economic Report of the study on the Rehabilitation and completion
of asphalting of the Gitarama - Ngororero - Mukamira road (September 2004), funded by the
AfDB. For post implementation economic analysis, different elements of VOC costs were mainly
obtained from the Vehicle Age Limit study of 20133. Again, the price of different elements of


3MININFRA (2013) Study on the Impact Assessment of the Age Limit of Imported Motor Vehicles on Economy, Environment
and Road Safety in Rwanda.

      VOC, which were collected in 2013, were converted into 2015 price by taking into account of
      annual inflation rates during the period as obtained from the Rwanda Bureau of Statistics. The
      VOC parameters for before and after the implementation of the project are demonstrated in Table
      3.2.

     9.      A summary of the results obtained in the appraisal from the two alternatives and reappraisal
     of the actual completed work as per alternative 3 are shown in Table 3.3. It is evident from the
     comparison of economic appraisal between pre and post project implementation analyses that
     despite the increase of project cost by 28.9% due to widening of the road, actual economic benefits
     after the implementation of the project are much higher in comparison to the predicted economic

benefits at appraisal time in 2007. Out of the two alternatives during appraisal time, economic
benefits of the alternative 1 was slightly better having EIRR and NPV(12 percent) of 12.80 percent
and USD 1.77 million respectively. On the other hand, economic indicators in terms of EIRR and
NPV (12 percent) for the alternative 3, which was implemented in the project, were 30.8 percent
and USD 345.05 million respectively. This clearly demonstrates that the actual economic benefits
from the project are significantly higher than predicted benefits during appraisal time.

10.     As demonstrated overall, the scenario option of Alternative 3, which represents the actual
implemented option, recorded better results for the economic indicators in comparison to the two
other alternatives of appraisal report. With regards to traffic, the original growth rate, which was
employed at the appraisal, was only 4.8 percent in the year 2005. However actual growth rate
during 2005 to 2010 before the commencement of the project was significantly higher, i.e. 7.2
percent. Moreover, the traffic growth rate between 2010 and 2013 was 13.3 percent, which is
almost 3 times higher than the predicted traffic growth at the time of appraisal, i.e. 2005. Given
that in the economic analysis only 5 percent generated traffic was assumed, it is clearly evident
that much higher economic benefits of the Kigali-Ruhengeri road rehabilitation project was
attributed to significant increase of traffic ranging from 7.2 to 13.3percent as shown in Table 3.4.

                             Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      Introduction: As part of the assessment of the beneficiary of TSDP, RTDA undertook a
comprehensive questionnaire survey for all four components of the project, i.e. (i) Component 1 –
Paved Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance, (ii) Component 2: Sector Governance and Policy
Support, (iii) Component 3: Sector Analysis and Planning Support, and (iv) Component 4- Project
and Program Management Support. A team of 15 engineers/enumerators coordinated by the
Transport Adviser of RTDA (Team Leader) were employed to conduct the Beneficiary
Assessment of the project. The team conducted the questionnaire surveys for the key beneficiaries
of the project during March, 2015.
2.      Purpose and Objectives: The main purpose of the project was to improve riding quality
of the National road network and hence to generate employment opportunities and improvement
of institutional and human resources capacity in road sector. The objectives of the project were:
(a) to assess direct transport impacts of the rehabilitation of Kigali-Ruhengeri road on road users
and other key stakeholders in zone of influence of the project areas, and (b) to determine indirect
impacts on net social welfare for the stakeholders of the project.
3.      Task 1: Description of the Proposed Project: At the time of Beneficiary Assessment in
March, 2015 all the four components of the project were successfully completed within the project
completion date, That is, December 31, 2014. However, it is not clear what the wider impacts of
the project on stakeholders are. Efforts were made in the Beneficiary Assessment of the project to
determine wider direct transport and socio-economic impacts of the project on intended
beneficiaries.
4.     Task 2: Description of the Historical, Institutional, Socio-Cultural and Political
Context: The economy was at stagnant situation having only 4% Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth during the time of appraisal. Since then remarkable progress have been made in both
transport and socio-economic sectors. The key issue is therefore to isolate impacts of the project
which were solely attributed to the project from other overall socio-economic growth of the
country as a whole during the implementation period.
5.     Task 3: Legislative and Regulatory Considerations: During the implementation period
CGPT was restructured and converted into a full-fledged transport agency, which is Rwanda
Transport Development Agency (RTDA). RTDA was assigned the responsibility of improvement
and maintenance management of National Road network of Rwanda. With the establishment of
RTDA, the Policy Planning and Capacity Building Unit (PPCBU) of MININFRA no longer acts
both as a policy making and implementing agency. The role of the MININFRA is now limited to
policy making and monitoring the activities of the implementing agencies, such as RTDA.
6.      The Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) is an institution established by the law. Road
Maintenance Fund is tasked with the responsibility to is to receive, effectively manage and
disburse funds for the maintenance of National, District (Class 1) and Kigali City roads, as
determined by an Order of the Ministry in charge of roads. Since 1998 when RMF was established,
its mandate was limited to maintenance of only National roads. Road Act of 14/02/2011 governing
roads in Rwanda included District roads Class 1 under RMF’s mandate. However, the expansion
of mandate of RMF to cover District Class 1 roads was done without making provisions of
additional financing for institution.


                                                33
7.      Task 4: Assessment of Key Impacts: Efforts were made to include all potential direct and
indirect impacts of the all four components of the project in the beneficiary analysis.
8.      Task 5: Data Collection and Assessment Methods: The study conducted a
comprehensive analytical assessment of the beneficiaries of the project. In order to collect data
related to different direct and indirect impacts of the project, six questionnaire surveys were
undertaken to assess impacts on beneficiaries by all four components of the project. A stratified
random sampling technique was employed for the questionnaire surveys. In order to maintain
normal distribution, sufficient number of samples from each stratum, i.e. at least 30 samples for
each vehicle type were collected. This means in total 270 interviews were conducted in the study
as shown in Table 5.1. In total 15 numbers of surveyors and 2 data entry and transcription
personnel were employed for period of 4 weeks to conduct the questionnaire surveys and Transport
Advisor of RTDA supervised and coordinated the study as the Team Leader.
9.      Design of Questionnaires: In order to design the questionnaire for different types of
surveys for beneficiary assessment mainly three types of questions were considered as follows: (i)
Informative or Descriptive Questions, (ii) Preference or ranking questions, and (iii) Before- and-
after questions. There are three main ways of collecting information regarding preferences: (i)
Choice, (ii) Rating, and (iii) Ranking. In choice experiments, the respondents are asked to select
an option either from a pair or from a group. One of the attractions of ranking is that all the options
can be presented simultaneously. Ranking was employed in the study to rank the relative impacts
of some the key parameters due to implementation of the project. Nine points Likert scale were
employed to rank different attributes of the project as shown in Table 5.1. A special kind of
‘before-and-after design’ was employed in this research. All the relevant parameters of the all four
components of the project before and after the implementation were collected from the surveys.
Depending on the nature of the questionnaires, either a single class or a combination was presented
to the respondents.
10.       Selection of Samples: There are two major factors, which underlie all sample design: the
first is to avoid any bias in the selection process, and the second is to achieve maximum precision
for a given resource. However, it was extremely important to collect at least statistically significant
sample from each stratum. Considering limited resources available for the study it was not possible
to collect statistically significant number of sample for each strata instead efforts were made to
collect at least 30 sample from each strata to ensure a Normal distribution in responses. The sample
sizes for different types of questionnaire surveys for the study are given in Table 5.2.
11.     Task 6: Analysis of Impacts on Beneficiaries: The study conducted a comprehensive
analytical assessment of the beneficiaries of the project. In order to collect data related to different
direct and indirect impacts of the project, six questionnaire surveys were undertaken to assess
impacts on beneficiaries by all four components of the project. A stratified random sampling
technique was employed for the questionnaire surveys. In order to maintain normal distribution,
sufficient number of samples from each stratum, i.e. at least 30 samples for each vehicle type were
collected. This means in total 270 interviews were conducted in the study as shown in Table 5.1.
In total 15 numbers of surveyors and 2 data entry and transcription personnel were employed for
period of 6 weeks to conduct the questionnaire surveys and Transport Advisor of RTDA
supervised and coordinated the study as the Team Leader.
12.   Component 1- Paved Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance: Direct Impacts Related
to Travel Characteristics: Direct impacts of the project on travel characteristics for different

                                                  34
types of drivers were collected in the questionnaire surveys related to travel characteristics using
“Before and After” questionnaire approach. A brief description of the impacts for different vehicle
types is given in the following section.
13.      Impacts on Motorcycle Drivers/Passengers: The impacts of the project on Motorcycle
drivers/users are shown in Table 5.3. It appears from the table that most the travel characteristics
of the motorcycle drivers/passengers were improved in the positive direction due to
implementation of the project. Starting from the ownership of motor vehicles, duration and length
of trips have been increased after project but frequency of trips has been decreased. . This might
be attributed to the fact that due to improvement of road condition motorcycle users can make
relatively longer trips. However, motorcycle maintenance costs have increased. This might be due
to inflation of price.
14.     Impacts on Car Drivers/Passengers: The impacts of the project on Car drivers/users are
shown in Table 5.4. It appears from the table that most the travel characteristics of the car
drivers/passengers were improved in the positive direction due to implementation of the project.
The car ownership and trip frequency have increased. On the other hand both trip time and length
have decreased. All these are positive indicators of better travel characteristics after the
implementation of the project. However, average fare per trip has increased probably due to
inflation.
15.     Impacts on Pick-up Drivers/Passengers: The impacts of the project on Pick-up
drivers/users are demonstrated in Table 5.5. Most the travel characteristics of the pickup
drivers/users were improved in the positive direction due to implementation of the project. It is
evident from the table that for a pick-up driver/passenger all the indicators for travel characteristics
like motor vehicle ownership, trip frequency, load per trip and number of working days in year,
etc. have increased. Again, both average trip length and time have decreased considerably. All
these demonstrated significant improvement of travel characteristics for a pick-up due to
implementation of the project.
16.     Impacts on Minibus Drivers/Passengers: The impacts of the project on Minibus
drivers/users are shown in Table 5.6. It appears from the table that most the travel characteristics
of the motorcycle drivers/users were improved in the positive direction due to implementation of
the project. Key travel parameters like frequency of trip, duration of trip, trip per passenger and
average working days in year all have increased. Again, travel time and number of working days
lost due to bad weather have decreased. However fare charged and vehicle repair and maintenance
costs have increased.
17.     Impacts on Bus Drivers/Passengers: The impacts of the project on Bus
drivers/passengers are shown in Table 5.7. It appears from the table that most the travel
characteristics of the motorcycle drivers/users were improved in the positive direction due to
implementation of the project. Key travel indicators like frequency of trip, duration of trip, trip per
passenger and average working days in year all have increased. Again, travel time and number of
working days lost due to bad weather have decreased significantly. Again fare charged, fuel
consumption and vehicle repair and maintenance costs have also decreased indicating overall net
positive benefits in almost all key trip parameters for bus drivers/passengers.
18.    Impacts on 2-Axle Truck Drivers: The impacts of the project on 2-Axle Truck drivers
are shown in Table 5.8. It appears from the table that most the travel characteristics of the 2-axle
truck drivers/users were improved in the positive direction due to implementation of the project.

                                                  35
All key travel indicators like frequency of trips, load per trip, working hours have increased. Again,
average trip length, trip time, days of work lost and fare all decreased due to implementation of
the project.
19.     Impacts on Trailer Truck Drivers: The impacts of the project on Trailer Truck drivers
are shown in Table 5.9. It appears from the table that most the travel characteristics of the
motorcycle drivers/users were improved in the positive direction due to implementation of the
project. All key travel indicators like load per trip, working distance and working days in a year,
etc. have increased after the project. Again both trip length and duration have increased. However,
proportional change of trip time is only 5.4% in comparison to 31.6% increase of average trip
lengths indicating average reduction of travel time per km.
20.    Component 1- Indirect Impacts: Welfare Outcomes related to Income and
Expenditure: Indirect impacts of the project on income and expenditure in the zone of influence
are shown in Table 5.10 to 5.16. Although most the impacts were due to combined effects of
overall socio-economic development of the region, some indirect impacts of the projects on
income and expenditure cannot be overlooked.
21.     Household Demographic Characteristics of Income & Expenditure Survey: It is
evident from the survey that household demographic characteristics in the zone of influence of the
project areas, such as family composition income have increased after the project as shown in
Table 5.10.
22.     Impacts on Agricultural Activities: It is evident from the Table 5.11 that all the key
parameters related to utilization of land, outputs per hectare, use of fertilizers and other modern
inputs, price of agricultural products, and advisory support agricultural activities have shown
remarkable improvement after the implementation of the project.
23.     Impacts on Non-agricultural Activities: Not only agricultural activities have shown
improvements, all the key non-agricultural activities, such as, public storage facilities, ownership
of non-agricultural enterprise and both on and off farm employment per household achieved
significant improvement due to the project as demonstrated in Table 5.12.
24.    Impacts on Income and Expenditure: Both income and expenditure per household have
increased more than 100% after the project in comparison to the baseline data as shown in Table
5.13. This clearly demonstrated significant increase of overall wealth in the project area. Some of
the additional prosperities were most likely to be due to the implementation of the project.
25.      Impacts on Markets: It appears that due to improvement of road transport facilities in the
project area distance to markets have decreased, number of trading activities, such as number
sellers, number available products either bought or sold have increased significantly indicating
positive impacts on markets (as shown in Table 5.14).
26.      Impacts on Prices: It appears the Table 5.15 that due to improvement of road transport
facilities in the project area both price of land and housing have increased significantly ranging
from 95 to 250% providing indirect benefits of transport improvements to the people in the project
areas. However, the price of traded commodities were also increased by 30% probably due to
inflation.
27.     Impacts on Opportunities for Credit and Employment: It appears the Table 5.16 that
due to improvement of road transport facilities in the project area significant improvements in
access to credit and employment opportunities have taken place in the range of 225 to 422%.
                                                 36
28.     Component 1- Indirect Impacts: Welfare Outcomes related to Social Benefits: Indirect
impacts of the project on social benefits in the zone of influence are shown in Tables 5.17 to 5.21.
Although most the impacts were due to combined effects of overall socio-economic development
of the region, some indirect impacts of the projects on social benefits were no doubt accrued due
to implementation of the project.
29.     It is evident from the survey that household demographic characteristics in the zone of
influence of the project areas, such as family composition income have increased after the project
as shown in Table 5.17.
30.      It is evident from the Table 5.18 that all the key parameters for education developments,
such as number of school, student enrollment rate, number of teachers and regular available supply
for school have improved after implementation of the project. Again, drop-out rates for both male
and female students have decreased significantly. All these clearly demonstrate overall indirect
positive impacts of the project on development of education. It is evident from the Table 5.19 that
due to improvement of road transport infrastructure both time use for firewood collection and tasks
related to transport have decreased indicating positive indirect travel benefits of the project.
31.      It is evident from the Table 5.20 that due to improvement of road transport infrastructure
social interactions among the people in the project areas have increased significantly indicating
positive indirect travel benefits of the project.
32.      It is evident from the Table 5.21 that due to improvement of road transport infrastructure
political among the people in the project areas have increased significantly. This clearly indicates
positive indirect travel benefits of the project in promoting political participation among the
general population.
33.     Component 2- Sector Governance and Policy Support and Sector Analysis and
Planning Support: Most of respondents were in the view that due to implementation of the TSDP,
effectiveness and efficiency of public resources, capacity for planning, budgeting and financing
have improved significantly as demonstrated in Tables 5.22 and 5.23. However, the respondents
did not totally agree that TSDP had improved participation of private sectors and improve timely
implementation of programs and projects as shown in Tables 5.24 and 5.25.
34.     Component 3- - Capacity Building (MSc Program): Direct Impacts: Most of the
students of the postgraduate training programs were in the view that the program was successful
as shown from Tables 5.27 to 5.46. In regard to different components of the program, they opined
that on balance overall courses were adequate, appropriate, and useful for practical life.
35.     Component 3 and 4- Transport Planning and Monitoring System, Project and
Program Management Support: Most of the respondents opined that TSDP was successful in
ensuring better statistics for transport strategy and policy making, improving continuous M&E of
road transport programs and projects, improving information sharing and effectiveness of M&E
system and overall MIS for the road transport sector of Rwanda as demonstrated in Tables 5.47 to
5.51.
36.     Task 8: Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Project: Key conclusions of the
project are as follows:
      i.    It appears from the table that most the travel characteristics of all categories of motor
            vehicles in the zone of influence of the project areas including frequency of trips,


                                                37
              passenger/load carrying capacity were increased whereas travel times, number of days
              lost due to bad weather were decreased due to implementation of the project;
        ii.   All the key parameters related to agricultural activities such as utilization of land,
              outputs per hectare, use of fertilizers and other modern inputs, price of agricultural
              products, and advisory support agricultural activities have shown remarkable
              improvement after the implementation of the project;
       iii.   Not only agricultural activities have shown improvements, all the key non-agricultural
              activities, such as, public storage facilities, ownership of non-agricultural enterprise
              and both on and off farm employment per household achieved significant
              improvement due to the project;
       iv.    It appears that significant increase of overall wealth in the project area was occurred
              in the order of more than 100% after the implementation of the project;
        v.    Due to improvement of road transport facilities in the project area both price of land
              and housing have increased significantly ranging from 95 to 250% providing indirect
              benefits of transport improvements to the people in the project areas;
       vi.    Due to improvement of road transport facilities in the project area significant
              improvements in access to credit and employment opportunities have taken place in
              the range of 225 to 422%;
       vii.   All the key parameters for education developments, such as number of school, student
              enrollment rate, number of teachers and regular available supply for school have
              improved after implementation of the project. Again, drop-out rates for both male and
              female students have decreased significantly after the implementation of the project;
   viii.      Most of respondents were in the view that due to implementation of the TSDP,
              effectiveness and efficiency of public resources, capacity for planning, budgeting and
              financing have improved significantly;
       ix.    Majority of the respondents did not totally agree that TSDP had improved
              participation of private sectors and timely implementation of programs;
        x.    Most of the students of the postgraduate training programs were in the view that the
              program was successful. In regard to different components of the program, they
              opined that on balance overall courses were adequate, appropriate and useful for
              practical life; and
       xi.    Most of the respondents opined that TSDP was successful in ensuring better statistics
              for transport strategy and policy making, improving continuous M&E of road
              transport programs and projects, improving information sharing and effectiveness of
              M&E system and overall MIS for the road transport sector of Rwanda.
37.     Recommendations for Future Project: Key recommendations for future the projects are
as follows:
  i.      It is important to develop sustainable financing system for road maintenance management
          to reduce the backlog in maintenance and proper preservation of road network in Rwanda;

Introduction

1.       In 2002, Rwanda was still in process of recovery from the invaluable damage to the social
and economic fabric of the county by 1994 genocide and civil war. The Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) was completed in June 2002 after extensive consultations with civil society, is based
on six strategic pillars: (i) rural development and agricultural transformation, (ii) human
development, (iii) economic infrastructure, (iv) good governance, (v) private sector development,
and (vi) institutional capacity building. By 2003 Rwanda’s domestic political situation was largely
stabilized, and substantial progress was made toward rebuilding the institutions of an effective
state, including through the adoption of a new constitution in May 2003, followed by a presidential
election and legislative polls in the same.

2.      At project appraisal in 2007, the poor state of infrastructure still remained a major barrier
to Rwanda’s economic growth as it reduces competitiveness of exports and discourages
investment. The government’s priority was not only to address the particular consequences of
genocide and war but also to tackle longer term structural difficulties evident in the pre-war
economy, particularly due to the pressure of population growth in a relatively small country with
an economy primarily dependent on agrarian activity. During this time period, Rwanda also faced
a key challenge in achieving its growth targets. Indications are that GDP growth is slowing to pre-
1994 levels. Real GDP growth, which stood at 7 percent on average over 1995-2003, rose only by
4.2 percent over 2004-2005. In addition, an update of the growth simulations under the PRSP
indicate that growth would need to be around 10 to 12 percent of GDP (compared to the previous
estimate of 7 to 8 percent) for Rwanda to achieve middle-income country status by 2015.

3.      At the time of appraisal, Rwanda’s transport costs were as high as 40% of the export import
values. This attributed to long distance, i.e. about 1,600 km from the nearest sea port, Rwanda’s
transport costs represent as high as 40 percent of export and import values. The average journey
times via both Northern and Central corridors to seaports were affected by long processing times
at the port due to inefficient terminal handling procedures, onerous transit preparations owing to
Customs transit transport requirements, and poor truck access and egress at the terminal, followed
by slow transit on the road as a result of compulsory stops at many weighbridge stations, numerous
random police road checks and cumbersome border crossings resulting in long queues, including
burdensome Customs bond cancellation procedures. These factors exacerbated the resources
consumed (capital cost, driver and assistant, license, fuel, tires, repair and maintenance, truck, etc.)
in providing the truck services due to the time to deliver a load to the destination. Furthermore, on
the return trip the truck was frequently faced with empty backhauls due to trade imbalances
(Rwanda imports exceed exports by a factor of 11 in terms of weight) and as a result the head haul
was often required to bear the full cost burden of the round trip. For these reasons, freight logistics
costs on both corridors exacted serious penalties on Rwandan producers and as a result blunt the
competitiveness of the export sector. Again, because of its mountainous terrain, the excessive
rainfall, erosion is particularly severe on the country’s road network, whose maintenance cost was
twice higher than that of most Sub-Saharan countries. The country’s road network of 14,000 km,
spread over barely 27,000 square km of national territory, was among the densest in Sub-Sahara
Africa, and its management far exceeds the country’s human and financial capabilities. Recent
sector surveys, conducted with the help of the European Commission (EC), the World Bank and


                                                  65
PPIAF, 4 concluded that only 23 percent of Rwanda’s asphalted network in 2005 was in good
condition, while barely 5 percent and 2 percent of the secondary and communal networks were in
good condition, respectively. As high as 85 percent of the 1,100 km paved network requires heavy
rehabilitation or periodic maintenance, and most of the secondary and communal roads have not
been maintained for over a decade.

4.     At appraisal in 2007 the Government took up a highly ambitious investment program in
transport sector to rise steadily investment from Rwandan Francs (FRW) 12 billion (US$24
million) in 2005 to about FRW 19 billion (US$ 38 million) in 2010 under NIS. In addition,
resources required to routinely maintain the country’s 14,000 km road network annually was
estimated at US$24 million whereas the RMF, which was currently the only financing source,
could only generate US$6 million.

5.      During appraisal period, the transport sector was suffering from acute human resources
problems. Most of the staff in the sector were young and inexperienced, while high staff turnover
used to undermine efforts to build capacity. There was no road/transport agency in place to look
after transport sector. Poor planning and the lack of proper budgetary practices, aggravated by
cumbersome procurement procedures, tended to limit the impact of the little investments directed
to the sector.

6.      In line with Rwanda’s broader decentralization policy, the responsibility for maintaining
the unpaved main roads and the unpaved rural roads was moved to the provinces and districts,
respectively. Since 2004, in an effort to support the policy, the RMF distributed 50 percent of its
resources to district and city councils in the form of subsidies. Unfortunately, this system has
further impoverished road maintenance in two ways: First, the classified road network lost half of
its maintenance resources while its maintenance gap became doubled. Second, the impact of the
resources distributed to city and local governments was limited given the lack of capacity and
experience to play this new role, and the absence of adequate control mechanisms.

7.      During the appraisal period, the Government of Rwanda adopted highly ambitious a
transport policy matrix supported by a three year Medium Term Expenditure Program (MTEP) for
the five modes of transport (air, land, rail, river and lake) under the PRSC of the World Bank.
However, its targets far exceeded those of the NIS and it did not take into account the human
constraints or the technical absorption limitations of the country. In addition, most of the country’s
transport legislation were from the colonial era and needed to be aligned with new and emerging
challenges, including the country’s integration with the EAC.

Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

8.     The objectives of the project were: (a) to improve the quality of Rwanda's paved road
network and (b) to generate sustained employment in rural areas through road maintenance works.
The project aimed to improve road quality by: (i) restoring parts of major road corridors to good
conditions through rehabilitation works on the Kigali-Ruhengeri road and maintenance works on
about 50 percent of the paved road network of 1,100 km; (ii) establishing a system for sustainable

       (iv) Provision of technical assistance to Infrastructure Planning, Policies and Capacity
             Building Unit, Transport Projects Management Unit, Road Agency following its
             establishment, and Road Maintenance Fund in support of Project financial audits.
       (v) Training of Project and Program management staff in accounting and financial
             management, procurement and contract management, and budget preparation and
             disbursement.

Implementation

11.     The Bank approved the project on August 28, 2007, and the credit became effective on
December 28, 2007. The original closing date was June 30, 2012. However, in order to resolve
issues related to widening of the carriageway of the Kigali-Ruhengeri Road from 6.15 m to 7.00
m project was delayed and subsequently revised closing date was on December, 31, 2014.

Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Factors outside the Control of the GoR or Implementing Agencies

12.    Limited Construction Sector Capacity: It was evident that there was a low construction
industry capacity in Rwanda, with very few contractors/consultants who had the capacity to handle

                                               68
major construction and capacity development projects during implementation period. The nation’s
construction industry is underdeveloped and plagued with problems, which include lack of
management, integrated legal and regulatory regime, technical capacity, access to credit facilities
and work opportunities. Further, there were contractors with limited financial and technical
capacities, leading to limited competition and lengthy verification processes on the performance
of previous projects in the procurement process of the project.

13.     Global Economic Crisis: The global economic situation affected the prices of inputs.
During the execution of the project, the global economy experienced both very high rise and fall
of oil price. For example, while the average price of a barrel of oil was US$67.94 at appraisal in
2007. During the implementation of the civil works contracts, the price of a barrel of oil continued
to fluctuate, generally with an upward trend and with a peak of around US$100.00 in during 2011
to 2013. In terms of contracts management, this resulted in higher than expected values of price
adjustment. Again, the negative global growth prospect was mainly being based on the weak
demand for oil at the flag end of the project in 2014 which forced prices to fall to below US$70
their lowest since 2009 and economists are attributing this trend to general weak economic activity
in advanced economies. More than 60 per cent of Rwanda's budget is funded locally through
domestic tax revenues with the rest coming from foreign aid. In 2012, donors suspended their
support which led to a growth slowdown in 2013. However, most donors restored their support in
2014 which has helped to facilitate economic recovery with an anticipated growth of more than 6
per cent. However, to ensure financial stability, government has since put in place precautionary
measures to guard against external shocks as well as ensuring steady flow of funding for priority
areas such as energy. Despite these fluctuations in global economic situations, the project
overcame most the obstacles and managed its overall expenditure more or less within budgetary
limits.

Factors Generally Subject to Government Control

14.     The government was expected to contribute through the RMF some US$20 million over
the five-year period of road maintenance contracts. In addition, and as a mitigating measure in case
the fuel levy did not increase as expected, the government undertook during negotiations to ensure
that agreed amounts of the resources raised locally through the RMF are maintained in a separate
project account to be managed independently by the RMF. These amounts, which total US$24
million over the life of the project, were supposed to be deposited in the account at the beginning
of every year starting in 2008. This commitment was a covenant in the Financing Agreement and
was monitored closely during implementation. The fuel levy was introduced in 1991, at RWF20.23
(US$0.13) per liter for Petrol and RWF24.43 (US$0.16) for diesel. By 2008, whilst the levy had
remained unchanged, its value had fallen to about 3% of the fuel pump price and was only worth
about US$0.04. In 2009, the levy was increased to RWF62.37 (US$0.11) per liter (for both fuel
types), representing about 9% of the fuel pump price. In 2014, the levy remains at RWF62.37 (now
worth about US$0.09) and representing about 6% of the fuel pump price. Another source of
revenue for RMF is International Transit Traffic. Existing revenue of RMF consists of US$21.114
million from Fuel Levy and US$12.70 million from International Transit Traffic, i.e. in total
US$33.814 million per year. The RMF deposited in the special project account, over US$24
million in accordance with the commitment of the Government to contribute for road maintenance
under TSDP.



                                                69
Factors Generally Subject to the Implementing Agency’s Control

15.      Weak Technical Implementation Capacity: During the implementation period CGPT
was restructured and converted into a full-fledged transport agency, i.e. RTDA. The current
organization structure of RTDA was established and approved in 2010. The implementation of the
organization structure commenced in September 2011. Starting from 38 staff of CGPT, RTDA has
now 98 staffs among which 61 are Engineers including managerial positions and the remaining 37
are in the corporate services. In addition to Road Maintenance Management Unit, a SPIU was
established in RTDA from July 2014. The restructuring process is aimed at improving the
efficiency of the institution by attracting skill professionals in the SPIU by offering better salary
and other remunerations. Again PPCBU of MININFRA no longer act both as a policy making and
implementing agency. The MININFRA has also gone through major restructuring relinquishing
its implementing roles to a number of agencies such as RTDA, Rwanda Housing Authority (RHA)
and Energy Water and Sanitation Authority (EWASA), etc. The role of the MININFRA is now
limited to policy making and monitoring the activities of the implementing agencies, such as
RTDA. With the restructuring of MININFRA and RTDA, the technical implementation capacity
of the transport sector in Rwanda has improved significantly.

16.    Cost overruns on road works would have undermined the project objectives and/or its
expected impact. The initial contract for the civil work was awarded to China Henan International
Cooperation Group Co. Ltd (CHICO) at a contract amount of RWF) 25, 060, 999, 796, equivalent
to USD 43,966,666; and the addendum was RWF 2,349,844,553 equivalent to USD 4,122,534.30.
The total contract amount is USD 48,089,199.The contract between the MININFRA and CHICO
was signed on November 30, 2009 with a construction period of 27 months. This means the
construction work of the project had a cost overrun of 9.4%.

Assessment of Outcomes

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

17.     The project objectives were clear, relevant, and important to improve road maintenance
management system and strengthening sector governance and policy, planning and program
management. The program components had a good linkage with the project objectives. The project
components are fully consistent with EDPRS 2 of Rwanda, which aims to accelerate private sector-
led growth and further reduce poverty, including extreme poverty. It seeks to do so while reducing
aid-dependency and increasing self-reliance. The project also contributed to the Bank’s CPS
strategic principles used in defining future areas of engagement in Rwanda, comprising: (i)
alignment with the twin goals of growth and poverty reduction; (ii) comparative advantage relative
to other donors; (iii) opportunity to maximize internal WBG synergies and present a coherent ‘one
Bank Group’ approach; (iv) client demand; (v) risk especially with respect to capacity constraints
both on the side of Government and the WBG. The project objectives were also in line with the
these CPS objectives of reducing capacity constraints, ensuring improvement in policy formulation,
planning and program management, preservation of road asset to ensure efficient and reliable
provision of road transport network, increasing agricultural production and accessibility,
stimulating economic growth in the country, and enhancing linkages with neighboring countries.




                                                 70
Achievement of Project Development Objectives

18.     The Project was successful to attain all PDO. About 62 percent of the paved roads network
continues to remain in good condition, and the project has surpassed its intended original target
(of 50 percent by the end of the project). After the completion of Kigail-Ruhengeri road, 100% of
the road is in Good condition having IRI (m/km) less than 3. The completion of the Kigali to
Ruhengeri road rehabilitation has contributed to the objective of providing reliable access to about
2.1 million people living along this main regional corridor. The objective of establishing a system
for sustainable financing of road maintenance made some inroads when in 2009 fuel levy was
increased from RWF 24.43 to RWF 62.37. The Existing revenue of RMF consists of US$21.114
million from Fuel Levy and US$12.70 million from International Transit Traffic, i.e. in total
US$33.814 million per year. The RMF deposited in the special project account, over US$24
million in accordance with the commitment of the Government to contribute for road maintenance
under TSDP. The engagement of LCAs for the maintenance of the national road network has
helped to provide employment opportunities for about 3,041 inhabitants along the roads (against
3,000 targeted by the end of the project). RMF, RTDA and the Districts now need to sustain the
engagement of LCAs to ensure that these gains are not lost after the closure of the project.

19.     The postgraduate training program in transportation studies by University of Rwanda
(UoR) was successfully completed by end December 2014. Under the program 30 students in
Highway Engineering and Management (HEM) and 22 students in Transport Engineering &
Economics (TEE) were trained leading to MSc degrees. Data collection to support the monitoring
and results assessment of the project were conducted in the form of surveys at three intervals during
implementation of the project as planned. These survey data helped the project to monitor all core
and intermediate indicators with respect to its periodical or annual targets. In this connection, the
project also helped RTDA, RMF and MININFRA to establish an M&E system to monitor all
development projects within the transport sector.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

20.     The PDO of the project were to improve the quality of Rwanda's paved road network, to
generate sustained employment in rural areas through road maintenance works, to restore Kigali-
Ruhengeri road corridor, to develop sustainable road maintenance financing system and to improve
human resources and institutional capacity for developing road transport sector policy, planning,
monitoring & evaluation and project management. The project was very successful in
materializing all PDO’s under the four components of the project. The Economic Efficiency of
Indicators of the Kigali-Ruhengeri Road, which was the most capital intensive component of the
project, were significantly better than predicted economic benefit at the time of project appraisal.
The project is a deserving candidate to be rated as “Satisfactory” as far as implementation of PDO’s
are concerned.

21.    Despite successful implementation of all PDO’s the project was not free from short-
comings. The original closing date of the project was 30 June, 2012 but it was delayed by almost
two and a half year up to 31 December, 2014. In addition to about 20% increase of the project cost
due to widening road carriage way from 6.15 m to 7m, the construction work of the project also
had a cost overrun of 9.4%. In total the overall cost was increased by 28.9%.



                                                 71
22.     During the implementation of the project, there was not accounting manual specific to
RTDA. Whereas the RTDA has an internal audit department, they primarily focus on government
funds, and therefore activities of the project were not audited by the internal audit unit. It was also
not possible to prepare audit plans on the basis of risk rather than activity. Considering all these,
the overall financial management ISR rating for the project may be classified as Moderately
Satisfactory. The overall financial management risk for the project was Substantial.

23.     Considering the time lose on actual implementation, escalation of construction costs and
some problems of financial management, overall the ISR “Satisfactory” ratings were too generous.
This is despite the fact that the project was generally successful in fulfilling all its PDO’s objectives.
Based on an assessment of the overall performance, considering the above mentioned factors and
weaknesses as an impetus for rating, the ICR assessed the overall performance outcome rating to
be “Moderately Satisfactory”.

Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

24.      The project design was relevant, appropriate, and responsive to the client’s needs as it was
directed to improve road maintenance management system and strengthening sector governance
and policy, planning and program management. In the project design all potential key issues, such
as (i) high transport costs, an oversized and poor road network, (ii) an ambitious investment
program with limited resources, (iii) weak institutions, (iv) effects of decentralization, and (v)
inadequate transport policy framework, etc. were dully taken into account and adequate measures
were designed to address them. Again, all the targets for key PDO indicators were turned out to be
relevant and realistic considering overall institutional, human resources and financial capabilities
of the transport sector of Rwanda.

25.     At project appraisal in 2007, the rehabilitation and maintenance works for Kigali-
Ruhengeri road were supposed to be implemented for a road with a 6.15 m width for carriageway.
However, in order to maintain continuity of the level of service between Kigali-Ruhengeri and
Ruhenger-Rubavu (Gisenyi), which was constructed with a 7m of carriageway width and to
enhance traffic safety, it was essential to maintain the same standard width of 7 throughout the
entire road corridor, i.e. Kigali-Ruhengeri-Rubavu. Due to the deficiency in the design concept,
the project was delayed by almost 2 years and 6 month with a substantial increase of costs (about
19%).

26.     The overall risk at project appraisal was assessed to be Very High and as such several
mitigation measures were proposed at entry. The key project risks were (i) weak Technical
Implementation Capacity, (ii) Cost overruns on road works, and (iii) weak Financial Management
Capacity. However, it appears that considering the very high risks associated with the project,
some of the key risk mitigation plans were not very clearly defined at entry.




                                                   72
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

27.    In order to facilitate the project supervision, a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was
prepared, which provided a good basis for the project supervision. The bank provided advisory
support by employing a competent team having a wide array of skill-mix in accordance with the
requirements of the project. The team worked in close cooperation with the RTDA, MININFRA,
Ministry of Economic Planning and Finance (MINECOFIN); and had regular coordination
meetings with key development partners in Rwanda in the road sector, namely, the African
Development Bank (AfDB), the delegation of the European Union (EU), and the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID). The team maintained a strategic vision not only
on for implementation of the rehabilitation work of Kigali-Ruhengeri road but also took into
account of issues related to road maintenance management, institutional and human resources
capacity development as well as other cross cutting issues such as labor-base road maintenance,
employment generation, gender equality, HIV/AIDS awareness and mitigation measures and
governance. There was significant involvement of the Bank’s team to resolve day-to-day
problems. The quality of the financial management reviews was found to be satisfactory and
consistent with the Bank guidelines. The supervision aide-memoires for the implementation phase
provided highlights on the key issues thus providing prompt information to the client and Bank
management.

28.     However, despite adequate supervision of the project, it was not possible to avoid long
delays in commencement of the project due to debate on widening of the road carriageway width
from 6.15m to 7m. Again, apparently because of inadequate supervision process the project
suffered an overall escalation of by 19% and a long delay in implementation of postgraduate
training program on transport sector in collaboration with University of Rwanda and number of
studies in the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

29.     Although the World Bank provided adequate advisory and supervision support throughout
the implementation process, the project was marred with significant delays and cost escalations of
different components. Therefore overall performance of the bank can be rated as “Moderately
Satisfactory”.

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

30.     The Government of Rwanda showed firm commitment in implementing institutional
reforms for improvement of service delivery and road maintenance management system. During
the implementation period the original implementation unit at project appraisal, i.e. CGPT was
restructured and converted into a full-fledged transport agency, i.e. RTDA. Starting from a weak
administrative structure of 38 staff of CGPT, RTDA has now 98 staffs with an array of strong
planning and management divisions. The PPCBU of MININFRA no longer play the dual role of
policy making and implementation of development projects. The role of the MININFRA is now
limited to policy making and monitoring the activities of the implementing agencies, such as
RTDA. There is no doubt that the technical implementation and institutional capacity of the

                                               73
transport sector in Rwanda have improved significantly after restructuring the same during the
project implementation period.

31.     The Government of Rwanda also fulfilled its commitment by providing over US$24
million to contribute for road maintenance under TSDP. Again, fuel levy for road maintenance
was increased RWF 24.43 to RWF 62.37 in 2009 to mobilize more funds for road maintenance.
Considering proactive approach of the Government of Rwanda for sustainable development of the
road transport sector, the overall performance of the government may be considered as
“Satisfactory”.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

32.     At the initial stage of the project CGPT and the PPCBU of MININFRA were the two main
executing agencies of the project. They successfully assisted in revised planning and design of the
rehabilitation of Kigali-Ruhengeri road with a carriage of 7m instead of 6.15 as originally planned
at appraisal in 2007. After the establishment of RTDA in 2010, it became the main implementing
agency of the project. RTDA successfully implemented all four components of the project and all
PDO’s were fully achieved.

33.    The rehabilitation work of the Kigali – Ruhengeri road was successfully completed and
three multi-year maintenance contracts were also completed successfully. RTDA successfully
engaged LCAs for the maintenance of the national road network which helped to provide
employment opportunities for about 3,041 inhabitants along the roads (against 3,000 targeted by
the end of the project). RTDA helped successful completion of long term in-country training in
transportation studies in collaboration of University of Rwanda.

34.   It appears that RTDA successfully maintained adequacy of the project's financial
management arrangements and compliance with the legal covenants related to financial
management. The project accounting system worked satisfactorily to process and record financial
data.

35.     Despite success in implementing all components of project, RTDA could not prevent
significant delays and cost escalation of the project. The performance of the implementing agency
can be regarded as “Moderately Satisfactory”.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

36.    The government’s overall performance is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory”.

Lessons Learned

37.    Finalization of Key Design Parameters at Entry: Despite the fact the Rehengeri-Rubavu
(Gyseni) section of Kigali-Ruhengeri-Gyeni road corridor was built with a carriageway width of
7m, initially Kigali-Ruhengeri section was proposed to build with a carriageway width of 6.15m
at Appraisal in 2007. In order to remove the anomaly in the design and to maintain the same
standard for all National road, it was redesigned to widen the carriageway from 6.15m to 7m.

                                                74
However, because of lengthy process to change the design, the commencement of the project was
delayed by almost two and a half year. In addition it resulted about 20% increase of construction
cost. It is therefore essential to select the key design parameters at Project Entry to avoid
unnecessary delays and cost overrun in the project.

38.     Sector Governance, Policy and Planning Support: The institutional reforms conducted
in parallel to project implementation by transforming CGPT into a full-fledged transport agency,
i.e. RTDA was proved to be very effective in realizing all PDO’s of the project. An important
lesson learned is that institutional reforms are essential to improve sector governance, policy and
planning capacity of the road transport sector in Rwanda.

39.     Involvement of Local Communities in Road Maintenance: The engagement of LCAs
for the maintenance of the National road network not only helped to ensure routine maintenance
of road network but also provided employment opportunities for about 3,041 inhabitants along the
roads (against 3,000 targeted by the end of the project). It is therefore essential to continue to
expand such programs to cover the entire road network Rwanda for sustainable maintenance
management of road network.

40.     Human Resource Capacity Development: The Project was success in creating a total of
283 cooperatives of road side dwellers and trained 11,322 rural people to carry out routine
maintenance works. Again under the project about 52 professional were trained at postgraduate
level road transport studies leading to MSc degrees. The development of human capital to an
acceptable and stable stage is a continuous process. It is not clear whether the human resource
development initiatives will continue after the completion of the project. For sustainability on the
provision of sector governance, policy, planning support and institutional reform and technical
assistance, the human capacity building process needs continuation and pick up by the follow-on
TSDP.

41.      Sustainability of the Road Maintenance Management: The total estimated maintenance
requirements for the roads (and bridges) to be funded by the RMF is approximately US$130
million per year, approximately five times the existing total revenue of US$ 35 million raised from
existing charges and sources. It is not clear how RMF will generate additional funds for the
maintenance of National Road network in Rwanda. Again, the expansion of mandate of RMF to
cover District Class 1 roads was done without making provisions of additional financing for
institution. In order to retain the core functions of the Road Maintenance Fund, there is a necessity
to provide it with a strong financial base commensurate to the mandate. It is therefore essential to
devise clear strategy to mobilize additional funds for maintenance management of National road
network in a sustainable manner.

42.     Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators of the Projects: The project was successful in
developing key indicators and targets for all four components of the project. However, there were
some inconsistencies in definition of Good road between the Common Appraisal Performance
Framework (CAPF) of RTDA and the Project Appraisal document. According to CAPF a paved
road is considered to be in Good condition if average IRI is less than 4m/km. On the other hand,
criterion for Good condition for a paved road in the Project Appraisal Document is IRI less than
3m/km. This anomaly in the definition of Good condition resulted in wrong information about the
percentage of paved road in Good condition in all previous interim ICR of the project. It is


                                                 75
therefore essential to adopt a common criteria to define Good condition for paved road network of
Rwanda.

                      COMMENTS OF BORROWER ON DRAFT ICR

1.       We reviewed the document and found most of the text reflecting the reality of the project
during implementation. However, on behalf of Director General (DG) RTDA we would like to
attract your attention to Page 32, Paragraph 121 of the draft ICR talking about "Bank Engagement
with RTDA". We believe this paragraph does not convey a fair assessment and hence request its
re-phrasing and advice to further engage with RTDA basing on the following:

       (a)     Two components of the TSDP, namely Sector Governance and Policy Support and
               Sector Analysis and Planning Support were provided to assist the Transport Sector
               in Rwanda to grow and mature after the Tutsi Genocide and war, both of which had
               affected transport infrastructure and sector institutions. It is our understanding that
               the progress made through TSDP should be consolidated through future programs
               and projects that should further strengthen the Transport Sector in general and
               RTDA in particular. Not engaging with RTDA would rather be against the required
               objective of strengthening the Transport Sector by having a dedicated
               implementing agency for Transport Infrastructure Development.
       (b)     Since 2014, RTDA has embarked on a number of reforms to effectively implement
               its mandate of looking after Transport Infrastructure Development in Rwanda and
               respond to the obligatory requirements. These reforms resulted from experience in
               implementing different projects including TSDP and we believe they should rather
               be supported to produce expected outcomes. The set-up of SPIU and upgrading the
               salary scheme have attracted new and competent staff which is a solution to the
               high staff turnover at all levels of the RTDA structure during TSDP implementation.
               For instance, the procurement personnel has increased from 3 to 9 people including
               3 consultants (2 locals and 1 international) and improvement is significant.
       (c)     In end 2014, the majority of RTDA staff (mostly newly recruited SPIU staff)
               underwent a contract management and procurement training for 3 weeks to build
               their project management capacity. From March 2015, an international
               procurement consultant with World Bank experience is working with RTDA to
               provide on-job capacity building for procurement staff as well as for the Internal
               Tender Committee.

2.     In addition, in the paragraph 119 of the draft ICR, RTDA is rated as MODERATELY
UNSATISFACTORY and we do not agree with the rating. The project has seen a number of
challenges in implementation but it attained its objectives and improvement reforms were
underway at the time of closure. This should have been taken into consideration in the assessment
of RTDA. We provided our comments in the attached draft ICR for your consideration.

                          Annex 10. Institutional Status of the RTDA

   Initial institutional arrangement for the TSDP

1.      In 2007, the Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP) was initially designed to be
implemented by the Program and Projects Management Cell (PPMC) that was under the Ministry
of Infrastructure (MININFRA) created then to manage the East Africa Trade and Transport
Facilitation Project (EATTFP) also financed by the World Bank. A separate Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), under MININFRA, was in place to manage three projects financed by
the African Development Bank. Transport infrastructure projects financed by the European Union
(EU) were managed by a PIU established under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.
The government of Rwanda’s financed projects, mainly in maintenance operations, were managed
under the Ministry of Infrastructure in the department of road maintenance. The overall World
Bank portfolio managed by the PPMC was amounting to $US84million with 10 staff including a
Coordinator, Procurement Specialist, M&E Specialist, 2 Road Engineers, Environmental
Specialist, Financial Specialist, Accountant and Administrative Assistant. Salaries were ranging
from around $US1,836 for specialists/engineers to $US2,209 for the coordinator and were paid
through the World Bank funded projects.

   Creation of RTDA and operational challenges

2.      To better coordinate the transport sector, the Rwanda Transport Development Agency
(RTDA) was created on 20th January 2010, under the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA),
with a mission to manage all day to day aspects of the transport sector in Rwanda. RTDA was
given a legal personality as well as administrative and financial autonomy. The management of all
transport projects, including TSDP, was then transferred to the newly created agency. Salaries
were aligned to the Government of Rwanda payment scheme for civil servants that was then
allocating around $690 to Specialists/Engineers and $US1,270 for Division Managers who were
tasked to be the World Bank projects Coordinators. The RTDA structure included a Division of
Development under which rehabilitation of the Kigali-Ruhengeri road was managed, Division of
Planning under which studies and MSc program were managed, Division of Maintenance under
which routine maintenance with Local Community Associations (LCAs) as well as periodic
maintenance were managed and the Division of Corporate Services responsible for procurement
and financial activities.

3.       The reduction in remuneration resulted in the high turnover of RTDA staff in its early stage
that negatively affected projects including TSDP. For instance, from 2010 to 2013 all previously
projects management staff, including the coordinator, left RTDA except the M&E specialist and
one road engineer who were assigned other RTDA managerial functions. In addition, other
important posts of RTDA saw a turnover as well including the post of Director General that was
occupied by four people between 2010 and 2013. The structural management of the TSDP, as well,
was not smoothly integrated into the RTDA structure. Newly RTDA recruited and inexperienced
staff, depending on their divisions, was given responsibility to manage standalone TSDP activities

                                                 79
which resulted in limited focus on the scope and overall progress of the project. Furthermore, the
Procurement Unit was made of three staff including its director who was not experimented in terms
of procurement for World Bank funded projects. Between 2010 and 2014, the RTDA budget
ranged from RWF33Billion to RWF114Billion implying a big number of procurement activities
and lengthy processes due to limited staff.

   RTDA reforms

4.      In 2014, RTDA conducted functional institutional review to provide with decision makers
a Reform Proposal to deliver its mandate in the most effective way. The recommendations of the
review included: (i) complete restructuring of RTDA and increase of its salary scheme, (ii)
provision of regular specific trainings to RTDA staff, (iii) creation of a Single Project
Implementation Unit (SPIU) that would be well staffed and specifically tasked to implement
projects that are externally funded as well as (iv) creation of well functioning processes and
systems. Since July 2014, all the above recommendations were implemented. The restructuring of
the Rwanda Transport Development Agency is at its final stage and the SPIU was created within
the agency (see Figure 1 and 2). There was an increase of wages at the agency level and SPIU
staff is recruited on a performance contract basis with good salaries compared to the market.
Currently, RTDA has 6 procurement specialists supported by 2 local procurement experts with
experience in World Bank funded programs/projects. From October to December 2014, the
majority of RTDA staff mainly in project management positions underwent an intensive training
in Procurement and Contract Management by an internationally recognised trainer who also
worked for the World Bank.

   Way forward

5.      As recommended in the RTDA Functional Review, strengthening of the human resource
capacity coupled with the establishment of proper systems and processes will progressively be
implemented. For the time being, road and bridge design manuals for Rwanda were prepared and
adopted for use (with TSDP financing), the procurement manual for RTDA is under final stage
and on-job training for project managers and procurement staff, through skills transfer from a full-
time international expert in procurement and contract management, is undergoing since March
2015. Well-tailored short-term training clinics are also envisaged to be provided by two long term
(2 years) experts in Road Infrastructure Management and M&E who are currently under
recruitment with AfDB financing. Their job descriptions will highlight the need to provide on-job
trainings to cover identified capacity gaps and upscale hands-on skills. A Young Engineers and
Skills Development Program (YESDP) involving 12 graduates is underway and will include
secondment to contractors and consulting firms to create a pool of good engineers in near future.
The RTDA laboratory building is being refurbished and new equipment will be delivered by end
September 2015 under the EU financing. The detailed RTDA capacity building plan, including
sustainability of the YESDP, is under preparation and will be shared with all stakeholders for input
and assistance.
