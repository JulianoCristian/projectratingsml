                         Implementation Status Overview
                         i). Overall implementation progress continued to improve with over about 80 percent of IDA/ACGF grants being disbursed, as of end of December 2011. The rehabilitation of the
                         Kigali-Ruhengeri road project is progressing well with the pavement works being completed over 74 km of the 82 km and open to traffic, as at end of November 2011.
                         Implementation of sector strategy and institutional development activities is gaining momentum. The preparation of a Transport Sector Master Plan is near completion; the post
                         graduate program by Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in transportation studies was launched, in October 2011; and Technical Assistance in the field of infrastructure

                         ii). RTDA has taken up its mandate to manage transport development and MININFRA continued to progressively release responsibility for managing road development projects. In
                         October 2011, the Cabinet has designated board members for RTDA and the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF), and this will help to establish performance agreement between

                         iii). The training of 283 road side communities was completed and Local Community Associations (LCAs) were formed to be engaged in road maintenance works. The engagement
                         of LCAs has started with 10 community based road maintenance contracts, providing employment opportunities for about 500 people. Preparatory activities to sign maintenance
                         contracts with LCAs and micro-enterprises, which would enable to engage about 3,100 people, are in progress. In addition, road maintenance works by local contractors is in
                         progress over 277 km of roads.
