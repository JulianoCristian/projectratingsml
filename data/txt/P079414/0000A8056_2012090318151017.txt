                         Project (TSDP) and the maintenance works to the Local Community Associations(LACs) is scaled up and sustained. The project has surpassed its intended target for increasing the
                         proportion of the paved roadsnetwork in good and fair condition ( the target was to have over 50 percent in good and fair condition). The substantialcompletion of the Kigali to
                         Ruhengeri road rehabilitation has contributed to the objective of providing reliable access to about2.1 million people living along this main regional corridor. The engagement of LCAs

                         Component 1 – Paved Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance: Theasphalt concrete wearing course was completed on the entire road length (83.1 km). Overall, the works are about
                         96 percentcompleted, and upon completion of the remaining defects correction and road furniture the contract will reach substantialcompletion stage. The three multi-year
                         maintenance contracts with a total length of 277 km are in progress. RTDA and RMF haveconcluded maintenance contracts with LCAs, in a form of community contracting for
                         maintenance of about 801 km of roads. Inaddition, LCAs are carrying out maintenance works on two multi-year maintenance contracts. MININFRA, under the TSDP, has created

                         maintenance works could be contracted and completed before the grant closing date of December 2013.
