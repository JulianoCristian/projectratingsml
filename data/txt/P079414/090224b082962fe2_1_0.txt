Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This is the last ISR of the Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP). It is based on the preliminary assessment of the performance of the four
 components of the project. About 95 percent of the paved roads network continues to remain in good condition, and the project has surpassed its
 intended original target (of 50 percent by the end of the project). The completion of the Kigali to Ruhengeri road rehabilitation has contributed to the
 objective of providing reliable access to about 2.1 million people living along this main regional corridor. The engagement of Local Community
 Associations (LCAs) for the maintenance of the national road network has helped to provide employment opportunities for 3,041 inhabitants along the
 roads (against 3,000 targeted by the end of the project). RMF, RTDA and the Districts now need to sustain the engagement of the LCAs to ensure that
 these gains are not lost after the closure of the project.
 As of November 30, 2014, the project had disbursed (from IDA Grant (H331-RW), ACGF TF090451 and IDA Credit 4968) a cumulative amount of
 US$55.32 million (92.2% percent of total grant, credit and TF). The project is expected to disburse most of the remaining balance by the closing date of
 December 31, 2014, with US$ 3.7 million in payment processing as the final price escalation invoice under the Kigali-Ruhengeri road.
 The closing date for the project was extended from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 to enable completion of the pending activities. These
 included the second batch of Masters’ Program in Engineering supported by the TSDP which will be delivered by December 2014. The defects liability
 period for the Kigali-Ruhengiri road rehabilitation contract was also extended to December 30, 2014 due to corrective actions identified following the
 technical audit of the project conducted in November 2013. All the corrective measures have been completed by contractor under the World Bank
 financed contract. The remaining corrections are part of a separate contract on emergency works triggered due to landslides and is financed by the
 government's own resources. RTDA has confirmed the final handover by December 30, 2014. In addition, the road safety audit, the study to finalize the
 road fund allocation formulae, and road and bridge design manual preparation will be completed by December 31, 2014. All the studies are on track and
 stakeholder workshops were held in Kigali to discuss the final draft of the Design Manual and Road Safety Audit on Decemeber 16 and 17, 2014
 respectively.

         The project has effectively created local community associations (LCAs) which have been in charge of regular maintenance on
         national roads. Ministry of Infrastructure through the TSDP recruited 2 local consulting firms, in 2008, to set-up local community
         associations (LCAs). In total 283 cooperatives of road side dwellers have been created and trained on the whole national classified
         road network, and this resulted in creation and of 3041 sustainable jobs.

         This is the percentage of total national rural population. The projects brings benefit to 19 percent of rual population living within 2km of project
         roads. When the project started in 2006/2007 no data was collected for this core indicator as baseline. The project did not involve
         construction/rehabilitation of any new roads and the target is therefore estimated using the estimated access to about 2.1 million rural population
         living within 2 km of the road calculated as a percentage of the overall national rural population.

               The project did not construct any new roads rather rehabilitated and maintained the existing roads. After the rehabilitation and
               maintenance of project roads, 2.1 m rural population living within 2 km have benefited. As there was no baseline data collected at
               project preparation, this number represents the current estimated population living around the project.
