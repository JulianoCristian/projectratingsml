                         Project Development Objective: The Project Development Objective (PDO) is considered to be achieved as the key outcome indicators of (i)50% of paved roads in good condition
                         (average IRI less than 3.0 m/km) is met since the proportion of paved roads in good condition has reached 95 percent; and (ii) Number of sustained jobs generated annually from
                         road maintenance works has also been met as already about 3041 people organized under Local Community Associations (LCAs) are engaged in maintenance. Further, the
                         substantial completion of the Kigali to Ruhengeri road rehabilitation has contributed to the objective of providing reliable access to about 2.1 million people- direct project
