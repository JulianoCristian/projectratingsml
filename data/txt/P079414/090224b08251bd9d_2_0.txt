                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the second to the last ISR of the Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP). It is based on the preliminary assessment of the performance of the four components of the
                         project.

                         About 95 percent of the paved roads network is in good condition, and the project has surpassed its intended original target (of 50 percent by the end of the project). The completion

                         of the Kigali to Ruhengeri road rehabilitation has contributed to the objective of providing reliable access to about 2.1 million people living along this main regional corridor. The
                         engagement of Local Community Associations (LCAs) for the maintenance of the national road network has helped to provide employment opportunities for about 3,041 inhabitants
                         along the roads. Road Maintenance Fund(RMF), Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA) and the Districts now need to sustain the engagement of LCAs to ensure that
                         these gains are not lost after the closure of the project.

                         As of April 4, 2014, the project had disbursed (from IDA Grant (H331-RW), ACGF TF090451 and IDA Credit 4968) a cumulative amount of US$ 55,317,012.54 (92.2% percent of total
                         grant, credit and TF). Provided that the on-going project activities are implemented in a timely manner, it is anticipated that the project will disburse another US$ 4.1 million by end of
                         June 2014, and remaining balance by end December 2014 (project closing date).

                         On the request of the Borrower, the project was restructured on December 16, 2013 and the closing date was revised to December 31, 2014, resulting in cumulative extension of 30
                         months. This was a Level Two restructuring, an approval in Principle for the request to extend the closing date was received on October 2, 2013. Project restructuring involved
                         reallocation of funds from activities that did not have impact on the achievement of the PDO, and revised the Results Framework to reflect the changes. The changes simplified the
                         indicators better aligned with actual data collected; and targets that were achievable and made sense to work on in the current state of transport sector in Rwanda. All changes to the
                         indicators ad their rationale are explained in the Annex to the Restructuring Paper. Reallocation of funds among disbursement categories was done to utilize funds from completed or
                         dropped activities that had not fully disbursed their allocated budget to activities in need of funds that were still under implementation. The changes included: (a) Drop the
                         maintenance of the Huye-Kitabi road that is under rehabilitation through other financing arrangements being undertaken by the GoR; (b) Reallocate funds from activities that have
                         been carried out using RTDA in-house resources and through support from other development partners.

                         The one-year extension offers adequate time to complete the remaining activities which include procurement of Technical Assistance for the Preparation of Roads and Bridges
                         Manual. A retendering was required, which is in the process of technical evaluation at present. The closing date extension will also enable completion of the ongoing second batch of
                         Masters’ Program in Engineering supported by the TSDP, which is estimated to be completed by July 2014. The defects liability period for the Kigali-Ruhengiri road rehabilitation
                         contract was also extended into September 2014 due ongoing corrective actions. Based on the defect corrections and discussion on contract price escalation on the Kigali-Ruhengiri
                         road (due to re-measured final quantities of works at completion), it is anticipated that the final payment could be made around June 2014. In addition, the road safety audit is under
                         implementation along with the study to finalize the road fund allocation formulae, and updating the HR study for the RMF. Both studies are on track to complete within the remaining
                         time period.
