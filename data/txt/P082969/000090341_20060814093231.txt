A. STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE
1. Country andsector issues
1.    Key elements of The Gambia's poverty reduction strategy. Poverty in The Gambia i s
pervasive and largely a rural phenomenon. Two thirds o f Gambians live below the poverty line
while almost 40 percent o f the households are food poor. Three-quarters o f the poor live inrural
areas, where extreme poverty is increasing. The objective o f The Gambia's Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRSP) is to reduce disparities inaccess to sources o f income and empowerment, and is
articulated around five pillars: (i)the creation o f an enabling environment for economic growth
and poverty reduction; (ii)  enhancing the productive capacity and social protection o f the poor;
(iii)improving the coverage o f and access to basic social services; (iv) building the capacity o f
local communities and their organizations to play a greater role in poverty reduction; and (v)
mainstreaming cross-cutting poverty issues (Gender, Environment, Nutrition, HIV/AIDS, etc.).
The PRSP also emphasizes decentralizing the public sector and directly intervening at the
community level. However, recent poor economic performance has underminedprogress toward
both the PRSP and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2.    Key issues and constraints. Poverty in The Gambia i s much higher in rural areas, where it
has increased considerably since 1992. This situation arose despite being addressed in The
Gambia Poverty Reduction Strategy, and i s largely attributable to insufficient resources reaching
the poorest areas o f the country. Severe capacity constraints have limited the ability o f The
Gambia to identify, recruit, deploy, and retain high-calibre extension staff to tackle the multiple
determinants o f poverty. Outcomes inkey sectors reinforce this reality: agriculture i s constrained
by its lack of diversification; education lacks sufficient humancapital; health outcomes compare
poorly to neighbouring countries and are constrained by insufficient funding, lack o f qualified
personnel, and drug shortages.
3.    While the Local Government Act o f 2002 articulates a strong framework for
decentralization in the country, its implementation is lagging. Though participation and
community empowerment are seen as critical contributors to reducing poverty, they conflict with
entrenched interests and approaches that are top-down and supply-driven across the major
sectors. Political decentralization i s in place, with local elections occurring every four years.
Administrative decentralization i s only partially effective, with a fair amount o f deconcentration
o f line ministry staff outside o f Banjul, but with no functional devolution to date. Fiscal
decentralization instruments mandated by the Act are not utilized by either central or local
governments, leading to a massive financing gap for critical services at decentralized levels. At
ward and village levels, structures established under the Act are often not functional unless
provided with external support. These weaknesses translate into poor development outcomes at
decentralized levels, particularly in the poorest and most vulnerable localities and in the most
critical sectors.
4.    What the country is doing to address these issues. Some o f the key constraints identified
above also serve as potential catalysts to address poor development outcomes in rural areas. In
particular, the Government has established enabling legislation such as The Local Government
Act (2002) and the Audit and Finance Act (2004) in order to stimulate local development. The
Government has stated its commitment to a meaningful process o f devolution, whereby citizens,
local governments, and civil servants have the mandate, ability, andresources to achieve tangible
development results.

2. Rationalefor World Bankinvolvement
5.    Inorderto addressthe multiple determinants ofpoverty inruralareas, andinconsideration
o f the limited size o f the cofintry, the Government requested that the World Bank support a
multi-sectoral project based on the community-driven development approach. By supporting
communities and local governments, the proposed Community-Driven Development Project
(CDDP) provides a single mechanism for working across sectors. This will allow the project to
efficiently tackle some o f the priority issues affecting rural areas, particularly related to past
weaknesses associated with a centralized, supply-driven approach to poverty reduction. This
approach will transfer the requisite skills andresources to decentralized administrative structures
inorder to addresskeypoverty issues.
6.    The International Development Association's (IDA) support can help promote local
institutions as key partners in the local development process, be catalytic in helping to
consolidate a transparent and equitable resource allocation at the local level, and provide a
demonstration effect related to decentralization that could be supported by other donors. Inthis
vein, the proposed project will complement the efforts o f other development partners who
support rural development and decentralization (see Annex 2). The World Bank's comparative
advantage to support the CDDP lies in its long track record and corresponding technical
leadership with respect to community-driven development (CDD) approaches around the world.
3. Higherlevel objectives to which the projectcontributes
7.    As noted above and in Annex 1, The Gambia's first PRSP was articulated around five
pillars. A new PRSP is currently under preparation along the same lines. The current Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS, February 2003) supports three o f the five pillars: (i)improving an
enabling policy environment to promote growth and poverty reduction; (ii)improving the
coverage o f m e t basic social services needs; and (iii)building the capacity o f local
communities and civil society organizations (CSOs) to play an active role in the development
process. The proposed project addresses all three focus pillars in that it seeks to create an
environment conducive to growth and poverty reduction, empower rural communities to become
agents o f development, and aims to improve their access to quality social and economic services.
At the same time, the project addresses the other two pillars o f the PRSP (productive capacity
and cross-cutting issues). A new CAS is beingprepared inFiscalYear 2007 (the expected Board
Presentation i s inJune 2007)
8.    The project replaces two operations initially foreseen inthe FiscalYears 2003-2005 CAS: a
Community-Based Rural Development Project and a follow-up operation to the Participatory
Health, Nutrition, and Population Project. Based on lessons learned from previous support to
agricultural and health sectors, the World Bank and the Government agreed that future
operations would focus on downstream, decentralized support to the sectors. The participatory
assessment undertaken in preparation o f the current CAS and the growing importance o f rural
poverty in The Gambia further validate the proposed decentralized, multi-sectoral, and
community-driven approach.

2.  Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkey indicators
10. The project development objective is the following: Rural communities, inpartnership with
Local Government Authorities, plan, implement and maintain their priority social and economic
investments.
11. Keyoutcome indicators (disaggregated bygendedage group whenever possible) include:

    0   At least 70percent o fCommunity Subprojects' results are achieved;
    0   Satisfaction with the results o f the Community Subprojects increases by 10 percent each
        year insample targeted rural population up to 90 percent byYear 5;
    0   At least 70 percent o f Community Subprojects are fully functional two years after their
        completion.
3. Projectcomponents
12. The project will target 88 wards and approximately 600 villages in the six rural Local
Government Areas (LGAs) o f The Gambia, and will benefit a population estimated at 435,000
people, which i s about 50 percent o f rural population (See Section C.2 for details on the
decentralized administrative structures targeted by the project).
13. The project has three components: A) Community Development Facility, B) Capacity
strengthening for community development, and C) Project coordination, monitoring and
evaluation.
14. Component A: Community Development Facility (CDF) US$10.8 million (of which
                                                                     -
IDA US$9.2 million and PHRD US$0.5 million). The CDF will finance community-driven
activities identified on the basis o f a participatory strategic planning process. It provides an
opportunity for communities to take charge o f local development challenges through experience
with participatory planning, budgeting, financial management,            and implementation of
development activities. The project will be demand-driven, and participating villages and wards
will have an open menu o f social and economic activities, including capacity buildingactivities
andincome generating activities. Criteria and procedures for use o fthe CDF will be described in
detail in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The technical and fiduciary review o f the
activities will be placed at levels corresponding to their area o f implementation and their
complexity. The budget allocation for participating villages andwards will be determined with a
formula based on population and poverty levels. The investment envelope will be made known
at the outset o f the planning cycle. Each Local Government Authority will manage a project
designated sub-account to disburse grant allocations to villages and wards. Village and ward
development committees (VDCs and WDCs) will manage funds to implement their own
development plans. About five percent o f the CDF will be earmarked for a Good Governance
Facility, which will finance activities to strengthen accountability andtransparency related to the
project. Gambian CSOs will develop proposals and implement activities under the Good
Governance Facility.
15. ComponentB: StrengtheningCapacity for CommunityDevelopment                  - US$6.3   million
(of which IDA US$2.1 million and PHRD US$3.35 million). Capacity-building activities will
address the technical and fiduciary skills needed at the different decentralized levels to
implement local development activities. In particular, the component will: (i)develop the
capacity o f villages and wards to undertake participatory planningand resource allocation based
on a simple, results-oriented approach grounded in the principles o f community empowerment,


                                                  3

transparency, and ownership; (ii)      strengthen the capacity o f deconcentrated staff to facilitate
community-level development planning and investment; (iii)strengthen capacities o f Local
Government Authorities to effectively monitor local development plans and to manage and
account for funds provided to villages and wards for investment activities; (iv) provide limited
support for capacity building for key sectoral government agencies, geared toward strengthening
sectoral capacities to support community-level social and economic activities; (v) support
implementation o f the project's public outreach campaign; and (vi) support strengthening o f
environmental management capacity. Training packages for at least the first eighteen months o f
project activity will be definedbefore project effectiveness.
16. ComponentC: ProjectCoordination,MonitoringandEvaluation US$1.65 million(of
                                                                             -
which IDA US$0.45 million and PHRD US$0.95 million). The component will support a
Project Coordination Team (PCT) responsible for technical and fiduciary oversight o f the
project. It will be mainstreamed within the Department o f State for Local Government and Lands
(DOSLGL) and its size will be limited to core fbnctions critical to the project's success and for
which severe capacity constraints exist in the Gambian civil service (overall coordination,
monitoring and evaluation, and fiduciary matters). Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) will focus
on results-oriented data collection to inform decision-making and impact evaluation. It will
enable beneficiaries and DOSLGL to: monitor due diligence focused on whether project
implementation complies with fiduciary guidelines as well as with social and environmental
safeguard policies; monitor and evaluate achievement o f the development objectives; evaluate
whether the project's implementation approach will be sustainable and have the desired
outcomes; assess project impacts on local governance and decision-making;           and assess the
extent to which project activities empower marginalized groups (women and youth). The project
will finance fiduciary specialists both at the central level (one Financial Manager and one
Procurement Specialist) and at the decentralized level (one Financial Controller ineach of the six
Local Government Authorities).
4. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe projectdesign
17. The CDDP will support multi-sectoral community development. Its design adopts several
lessons from other CDD projects:
        (i)Project implementation should build, not undermine, local capacity. Establishing
        parallel structures for project implementation undermines sustainability and the transfer
        o f knowledge. Therefore, CDDP's implementation will be mainstreamed within
        Government structures.
        (ii)Empowering communities achieves better outcomes. Enabling beneficiaries to make
        decisions about -and act on- development opportunities enhances sustainability and
       builds capacity. Therefore, the CDDP will use community involvement as a catalyst to
        achieve project outcomes.
        (iii)Balance top-down with bottom-up. In order to improve outreach and ensure
        sustainability, it is crucial to find a good balance between community-led initiatives and
       national level responses to poverty reduction. The project will, therefore, provide support
       to central level for coordination andcapacity building.
        (iv) Make M&E meaningful. Project indicators should be focused, realistic, and results-
       oriented. Active collection and reflection on progress toward these objectives enables



                                                   4

        M&E to act as amanagement tool. The CDDP will fully incorporatethese lessons into its
        M&Esystem. (See SectionC3 for details).
        (v) Supply of services does not necessarily increase utilization rates. Experiences
        demonstrate the need to initiate specific activities to improve the knowledge of, and the
        demand for, services. The CDDP will focus capacity building efforts at decentralized
        levels on this issue.
        (vi) Capacity building is more efective if it is through learning by doing. Experiential
        learning i s an effective means to develop capacity and achieve sustainable results. The
        CDDP will adopt "learning by doing" throughout the project's activities, including the
        use o fthe Rapid Results Approach at decentralized levels.
5. Alternativesconsideredand reasonsfor rejection
18. Other instruments and approaches also considered were:

    0   Two freestanding operations were initiallyproposedinthe Fiscal Years 2003-2005 CAS: a
        Community-based Rural Development Project and a successor to the Participatory Health,
        Nutrition andPopulation Project. Inthe context of reduced IDA allocation for The Gambia
        and considering the small size o f the country (The Gambia is the smallest country o f
        continental Africa), the two operations were replaced by this multi-sectoral community-
        driven development project, considered as the best approach for working efficiently and
        effectively across sectors at decentralized levels.

    0   The choice o f an Adaptable Program Loan (APL)was discussed andrejected at the Project
        Concept stage. While an APL inprinciple ensures long-term commitment from the World
        Bank, it was considered that the small size o f the country does not require a phased
        approach. In addition, it was considered that the World Bank long-term commitment i s
        implicit inits support to the PRSP process.
C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements
19. The project will be co-financed by the Government o f Japan, which has made available a
co-financing grant o f US$4.8 million under its Policy and Human Resources Development
(PHRD) Fund. The PHRD co-financing grant will support up to 75 percent o fin-country training
and technical assistance for capacity building. The PHRD funds will be pooled with IDA funds
andthe closing date o fthe grant will coincide with the closing date o fthe project.
20. The project will coordinate its activities with the following donor-supported interventions
that are currently under preparation:
        The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) will provide support the
        Rural Finance Project, the successor to the ongoing Rural Finance and Community
        Initiatives Project (RFC1P)-expected     to close in December 2006. The Rural Finance
       Project i s expected to concentrate on the development o f Micro-Finance Institutions
        (MFI) at decentralized levels.     It will provide on-demand capacity development to
        communities and individuals willing to engage in economic activities that can be
        supported byMFIs.The Rural FinanceProject i s expected to become effective in2007.




                                                  5

       The African Development Bank (AfDB) will support the Entrepreneurship Development
       and Livelihoods Promotion (EDLPP) project. This project is expected to become
       effective in early 2007, and i s anticipated to be a grant o f about US$12 million. The
       project will focus on support to MFIs and to entrepreneurship activities nationwide.
       The European Commission (EC) i s preparing a program o f Support to Decentralization
       and Local Development. The program, currently being prepared, is expected to start in
       2007. It will buildon lessons learned from the implementation o f the EC-funded Support
       to Decentralization and Rural Development Project, closed in2004. It is expected that the
       EC project, with an estimated allocation o f Euro 5 million (about US$6.0 million), would
       focus on policy reforms and institutional capacity building related to deepening
       decentralization inThe Gambia.

2.2 ImplementationArrangements
23. The project will be housed at the DOSLGL. Its implementation structure will comprise: (i)
a Project Steering Committee (PSC); (ii)Project Coordination Team (PCT); and (iii) staff
                                                 a                                              field
comprising Community Development Officers (CDOs) and Agents (CDAs), and extension
workers o f various governmental agencies.
24. The PSCwill be responsible for the overall coordination andpolicy guidance o fthe project.
It will reflect the multi sectoral nature o f the project, and will include representatives o f inter
alia: Department o f State for Finance and Economic Affairs (DoSFEA), DoSLGL, Department
o f State for Agriculture (DoSA), Department o f State for Health and Social Welfare (DoSHSW),
Department o f State for Water Resources (DoSWR), Department o f State for Education (DOSE),
National Nutrition Agency (NaNA), NGO representatives, and The Gambian Association o f
Local Government Authorities (GALGA). The PSC will be responsible for: (i)                approving the
project's annual work plan and budget prepared by the project coordination team; (ii)          providing
overall co-ordination and policy advice; and (iii)    approving subsequent updates o f the PIM. The
PSC will meet at least quarterly. It will be chaired by the Permanent Secretary o f DOSLGL and
have the Project Coordinator as Secretary. The exact composition and terms o f reference o f the
PSC will be defined inthe PIM.



                                                     7

25. The PCT will be responsible for the day-to-day coordination o f the project, including
oversight o f all technical, social, environmental, fiduciary, and administrative matters. It will be
located in the DOSLGL, whose mandate includes decentralization reforms and community
development issues. This arrangement will ensure skills transfer within an appropriate
institutional context, which leads to a higher likelihood o f sustainability once the project closes.
26. At the central level, the key staff o f the PCT will comprise: (i) Project Coordinator; (ii)
                                                                        the
the CDF Manager (Component A); (iii) Capacity BuildingManager (Component B); (iv) the
                                           the
M&E Specialist (Component C); (v) the Procurement Specialist; (vi) the Financial Manager;
(vii) the Administrative Assistant, and (viii) the Accountant.      In addition, in each of the six
targeted LGAs, the project will recruit a Financial Controller to provide technical assistance to
the Local Government Authority and to ensure compliance o f financial management with the
provisions o f the PIM. The PCT will report to DOSLGL's Permanent Secretary. The CDF
Manager will be the Environmental Focal Point inthe PCT.
27. The CDDP field staff (notably the cadre o f DOSLGL CDAs and CDOs as well as
extension staff o f various agencies) will be responsible for coordinating the project activities at
village and ward levels. The project will build upon the successful model o f the Multi-
Disciplinary Facilitation Teams (MDFTs), which bring together extension workers from
government agencies and NGOs to address development issues at village and ward levels.
Annual work plans will be usedto coordinate project activities at local level. DOSLGL staff will
assist with the identification and provision o f support services by relevant sectoral line
departments on a demand-driven basis.            Significant capacity building activities will be
undertaken at the inception o f the project in order to strengthen the skills and abilities o f field
staff to effectively play these roles. An environmental focal point will be nominated within each
MDFT for the purpose o f the implementation o f the Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF).
28. Villages and wards will take the lead in identifying and implementing development
activities, with support from the project field staff, Their respective VDCs and WDCs will
coordinate and monitor development planning and implementation o f identified activities. They
will leverage the requisite resources to undertake project activities, including mobilizing
community traditional leadership, civil society organizations, andthe private sector.
2.3 Flow of Funds
29. Local Government Authorities will be responsible for disbursing the formula-based grants
for development activities at village and ward levels. Each Local Government Authority will set
up a designated sub-account to receive project funds for the purpose o f disbursing grants.
Disbursements o f funds from Local Government Authorities to villages and wards will be based
on a tripartite agreement signed by the village/ward, the Local Government Authorities and the
CDDP. The tripartite agreement will include the village/ward development plan and the
indicative list and costing o f sub-projects (see also Annex 7 Appendix 3). The VDCs and WDCs
will be responsible for the management o f financial and procurement aspects related to their
grant allocation. VDCs and WDCs will request f h d replenishments to their respective Local
Government Authority on the basis o f physical progress, certified by the relevant C D M D F T .
Disbursements to VDC and WDC will be effected by the local Project Financial Controller and
the ChiefExecutive Officer.




                                                  8

30. Local Government Authorities, via the project Financial Controller at LGA level, will
submit replenishment requests to the PCT accompanied by a schedule detailing resources to be
used for: (i)facilitation o f planning and technical backstopping o f identified development
activities by MDFTs; and (ii)   transfers to VDCs and WDCs to finance approved development
activities.
3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results
31. Monitoring and evaluation i s seen as a key part o f the CDDP implementation process.
Annex 3 outlines the indicators to measure the achievement o f the project's development
objective and intermediate outcomes. The project's M&E will be geared toward tracking the
CDDP's key outcomes and results. The system will be results-oriented and conceived as a
management tool to be used by both project staff and participating communities. The M&E
system will be oriented towards: (i)   Monitoring due diligence, focused on compliance with the
PIM; (ii)  Monitoring and evaluating the achievement o f development objectives and outcomes;
(iii)Assessing sustainability of outcomes; (iv) Assessing impact on local governance and
decision-making; (v) Evaluating the level o f empowerment o f marginalized groups (women and
youth); and (vi) Monitoring compliance with the ESMF and the Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF).
32. An M&E Specialist in the PCT will supervise all M&E activities under the project, be
responsible for ensuring quality control o f data from decentralized levels, and take the lead in
compiling the data for quarterly reporting. The Financial Manager will be responsible for
analyzing the data related to fiduciary matters. All technical and financial data will be captured
in a Management Information System (MIS). A mid-term evaluation will be carried out at the
latest 30 months from the date o fproject effectiveness.
33. At the LGA level, the focus o f M&E will be on fiduciary aspects, particularly with respect
to monitoring the use o f funds at village and ward levels. This function will be monitored by the
project Financial Controller in each LGA. The Capacity Building Manager will monitor the
technical aspects o f implementation, including the LGA, ward, and village capacity building
activities. The project staff will also monitor outcomes related to the coordination function
assigned to the LGA's TAC.
34. At village and ward levels, citizens will use Participatory M&E to track the progress with
respect to desired outcomes and results they have identified as part o f the Development Planning
process. This level o f M&E will be self-standing, inthat it will be managed by the communities
themselves and will utilize the community scorecard approach, with technical support from
CDAs when necessary. Fiduciary and technical audits will be undertaken within samples o f
participating villages to ensure compliance with PIM procedures. Baseline data for the purpose
o f impact evaluation will be collected, in treatment and control villages, by a third party before
project activities begin. CDAs and CDOs will coordinate data collection referring to the
intermediate outcomes at village and ward levels, and will provide periodic reports to the PCT
for management andreporting purposes.
4. Sustainability
35. Project sustainability is based on three justifications. First, the design and implementation
arrangements for the project are grounded in the Local Government Act o f 2002 (See Section
C.2 for details). While this legislation demonstrates The Government o f The Gambia's overall



                                                 9

commitment to decentralization, the CDDP provides the necessary catalyst to put portions o f The
Act into action through its focused support to lower institutional levels (inparticular villages and
wards). Admittedly, strong political will at central level will be critical for these gains to be
realized and sustained, particularly once the project closes. Other donors strengthening their
support for decentralization, particularly as the project phases out, will also contribute
significantly to sustainability.
36. Second, the project will avoid creating parallel structures at the levels o f coordination and
implementation, given that it will strengthen the capacities o f the Local Government Authorities,
WDCs, and VDCs. Existing staff of the Government Departments o f State will be integral to
project implementation,          including Local Government Authorities'             civil servants and
deconcentrated extension workers from line ministries. The project's significant focus on
capacity building is geared toward skills enhancement of civil servants and citizens who will
participate inproject activities.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economicandfinancialanalyses
39. The project comprises three components, o f which Component A (Community
Development Facility) will have direct economic or social impact on the beneficiaries,
Component B (StrengtheningCapacity for Community Development) will contribute directly to
these benefits, while Component C (Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation) will be a
precondition for delivering the project outputs under Components A and B as planned and
achieving the desired impact. Given the demand-driven nature o f the project, it is not possible to
determine beforehand the type andmix o fprojects that will be implementedby the communities.
Furthermore, the benefits o f many social investments may be difficult or impossible to quantify
in monetary terms. A meaningful quantification of project costs and benefits is, therefore,
difficult. However, on the basis o f existing ward and village development plans and making
conservative assumptions regarding the economic returns o f likely subprojects, the economic rate
of return (ERR) has been calculated for various scenarios (see Annex 9). Taking into account the
quantifiable benefits under Component A, the ERR for the whole project i s estimated at about
6.4 percent. The ERR increases to 15.3 percent (net present value: US$1.39 million), ifthe costs
of only Component A are included inthe analysis. Given the fact that capacity buildingprojects
are generally not subject to economic analysis, as they only yield longer-term, intangible
benefits, the project can bejustified on the grounds o f the ERR for Component A, particularly as
many social benefits that directly contribute to improved livelihoods o f the rural poor have not
been captured by the analysis.
2. Technical
40. The guiding premise o f the CDDP is that there i s considerable latent technical and
managerial capacity at the local level, which can be released through a participatory strategic
planningprocess that is followed with a predictable investment envelope to finance activities. In
addition, because the anticipated investments will likely be simple infrastructure, local artisans
and entrepreneurs have sufficient technical knowledge and experience to implement andmanage
them. The technical quality o f subprojects would be ensured by: (i)     allowing communities to
choose activities and technologies they are familiar with; (ii)   allowing communities to procure
technical assistance from the public or private sector if they choose to do so; and (iii)ensuring


                                                   12

that deconcentrated sectoral extension workers (MDFTs) and the expertise o f line agencies
would be available to assist communities with guidance on issues related to their specific
technical disciplines. Activities related to the different sectors would be carried out within the
respective policy framework and general guidelines o fthe Government.
3. Fiduciary
3.1 FinancialManagement
41. A financial management assessment was carried out to determine whether the project
implementing agencies at the central and local levels have acceptable financial management
arrangements. The conclusion o f the assessment i s that, in order to satisfy the World Bank's
minimum requirements under OP/BP 10.02, the financial management arrangements for the
project need to be improved before project effectiveness. Strengthening o f financial management
arrangements shall be achieved with the implementation o f the action planprovided in appendix
1o fAnnex 7. Key actions identified are: (i) o fthe PCT and the LGA with qualified and
                                                staffing
experienced Financial Controllers; (ii)   elaboration and adoption o f a PIM in form and substance
satisfactory to IDA; (iii)setting up accounting software; and (iv) appointment o f external
auditors with experience and qualifications satisfactory to IDA. Once the action plan i s
implemented, the financial management arrangement will be adequate to provide, with
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status o f the project as required by
IDA.
3.2 Procurement
42. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), carried out in The Gambia in
October 1998, flagged the main issues such as the lack o f capacity regarding the Recipient's
staff, the absence o f standardbiddingdocuments at the national level, the insufficient capacity o f
local contractors for contracts subject to International Competitive Bidding (ICB),                and
corruption. Recommendations were made to address these issues. The World Bank, through the
Capacity Buildingand Economic Management Project (CBEMP), provided support to strengthen
the Recipient's capacity in procurement, modernize the procurement process and improve
regulation (approval o f Gambia Public Procurement Act).         Thanks to this plan, some o f the
issues, such as training staff responsible for procurement and designing standard bidding
documents, including provisions in the Code against corruption have been addressed.
Nonetheless, the situation remains risky.
43. A CPIP has been carried out in2005 as anupdate o f the CPAR but the report is not yet
commentedby the Government and subsequently and actionplanwith clear recommendations
(capacity building, institutional reinforcement through a regulatory body, an appeal body,
strengthening o f the private sector, judiciary reinforcement, etc.) i s not yet discussed and agreed.

Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement
44. Procurement activities will be carried out by the Project Coordination Unit located in the
DOSLGL. The project procurement functions will be assured by a Procurement Specialist.
Given the difficulty o f finding qualified procurement specialists in The Gambia, the CDDP
Procurement Specialist, recruited on a competitive basis, will be eligible for short-term
consulting fees. The recruitment o f the procurement specialist, and other key staff inthe project,
i s condition o fproject effectiveness.



                                                   13

45. An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement
actions for the project reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the
interactionbetween the project's staff responsible for procurement and the Government's central
unitfor administration andfinance.
46. The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation o f the project have
been identified and include lack o f experience in World Bank procurement procedures and
insufficient capacity at the local level. The corrective measures which have been agreed are: (i)
recruitment o f a highly qualified procurement specialist knowledgeable o f World Bank
guidelines; (ii)training o f project, LGA staff and communities on procurement issues; and (iii)
preparation o f a PIM which defines the procurement methods and procedures for community-
based contracting;      standard bidding documents for N C B, small works and consulting
assignments and (iv) Frequent supervision and control from the main procurement specialist to
advice local communities responsible on all procurement matters.
47. The overall project risk for procurement is high.

4. Social
48. A social and gender assessment was financed as part o fproject preparation, and outlines the
key opportunities, constraints, and prospective impacts and risks arising out o f The Gambia's
socio-cultural and political context, particularly in rural areas. The CDDP design draws from
these recommendations, and builds upon the country's rich legacy with respect to participatory
and demand-driven development activities at community level. Project design also responds to
the institutional opportunity to work in concert with LGAs to develop their capacity to support
community-driven initiatives. The design also reflects concern raised in the social and gender
assessment with respect to the issue o f inclusion, particularly o f women and youth in decision-
making and access to resources. The CDDP strategic planning methodology is broadly
participatory and geared toward fostering inclusion throughout all stages o f project work at the
local level. This approach will give voice to those who are typically on the margins, and enable
them to have meaningfulroles in articulating the community's future andputtingthat vision into
action through the project's CDF. Existing leadership structures at the village level, notably the
VDC, will be validated for their representativeness and leadership qualities during the planning
process supported by the project. This approach will mitigate exclusionary and elite captured
entities that would diminish the project's ability to promote transparency, inclusion, and
strengthened village governance. Mechanisms to monitor inclusiveness, satisfaction with project
outcomes, transparency, and local governance are also developed in the M&E framework, and
will be disaggregated by gender inorder to take corrective action when necessary. Inaddition to
conventional M&E, communities themselves will monitor progress with respect to these
indicators through the use o f community scorecards.
49. Project preparation has been broadly participatory. A Core Team,                    comprising
representatives of government agencies and civil society organizations, has overseen the project
design, including oversight o f the social and gender assessmerit and the ESMF.              These
assessments, in addition to field visits by project preparation staff, engaged various stakeholders
at community and local government levels in technical discussions to vet the proposed project
design. These stakeholders, particularly at village and LGA level, will be the leading actors in
project implementation.



                                                 14

5. Environment
50. Under Component A, the CDDP will finance community-driven activities which will be
identified on the basis o f a participatory strategic planning process. Activities are likely to
include sub-projects such as: construction and rehabilitation o f feeder roads, health care
facilities, andvaccination parks; and activities related to improvements inagricultural production
and thus an increased use o f pesticides. Based on experience with similar sub-projects, potential
negative environmental and social impacts are likely to include soil erosion, water and soil
pollution, loss o f vegetation, increase in solid and liquid waste, including medical waste,
pesticide poisoning, andpesticide residues inthe food chain.
51. Since the locations and potential negative localized impacts o f the future sub-projects were
not known at appraisal, the Recipient has prepared an ESMF that outlines an environmental and
social screening process for sub-projects and includes: i)Guidelines for an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP); ii)Environmental Guidelines for Contractors; iii)a summary o f the
World Bank's safeguard policies; iv) a Pest Management Plan (PMP); andv) a National Medical
Waste Management Plan (NMWMP). A RPF was prepared for identifying and mitigating
potential negative environmental and social impacts at the sub-project planning stage. The RPF
outlines the policies and procedures to be followed in the event that sub-projects require land
acquisition. To ensure that the sub-projects are implemented in an environmentally and socially
sustainable manner, the ESMF formulates recommendations to strengthen environmental
management capacity, as well as implementation and monitoring o f corrective measures. Annex
10provides further detail on the ESMF and RPF.
52. In coordination with the PCT, the day-to-day monitoring activities will be carried out by
technical agents o f the MDFT, the LGAs and V D C to follow-up on environmental and social
indicators andthe implementation o f corrective measures, ifnecessary.

6. Safeguardpolicies
53. The project has triggered (i) 4.01 Environmental Assessment due to future construction
                                   OP
and rehabilitation activities as well as potential impacts related to medical waste management;
(ii)OP4.09 PestManagementduetothepotentialincreaseintheuseofpesticidestoimprove
agricultural production; and (iii)OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement due to the potential need for
land acquisition for future sub-projects. The safeguard screening category is S2, and the
environmental screening category is B.
54. In an effort to address potential negative environmental and social impacts o f future sub-
projects, the Recipient has prepared an ESMF and an RPF. Both documents have been approved
and disclosed inThe Gambia andat the World Bank's InfoShop onFebruary 17,2006.
55. The ESMF outlines an environmental and social screening process for sub-projects and
includes: (i)Guidelines for an EMP; (ii)       Environmental Guidelines for Contractors; (iii)a
Summary o f the World Bank's safeguard policies; (iv) a PMP; and (v) a NMWMP.
56. The RPF outlines the policies and procedures to be followed inthe event that sub-projects
require land acquisition.

1.1Key elementsof The Gambia's poverty reductionstrategy
1.    Poverty in The Gambia is pervasive and i s largely a rural phenomenon. Two thirds o f
Gambians live below the poverty line while almost 40 percent o f the households are food poor.
Three-quarters o f the poor live inrural areas, where extreme poverty i s increasing. The objective
o f The Gambia's Poverty Reduction Strategy i s to reduce disparities in access to sources o f
income and empowerment, and is articulated around five pillars: (i)creating an enabling
environment for economic growth and poverty reduction; (ii)       enhancing the productive capacity
and social protection o f the poor; (iii)  improving the coverage o f and access to basic social
services; (iv) buildingthe capacity o f local communities and their organizations to play a greater
role in poverty reduction; and (v) mainstreaming cross-cutting poverty issues (gender,
environment, nutrition, HIV/AIDS, etc.). The strategy emphasizes decentralization and direct
interventions at the community level, thus enabling local governments to develop the capacity
and responsibility for implementing and monitoring the PRSP with the goal o f attaining the
MDGs.
2.    However, recent poor economic performance has undermined progress toward both the
PRSP and MDGs. The poverty headcount target and half o f the country's education and health
indicators are substantially off-track. The Gambia's health and social indicators are among the
lowest in sub-Saharan Africa. While health status in the country has improved over the last
decade, infant and child mortality rates are still high and maternal mortality remains a critical
issue due to malnutrition and infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS andmalaria.
1.2 Key issuesand constraints
3.    Poverty in The Gambia is much higher in rural areas, where it has increased considerably
since 1992. The latest Household Poverty Survey revealed a highincidence o f poverty and threat
to livelihood security inthe country, with an increasingproportion o f the population livingbelow
the poverty line over the past decade: overall poverty is 69 percent. Seventy-four percent o f the
total population is rural while only 52 percent o f the total population is literate. Almost 30
percent o f the total population is categorized as undernourished and 20 percent o f the under five
children are said to be suffering malnutrition. Women and youth are particularly disadvantaged
due to lack o f diversified access to resources and income generation opportunities. The 2003
Food Security and Nutrition Survey reports that up to 11percent o f the rural population in The
Gambia i s categorized as most vulnerable to food insecurity. This group has less than four
months o f food self sufficiency, against a food stress period o f about six months per year.
4.    The capacity o f the Gambian population to achieve sustainable household livelihood
security in terms o f access to income and resources to meet basic needs (including adequate
access to food, potable water, quality health services, educational opportunities, housing, and
time for community participation and social integration) has increasinglybeen eroded inthe past
decade. The World Human Development Report (WHDR, 2005) has ranked The Gambia 155th
among 174countries and as one o f the least developedcountries. This situation is directly related
to the agricultural sector, the principal income-generating activity in rural areas. Overall
agricultural production and productivity are low and over-dependent on groundnut. Livestock


                                                 17

and fisheries remain predominantly traditional. The causes o f this situation include the lack o f
diversification within and from agricultural activities, the absence o f a basic rural infrastructure   '
base (storage, processing, transport), poor extension services, and insufficient access to capital
and new technologies.
5.    While the Local Government Act o f 2002 articulates a strong framework for
decentralizationinthe country, implementation o f the legislation i s lagging. Under this Act, local
governments became critical to the fight against poverty. They are now full stakeholders in
social and economic development and are expected to fulfill Government's mission o f
continuity, presence and proximity in the implementation o f national policies and the delivery o f
public services in their areas o f administrative control. Through decentralization, local
government authorities are now expected to consolidate the spatial and institutional
environments for the performance o f economic operators, guarantee equal access to social
services and ensure the consistency o f economic development, social action and inclusion. The
integration o f local potential into the new national strategies o f development i s the basis o f local
government policy and it i s recognized inparticular that local government authorities need to be
able to meet fully the demands relating to service delivery, local development, democracy and
participation.
6.    Though participation and community empowerment are seen as critical contributors to
reducing poverty, this conflicts with entrenched interests and approaches that are top-down and
supply-driven across the major sectors. Political decentralization is in place, with local
government elections occurring every four years. Administrative decentralization i s only
partially affected, with a fair amount o f deconcentration o f line ministry staff outside o f Banjul,
but with no functional devolution having taken place to date. As a result o f this centralized
accountability chain, extension staff o f key Departments o f State lack the ability to make
meaningful and informed decisions about issues that directly affect poverty outcomes in rural
areas, Fiscal decentralization instruments mandated by the Act are not operational, leading to a
massive financing gap for critical services at decentralized levels. In short, the Local
Government Authorities are clearly not yet fulfilling many o f the functional roles mandated to
them under the Act. At ward and village levels, structures established under the Local
Government Act are often not h c t i o n a l unless externally supported. Linkages between
deconcentrated line department staff andward andvillage committees are not clearly defined and
interactions are on an ad hoc basis. These weaknesses translate into poor development outcomes
at decentralized levels, particularly in the poorest and most vulnerable localities and inthe most
critical sectors.
1.3 What the country is doingto addresstheseissues.
7.    Some o f the key constraints identified above also serve as potential catalysts to address
poor development outcomes in rural areas. Inparticular, the Government has demonstrated its
priority inenabling legislation such as The Local Government Act (2002) and Audit and Finance
Act (2004). It acknowledges its past weaknesses and the failure o f the state to provide adequate
social services, capacity building activities at local levels, and access to markets to make a
meaningful and sustained impact on poverty and has stated its commitment to a meaningful
process o f devolution, whereby citizens, local governments, and civil servants have the mandate,
ability, and resources to achieve tangible development results. This situation arose despite being
addressed in the Gambia PRSP, and i s largely attributable to insufficient resources reaching the
poorest areas o f the country. Inparticular, the public sector has failed to deliver critical services


                                                 18

inrural areas. Severe capacity constraints havelimitedthe ability ofthe stateto recruit andretain
high-calibre extension staff to tackle the multiple determinants o f poverty. As a result, rural
communities in non-served or underserved settlements get by with poor socio-economic
conditions. Outcomes inkey sectors reinforce this reality: agriculture i s constrained by its lack o f
diversification; education lacks sufficient human capital; health outcomes compare poorly to
neighbouring countries and are constrained by insufficient fhding, lack o f qualified personnel,
anddrug shortages.

                   THE GAMBIA, Community-DrivenDevelopmentProject


4.1 ProjectCoverage
1.   The project will target 88 wards and approximately 600 villages in the six rural Local
Government Areas o f The Gambia, and will benefit a population estimated at 435,000 people.
(See Annex 6 for details on the decentralized administrative structures within LGAs that will
participate inthe project).
2.   The project will be based on the following key designprinciples:
            Address the priority concerns o f the communities, ensuring that they play an effective
            role inproject cycle (from planningto evaluation) o f local development activities;
            Select participating villages based on a transparent and equitable criteria;
            Strengthen the capacities o f decentralized actors, from community members to Local
            Government administrators and representatives;
            Limit its support at central-level to: (a) few key government agencies (agriculture,
            health, local government, nutrition); and b) activities needed to supervise, coordinate
            andmonitor activities at the decentralized level;
            Work with existing institutional arrangements that take into account the multi-sectoral
            nature o f the project and the evolutiontowards a fully decentralized context;
            Coordinate     with other     development    partners   to  maximize      synergies and
            complementarity;
            Develop a results-oriented - yet simple - monitoring and evaluation system;
            Buildcapacitythrough "learning bydoing".
4.2 ProjectComponents
3.   The project would be built around three components: A) Community Development Facility;
B) Strengthening Capacity for Community Development; and C) Project Coordination and
Monitoringand Evaluation.
Component A: Community Development Facility (US$10.8 million, of which IDA US$9.2
millionandPHRDUS$0.5 million)
4.   The component will support an investment facility to finance community-driven activities
identified on the basis o f a participatory strategic planning process.      The CDF provides an
opportunity for communities to take charge o f local development challenges through experience
with participatory planning,       budgeting, financial management,       and implementation of
development activities. Given the demand-driven nature o f the project, participating villages and
wards will have an open menu o f social and economic activities, including capacity building
activities and matching grants for income generating activities. Criteria and procedures for use o f
the CDF will be described in detail in the PIM. Technical and fiduciary reviews o f the activities
will be placed at levels corresponding to their area o f intervention and their level o f complexity.
The budget allocation for participating villages and wards will be determined via a formula based
on population and poverty levels (see below). The investment envelope will be made known at
the outset o f the planning cycle.      Each Local Government Authority will manage a project
designated sub-account to disburse the formula-based grant allocations to villages and wards. In
turn, villages and wards will manage funds to implement their Development Plans and


                                                  25

subprojects. While the PIM will describe in detail the CDF's criteria and procedures, the
followingparagraphs present the main features o f Component A.
5.    Resource allocation. Inthe six targeted rural LGAs, the CDF will cover all o f the 88 wards,
and approximately 600 villages (about one third o f villages). A formula, based on population, will
determine the grant allocation for each ward and village. Calculations will be made for each
participating ward and village, and funds will be allocated on the basis o f activity plans. It is
anticipated that, on average, each village and ward will receive US$12,000 and US$30,000,
respectively. Communities will contribute ten percent, through cash and/or in-kindcontributions
(e.g. localmaterials, voluntary labor).
6.    Selection of participating villages.       Given that all wards will participate, the list o f
participating villages in a given ward will be decided at the ward level. A transparent and
equitable approach to select participating villages will be presented in the PIM, based on criteria
that include village size and poverty proxies. The final list o f villages selected to participate inthe
project willbe validated by the PSC.
7.    Village and Ward Development Planning. Strategic (three-year) development planswill be
prepared by participating villages and wards. The DOSLGL's CDAs will facilitate this process.
They will work inpartnership with extension workers from other government agencies and civil
society organizations, building on the MDFT model that was successfully introduced in the
country by an EC financed project. The planning cycle will comprise: village/ward preparation
and sensitization, diagnosis, three-year strategic development planning, results-oriented activity
planning for specific goals from the strategic plan, M&E. Strategic plans will be prepared under
the guidance o f village and ward development committees and will be validated by the
communities themselves.      Both village and ward Strategic Plans will be endorsed by Local
Government Authority through the Technical Advisory Committee. Disbursements o f funds from
Local Government Authorities to villages andwards will be based on a tripartiteagreement signed
by the village/ward, the Local Government Authorities and the CDDP. The tripartite agreement
will include the village/ward Strategic Plan as well as the indicative list and costing o f sub-
projects (see also Annex 6).      This will be followed by implementation o f activities that are
identified in the Strategic Plans. Village planning will be the initial priority o f the project, with
ward plans and financing commencing inYear Two o fthe project.
8.    Eligible activities. Criteria for eligibility o f activities to be financed by the fund will be
described inthe PIM. Ingeneral, an open menuwill be used, and the PIM will provide a negative
list and general qualifying criteria for eligible activities. CDAs will ensure that VDCslWDCs are
knowledgeable o f these criteria and carry out their planningaccordingly.
9.    Activities to be financed are expected to fall under the following broad categories:
    i) Socialandeconomicinfrastructure;
    ii) Capacity-buildingactivities;
    iii) Incomegeneratingactivitiesthatwilleitherbeintroducedonapilotbasis,orbeofa
            "public-good" nature.
10. For activities o f a reasonable technical and financial threshold, line ministry extension
workers will provide necessary advice and reviews. Only in the case o f technically complex or
expensive (above US$lS,OOO) individual activities will authorities at the level o f the LGA be
required to review and approve specific activities. Details o f this arrangement will be outlined in
the PIM.


                                                   26

11. VDCs and WDCs will manage finances to be spent on their plans, CDAs will facilitate the
planning process, supervised by the CDOs. Supervision o f activities under the plan will be
undertaken by sectoral extension workers (MDFTs), except where technically complex. In this
case, contracted technical assistancewill support supervision.
12. With respect to M&E, both process- and outcome-oriented indicators will be monitored by
project stakeholders. PCT staff will monitor prescribed indicators for both management and
reportingpurposes, andstakeholders at the local level will engage inparticipatory M&E.
13. The Good Governance Facility (GGF). Component A will also support accountability
activities that are conceptualized, proposed, and implemented by Gambian civil society
organizations (CSOs). Resources will be channeled to CSOs to promote good governance at
decentralized levels, particularly focused on Area Councils, WDCs, and VDCs. An annual Call
for Proposals will explain the principles o f the CDDP and the GGF, outline application guidelines,
and invite CSOs to submit proposals based on a simplified proposal format. A selection
committee, reflecting the composition o f the PSC, will review proposals for their feasibility,
prospective impact, cost effectiveness, and innovation. The PIM will provide details o f the
fhctioning o f the GGF.
14. The component will support civil works, equipment, training, study tours, technical
assistance, consulting studies, goods, services, operating costs o f field staff, including salaries
and/or allowances.
Component B: Strengthening Capacity for Community Development (US$6.3 million, of
which IDA US$2.1 millionand PHRDUS$3.35 million)
15. Villages and Wards. At this level, intensive training will be undertaken to build the
capacities o f citizens to understand their roles and responsibilities in a decentralized governance
context, and put these into action. Villages and wards will be trained in a simplified, results
oriented strategic planning approach that i s transparent and broadly participatory. This
methodology will be described in the project's Field Guide, which forms part o f the PIM. This
process will be coordinated by VDCs and WDCs, but will rely upon broad engagement o f diverse
stakeholders (civil society, private sector, traditional leaders, etc.) at the local level to succeed.
Villages and wards will also be trained inthe Rapid Results Approach (RRA), a methodology that
provides a direct means o f achieving intermediate outcomes. RRA provides quick success, results
and learning that is grounded in: capacity-building and learning; stakeholder exchanges for mid-
term and final reviews across villages, wards and LGAs; proven tools including team operating
plans, work plans, tracking charts, andprogress reviews; andtransparency, including participatory
monitoring and public display o f development activities at village and ward levels. RRA will be
used in implementing activities identified intheir strategic development plans. VDCs and WDCs
will also receive focused training on fiduciary matters in order to efficiently and transparently
handle financial resources made available to them under the CDF. As mentioned above,
representatives from villages and wards will also be trained in participatory monitoring and
evaluation, in order for them to track progress over time with respect to the goals set in their
development plans.
16. Local Government Authorities. Given that the main entry-point and locus o f project
activities will be within the six rural LGAs, the project will work intensively to develop the skills
and abilities o f existing staff at this level to support and sustain community development. The first
target audience will be the Planning and Development and Finance Departments o f each Local
Government Authority. These staff will be trained inkey areas related to project implementation,

                                                     27

and will "learn by doing" through their support to downstream activities at village and ward
levels, in addition to their technical and fiduciary reporting and oversight responsibilities under
the project. The Technical Advisory Committee will be another target audience, given their
mandate under the Local Government Act to ensure that development activities at LGA, ward,
andvillage levelconform to national standards, priorities, andpolicies.
17. Staff of GovernmentAgencies. This will develop the capacity o f sectoral extension workers
to assist with identification, appraisal, and supervision o f activities financed by the CDF. The
project will build upon the successful model o f the MDFTs, which brings together sectoral
extension workers and other key stakeholders to address development issues at village and ward
levels. Significant capacity building activities will need to be undertaken at the inception o f the
project in order to strengthen the skills and abilities o f deconcentrated staff in the relevant
government agencies to undertake these roles. Staff will be trained to enhance their role in
supporting decentralized planning and implementation at village and ward levels, and the
component will support sensitization and training in key areas such as participatory planning,
reporting and work planning, team building and coordination, facilitation techniques, coaching
skills, conflict resolution, M&E (especially as it relates to community-level activities within their
sectoral discipline). Inparticular, training will focus on undertaking feasibility studies that verify
the technical and fiduciary viability o f development activities that are identifiedby participating
communities. This support will be provided in the form o f training, equipment (e.g. motorcycle
transport for CDAs), andrecurrent costs (e.g. fuel, allowances, etc).
18. The component will support civil works (office rehabilitation at LGA level), equipment,
training, study tours, technical assistance, consulting studies, goods, services, operating costs o f
field staff, salaries and allowances o f trainers.
ComponentC: ProjectCoordination,MonitoringandEvaluation(US$1.65 million,ofwhich
IDA US$0.45 millionandPHRDUS$0.95 million)
19. The component will be based on the principles o f simple design geared toward effective
oversight o f technical and fiduciary aspects o f the project, and will be mainstreamed within
DoSLGL. At the central level, the project will be implementedunder the overall supervision o f an
Inter-Departmental Steering Committee responsible for policy orientation, for the approval o f
annual work plans and budgets, and for reviewing progress activities. A PCT will be responsible
for oversight o f project activities, and is justified in the Gambian context because o f severe
capacity constraints within the civil service. Its size will be limited to core functions critical to the
project's success (overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and fiduciary matters). The
PCT will be located within the DOSLGL and reports to the Permanent Secretary o f the latter. The
key staff o f the PCT at central level will comprise: (i)         the Project Coordinator; (ii) CDF
                                                                                               the
Manager4 (Component A); (iii)      the Capacity Building Manager (Component B); (iv) the M&E
Specialist (Component C); (v) the Procurement Specialist; (vi) the Financial Manager; (vii) the
Administrative Assistant, and (viii) the Accountant. In addition, at LGA level, a Financial
Controller will provide technical assistance to the LGAs and will ensure compliance o f financial
management with World Bankrequirements.
20. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) will focus on results-oriented data collection for the
purpose o f management decisions and impact evaluation. It will enable beneficiaries and
DOSLGL to: monitor due diligence focused in compliance with the PIM; monitor and evaluate
achievement o f the development objectives; evaluate whether the project's implementation


 The CDF Manager will also be the Environmental Focal Point inthe PCT
                                                   28

approach will be sustainable and have the desired outcomes; and assessing project's impacts on
local governance and decision-making, along with evaluating the extent to which project activities
empower marginalized groups (women and youth).
21. The M&E system will be based on four inter-related activities:

   0    Project-levelM&E: the project team will monitor and evaluate project inputs, processes
        andoutputs, andtake management decisions based on findings;
   0    Participatory M&E: communities will identify indicators, decide on monitoring
        arrangements (source and frequency of data collection) and track progress toward the
        achievement o f results identified intheir development plans. Given rich experience inThe
        Gambia with the Community Scorecard, this approach is likely to be employed;
   0    Randomized technical and financial audits: a third party will undertake, every year,
        random technical and financial audits o f at least 10% o f subprojects inparticipating wards
        andvillages;
   0    Impact evaluation: a third party will conduct an external evaluation o f the project,
        including developing and fielding a baseline survey at the beginning o fthe project.
22. The M&E Specialist o f the PCT will supervise all M&E activities under the project.
Collected data at all levels will be captured ina MIS.
23. The component will support civil works (rehabilitation), equipment, training, study tours,
technical assistance, consulting studies, goods, services, operating costs o f PCT and field staff,
salaries and allowances o f PCT staff andtrainers.

7.    The CDDP field staff (notably the cadre o f DOSLGL CDAs and CDOs as well as extension
staff o f various agencies) will be responsible for coordinating the project activities at village and
wardlevels, The project will builduponthe successful model o fthe MDFTs, which bringtogether
extension workers from government agencies and NGOs to address development issues at village
and ward levels. Annual work plans will be used to coordinate project activities at local level.
DOSLGL staff will assist with the identification and provision o f support services by relevant
sectoral line departments on a demand-driven basis. Significant capacity buildingactivities will
be undertaken at the inception o f the project inorder to strengthen the skills and abilities of field
staff to effectively play these roles. Figure 6.2below provides an overview o f these arrangements.

6.3 Sub-project Cycle
8.      Ultimately, project implementation responsibilities will rest with villages and wards
themselves. Their respective VDCs and WDCs will act as the umbrella institutions to spearhead
development planning and implementation of activities that are identified. They will leverage the
requisite resources to undertake project activities, including mobilizing community traditional
leadership, civil society organizations, and the private sector. Table 6.3 provides an overview of
the key phases and steps inthe sub-project cycle at the village level. Similar phases and steps will
be used at ward level in year 3 o f ward participation, in order to develop ward level plans and
undertake development activities identified therein.Intensive capacity buildingactivities will also
be built into the sub-project cycle to strengthen communities' awareness and abilities within the
context o f decentralization.

6.4. Project Phasing, `Scaling Up' and `Scaling Out'
9.    Because o f the large number o f villages involved and the intensive sub-project cycle, the
project has made the strategic choice to phase in its implementation to all participating villages.
Such phasing and flexibility in design will also allow for continuous improvement o f key
facilitation and training processes over the course o f the project. In this way, a CDA and their
cohort o f MDFTs will be assigned to a given ward, and will support all village and ward level
activities within that geographic locality. Figure 6.3 shows the intended sequence to be followed.
The precise number o f villages in the Year One, Two, and Three cohorts will be defined in the
first annual workplan o f the project (within 60 days from effectiveness).     Scaling out to new
geographic communities will occur within wards on an annualized basis. `Scaling up' to the ward
level will occur inYear 3 o f the project.

Flow of Funds
10. Figure 6.4 below illustrates the flow o f funds. Local Government Authorities will be
responsible for disbursing the formula-based grants for village and ward development activities.
Each Local Government Authority will set up a designated sub-account to receive project funds
for the purpose o f disbursing grants. Disbursements from LGA level to villages andwards will be
defined in a tripartite agreement signed by the village/ward, the Local Government Authority and
the CDDP. The tripartite agreement will include the village/ward development plan and the
indicative costing o f sub-projects. Disbursements to WDC and VDC accounts will be based on
their overall grant allocation as determined by a formula. VDCs and WDCs will then be
responsible for financial management and procurement matters at their level, and will provide
expenditure justifications to their respective LGA. The justification o f the use o f funds for
subsequent installments will be based on physical progress certified by the relevant CDNCDO.
Local Government Authorities' replenishment request to the PCT will be accompanied by a
schedule detailing resources that are to be used for: (i)facilitation o f planning and technical
backstopping o f identified development activities by MDFTs; and (ii)                                         transfers to VDCs and

                   THE GAMBIA, Community-DrivenDevelopmentProject


7.1. Executivesummaryandconclusions
1.    The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) o f The Gambia was conducted in
2003. The table inAppendix 1 shows the Financial Management Risk Assessment at the Country
level. The overall risk rating o f the public financial management system was high. Since that
exercise, no major progress was noted. The weaknesses noted include poor resource allocation,
non-compliance, limitedexecution, inadequate monitoring and scrutiny, insufficient capacity, lack
o f enforcement, non-transparency and poor parliamentary oversight. In response, the authorities
have been implementing various initiatives to strengthen public financial management including
reclassification o f the budget according to Government Finance Statistics, implementation o f a
cash management system, and the ongoing implementation o f an integrated financial management
information system (IFMIS).
2.    However, no major progress was made on decentralization and local government finance.
Various studies in The Gambia including the CFAA show serious weaknesses at that level,
notably, budgetary controls, financial recording and use o f manual ledgers are generally very
poor. Accounting records are not kept up to date, basic controls are not inoperation, there i s very
little segregation o f duties between record keeping and authorization of expenditure, and credit
control procedures are weak. The LACShave not prepared financial statements in recent years.
There are many problems with the draft Financial & Accounting Manual. The internal audit
function does not exist in most councils and the external audits performed by the National Audit
Office  (NAO) is done on a transactional basis and has not extended to an effective review o f
operational controls o f the provision o f an opinion on council financial statements. Finally,
inadequate intergovernmental fiscal transfers, cumbersome procedures, and a weak system for tax
collection also seriously hamper local development.
3.    The CDDP will assist in addressing some o f the deficiencies, notably institutional capacity
and accountability and transparency. It will be coordinated by a PCT at the central level while
Local Government Authorities will be assisted by Financial Controllers at the LGA level.
4.    A financial management assessment was carried out to determine whether the project
implementing agencies (the PCT at the central level and the LGAs at the local level) have
acceptable financial management arrangements. The conclusion o f the assessment is that the
financial management arrangements for the project need to be improved before project
effectiveness to satisfy the World Bank's minimumrequirements under OPE3P10.02 andwill then
be adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status
o f the project requiredby IDA.The financial management arrangements will be strengthened with
the implementationo fthe actionplaninAppendix 1.
7.2. Staffingandimplementationarrangements
5.    Overall project orientation and coordination. The overall policy guidance will be
entrusted to a national steering committee. The steering committee will comprise high-level
representatives from the main stakeholders concerned with CDDP: the DoSFEA, the DoSLGL,
DoSA, DoSHSW, DoSWR, DOSE, NaNA, the GALGA, representatives o f the private sector, and
civil society.

                                                39

6.    Project Coordination. The PCT will be responsible for day-to-day coordination of the
project, and will be located in the DoSLGL. It will operate in conformity with the principles
procedures and conditions laid out inthe Grant Agreement and inthe PIM. Its responsibilities will
include:
            Coordination and provision o f technical support to communities with regard to the
             formulation, design, appraisal and implementation o f development plans with technical
             support fiom the relevant social line departments;
            Support the preparation, review, financing and M&E o f capacity building programs o f
             concerned line departments,
     0      Liaise with Local Government Authorities to ensure they are informed o f the project's
             development initiatives plannedfor villages andWards withintheirjurisdiction, and
     0      Management o fthe Designated Account
7.    At the local level, the PCT will be supported for the teckical implementationbyDOSLGL's
field staff, notably its cadre o f CDAs and CDOs responsible for supporting the implementationo f
CDDP activities at village andward levels.
8.    Financialmanagement: Management o f project resources will be under the responsibility
o f the PCT. A Financial Manager with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the World
Bank will be recruited at the PCT. He will be assisted by an Accountant at the central level and
six Financial Controllers at the LGAs level. The Financial Manager has, as far as financial
management is concerned, the responsibility to collect and control invoices, manage the project's
bank accounts, keep the books o f accounts, prepare and produce quarterly Un-AuditedInterim
Financial Reports (IFR) and make the necessary arrangements for the annual financial audit of
project account. The recruitment o f the Financial Manager within the PCT and o f a Financial
Controller inat least three LGAswill be effectiveness conditions o f the project.
7.3. Accountingandfinancialmanagementproceduresandcomputerizedmanagement
informationsystem
9.    Accounting policies and Procedures. Accounting procedures will follow the Companies
Act6 in The Gambia. The project accounts will therefore be maintained under the private
accounting rules and on an accrual basis. The Chart o f Account will be drawn up using the cost
tables o f the project. A PIM will be developed and will provide all the required details on
accounting and financial procedures. It will set out in particular the flow o f accounting and
financial information o f the Project and the beneficiaries i.e. DoSLGL, Local Government
Authorities and local Communities (VDCs and WDCs) as well as the modalities and formats of
periodic reports.. The basis o f the intervention at the local level will be the World Bank Guidelines
Fiduciary Management for CDD Projects. The basis for the disbursement o f hnds will be a
simple financial report and milestones (for instance, assessments o f subproject progress) defined
in the financing agreement between the PCT and the beneficiary community. An overview of
funding flows and cash management mechanisms is provided in the paragraph on disbursements
and inAppendix 3. The project will provide funds to also buildthe capacity o f local communities.
The selection o f local communities will be done through a formula that takes into account
population and poverty data. The formula will be detailed inthe PIM, whose endorsement by the
PSC will be a condition o f effectiveness.


 A new Accounting Standard was recently elaborated and should soonbe tabledbeforethe National Assembly. This
standard i s much closer to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as enunciated inthe International
Accounting Standardspronouncedby the International FederationofAccountants (IFAC).
                                                        40

10. Reporting and Monitoring. The PCT will be responsible o f the overall reporting o f the
project. The Financial Manager will make sure that quarterly Un-AuditedIFRs are produced and
transmitted to the World Bank not later than one month after the end o f each quarter. The first IFR
shall be provided to the World Bank not later than one month after the end o f the first calendar
quarter after following the date o f effectiveness and shall cover the period from the incurrence o f
the first project expenditure to the end o f the relevant quarter. The format o f the IFR was
discussed and agreed upon during project negotiations. The Financial Controller at LGAs level
will address to the PCT monthly reports on the use o f funds. Annually, the PCT will prepare, not
later than June 30 o f the following year, audited annual financial statements. These financial
statements will be subject to periodic audits (see paragraph on audits),
11. Informationsystem. A computerized information system will be established at the PCT.
The computerized information system will be defined insuch a way as to provide all o f the above
data, inaddition to providing data for the purposes o fmonitoring grants to local communities. The
system will be integrated with the LGA level in order to avoid any delay in submission o f the
withdrawal applications. The accounting system will be elaborated based on the reporting
requirements as defined in the accounting manual. The installation o f this system satisfactory to
IDAwill be an effectiveness condition.
12. Internal Audit. The Project i s required to have in place satisfactory internal audit
arrangements to assist management in ensuring the continuing adequacy o f and conformity with
the project's procedures. Although the project does not have an internal audit body, key internal
controls will be undertaken. Thus several controls will be undertaken by all the highlevel staff o f
the PCT: approval and authorization controls (including for procurement) will be documented in
the manual, bank reconciliations will be prepared regularly and on a timely basis by staff
independent of the payment function, subsidiary records o f fixed assets and stocks will be
maintained and all assets will be duly insured. The PIM, therefore, will outline the specific
internal controls to be carried out by each staff member o f the PCT as well as the PSC and LACS.
In addition, the external auditors, during their reviews, will pay attention to the continuing
adequacy o f and conformity with the project's procedures bythe PCT.
13.   Externalaudits. An annual audit o f the project will be conducted by external auditors with
qualifications and experiences satisfactory to the IDA. Besides expressing an opinion on the
Project Financial Statements in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, the auditors
will be required to verify a randomly selected sample o f about 10 percent o f sub-projects grants
approved in the year under review, to verify whether the Grants for local communities have been
disbursed according to the PIM and that the intended identified beneficiaries have received the
funds. In addition to the audit report, the auditors will be expected to prepare management's
letters giving observations and comments, and providing recommendations for improvements in
accounting records, systems, controls and compliance with financial covenants inthe World Bank
agreement. The selection process o f the auditor will be conducted by the NAO. A selection o f an
auditor with experience and qualifications satisfactory to the World Bank will be an effectiveness
condition. The audit report for the fiscal year ended must be submitted no later than June 30
following the end o f that fiscal year.

7.4. Risks analysis
14. At the country level. The fiduciary risk at the Country level was rated Highafter the CFAA
in 2003. Since that exercise, key elements of the financial management reform that have been
followed up are: (i)general and sector specific Public Expenditure Reviews have been
undertaken; (ii) backlog of audited accounts i s being reduced; and (iii) Government, with
                 the                                                         the
IDA funding, is implementing an IFMIS which, once completed, would improve the transparency
and timeliness o f public accounts. Despite these gains, the Public Financial Management risk
remains high.
15.   At the project level. Because o fthe highfiduciary risk at the country level, IDAhas taken
special measures to ensure adequate financial management o f its portfolio. Project management
staff are appointed on a competitive basis andWorld Bank funding is following special
mechanisms to mitigate fiduciary risk. IDAprojects are invariably auditedby independent and
competent auditing firms. The table inAppendix 2 identifies the key risks at the project level and
provides a basis for determining how management should address these risks.
7.5 Grant Conditions and financial covenants
16. The financial management related effectiveness conditions o f the Grant are:
    a) the Recipient has appointed external auditors with qualifications and experience
        satisfactory to IDA;
    b) the Recipient has adopted the PlM, including administrative, accounting and financial
        procedures, inform and substance satisfactory to IDA;
    c) the Recipient has installed the Financial Management System in form and substance
        satisfactory to IDA;
    d) the Recipient has appointed the core staff o f the PCT (Project Coordinator, Procurement
        Specialist, Financial Manager andM&E Specialist);
    e) the Recipient has recruited a Financial Controller, with qualifications and experience
        satisfactory to IDA, for at least three LGAs.
7.6 Flow of funds
17. The flow o f funds, described inAppendix 3, comprises:

    0   One DesignatedAccount at the central level at the Central Bank (managed by the PCT);
    0   Six sub-accounts at the LGAs level, each managed by the Chief Executing Officer o f the
        L A C andthe CDDP Local Financial Controller;
    0   Accounts o f Local Communities (open ina commercial bank or a financial institution
        acceptable to the World Bank).

18. Table 7.1 below specifies the bank accounts to be opened at the various Levels.

    0  Reporting on the use of funds by Local Communities will be based on a simple financial
       report and milestones (for instance, assessments o f subproject progress) defined in the
       tripartite financing agreement between the Local Government Authority (represented by
       the Chairman o f the Council), the VDC/WDC (represented by its chairman), and the
       CDDP (represented by the CDO). Payments will be made in installments. The initial
       installment will be a minimumo f 25% o f the approved subprojects' proposals. Subsequent
       payments (no more than 2) will be based on physical progress, certified by the
       CDA/MDFT, and not on financial progress. However, VDC and WDC will be required to
       produce periodic financial reports inorder to demonstrate good accounting practices at the
       community level.
7.7 Disbursementarrangements
19. Disbursement Methods. The project will start with the disbursement methods based on
Reimbursement, Designated Account Advance, Direct Payment and Special Commitment. These
methods will be used at the beginning o f the project. The project i s expected to shift to the
quarterly IFR-based disbursement as soon as IDA i s satisfied with the ability o f the implementing
entity.
20. Minimum Value of Applications. The minimum value o f Direct Payment and Special
Commitment will be US$80,000.
21. Reportingon Use of Loan Proceeds
       Initially, the supporting documentation for replenishment applications should be a
       summary sheet and an SOE andrecords evidencing eligible expenditures against contracts
       valued at: (i) US$250,000 for works; (ii)    US$150,000 for goods; (iii)       US$lOO,OOO for
       consulting firms; (iv) US$50,000 for individual consultants; (v) workshops and training;
       and (vi) Sub-project grants and operating costs, all under such terms and conditions as
       IDAshall specify bynotice to the Recipient,
       The supporting documentation for requests for direct payment should be records
       evidencing eligible expenditures (copies of receipts, suppliers' invoices).
       The project will submit on a monthly basis a bank statement and a reconciliation o f the
       designated account together with the replenishment application.

8.1. General
8.1.1. Procurementcontextinthe country
1. A CPAR, carried out inThe Gambia inOctober 1998, flagged the main issues such as the
lack o f capacity regarding the Recipient's staff, the absence o f standard biddingdocuments at the
national level, the insufficient capacity o f local contractors for contracts subject to ICB, and
corruption. Recommendations were made to address these issues. The Bank, through the CBEMP,
provided support to strengthen the Recipient's capacity in procurement, modernize the
procurement process and improve regulation (approval o f Gambia Public Procurement Act).
Thanks to this plan, some o f the issues have been addressed, including: training staff responsible
for procurement, designing standardbidding documents, including provisions inthe Code against
corruption. Nonetheless, the situation remains risky.
2.    A Country Procurement Issues Paper has beencarried out in2005 as anupdate o fthe CPAR.
The Government has not yet provided its comments on the report and, therefore, the proposed
action plan and recommendations (capacity building, institutional reinforcement through a
regulatory body, an appeal body, strengthening o f the private sector, judiciary reinforcement, etc.)
have not yet been discussed and agreed upon.
8.2.2. Procurementmethodsfor the project
3.    Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under JBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004,
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement.           The various items under
different expenditure categories are described in general terms hereafter. For each contract to be
financed by the project, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the
need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed
between the Recipient and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be
updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.
4.    Procurement of Works.          Works procured under this project would be limited to
rehabilitation o f office buildingat LGA and central levels. There will not be any major civil works
contract under the project. All works estimated to cost at least US$250,000 equivalent per contract
will be procured under ICB procedures. The procurement will be done using the Bank's SBD for
all ICB, and National SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for contracts procured under
N C B or shopping. Contracts for works estimated to cost less than US$250,000 equivalent would
be procured under NCB procedures. Contracts for small works estimated to cost less than
US$50,000 will be based on shopping with a written proposal addressed to a minimum o f three
contractors regularly established and in order with the administration o f the Recipient interms o f
their fiscal and social status. The contract may only be awarded to the bidder who has offered the
lowest price, after comparing at least three bids and provided he has the capacity to successfully
perform the works.

5.     Procurement of Goods. Goods procured under this project would-include, but not be
limited to: vehicles; motorcycles; office equipment; office furniture; IT, communication and
multimedia equipment; medical equipment anddrugs; farm equipment and inputs, etc.
6.     When possible, goods will be grouped inbidpackages estimated to cost at least US$150,000
equivalent per contract and will be procured under ICB procedures. The procurement will be done
using the Bank's SBD for all ICB, and National SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for
other procurement methods. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$l50,000 equivalent for
goods available locally would be procured under N C B procedures. Small articles and office
supplies as well as small equipment and furniture available locally and whose estimated cost is
less than US$50,000 may be awarded through Shopping. In those cases, the written request
proposal shall be addressed to several suppliers regularly established and in order with the
administration o f the Recipient in terms o f their fiscal and social status. The contract will be
awarded, after comparing a minimumo fthree quotations, to the bidder who has offered the lowest
price and has demonstrated capacity to successfully perform the contract. Procurement under
Direct Contracting may be allowed in accordance with provisions 3.6 and 3.7 o f the Procurement
Guidelines. Finally procurement o f goods from agencies o f the United Nation or through such
agencies (like inthe case o f IAPSO) will also be allowed, according to articles 3.9 and 3.10 o f the
Procurement Guidelines.
7.     Community Participation. Under component A (Community Development Facility), the
project will finance community subprojects for a total value o f US$11.0 million o f which IDA
will finance US$8.5 million. Fundingfor the subprojects will be inthe form o fgrants to the VDCs
and WDC. Communities will be required to contribute a minimumo f 10percent o f the subproject
budget in labor, kind, cash, or a combination thereof. The subprojects will comprise small social
and economic infrastructures, communication activities and materials, minor repairs or works,
capacity buildingetc. These subprojects are estimated to cost US$50,000 or less per contract.
8.     Financing o f subprojects will depend on proposal formulated by VDCs and WDCs. Due to
their demand-driven nature, it is not possible to determine the exact mix o f goods, small works,
and services to be procured under the subprojects. Procurement for the implementation o f
subprojects would be carried out in accordance with simplifiedprocurement procedures referred
to in the PIM. The PIM will contain a special section describing the procedures and tools in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for
Community-Based Investments (February 1998). The PCT will be responsible for ensuring
compliance with these guidelines. Ex-post reviews o f random subprojects will be conducted
periodically by independent technical audits.

services, banking services, insurance, transportation, catering, cleaning services, etc. Regarding
the size o f these types o f contracts, the procurement process will be conducted under procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
10. Selection of Consultants. Consulting services would include technical assistance, training,
auditing, M&E, work supervision, information and communication, etc. Consultants will be

12. The Standard Request for Proposal (RFP) and the sample form o f Evaluation Report for
consultants, as developed by the Bank, will be used for appointment o f consultants. Simplified
contracts will be used for short-term assignments (not exceeding six months), carried out by firms
or individual consultants.
13. Operating Costs. Operating costs financed by the Project are incremental expenses,
including office supplies, vehicle operation and maintenance, maintenance o f equipment,
communication costs,        rental expenses,     utilities expenses, consumable,    transport    and
accommodation, per diem, supervision costs, salaries and allowances o f locally contracted staff.
They will be procured using the implementing unit's administrative procedures, which will be
detailed inthe PIM.
14. Others. The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as
well as model contracts for works and goods procured, will be detailed inthe PIM.
8.2 Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement
15. Procurement activities will be carried out by the PCT located at the DOSLGL. The agency
is staffed by a Project Coordinator, a Capacity Building Manager, a CDF Manager, an M&E
Specialist, a Financial Manager, and a Procurement Specialist. The Procurement Specialist will
assure the procurement functions. Giving the difficulty o f finding qualified fiduciary staff in The
Gambia, the CDDP Procurement Specialist, recruited on a competitive basis, will be eligible for
short-term consulting fees. The recruitment o f the Procurement Specialist, and other key staff in
the project, is a condition o fproject effectiveness.
16. An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement
actions for the project has been carried out by the Senior Procurement Specialist o f the World
Bank Senegal Country Office.          The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementing the project and the interaction between the project's staff responsible for
procurement and the government central unit for administration and finance.
17. The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation o f the project have
been identified and include lack o f experience in World Bank procurement procedures and
insufficient capacity at the local level. The corrective measures which have been agreed upon are:
(i)recruitment o f a qualified procurement specialist knowledgeable o f World Bank guidelines; (ii)
training on procurement aspects for staff o f the project, members o f MDFT, staff o f Local
Government Authorities, and community members; and (iii)preparation o f a Project
Implementation Manual which defines the procurement methods and procedures for community-
based contracting; standardbiddingdocuments for NCB, small works and consulting assignments
and (iv) Frequent supervision and control from the main procurement specialist to advice local
communities responsible on all procurement matters, (v) the fact that PIM is an effectiveness
condition; (vi) the fact that the supervision and prior review thresholds are consistent with the
highrisk levelidentified.

8.3 ProcurementPlan
19. The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementationwhich
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This planhas been agreed between the Recipient
andthe Project Team and finalized on May 24, 2006 and is available at DOSLGL. Itwill also be
available inthe project's database and inthe Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will
be updated, inagreement with the World Bank, annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementationneeds andimprovements ininstitutional capacity.
8.4 Frequency of ProcurementSupervision
20. Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended at least two supervision missions to
visit the field to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.

                                 Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
                      THE GAMBIA, Community-Driven Development Project
9.1 Economic Analysis
1.    Given the demand-driven nature o f the project, support to villages and wards under the CDF
will be within the framework o f an "open menu" o f social and economic infrastructures and
activities, capacity building activities, and income generating activities that are o f a public good
nature. Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the benefits and costs o f the project ex ante, as it i s
impossible to predict: (a) which investment activities will be pursued by the communities; and (b)
which ones will actually receive funding. Consequently, there are inherent uncertainties in
attempting to perform a traditional economic analysis, as: (i) benefits and costs o f each
                                                                       the
individual subproject vary due to the localized planning, design, construction, implementation,
operation and maintenance (O&M) and utilization; (ii)           the actual distribution o f the types o f
subprojects to be selected by the local communities across the entire Project i s not known; and
(iii) socialandcapacitybuildingactivitieshaveonly indirect economicbenefitsthat are
     most
difficult or impossible to quantify in monetary terms. It is for these reasons that economic
analyses are usually not carried out for Bank funded CDD-type operations.
2.    Nevertheless, an attempt has been made to capture as much as possible the potential
economic benefits that are likely to result from the project and to calculate the ERR for the project
for various scenarios. The analysis takes into account: (i)    a likelymix o f subprojects that would be
prioritized by communities, based on existing ward andvillage development plans and experience
from other projects in The Gambia; and (ii)            economic analyses carried out in the course o f
preparing projects that support similar community investments, while making conservative
assumptions regarding the economic returns o f individual subprojects hnded by the CDF. In the
absence o f meaningful data available for The Gambia, a number o f analyses from other countries
have been used as reference. The subprojects included inthe analysis as well as the assumptions
concerningindividual subprojects' ERR and share o f CDF are presented inTable 1below.

3.     Profiles o f generic subprojects were modelled for estimating expected cost and benefits per
subproject. The following assumptions were made:

     (i)     Each subproject generates a net stream o f incremental benefits over 15 years, which
             results inthe ERR specified inTable 1, regardless o f the size o fthe subproject (Le., if
             the investment cost per subproject changes, the recurrent costs andbenefits will change
             proportionally);
     (ii)    0 &Mcosts arecalculated as ashareofinvestmentcosts andareconstant throughout
             the subproject life cycle;
     (iii)   No replacement costs havebeen added (included inO&M) andthe investmenthas a
             residuallsalvage value o f zero inYear 15;
     (iv)    Fullbenefits from each subproject materialize inYear 3 after the investment;
     (v)     Benefits cease immediately after the subproject life o f 15 years;
     (vi)    Subproject models o f one type are assumed to be representative for all subprojects o f
             the same type;
     (vii)   Annual subproject investments are calculated as a share o f total annual CDF
             disbursement (village andward grants) as presented inthe detailed cost table for
             Component A.
9.2 Results of Economic Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis
4.     Taking into account only the quantifiable benefits under Component A, the ERR for the
whole project i s estimated at about 6.4percent. The ERR increases to 15.3 percent (net present
value: US$1.39 million), if the costs o f only Component A are included in the analysis. Table 2
below provides an overview, on the basis o f the project components considered, o f how the ERR
i s affected by changes o f benefits and costs and a delay o fbenefits.

i s not possible to quantify the potential impact of the project on the Government's revenue
earnings. However, inthe long term, the fiscal impact of the project i s expected to be positive, as
the Government is able to tax economically productive activities.
9.4 Concluding Remarks
7.   The economic analysis o f the project on the basis of the assumptions described above
provides sufficient justification for the project. Given the fact that capacity buildingprojects are
generally not subject to economic analysis, as they only yield longer-term, intangible benefits, the
project can bejustified on the grounds of the ERR for Component A (15.3 percent), particularly as
many social benefits that directly contribute to improved livelihoods o f the rural poor have not
been captured by the analysis. Indirect benefits or those that could not be readily quantified,
including those from community empowerment and strengthening of local institutions and
communities, were not included inthe analysis. Inaddition, the analysis i s based on conservative
estimates o f ERR for individual subprojects. Therefore, the results are believed to be on the low
side o f the actual economic returns which will be realizedwhen the project i s implemented.

                                 Annex 10: SafeguardPolicyIssues
                   THE GAMBIA, Community-DrivenDevelopmentProject
1.    The project has triggered (i)OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment due to potential
construction and rehabilitation activities as well as potential impacts related to potential medical
waste; (ii) OP 4.09 Pest Management due to the potential increase in the use o f pesticides to
improve agricultural production; and (iii)    OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement due to the potential
need for land acquisition for future sub-projects. The safeguard screening category i s S2, and the
environmental screening category is B.
OP 4.01 EnvironmentalAssessment
2.    Under Component A, the CDDP will finance community-driven activities which will be
identified on the basis o f a participatory strategic planningprocess. Activities are likely to include
sub-projects such as the construction and rehabilitation o f feeder roads, health care facilities, and
vaccination parks,, and activities related to improvements in agricultural production and a
concomitant increase inthe use o fpesticides.
3.    To identify and mitigate potential negative environmental and social impacts o f future sub-
projects, the Recipient has prepared an ESMF and a RPF. Both documents have been approved
anddisclosed inThe Gambia andat the Bank's InfoShop onFebruary 17,2006.
4.    These documents were prepared because the precise locations and potential localized
negative environmental and social impacts o f sub-projects were not known at the time of
appraisal. However, based on experience with similar sub-projects, potential negative
environmental and social impacts are likely to include soil erosion, water and soil pollution, loss
of vegetation, increase insolid and liquidwaste, including medical waste, pesticide poisoning, and
highlevels o fpesticideresidues inthe food chain.
5.    The ESMF outlines an environmental and social screening process for sub-projects to be
implemented by qualified personnel at the sub-project planning stage as follows: (i)      screening o f
sub-projects and sites using the Environmental and Social Screening Form (see Annex 1 o f the
ESMF); (ii)  assigning the appropriate environmental categories based on the screening results;
(iii)carrying out the appropriate environmental work (either the application o f simple mitigation
measures or the preparation o f a separate EL4 report) (see Annexes 2, 3, 6 o f the ESMF); (iv)
review and approval o f the relevant environmental documents; (v) public consultations and
disclosure; and (vi) environmental monitoring.
6.    The ESMF includes (i)Guidelines for an EMP; (ii)Environmental Guidelines for
Contractors (Annex 4 o f the ESMF); (iii)     a Summary o f the Bank's safeguard policies (Annex 5
o f the ESMF); (iv) a PMP (Annex 11 o f the ESMF); and (v) a NMWMP (Annex 12 o f the
ESMF).
7.    To ensure that the sub-projects are implemented in an environmentally and socially
sustainable manner, the ESMF recommends that an Environmental Focal Point (EFP) be
appointed within the MDFT in each division to serve as the environmental and social expert
during the implementation o f sub-projects, and to be responsible at the level o f the CDD for the
coordination and supervision (overseeing) o f the implementation o f the ESMF. To carry out these
tasks, the EFP should visit all the sites where project activities will be implemented, only once at
the beginning o f the works, in order to complete the screening forms. This expert will take
advantage o f the support and permanent assistance o f the environmental experts at the National
Environment Agency (NEA). In coordination with the Project Coordination Unit, the day-to-day

                                                   58

monitoring activities will be carried out by technical agents o f the MDFT, the municipalities, and
VDC to follow-up on environmental and social indicators and the implementation o f corrective
measures, ifnecessary.
8.    Capacity for environmental management and monitoring will be required at the national,
divisional, district and village levels as follows: (a) The EFP and the other members o f the MDFT
in each Division will need to strengthen their capacity to apply and implement the screening
process as outlined in the ESMF; (b) Selected members o f the technical services o f the
municipalities, wards and members o f the V D C will need to strengthen their environmental
monitoring capacity; and (c) As necessary, members o f the MDFT will require environmental
training to enable them to assist the EFP o f the Project Coordination Unit o f the CDD. The ESMF
provides details regarding the recommended training topics and related cost estimates as well as
monitoring indicators.
9.    Medical Waste Management: As regards safe medical waste management relevant to sub-
project implementers will refer to the NMWM (Annex 12 o f the ESMF), for guidance according
to the type o f health care facility to be constructed or rehabilitated, operated andmaintained under
the CDD. The plan includes an action plan and cost estimates for the proposed activities,
including health care training program reviews andworkshops for health care workers.
10. Thus, to ensure that all health care facilities nationwide use a proper health care waste
management system, the plan proposed that they focus on: (i)         proper methods for medical waste
segregation, collection, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal; (ii)  provision o f adequate
personal protective equipment and waste handling, storage and transportation equipment; (iii)
continual training and education on risks and hazards, proper procedures and methods; and (iv)
enforcing and monitoring compliance with health and safety procedures and precautions through
the establishment o f Infection ControlNaste Management Committees, including the designation
o f a Waste Management Officer in each health care facility. Target groups for such training
include, among others, municipal staff, domestic staff (orderlies, cleaners), medical staff and
administration, private hospitals, clinics andpractitioners.
OP4.09 PestManagement
11. As part o f the ESMF, the Recipient has prepared a PMP. This plan discusses, among other
things, the current problems encountered with pest management inthe agriculture sector. In 1995,
the Agricultural Pest Management Unit (APMU) carried out an inventory o f pests and diseases o f
crops in the country to identify the key pests for each crop and their management, developed a
fieldmanual for extension agents to be used as reference material by farmers insolving their pest
problems. Tables 8 and 9 in the EMSF list the major insect and pests (such as red spider mites,
seed bugs, rodents, h i t worms, blister beetles) and diseases (such as nematodes, hit-rot,
downey mildew, rosettes, smut) o f individual crops (cereals, legumes, roots and tubers, and
vegetables) inThe Gambia which have reduced yields significantly over the years.
OP 4.12 InvoluntaryResettlement
12. Given that the exact locations and potential negative social impacts related to land
acquisition for sub-projects could not be determined beforehand, the Recipient has prepared a
RPF. The RPF outlines the policies and procedures to be followed inthe event that sub-projects
require land acquisition. The overall responsibility for the implementation o f the RPFwill be with
the: (i) at the divisional level; (ii) WDC; and (iii) VDC (at the village level). These
        Council                              the                   the
institutions will ensure that the framework i s publicly disseminated and that project staff have the

framework.
