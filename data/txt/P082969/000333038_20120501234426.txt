                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY
The purpose of the proposed restructuring is to extend the closing date of the Project. The
extension of the closing date will give enough time to the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) to complete the last key activities that are under-way and which include: (a) the
completion of the last batch of thirty community-based subprojects that are currently
being implemented; (b) the completion of the impact evaluation study which is being
carried out by the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS); and (c) the carrying out of the
final field data collection in order to feed in the score cards and ease the preparation of
the up-coming Implementation Completion Report for the project.

B. PROJECT STATUS
The assessment of the Implementing Agency is rated Satisfactory. Furthermore, the
assessment of implementation progress shows satisfactory achievements in all the
components. Under Component 1 (Community Development Facility), since the start of
implementation in 2008 a total of 1098 subprojects have been financed; out of this total,
implementation is completed in 1058 subprojects representing about 96% of the total
financed. Under Component 2 (Strengthening Capacity for Community Development),
strong efforts were made to complete all the capacity building activities for the targeted
communities and also the Local Governments. Furthermore 100% of all the Strategic
Development Plans were produced. Under Component 3 (Project Coordination and
Monitoring & Evaluation), all the key activities were implemented satisfactorily.

1.    The closing dates for The Gambia Community-Driven Development Project, IDA
Grant No. H2520-GM (Project ID: P082969) and the related co-financing Japanese
PHRD Grant No. TF55124-GM will be extended from April 30, 2012 until October 31,
2012.

2.       The assessment of implementation progress shows satisfactory achievements in
all the components. Under Component 1 (Community Development Facility), since the
start of implementation in 2008 a total of 1098 subprojects have been financed; out of
this total, implementation is completed in 1058 subprojects representing about 96% of the
total financed.      Under Component 2 (Strengthening Capacity for Community
Development), strong efforts were made to complete all the capacity building activities
for the targeted communities and also the Local Governments. Furthermore 100% of all
the Strategic Development Plans (SDP) was produced. Under Component 3 (Project
Coordination and Monitoring & Evaluation), all the key activities were implemented
satisfactorily. The project objectives continue to be achievable.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to give the Recipient the required time to
complete the last key activities that are under-way and which include: (a) the completion
of the last batch of thirty community-based subprojects that are currently being
implemented; (b) the completion of the impact evaluation study which is being carried
out by the Gambia Bureau of Statistics; and (c) the carrying out of the final field data
collection in order to feed in the score cards and ease the preparation of the up-coming
Implementation Completion Report for the project. The Government’s request for an
extension of the closing date is supported by an Action Plan to complete the project’s
remaining key activities. The new closing date will be October 31, 2012.

4.     This will be the first extension of closing date for the project.
