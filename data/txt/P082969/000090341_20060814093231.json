Community-Driven Development Project for Gambia is the\n            following: Rural communities, in partnership with Local\n            Government Authorities, plan, implement and maintain their\n            priority social and economic investments. The project\n            consists of the following components. Component 1: The\n            Community Development Fund (CDF) will finance\n            community-driven activities identified on the basis o f a\n            participatory strategic planning process. Component 2:\n            Capacity-building activities will address the technical and\n            fiduciary skills needed at the different decentralized\n            levels to implement local development activities. Component\n            3: Will support a Project Coordination Team (PCT)\n            responsible for technical and fiduciary oversight o f the\n            project. It will be mainstreamed within the Department o f\n            State for Local Government and Lands (DOSLGL) and its size\n            will be limited to core functions critical to the\n            project's success and for which severe capacity\n            constraints exist in the Gambian civil service (overall\n            coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and fiduciary matters)."}, "docdt": "2006-08-04T00:00:00Z"}
