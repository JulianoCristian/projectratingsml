                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The overall performance of the project is satisfactory (S). The project has made significant progress towards the achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs). The
                         data collected shows that all three outcome indicators have been achieved. As of October 2012, 99 percent of community subprojects completed against the target of 70 percent;
                         98.6 percent of satisfaction with the results of the community subprojects in the targeted rural population against a target of 90 percent; 92 percent of community subprojects fully
                         functional after 2 years from their completion against a target of 70 percent (to date all subprojects that have been financed are functional).

                         2. The disbursement rate at end October 2012 is 100 percent for IDA, 100 percent for PHRD, and 87 percent for Government counterpart funding, compared to overall 2010

                         disbursement rates of 70 percent (78 percent for IDA, 98 percent for PHRD, and 19 percent for Government counterpart funding). These figures suggest a very significant
                         improvement in government commitment to the project since the MTR in July 2010.

                         3. Rural communities, in partnership with Local Government Authorities, have formulated Strategic Development Plans (SDPs) for all targeted villages (525) and wards (88). Currently

                         a total of 1428 subprojects have been financed; 1420 have been completed and are fully operational; whilst the implementation of the remaining 8 is currently under way. The
                         significant achievements of subproject implementation in the villages and wards reflect the effective participatory planning and implementation nature of the CDDP approach.
                         Management Committees for sustainability have been established in all targeted villages and wards, and are working well in the majority of the villages and wards. These committees
                         are responsible for making sure that community contributions are mobilized and to ensure the protection as well as effective and efficient use of subproject facilities.
