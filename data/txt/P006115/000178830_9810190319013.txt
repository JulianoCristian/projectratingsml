REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
COMPANIA YACIBOL BOGOC TRANSPORTADORES
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE

REPORT AND RECOWE14DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO COMPANIA YACIBOL BOGOC TRANSPORTADORES IJITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA AND THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
1.        I submit the following report and reccmmendation on a proposed
loan to replace the loan originally made in 1969 to Compania Yacibol
Bogoc Transportadores (YABOG) for the construction of a natural gas
pipeline from Santa Cruz in Bolivia to Yacuiba on the Bolivian-Argentine
border.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        On July 1, 1969, the Executive Directors, acting on my recommen-
dation contained in Report No. P-705 of June 19, 1969, approved a loan in
various currencies equivalent to $23,250,000 to YABOG for the construction
of a transmission system to deliver gas from Bolivia to Argentina pursuant
to a 20-year Sales Agreement entered into in July 1968. The loan was
signed on July 22, 1969 and guaranteed by the Republic of Bolivia. It
was further jointly and severally guaranteed by YABOG's two owners,
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), the Bolivian state
oil enterprise, and Bolivian Gulf Oil Company (BOGOC), with Gulf Oil
Corporation of the United States guaranteeing the obligatimns of BOGOC.
The Bank was to finance half of the cost of the project; the other half
was to be financed by the New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF),
which in June 1969 made a $25 million loan to YABOG iwith the guarantee
of Gulf Oil Corporation.
3.        On October 17, 1969, before the conditions of effectiveness of
the Bank's loan had been met, Bolivia nationalized the properties of BOGOC
and terminated its concession. This affected the guarantee of Gulf Oil
Corporation, certain undertakings of BOGOC, and the organization of the gas
fields near Santa Cruz, and rendered it impossible to declare the loan
effective. Meanwhile, construction of the project had started and its
interruption gave rise to additional costs, creating a gap in the financing.
This gap was greatly widened when the NYSCRF decided to cancel the
undrawn balance of its loan, reducing its amount to $14 million.
4.        The nationalization notwithstanding, Bolivia and Argentina
continued to have a strong interest in the construction of the pipeline.
At the same. time,both the Bolivian Government and Gulf showed evidence
of desire to reach an amicable settlement on payment of compensation
for the nationalized properties. At a very early stage, the Bolivian
Government confirmed to the Bank its intention to indemnify BOGOC, and
shortly thereafter discussions began on the reconstitution of the
project. In December 1969, the Argentine Government offered to give
its guarantee for the Bankts loan in substitution for the guarantee of
Gulf, and in February 1970 it agreed to postpone the date by which
gas deliveries would start under the Sales Agreement.



5.        On September 10, 1970, the Bolivian Government issued a Supreme
Decree providing for payment to BOGOC of an amount of up to $101.1
million, determined by independent consultants as BOGOC's investment
under its concession. A 22 percent tax, established by the same Decree
and earmarked for exploration and project preparation by YPFB, reduced
the amount to be collected by BOGOC to about $78.6 million. The indemnity
is to be paid by channelling through a trustee 25 percent of the sales
proceeds of exports of gas and oil from the Caranda, Colpa and Rio Grande
fields (the fields formerly operated by BOGOC). Payments will cease
when the amount of $78.6 million has been paid, or at the end of 20 years,
whichever shall be the earlier. The Decree conditioned the payment of
indemnity, inter alia, on the Bank's loan being made effective and on
additional funds being provided to complete the gas pipeline project.
At the same time, BOGOC concluded an agreement with the Bolivian Govern-
ment in which, inter alia, it committed itself or Gulf Oil Corporation
to continue Gulf's guarantee for the NYSCRF loan and to meet any cost
overrun on the project. Also in September 1970, the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), agreed to consider a loan to meet the gap in
the financing plan.
6.        By March 1971, after extensive consultations among the parties
involved in the pipeline project, agreement was reached on arrangements
for the management and operation of the Caranda, Colpa and Rio Grande
oil and gas fields and on the payment, through a trustee, of the indemnity
and debt service. At the same time, the Bolivian Government, YPFB and
Gulf reached agreement on the settlement of various outstanding claims
and counterclaims separate from the indemnity. This resulted in a net
debt of $11.1 million, due to Gulf, which is to be paid by earmarking a
part of the export proceeds from crude oil produced in the fields of
Caranda, Colpa and Rio Grande. Most of this debt is expected to be repaid
before indemnity payments begin; the balance will be paid soon thereafter
with 10 percent of oil export proceeds being used for this purpose.
7.        The negotiation of the Guarantee Agreement with Argentina took
place on April 6 with lIr. Luis Alberto Rey, Under-Secretary of Energy,
and Hr. Marcelo Huergo, Secretary to the Argentine Embassy in Washington.
The renegotiation of the Loan Agreement with YABOG and the Guarantee
Agreement with Bolivia, and the negotiation of the Gas Production
Agreement with YPFB and the YPFB Santa Cruz Division, were carried out
between April 21 and 26 with Messrs. Gonzalo Ruiz Ballivian, Under-
Secretary at the Ministry of Finance, Rolando Prada Mendez, General
Manager of YPFB and President of YABOG, Humberto Suarez Roca, Manager of
YABOG, and Carlos Delius, Manager of the YPFB Santa Cruz Division.
8.        The loan is the first made by the Bank in Bolivia.   The status
of previous IDA credits to Bolivia as of May 31, 1971, is given in
annex 1. Report No. P-939 of May 14, 1971, in which I recommended for
approval by the Executive Directors an IDA credit of $6.8 million to
Bolivia for the third livestock project, described the current activities
and lending prospects of the Bank group in Bolivia.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPO03ED LOAN
9.        Borrower:              Compania Yacibol Bogoc Transportadores
(YABOG)
Guarantors:           Republic of Bolivia
The Argentine Republic
Amount:               In various currencies equivalent to
US$ 23,250,000.
Purpose:              To help finance the constructicn of
a gas pipeline from Santa Cruz in
Bolivia to Yacuiba on the Bolivian-
Argentine border.
Amortization:         In 20 years, including a 2-year period
of grace, through semi-annual install-
ments beginning July 1, 1973 and
ending July 1, 1991.
Interest rate:        6-1/2 percent, as approved when the
loan was originally considered on
July 1, 1969.
Comritment charge:    3/4 of 1 percent per annum, accruing
frcm September 20, 1969, as in the case
of the original loan.
The guarantee of the Argentine Republic (unlike the earlier guarantee
of Gulf Oil Corporation) is subject to the limitations described in
paragraph 26 below.
PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       The Santa Cruz-Yacuiba pipeline is an international project
requiring the close cooperation of both Bolivia and Argentina to achieve
success.  It should prove of great benefit to both countries and make a
contribution to the econcmic integration of South America.   The project
addresses itself to Bolivia's basic need for diversification and expansion
of exports; it would strengthen Bolivia's external payments position and
result in substantial tax revenue to the Government. At the same time, the
project meets Argentina's demand for more natural gas, without the need for
immediate heavy investment in the development of its own natural gas
deposits. The project was appraised in Report No. PTR-19a (Appraisal of
the Compania Yacibol Bogoc Transportadores Gas Pipeline Project) distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on June 19, 1969. That report referred
to the discovery of natural gas in the areas of Santa Cruz and Monteagudo
in Bolivia, and to the gradual exhaustion of the Argentine gas field at
Campo Duran, located near Yacuiba and connected with Buenos Aires with
an existing gas pipeline. It further summarized the Sales Agreement,



- 4 -
signed on July 23, 1968, by YPFB and BOGOC with Gas del Estado, the
Argentine state gas enterprise, and providing for the delivery of 4
million m3 (141 Mvicf) of gas per day in the first seven years and of
4.5 million m3 (159 Ficf) in the following thirteen years.
11.       The project consists of the construction of a 530km-long high
pressure natural gas trunk line from Santa Cruz to Yacuiba, a 20km-long
lateral line to Naranjillos and a number of river crossings, together
with metering and regulating stations and other appurtenant facilities.
It is expected to be completed in the first half of 1972.   A 140km-long
pipeline from the YPFB field at Monteagudo to the trunk line was included
in the original project but will not be constructed, because the earlier
interest which Bolivia had in deriving a larger net inflow of foreign
exchange from YPFB fields, as compared with BOGOC fields, disappeared
with the passing of the BOGOC fields into YPFB hands.
12.       Construction was well under way at the time of BOGOC nationali-
zation. In the spring of 1969 already, after international comnetitive
bidding conducted in accordance with the Bankts guidelines, YABOG placed
orders for pipe with Ferrostaal, A.G., of the Federal Republic of Germany
and awarded the construction contract to 1Williams Brothers of the United
States. Work on the project was interrupted in November 1969 because of
the nationalization of BOGOC. By that time, however, about 140 km of
trunk line pipe had been installed, the Naranjillos lateral line completed
and much foundation work on the four major bridges carried out. Substantial
quantities of pipe were stored in Argentina, and miscellaneous equipment and
materials were in transit or awaiting shipment in the United States.
13.      dJork on the project resumed in April 1971. The contracts wqith
l-Jilliams Brothers and Ferrostaal have been reinstated on terms which,
while more expensive than the original terms, are reasonable in the light
of specific cost changes in the intervening period. YABOG has retained
Van Houten Associates, a U.S. consulting firm which had formerly assisted
BOGOC in designing bridges for the project, to carry out construction
supervision originally entrusted to Gulf.
14.       The project cost was estimated in 1969 at $46.5 million, about
10 percent of it representing the cost of Monteagudo lateral line. Price
increases, the appreciation of the German mark, financial and storage
charges, and the contractor's demobilization and remobilization expenses,
have raised the cost estimates to about $56 million. Of this, about
$51 million would be expenditure in foreign exchange and about $5 million
in Bolivian pesos. The total consists of:
$ millicn
Construction services                       24.5
Pipe                                       15.8
Other equipment and materials               3.8
Engineering and consulting services          3.4
Loan interest and other charges             5.6
Miscellaneous                                0.9
Contingencies                               2.0
7.0



Through 1970, about $27.5 million had been spent on the project, most of
it before the nationalization of BOGOC. Of this, $14 million was disbursed
by the NYSCRF and $8.2 million advanced by Gulf, while $5.3 million
represented unpaid invoices for work performed by Williams Brothers.
Pending the effective date of the Bank and IDB loans, YPFB arranged in
May 1971 with the First National City Bank (FINCB) for a short-term loan
in the amount of $10 million to finance the resumDtion of construction.
This loan would be refunded from the proceeds of the Bank and IDB loans.
15.           The financing plan for the reconstituted project provdes for
$14 millicn made available in 1969 by the NYSCRF, $19 million from the
IDB, and $23.25 million from the Bank. The terms of the NYSCRF loan
remain unchanged at 20 years life and 7 percent interest. The proposed
IDB loan (which is being presented to the IDB Executive Directors
parallel with this loan) would be for 20 years, with amortization
coRmencing after 4 years, and would bear an interest rate of about 8.2
percent. Any cost overrun on the project would be met by Gulf in accordance
with commitments made to Bolivia, which will be confirmed directly by Gulf
to the Bank at the time of the signing of the new loan documents.
16.           Since the purpose of the loan and the basic project are
unchanged from those approved by the Executive Directors in July 1969,
and since a substantial investment in the project was made in 1969
following the action by the Executive Directors, I recommend that the
interest rate of the proposed loan remain unchanged at 6-1/2 percent,
with ccmmitment charge accruing from September 20, 1969, as under the
original loan agreeTment.
17.           The Bank and the IDB would enter into an agreement to co-
operate in the administration of their respective loans. The proceeds of
both loans would be available to finance new foreign exchange expenditures
on the project and to reimburse the advances made by Gulf and -Williams
Brothers. They would also reimburse YABOG for eligible expenditures on
the project made out of the $10 million interim loan by FNCB. As in the
original Bank loan, the Bank ifould reimburse expenditures made after
April 30, 1969, and, in the case of engineering services, after July 31,
1968; similarly, the IDB management has recommended that, as an exceptional
case, the proposed IDB loan be eligible, up to an amount of $13.5 million,
to reimburse expenditures made after those dates. The proceeds of the
Bank's loan would be applied mainly to the foreign exchange cost of the
construction contract and those of the IDB loan to pipe procurement. In
addition, each of the Banks would finance part of the foreign exchange
cost of engineering and consulting services, and interest and certain
other charges on its loan. The availability of the funds under the
proposed Bank loan and the IDB loan would be inter-dependent. Local
expenditure on the project and the remainder of foreign exchange
expenditure would be covered by the loan from NYSCRF.
18.           The economic rate of return on the project is presently
estimated at about 20 percent. The rate of return on the original project,
including the Monteagudo lateral, was 24 percent; writhout the Monteagudo
lateral it would have been 33 percent. In other words, the reduction in
the rate of return resulting from the increased cost of the trunk line



will be largely offset by the economies realized from abandoning the
Monteagudo lateral. This rate of return assumes gas sales at the minimum
volumes specified in the sales contract with Gas del Estado. However,
the Argentine authorities have informed Bolivia that they expect to take
substantial additional quantities for which both the gas reserves and
the pipeline capacity wi11 be adequate.  Such additional purchases would
increase the rate of return on the project.
19.           The Borrower, YABOG, is incorporated in the United States and
has its principal domicile in Bolivia. Half of its stock is still held
by BOGOC but will be transferred, before the signing of the renegotiated
loan, to YPFB which will thus become YABOGts sole owner. The originally
adopted policy that gas will be transmitted by YABOG at cost will be
maintained. The draft Loan Agreement provides for the execution of the
project under the supervision of experienced and competent management,
and the present Manager of YABOG, a Bolivian engineer, meets these quali-
fications. The draft Loan Agreement further provides that (i) YABOG
will consult with the Bank on any proposed expansicn and will not undertake
any new project which, in the opinion of the Bank, would substantially
and adversely affect the position of the company or the efficiency
of its management; and (ii) YABOG will not, without the Bank's agreement,
incur any debt in excess of $100,000, in addition to the funds required
to build the pipeline.
20.           The Caranda, Colpa and Rio Grande fields are the source of gas
to be transmitted through the pipeline and sold to Gas del Estado, and
their efficient operation is crucial to the success of the project. To
this end, the Bolivian Government issued on April 19, 1971 a Decree-Law
authorizing YPFB to set up, within its legal structure, a separately-
managed Santa Cruz Division to administer and operate the three fields.
This Division was created, and its By Laws approved, by a resolution of
the YPFB Board of Directors on April 22, 1971. It has a high degree of
autonomy in administrative, commercial, financial and technical matters,
including the right to enter into contracts, and the funds required for
its operations are to be held segregated from other YPFB funds. Thus,
the Division should not be greatly affected by changes in the management
of YPFB. The Division is headed by an experienced and competent Bolivian
NIanager, who reports to a Ilanagement Committee consisting of three high
ranking YPFB officials. A representative of the Bank will attend the
meetings of the Committee and participate in its deliberations without
the right to vote. Moreover, the Division has entered into a contract
with a leading firm of gas and petroleum consultants, De Golyer and
1IcNaughton, who will provide the head of the Division's operations depart-
ment and other specialized technical assistance, and train Bolivian
personnel on the job. The draft Gas Production Agreement between the
Bank, YPFB and the YPFB Santa Cruz Division provides that the Manager of
the Division will be appointed in agreement with the Bank and that the
Division will continue to employ consultants acceptable to the Bank.

PART IV - RE PAYME NT OF THE LOAN
21.      Although Bolivia's ability to service debt on conventional
terms is verj limited, the country is justified in assuming such debt
in this case by the particular nature of the project, which will di-
rectly earn in foreign exchange amounts substantially in excess of the
service on the debt contracted for its construction. A cash flow
projection for the Caranda, Colpa and Rio Grande fields, prepared by
Bolivian officials, shows sales of gas to Argentina and of crude oil
exported through Arica at $425.2 million for the years 1971-1991.
These sales proceeds, and the proceeds of oil sales in the domestic
market equivalent to $111.7 million, are expected to be applied as
follows (for detail see annex 2):
$ million
Investment in the fields                       18.3
Operating expenses ( Santa Cruz Division       98.4
( YABOG                     22.0
Service payments on loans                      95.4
Indemnity to BOGOC                             78.6
Surplus and taxes to Bolivian Government      224.2
536.9
22.     Three trusts will be created in order to ensure the orderly
distribution of export proceeds from oil and gas p~roduced in, or attrib-
utable to, the Caranda, Colpa and Rio Grande fields among the various
beneficiaries: the lenders for the pipeline; Gulf, in respect to its
indemnity and the repayment of its other claims; YPFB and YABOG for
operating expenses of the fields and the pipeline; and finally YPFB as
the residual beneficiary. The agreements creating these trusts will
provide that foreign purchasers of oil and gas will make payment in U.S.
dollars to a trustee for distribution among the various interested parties.
First National City Banlc of NewJi York (FNCB) will act as trustee. The
three trust agreements wrill be: the Bolivian Crude Oil Trust Account
Agreement between YPFB and FNCB; the Indemnity Trust Agreement between
YPFB, Gulf Oil Corporation, BOGCOC and Fi\ICB; and the Lenders Trust Agreem-
ent betTween YPFB, FNCB, IDB, the Bank, NYSCRF, Gulf and the Central Banlc
of Bolivia. These agreements are to be signed prior to the signing of
the Bank and IDB Loan and Guarantee Agreements. The Bolivian Crude Oil
Trust Account Agreement and the Indemnity Trust Agreement will be approved
by the Bolivian Government and the Lenders Trust Agreement by the Gov-
ernments of Bolivia and Argentina.
23.      Under the Bolivian Crude Oil Trust Account Agreement, YPFB will
assign to the trustee 100 percent of export proceeds of oil and will agree
to require the purchasers to pay the full price in U.S. dollars to the
trustee. Beginning January 1, 1973 (or, at Boliviats option, three months



- 8 -
after the start of gas exports to Argentina) the trustee will transfer
25 percent of the oil proceeds to the Indemnity Trust and 75 percent to
the Lenders Trust. Prior to that date, and after the indemnity has been
fully paid (or after 20 years), all the proceeds will be paid to the
Lenders Trust.
24.       Under the Indemnity Trust Agreement, YPFB will assign to the
trustee) and the latter will pay to an account opened in the name of
BOGOC, 25 percent of the proceeds of gas sold to Gas del Estado. The
trustee will also credit the BOGOC account with 25 percent of oil export
proceeds, in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of the Bolivian
Crude Oil Trust Account Agreement. At the beginning of every month, the
trustee will deduct and pay over to YPFB the 22 percent tax established
by the Supreme Decree of September 10, 1970, the remaining balance being
paid to Gulf Oil Corporation.  Payments into the Indemnity Trust will
begin on January 1, 1973 (or, at Bolivia's option, three months after
the start of gas exports to Argentina) and will cease when Gulf has
received $78.6 million or at the end of 20 years, whichever shall be
earlier.
25.       Under the Lenders Trust Agreement, the trustee will receive (i)
frcn January 1, 1973, until the indemnity obligaticn has been satisfied,
75 percent of export proceeds of oil and gas produced in, or attributable
to, the Caranda, Colpa and Rio Grande fields (and prior to January 1,
1973, and after the indemnity has been fully paid, 100 percent of such
proceeds) and (ii) 100 percent of export proceeds of any other gas trans-
mitted through the pipeline. The trustee will open a number of accounts,
the beneficiaries of which will be: IDB, the Bank, NYSCRF and, if
necessary to cover a project cost overrun, Gulf (or any lender brought in
for that purpose by Gulf); Gulf as creditor under the claims settlement
with the Bolivian Government and YPFB; and the Central Bank of Bolivia as
a trustee for YABOG, the YPFB Santa Cruz Division and YPFB. The three
lenders (and any lender financing an overrun) will have priority in respect
of gas proceeds and to the extent that gas proceeds are insufficient to
cover debt service, also in respect of oil proceeds. The prior claim
of the lenders will be further strengthened by the establishment of a
reserve account, in which will be deposited as from the date of project
completion (and subsequently held on deposit) oil and gas proceeds
sufficient to meet the next succeeding semi-annual debt service install-
ments. The next-in-line beneficiary of oil proceeds will be Gulf in its
capacity of creditor. The remaining oil and gas proceeds will be paid
by the trustee to the Central Bank of Bolivia for allocaticn among
YABOG, the YPFB Santa Cruz Division and YPFB. On the other hand, if
the funds in the Central Bank account were to fall short of the operating
needs of YABOG or the YPFB Santa Cruz Division, the arrangements
contemplate that the lenders might instruct the trustee to release the
necessary amounts from their accounts and the reserve account.
26.       If the funds received by the Bank through the lenders trust were
ever to fall short of loan service requirements, the Bank would turn for
payment to the Guarantors, Bolivia and Argentina. The Bolivian guarantee
is unconditional. The obligation of Argentina under its Guarantee Agreement



- 9 -
is subject to suspension after 180 days in the event that gas deliveries
to Argentina became impossible because of any act by the Bolivian Govern-
ment deliberately designed to prevent them, or as a result of revolution,
insurrection or war in Bolivia. The Argentine guarantee would further
be suspended in the event of the suspension of the loan on the grounds
of Bolivia's failure to meet its obligations under other Agreements with
the Bank or IDA, and if such an event should lead to cancellation or
prematuring of the loan, then the Argentine guarantee would be terminated.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUM4ENTS AND AUTHORITY
27.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and YABOG, the draft
Gas Production Agreement between the Bank, YPFB and the YPFB Santa Cruz
Division; the draft Guarantee Agreements between Bolivia and the Bank,
and Argentina and the Bank; the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank;
and the text of a Resolution approving the renegotiated loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
28.       Except for several references to the trust arrangements, the
draft Loan Agreement and the draft Guarantee Agreement with Bolivia
follow substantially the form of the Agreements signed in 1969. The
draft Loan Agreement includes, as additional events of suspension and
prematuring, a default in the performance by any party under the Sales
Agreement with Gas del Estado, the Lenders Trust Agreement and the
Bolivian Crude Oil Trust Account Agreement. Certain specific features of
the draft Gas Production Agreement and the draft Guarantee Agreement with
Argentina have been referred to, respectively, in paragraphs 2-0 and
26 above.
29.       Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan include the
fulfilment of all conditions precedent to withdrawal under the IDB Loan
Agreement, the acquisition by YABGG of all lands, rights and privileges
necessary to construct the Project and carry on its business, and the
granting of all necessary approvals and authorizations with reference to
the loan and trust documents, the Sales Agreement with Gas del Estado,
the Gulf overrun commitment and the By-Laws of YPFB Santa Cruz Division.
30.       The agreements relative to the original loan will terminate upon
the approval of the renegotiated loan by the Executive Directors.
PART VI - TrFE ECONOMY
31.       A report on the "Current Econacic Position and Prospects of
Bolivia" (WlH-199) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 1,
1970.  A iiemorandum on Recent Economic Developments in Bolivia, summarizing
the preliminary findings of an economic mission which visited the
country in February/March 1971, was distributed to the Executive Directors



- 10 -
on Flay 17, 1971, with the President's Report and Recommendation on a
proposed IDA credit for the third livestock project (P-939).   That report
also referred to the status of service payments on Bolivia's external
dollar bonds and to steps towards settlement of the claims arising from
the recent nationalization of the assets of two U.S.-owned mining companies.
PART VII - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEM4ENT
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VIII - RECONINENDATION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
