Gas del Estado is\n            obligated to purchase at a fixed price in U.S. dollars, 141\n            million cubic feet per day for the first 7 years and 159\n            million cubic feet for the following 13 years. To transport\n            the gas to Argentina, a 24-inch pipeline, 329 miles in\n            length, will be built from the Santa Cruz region in eastern\n            Bolivia, where the principal gas fields are located, to the\n            border at Yacuiba. Gas del Estado will build a short\n            connection on the Argentine side of the border to link the\n            new pipeline with its existing pipeline to Buenos Aires. The\n            project includes, in addition, the construction of a\n            12-3/4-inch lateral pipeline, 89 miles long, to connect\n            YPFB's Monteagudo field in southern Bolivia to the main system."}, "docdt": "1971-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
