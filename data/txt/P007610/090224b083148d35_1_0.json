A decade ago, Mexico\u2019s development banks accounted\n            for one-fifth of the total credit provided by the banking\n            sector, yet their operations were often inefficient,\n            ineffective and blighted by high costs and undue risks. The\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development worked\n            with the Mexican government to slim down the number of\n            development banks and to make them more effective and\n            accountable, thereby ensuring public funds were being\n            well-targeted and efficiently used. Based on recommendations\n            of the joint World Bank and International Monetary Fund\n            Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2000, the Bank used\n            new loans to transform development financial institutions. A\n            Restructuring loan helped transform the Financial Housing\n            Aid Fund into the Federal Mortgage Corporation, a\n            well-respected and market engaged institution. Rural Finance\n            Development Structural Adjustment Loan assisted in the\n            liquidation of Banrural, an institution that introduced huge\n            distortions in the rural finance markets, and instead\n            established the Financiera Rural to provide financial\n            services to small and mid-sized rural markets. Finally, a\n            Savings and Rural Finance Loan helped with the\n            transformation of Pahnal, an economic vehicle to invest\n            small depositors\u2019 savings in risk-free government\n            instruments, into Bansefi, to provide cost pooling for\n            technological development and a common marketing brand for cooperatives."}, "docdt": "2010-03-15T08:49:05Z"}
