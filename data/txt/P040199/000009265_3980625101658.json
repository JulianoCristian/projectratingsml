is Phase I of the proposed Adaptable\n            Program Loan (APL), which supports the government's\n            compensatory education programs, as outlined in its\n            Education Development Program (PDE) through CONAFE (National\n            Agency for Educational Development), working exclusively\n            with underserved (i.e., rural, poor, indigenous, and\n            marginalized urban areas) communities. The APL further\n            improves the quality of its compensatory programs, continues\n            its policies to redress inequities in the sector, continues\n            to decentralize, and provides a smooth transition across\n            presidential administrations. There are two projects\n            components. The first improves quality in basic education by\n            1) carrying out in-service training of teachers, principals,\n            supervisors, and other administrative staff; 2)\n            strengthening school-based management at the local community\n            and school association levels; 3) strengthening supervision;\n            and 4) building and rehabilitating school infrastructure as\n            well as providing equipment and teaching aids. The second\n            component strengthens institutional capacity at the federal\n            level by strengthening the national evaluation system,\n            implementing a regional planning exercise, and setting up\n            pilot programs for migrant children, for children aged 9-14\n            in urban marginal areas, and for indigenous children in\n            regular schools. It also helps states implement their\n            institutional development proposals and other\n            state-generated initiatives."}, "docdt": "1998-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
