satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was highly likely, the institutional\n            development impact was substantial, and the Bank and\n            borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicated that there is a need for well designed\n            outcome indictors, in-service teacher training reform,\n            community, and especially parents participation. The\n            Adjustment Program Loan (APL) is well suited for achieving\n            program objectives that require long term investments, such\n            as improvements in the quality of basic education.\n            Successful approaches tend to include allowances for\n            adaptation to improve the fit between design and the\n            particular needs of local contexts. Mexico has decentralized\n            to the states the function of providing universal basic\n            education since 1992. The basis of successful pilot programs\n            seems to be the availability of pertinent research findings\n            to orient the selection of appropriate intervention which\n            the pilot will test, as well as the necessary institutional\n            base to carry out the pilot. The relationship between\n            education and income in Mexico is positive, and economic\n            rates of returns are positive for all levels. Achievement\n            and sustainability of organizational and operational changes\n            require continuous reinforcement of ownership and\n            participation throughout project design and implementation.\n            Appropriate policies and relevant sector interventions\n            require a capacity not only to assess student learning\n            outcomes, but also to identify which factors produce the\n            best results. The design of schemes involving inter-state\n            competition needs careful planning and probing for political\n            feasibility prior to implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
