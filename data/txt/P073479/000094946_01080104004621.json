aims\n            to assist the government to a) identify the extent of the\n            existing environmental liabilities of public enterprises and\n            rank them accordingly as to which needs full audit or no\n            audit; b) broadly assess the environmental conditions at the\n            enterprises to be privatized against the risk of being held\n            responsible for damages after privatization; c) use the\n            environmental pre-audit as a starting point for assessing\n            the enterprise's environmental and health status prior\n            to privatization; and d) assess the responsibility of\n            monitoring and compliance of each party to meet the\n            internationally accepted environmental standards. The\n            pre-audit will be conducted in two phases: focusing to\n            privatize the telecommunication company -- Telecommunicacoes\n            de Mozambique (TDM), the national airline -- Linheas Aeras\n            de Mozambique (LAM) , and to concession the Maputo\n            International Airport (MIA). For MIA, a partial pre-audit\n            will be required to deal with solid waste disposal,\n            treatment of water, and VOA equipment. For LAM, no audit is\n            required since the current fleet being operated does not\n            pose any environmental concerns, For TDM, no audit is\n            required since TDM has been able to resolve the main\n            concerns relating to the decommissioning of cross-bar\n            exchanges and other analog equipment with a Zimbabwean enterprise."}, "docdt": "2001-07-23T00:00:00Z"}
