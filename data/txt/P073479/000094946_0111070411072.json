will improve the access, and quality of communications\n            services in Mozambique, by creating a competitive\n            environment, with private participation in the\n            telecommunications, postal, and air transport\n            infrastructure, and services. Project components will: 1)\n            develop a telecommunication policy, through consulting\n            services to reflect the principles of liberalization,\n            independent regulation, and privatization of the Public\n            Telecommunication Company (TDM). Assistance will also be\n            provided to the Ministry of Transport and Communications in\n            building capacity in sector analysis, policy formulation,\n            and monitoring criteria to liaise throughout the reform\n            process. Additionally, a comprehensive telecommunications,\n            and postal legal, and regulatory framework will be prepared,\n            by strengthening the Telecommunications and Postal\n            Regulatory Authority's capacity, and, technical\n            assistance (TA) will support TDM's privatization. A\n            strategy for market-based rural access should establish\n            provision of seed money, and universal fund access, while a\n            modernization strategy will elaborate a postal policy\n            focused on competitiveness to improve services, in addition\n            to enabling legislation for an information, and\n            communications (IC) technology strategy; 2) develop an air\n            transport policy, and regulatory framework, by strengthening\n            the capacity of the Civil Aviation Policy Unit, through the\n            provision of TA, training, and consulting services, to\n            restructure, and foster private participation of the\n            national airline, and to implement the concession of the\n            Maputo International Airport; and, 3) support project\n            management, procurement, and financial management, and,\n            finance IC campaign and dissemination."}, "docdt": "2001-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
