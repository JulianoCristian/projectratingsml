moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: when the implementation\n            capacity of the borrower is limited, more effort/resources\n            are needed to keep the project implementation unit and the\n            implementing agencies actively involved and proactive: i.e.\n            effort to encourage each implementing agency to have an\n            empowered focal point in charge of project components,\n            effort from the World Bank (WB) to keep those staff updated\n            especially in case of high turnover. In a country that shows\n            overall limited project implementation effectiveness, it is\n            also important to define a realistic time line for project\n            implementation and/or scope of activities. Full development\n            impact from liberalization of the sector, including\n            privatization of the incumbent, can only be experienced when\n            liberalization actions are comprehensive and timely. Three\n            key factors are needed for a rural access component to be\n            successful: a good strategy based on an accurate evaluation\n            of the market components (supply and demand), the existence\n            of the right balance of competition in the market and\n            incentives mechanisms embedded in the tender process, and a\n            swift implementation of the tender process so as to keep the\n            investors committed."}, "docdt": "2009-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
