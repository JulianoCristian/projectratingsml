for the Rural Finance Program\n            Project for Romania were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: increasingly, as liquidity of the financial sector\n            expands, more and more funds are potentially available for\n            lending to agriculture. To take advantage of this situation,\n            considerably more needs to be done to reduce the risks\n            related to the sector's activities. The focus\n            therefore, especially in light of evident climate change\n            moving toward a more complex, agricultural finance and risk\n            management instruments such as warehouse receipts, weather\n            index-based crop insurance or partial risk guarantees.\n            Although some of these issues were expected to be dealt with\n            during the second phase of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL),\n            they can have been more effectively dealt with at the same\n            time as the credit line, to make sure these risk mitigating\n            systems are in place by the time the credit line closes. A\n            lack of specific bank-wide guidance on acceptable commercial\n            practices and their supervision needs made it difficult for\n            the Government and the Bank team to properly assess the\n            procurement activities under the credit line if needed. For\n            projects that are operating in a rapidly changing\n            environment and are demand-based, the funding mechanisms\n            need to be kept as streamlined and flexible as possible. The\n            Government and the Bank were able to be flexible to\n            compensate for cumbersome arrangements, but flexible\n            mechanisms should be included at the design stage."}, "docdt": "2008-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
