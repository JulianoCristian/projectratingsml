the\n            risk to development outcome was significant, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: Before a loan is negotiated it is vital to\n            secure the implementing agency\u2019s agreement to project\n            components and implementation procedures. Investment\n            projects need to be sufficiently flexible to allow for rapid\n            and often unanticipated changes in the economy and the\n            external environment. Changes in financial sector conditions\n            during project implementation may make it difficult to\n            forecast the demand for Bank-financed credit lines. Before\n            governments enter into an agency relationship with\n            microfinance institutions (MFIs) the possible consequences\n            for overall investment flow need to be fully understood."}, "docdt": "2009-06-22T01:40:04Z"}
