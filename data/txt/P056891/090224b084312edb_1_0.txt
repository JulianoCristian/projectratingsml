IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessa ry level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Rural Finance Project
in Romania. It is intended also to contribute to IEG’s FY10 Agriculture Study. The
Project (Loan 46020), an APL for US$ 80.0 million equivalent, was approved on March
29, 2001. Intended as the first of a two phase APL, a follow-on loan was dropped from
the program at Government’s request. Following two extensions, the Loan was closed on
November 30, 2007, twenty months later than the date established at appraisal. An
Implementation Completion Report was submitted on May 22, 2008.

This report was prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) based on the
Implementation Completion Reports, Staff Appraisal Reports, Loan Agreements, as well
as a review of Bank files. IEG sent a mission to Romania in February 2009, and held
interviews with a number of stakeholders, including representatives of Government, and
the implementing agencies, including local staff, direct beneficiaries, and other donors in
Romania. The cooperation and assistance of all stakeholders and government officials is
gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, the draft PPAR was sent to government officials and
agencies for their review and comments. The Borrower’s response is attached at Annex
E.

Summary

The Romania Rural Finance Project (RFP) was conceived as an initial phase of an
adaptable program loan (APL), whose design benefited from the lessons of prior Bank
operations in Romania, namely an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan and a detailed
review of the country’s rural financial markets, investment needs and demand for credit.

The over-riding objective of the APL sequence was to promote economic growth and
reduce poverty in rural Romania through the provision of financial services. At project
inception, the country was recovering from a lost decade, following the precipitous
declines in GDP and agricultural value-added that followed the collapse of the Ceausescu
regime. The 1999 financial crisis was a turning point in Romania’s reform process. The
country was without fiscal or financial headroom to promote needed reforms, and its
relations with international creditors were poor. A Bank-supported adjustment program
helped to break the impasse, while the prospect of EU accession gave added momentum
to a reform process that accelerated in the early 2000s after the financial crisis had
abated.

RFP, approved on March 21, 2001, had four specific development objectives: (i)
accelerate the economic transformation of the rural economy by increasing the flow of
investment capital to the sector; (ii) strengthen the role of the private sector in the rural
economy; (iii) strengthen the Borrower’s capacity to receive funding from the European
Union Special Accession Program for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD);
and (iv) alleviate rural poverty through financing of farm and off-farm investments for
poor segments of the rural population. These objectives were backed by three
components: a rural credit and leasing facility; institutional support for rural retail
banking and micro-finance institutions; and a project management and technical
assistance component.

IEG rates project outcome as satisfactory. Although by loan closing Romania’s accession
to the European Union had eased access to investment funds, thereby reducing the need
for a line-of-credit project, overall, the project’s objectives were substantially relevant.
The project substantially achieved its objectives, particularly with respect to institutional
strengthening. In the communes where the project was active, the rural business
environment improved, stimulating enterprise development and commercial farming.
New jobs were generated and household incomes increased. Providing funds to micro-
finance institutions stimulated the delivery of financial services and sub-loans to qualified
smallholders, while transforming these intermediaries from informal outfits into
profitable, regulated firms under central bank supervision. While the impact of the project
on real sector performance was not estimated, an assessment of benefits from a sample of
beneficiary enterprises demonstrated increased profitability and very high returns on
equity and assets. Also, participating financial institutions generally followed the lending
guidelines when appraising investment proposals and borrower’s creditworthiness.

Risk to the project’s development outcome is rated significant. The main risk derives
from the repercussions of the current global economic crisis. Before this crisis, the capital
adequacy and liquidity provisions of participating financial intermediaries were sufficient
                                            xii


to allow the banks, leasing companies and micro-finance institutions to weather a normal
downturn in economic activity. But lately the return of guest workers laid-off in Western
and Central Europe has led to a decline in euro-denominated remittances, which has
disproportionately affected rural households’ ability to service bank and micro-finance
lending. The corresponding weakening of Romania’s balance of payments and the
evaporation of Euro-zone credit lines have led to steady depreciation of the Romanian
Leu. Borrower obligations under the project are dollar-denominated while those outside
the project are mainly euro-denominated, the combined effect being a likely increase in
arrears and defaults. Attempts to bring Romania into the Euro Zone have recently been
rebuffed by the European Central Bank, which could reduce the viability of the financial
intermediaries supported by this project.

The Bank’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Quality at entry was rated
satisfactory by the Bank’s Quality Assessment Group. But design deficiencies identified
by QAG delayed implementation, and forced two restructurings and extensions. On the
other hand, the project was grounded in a solid analysis of Romania’s rural financial
markets; and supervision performance was intensive and eventually helped make up the
ground lost to the early implementation delays.

The Borrower’s performance is also moderately satisfactory. The 22 month delay in
declaring project effectiveness reflected resistance by ministries to implementation
arrangements. But once the loan became effective and the implementation arrangements
were adjusted, the supervising ministries and the project management unit drove the
operation forward swiftly and effectively.

Four lessons are drawn:

       (1) Before a loan is negotiated, it is vital to secure the implementing agency’s
       agreement to project components and implementation procedures. If QAG’s quality
       at entry reservations had been addressed early on this project’s start-up lag may have
       been reduced. Various items were not ready at entry: agreements with financial
       intermediaries had not been sealed, appraisals of financial institutions were
       incomplete, consultant terms of reference had not been finalized, and the
       responsibilities of the implementing agency had not been spelled out. Second,
       procurement procedures were onerous and out of step with the private sector
       environment in Romania.

       (2) Investment projects need to be sufficiently flexible to allow for rapid and often
       unanticipated changes in the economy and the external environment. In this case,
       the project had to be adjusted to take into account the speeding up of Romania’s
       accession to the European Union.

       (3) Changes in financial sector conditions during project implementation may
       make it difficult to forecast the demand for Bank-financed credit lines. This
       project showed that it is better to address the underlying reasons for limited credit
       access—factors such as high risks and the heavy transaction costs entailed by
       lending to small enterprises—rather than directly supplying credit.
                                   xiii


(4) Before governments enter into an agency relationship with microfinance
institutions (MFIs) the possible consequences for overall investment flow need to
be fully understood. In the RFP, no legal framework existed that would allow the
Government to lend to MFIs through their umbrella organizations, which signed
the SLAs and assumed the fiduciary obligations. (The legal framework is now
being developed.) Instead, an agency role was developed for MFIs that required
them to reimburse the Government in the brief period stipulated in the project’s
operating manual. The inability of the MFIs to intermediate the funds they
administered impeded a fuller flow of investment capital to rural entrepreneurs
and farmers, as the MFIs could not readily recycle sub-borrower repayments
under the agency arrangement.

1.      Background

1.1     The 1990s was a period of economic turmoil for Romania. The industrial and
agricultural sectors both contracted in real terms. (Agriculture’s share of GDP was 23 percent
in 1990; today it is about 11 percent.) The agriculture sector functioned partly as a safety net:
the share of agriculture in the labor force rose from 31 percent to 40 percent during the
1990s; and then dropped to 35 percent in 2000-2004. There was progress with agricultural
reform around 1997—subsidies were reduced and loss-making enterprises were closed—but
this was then undermined as government commitment waned.

1.2     The 2005 Country Assistance Evaluation noted that:

                ―The Bank’s involvement in Romanian agriculture started early on and has
been significant, including substantial ESW and lending [as shown in Table 1 below]. The
FY1997 Agricultural Sector Adjustment loan (ASAL) absorbed half of all commitments.
Starting with the findings of a huge economic mission in Oct/Nov 1990, which included a
seven person agricultural team,1 the Bank has had a good understanding of the key
constraints holding back agriculture…. important progress has been made towards relieving
some of these constraints.‖2

1.3     Some achievements of ASAL were noteworthy. Central Bank refinancing of
agriculture was ended. Subsidies were cut and placed ―on budget.‖ Many loss making
enterprises were liquidated or privatized, particularly the very large livestock kombinats.
Also, legal obstacles to agricultural land sales and leasing were removed. But political
support eroded before the project’s second tranche could be fully implemented. The changes
needed to bring the Ministry of Agriculture’s role in line with the requirements of a market
economy did not take place; and there was backtracking on reform of the incentive regime.

Loan closing was delayed by two years, the final tranche remaining undisbursed, owing
mainly to the lack of an acceptable macro-economic program. The outcome of the ASAL
was rated unsatisfactory.3

1.4     The Country Assistance Evaluation concluded that, on balance, the outcome of
Bank’s entire assistance program to Romanian agriculture (from 1992 to 2004) had been
unsatisfactory.4 It noted that agricultural growth had languished despite progress with
reducing subsidies and closing loss-making enterprises. In the highly distorted policy
environment the relevance of investment lending to agriculture was questionable and there
were shortfalls in progress toward objectives.

1.5     Nevertheless, Romania’s economic performance picked up around the turn of the
millennium. The 1999 financial crisis was a turning point. A well-designed adjustment
program, supported by the Bank, focused on the key issues—removing off-budget subsidies
and directed credits for agriculture, and pushing toward privatization of Banca Agricola
(which came in 2001). The adjustment operation was usefully backed up with technical
assistance loans. The prospect of Romania being admitted to the European Union helped
maintain reform momentum, even after the financial crisis had abated.

1.6     By 2004, per capita income had returned to the level of 1989. But little progress had
been made with banking reform. Although the state-owned banks were making fewer losses,
the financial system remained underdeveloped. Banks were reluctant to lend, partly because
they did not have the staff to properly evaluate investment projects. The rural sector (broadly
defined—not limited to agriculture)5 was short of investment capital. The project that is
assessed in this report sought to address that constraint.


2.       Project Objectives and Design

2.1     The Rural Finance Project (RFP) supported the first of what was intended to be a
two-phase program to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in rural Romania. The
specific objectives of the first phase were:

          (i) To accelerate the economic transformation of the rural economy by
                increasing the flow of investment capital to the sector;
          (ii) To strengthen the role of the private sector in the rural economy;

4 World Bank (2005), paragraph 3.34.
5 The Project Appraisal Document noted that, ―In practice, rural areas include the entire country minus about
200 localities which have been granted urban status by legislative action. More than half of total employment
and roughly a fifth of all formally incorporated businesses are located there. Hence, rather than being a sector in
itself, the rural economy constitutes a collection of sectors including banking, state-owned enterprises, private
SMEs, and agriculture‖ (p. 4).
                                                 3


        (iii) To strengthen the Borrower’s capacity to receive funding from the European
              Union Special Accession Program for Agriculture and Rural Development
              (SAPARD); and
        (iv) To alleviate rural poverty through financing of farm and off-farm investments
             for poor segments of the rural population.
2.2     The above project objectives are taken from the Loan Agreement. In addition, the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) fleshes out objective (ii) to include:

                Better access by rural households and private enterprises to financial services;
                 and
                Increased presence of regulated private financial intermediaries in rural
                 localities, thus filling any vacuum left by the closing of rural bank branches
                 following privatization of state banks.

2.3    As described in the PAD, the RFP had three components:

       (i)   Part A: Rural Credit and Leasing Facility ($114.9 million at appraisal; $109.1
             million actual): (a) sub-loans on-lent through participating Private Intermediary
             Banks (PIBs) for farm and non-farm investments in rural productive activities;
             (b) micro-loans disbursed through participating non-governmental and/or private
             Service Providers (SPs) to rural entrepreneurs; and (c) leasing of depreciable
             capital assets by PIBs and leasing companies.

       (ii) Part B: Rural Retail Banking and Micro-Finance ($24.5 million at appraisal;
             $28.8 million actual): financing for (a) Private Retail Banks (PRBs) and SPs to
             develop suitable technologies to provide retail financial services to micro-, small-
             , and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) in rural areas; (b) PRBs to establish
             and operate a network of pilot retail banking offices; (c) SPs to operate a network
             of micro-credit retail points; and (d) training and technical assistance to PRBs
             and SPs, and

       (iii) Part C: Project Management and Technical Assistance ($5.7 million at
             appraisal; $3.9 million actual): technical assistance for project implementation,
             the development of a warehouse receipts system, and for studies related to
             leasing, and public outreach.

2.4     The loan was approved on March 29, 2001 and became effective 11 months later on
February 15, 2002 (22 months after appraisal). Start up was delayed owed to institutional and
procurement problems. Disbursements picked up only after a project management unit was
established in the Ministry of Finance (Figure 1).

2.5     The project was restructured on May 16, 2003 and on March 29, 2004, in an attempt
to accelerate implementation and adapt to changing financial sector conditions. Objectives
and targets remained the same, but implementation procedures were adjusted, maximum sub-
loan sizes were reset, ―rural‖ borrower eligibility was redefined to provide more flexibility in
lending and procurement.

2.6     Also, funds were reallocated between categories to allow for shortfalls in demand and
to increase the project's impact on smaller entrepreneurs and land holders. Demand was less
than expected because banks didn’t want to draw on the project's credit line to finance the
operating costs of new rural branches. Also, foreign investors helped retail banks to upgrade
their technologies, further reducing the call on project funds. The loan was extended twice to
accommodate implementation delays, and closed nearly two years later than expected on
November 30, 2007. The balance of the loan ($6.6 million) was cancelled.

2.7    IEG evaluates the project against the loan agreement’s statement of objectives. It also
evaluates the contribution of the project to overall program objectives. At project closing, the
Government told the Bank it would not seek financing for a second phase of the program.

3.     Project Outcome

RELEVANCE

Relevance of Objectives (Rating: Substantial)

3.1      OBJECTIVE 1 - Accelerate the economic transformation of the rural economy by
increasing the flow of investment capital to the sector. At project inception, Romania’s
commercial banks were reluctant to engage in medium- to long-term lending to any sector of
the economy, partly because of the uncertainties surrounding the ownership and
transferability of fixed and moveable property; and partly because they did not have the staff
to properly evaluate investment projects. This problem was magnified in rural areas, where
banks in general were reluctant to operate and maintain an adequate number of branches.
Accession to the European Union increased the flow of investment capital, some of which
reached rural areas; but, relative to other sectors, agricultural and non-farm rural enterprises
still had difficulties in obtaining investment capital. This objective was still broadly relevant
when the loan closed.

3.2      OBJECTIVE 2 - Strengthen the role of the private sector in the rural economy.
During project preparation and appraisal, the government was still selling off state-owned
banks (such as Banca Agricola) and enterprises (e.g. the local remnants of RomCereal, the
cereals logistics agency), and privatizing the remaining collective farms—which occupied
about one-fifth of the arable land in the country (by and large, the most fertile part). In order
to consolidate the gains from Romania’s privatization and private sector development
initiatives it was necessary to strengthen the rural investment climate, improve the efficiency
and reliability of the general cadastre and land registration system, and expand access to
institutional borrowing in rural areas. The project was consistent with these priorities.

3.3    OBJECTIVE 3 - Strengthen the Borrower’s capacity to receive funding from the
EU’s SAPARD window. Once it embarked on the reforms needed to meet conditions for
accession to the European Union, Romania became eligible for grant financing through the
EU’s Special Accession Program for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD). But
the country was not well placed to prepare the needed project documentation and satisfy the
required 50 percent beneficiary contribution. RFP thus aimed to provide technical advice and
sub-loans to eligible applicants to accelerate financial inflows via the SAPARD grants.

3.4     OBJECTIVE 4 - Alleviate rural poverty through financing of farm and off-farm
investments for poor segments of the rural population. At project inception (2002), 29
percent of the population of Romania fell below the poverty line. Roughly one-half of the
total population and two-thirds of the poor lived in rural areas. Routing RFP sub-loans to
poor but creditworthy clients could in principle help to alleviate rural poverty.

Relevance of Design (Rating: Substantial)
                                                    6


3.5    The design of the project’s rural credit and leasing lines, as well as its rural retail
banking and micro-finance sub-components, took account of lessons from the earlier Private
Farmer & Enterprise Support project and the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan. To a
somewhat lesser extent, the General Cadastre & Land Registration Project also exercised an
influence.

3.6    Project design was also based on a considered assessment of the government’s
uneven performance under the FY97 ASAL. On the one hand, subsidies were reduced and
made more transparent and there was a sharp fall, in real terms, in the level of directed credit.
But there were three problems:
            (i) Many of the incentives policy reforms enacted under the ASAL were not
                 credible and were subject to backtracking;
            (ii) Legislative reforms regarding warehouse receipts, grain grading, and inter-
                 professional associations were delayed, while the State Grain Reserves agency
                 (successor to RomCereal) continued to intervene in the cereals market in
                 violation of ASAL agreements; and
            (iii) The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries (MAFI) resisted market-
                 oriented reform, wanting to continue allocating subsidies to favorites.
3.7     Project design was informed by a study of the rural financial sector that was carried
about before appraisal.6 This analysis revealed that rural financial markets were performing
poorly, limiting access to financial services by rural enterprises and households. When the
project was under preparation only 20 percent of households and rural enterprises used loans
to finance production, consumption and investment needs. Limited access to credit was the
result of the high risks and transactions costs involved in lending to the rural population.
Also, the supply of credit from private lenders was restricted by the absence of an appropriate
regulatory and supervisory framework for independent mutual financial intermediaries, the
majority of which operated in rural areas.

3.8      In an effort to restart the momentum for rural reform, Government submitted a
―Letter of Development Program‖7 outlining several commitments which would underpin the
rationale for the Bank to provide support through an Adaptable Program Loan (APL).
Subsequent supervision teams, portfolio review missions and management visits tried to
insist that the commitments to reform mentioned in the Letter be honored, though many of
the specific commitments were superseded8 by requirements of the Acquis Communautaire
once Romania accelerated preparations to join the EU.

3.9     Although conditions evolved during project implementation to ease the constraints
that the project sought to address, the project approach remained pertinent. The project
tackled the problem of limited access to finance in two ways: directly, by supplying
enterprise financing and micro-credit through financial intermediaries; and indirectly, by



6 World Bank (2000).
7 This is reproduced in the Project Appraisal Document, Annex 11.
8 And eventually rendered moot once the decision was made to terminate the program upon completion of the
1st phase (i.e. when the RFP was closed).
                                                      7


addressing some of the constraints in the legal and regulatory environment that raised the risk
and transactions costs of lending to the target population, and providing technical assistance
needed by retail banks and service providers wishing to lend more. By the end of the project,
the government's sound macroeconomic management, strong economic growth, and the
prospect of EU accession led to increased liquidity in Romanian financial markets. In this
new world, there was less need for a credit-line project. On balance, however, IEG considers
that, even by loan closing, most aspects of the project’s design remained relevant.

3.10 Project design satisfactorily took account of the Bank’s policy for financial
intermediary lending (OP 8.30). The following aspects of the policy were reflected in project
performance: (i) there was adequate competition among the prequalified intermediaries; (ii)
intermediaries were free to select borrowers, approve sub-projects, and set lending terms,
assuming in exchange the risks associated with lending; (iii) intermediaries were allowed to
establish on-lending interest rates sufficiently above the costs of capital to guarantee them a
reasonable return; (iv) fiduciary responsibilities were adequately spelled out and were
enforced by the Central Bank’s separate Departments of Regulation & Supervision;9 and (v)
periodic reporting requirements and inspections were adequate and timely, thus assuring
compliance with the National Bank of Romania’s prudential norms.10 Also, all costs related
to the credit line were passed on to the banks, leasing companies and microfinance
institutions, including IBRD commitment fees.11


EFFICACY

3.11 The project was implemented in a fast-changing financial sector environment. With
Romania’s imminent entry to the European Union, the banking sector experienced
considerable increases in liquidity, particularly from new foreign shareholders. This was
especially true of banks headquartered in Bucharest. The new partnerships with foreign
banks resulted in major improvements in banking technologies, reducing the need for the
technical assistance planned under the project. At the same time, the National Bank of
Romania (NRB) was steadily improving its regulatory and supervisory capacity. Funds were
therefore reallocated away from technical assistance, towards rural credit lines which, during
2005 and 2006 disbursed at a brisk pace, helping the project reach its objectives.12




9 In addition to the banking system, the NBRs’ supervisory responsibilities also extend to NBFIs and MFIs.
10 These norms are consistent with the BASEL 1 and 2 conventions, because Romania brought its banking
regulations in line with EU norms as part of the accession process.

OBJECTIVE 1. Accelerate the economic transformation of the rural economy by
increasing the flow of investment capital to the sector: (Rating: Substantial). RFP
increased the flow of investment capital: US$64.5 million was channeled through selected
financial intermediaries for on-lending to the rural sector (Table 2). The project funded 225
sub-loans, 510 leases, and over 12,000 micro-credits to private sector borrowers in rural
areas. In principle, RFP credit may have displaced some other sources. But the ICR noted
that over 8,800 of borrowers (farmers, rural micro-entrepreneurs, and rural SMEs) had no
                                               9


access to the financial sector before the project, suggesting that displacement was not a major
issue.

3.12 Besides this direct impact on the supply of credit, the project contributed to
improvements in the legal and regulatory framework for rural finance, and to the
development of the warehouse receipts system. These were significant achievements that, in
the long term, probably facilitated growth in rural Romania, although IEG was unable to
establish direct attribution. On the other hand, the project did not develop the legal
framework that would allow the Government to lend to MFIs through their umbrella
organizations. (This framework is now being developed.) Instead, an agency role was
developed for MFIs that required them to appraise and administer sub loans and collections
for the MOPF, assume the fiduciary obligations and fully reimburse the Government in the
brief period stipulated in the project’s operating manual. Staff in the MFIs and the PIU told
IEG that the inability of the MFIs to intermediate the funds they administered impeded a
fuller flow of investment capital to rural entrepreneurs and farmers, as the MFIs could not
readily recycle sub-borrower repayments under the agency arrangement.

3.13 OBJECTIVE 2. Strengthen the role of the private sector in the rural economy:
(Rating: Substantial). The project helped to bring lending and deposit-taking to poorer rural
areas that had previously been sidelined. Participating financial intermediaries on-lent
US$64.5 million, including about $40 million in sub-loans, $9.7 million in micro-loans and
US$15 million for leasing.

3.14 Under the project, two of the five participating banks, three micro-finance
intermediaries and various leasing companies expanded their rural outreach. Access to
lending services was expended to include a further 700,000 inhabitants, and 124 new
branches and service points were opened in rural areas throughout Romania. Micro-credit
services reached 8,000 clients (36 percent of whom were first-time borrowers). The project
helped upgrade micro-finance services and technologies.

3.15 The project's impact on lending technologies utilized by three of the five participating
banks is less certain, as the entry of foreign banks led to the modernization of banking
technologies, and RFP technical assistance funds for this purpose were reallocated to other
uses. However the project strongly benefited the two Romanian-owned banks (Banca
Carpatia and Bank Transylvania), which modernized and streamlined their financial service
operations and considerably expanded their rural networks under the project. Two of the
three micro-finance intermediaries in the project also benefited from the project’s technical
assistance and advisory services.

3.16 Capital adequacy, reserves and liquidity ratios—all conform to European Union
standards, as well as the Basel I and II framework; so also do the standards for reporting,
regulation and off-site and on-site supervision. Also, the framework for regulation of Non-
Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) is fully adequate—a new draft law for NBFIs
(summarized in Annex E) is now being developed. IEG was advised that the capital
adequacy and liquidity positions of the financial intermediaries are generally well in excess
of central bank requirements, although detailed figures were not available.
                                                10


3.17 Moreover, the RFP appears to have stimulated lending via reflows and induced a
responsible credit culture among beneficiaries. For example, as of January 2009, one of the
more active participating banks had granted an additional 170 loans from reflows, amounting
to US$ 27 million and comprising more than 5 percent of this bank’s loan portfolio. The
portfolio at risk (arrears of more than 60 days) accounted for 5.6 percent of the portfolio, but
arrears of more than 180 days accounted for only 1.8 percent, well beneath the 7 percent
target stipulated in the project’s operational manual. Similar results were obtained by other
PFIs.

3.18 Although the APL sequence and the RFP did not specify agricultural productivity and
growth as development objectives, lending to farming and agribusiness was an important part
of the project. The government noted that lending to agriculture increased almost three-fold
during the RFP implementation period, although the project accounted for only 0.6 percent of
total disbursements nationwide.13 In parallel, during implementation, aggregate private
agricultural investment increased from 8.3 percent of agricultural gross value added to 9.4
percent (the project target was 9.6 percent).

3.19 The warehouse receipts system made less headway than expected. Consultants
retained by the project made a series of legal, financial and technical proposals in 2004-2005,
and these were endorsed by Bank supervision missions. Although the proposals were
accepted by Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAFI) , private warehouse operators were
not interested, expecting that there would be too much red tape and not enough benefit to
themselves. Also, large-scale farmers began to build their own warehouses, reducing the
demand for off-site storage.14 The government is now crafting legislation to adopt a
―European system‖ of warehouse receipts, with the cost being borne by the Common
Agricultural Policy.

3.20 OBJECTIVE 3. Strengthen the Borrower’s capacity to receive funding from the
European Union SAPARD (Rating: Modest). With SAPARD the project co-financed 53
private investment projects, amounting to US$11.7 million—the target was US$17 million.
The project helped 225 individual investors to prepare business plans for rural investments
co-financed by SAPARD. Most of this co-financing took place during the last 18 months of
SAPARD, owing to startup problems, including a high management turnover. Thus, during
the first four years of project implementation, the Bank loan was unable to disburse against
the EU-assisted subprojects, leading to a shortfall in attaining this objective.

3.21 OBJECTIVE 4. Alleviate rural poverty through financing of farm and off-farm
investments for poor segments of the rural population (Rating: Modest). The project was
designed to serve the poorer (i.e. rural) areas of the country but it was not designated at
appraisal as a poverty-targeted intervention. The M&E system did not include the specific
indicators needed to capture poverty impact. On the positive side, 42 percent of the
communes served by the project belonged to the poorest one-half of all communes.

Moreover, given the substantial investment flow stimulated by the project there may have
been some trickle down to poorer groups in all the communes served. But this is not hard
evidence that rural poverty was alleviating, suggesting that achievement of this objective
should be rated modest.

3.22 Weighing up the overall rating of efficacy requires careful deliberation. Although
achievement of two of the four objectives is rated modest, the objectives that were
substantially met (the first and the second) carry a larger weight than the third and fourth
objective. The third objective (facilitating Romania’s access to accession-related EU funds)
was conjunctural, lacking the long-term significance of the first two objectives. The fourth
objective would carry more weight if the project had been designated a targeted intervention;
but it was not. Moreover, the appraisal targets for the project’s key performance indicators
were amply exceeded (Table 3).

3.23 The project logical framework contained no indicators to allow an assessment of the
achievement of the overall program objective of promoting economic growth and reducing
poverty in rural Romania. However, on balance, financial sector development seems to have
improved the rural business environment and stimulated enterprise development and
commercial farming in the communes where the project was active. New jobs were generated
and household incomes increased. Providing funds to micro-finance institutions stimulated
the delivery of financial services and sub-loans to qualified smallholders, while transforming
these intermediaries from informal outfits into profitable, regulated firms under central bank
supervision. Overall, IEG rates efficacy as substantial.
                                                 12


EFFICIENCY
3.24 The ICR noted that ―Given the…difficulty to predict in advance the types of loans
that would be financed, the PAD did not attempt to predict an Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) for the overall project.‖15 The ICR did, however, present considerable indirect
evidence on efficiency, and the positive picture that emerges from this evidence was
endorsed by IEG’s mission findings. Enterprise beneficiaries experienced an almost four-fold
increases in revenues; profits increased by around 1,000 percent; returns on assets rose by
almost 800 percent; and returns on equity went up by 20 percent. In order to ensure that all
investments actually financed under the component had acceptable rates of return, the
lending guidelines for the banks required that estimated sub-loan rates of return exceed on-
lending rates of interest; and that the repayment capacity of the sub-borrower or lessee be
clearly proven. Discussions with the two banks that retained Romanian ownership and
benefited from the institution building component of the project (Banca Carpatica and Banca
Transylvania), and with the three umbrella MFIs concluded that these participating financial
intermediaries operated in a manner likely to yield positive returns, ensure repayment
performance and facilitate enterprise growth. For MFIs, these conclusions also are reflected
in the final report of the project’s M&E consultants.

3.25 New investments in banking retail units were, by and large, profitable. For example,
in one of the banks, two-thirds of the 93 new units were generating a profit by project end.
The early evidence suggested that the banks’ strategies for expansion were working, aided by
access to the project credit line for loans and leases.

3.26    Based on this evidence IEG rates the efficiency of the project as substantial.

OUTCOME RATING
3.27 Combining the ratings of substantial relevance, substantial efficacy and substantial
efficiency yields a project outcome rating of satisfactory.


4.      Monitoring & Evaluation

M&E DESIGN
4.1     An ambitious monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was designed during project
preparation.16 The Project Management Unit had primary responsibility for the reporting and
data gathering tasks, and established a credible system of implementation and output
indicators which allowed both the Government and Bank to closely monitor implementation
of project procurements and disbursements, financial management and the implementation of
the project’s technical assistance services.




15 ICR, p. 14.
16 As noted in the ICR (and confirmed by meetings with REMACO, the main M&E consultants).
                                                       13


4.2     The M&E system was more suited to tracking project implementation than measuring
impact. The performance indicators focused legitimately on the direct supply of credit, the
efficiency of financial intermediation, but only indirectly on the project's outreach to the rural
poor.17 But the survey instruments designed during project preparation turned out to be
expensive and time-consuming to implement, while the sampling design could neither isolate
nor fully capture the project’s contribution to beneficiary welfare.18 Also, the M&E system
did not attempt to quantify the project's impact on some of the broader (admittedly, harder to
measure) objectives of the program such as private sector development, economic growth,
and its direct impact on poverty reduction.

M&E IMPLEMENTATION
4.3     Implementation monitoring was based on the submission of routine progress reports
by the Project Management Unit, participating financial intermediaries and other
implementing agencies. These reports allowed for good tracking of project inputs and
outputs.

4.4    Implementing the M&E system’s evaluation component was more problematic. The
PAD stipulated that a follow-up independent social assessment and enterprise survey would
be undertaken by the Mid-Term Review. But assessment and survey were delayed by 18
months owing to delays in project effectiveness and implementation. Also, because the
survey instruments were cumbersome it was impossible to deploy them regularly, denying
the government timely feedback on progress toward project development objectives.

4.5     There were two further problems. First, the M&E consultant was hired late meaning
that the baseline survey was put off until August 2006, with the follow-up survey conducted
only 7 months later. Second, the survey instruments were not adequately pretested and the
control group was not properly matched against the treatment group, limiting the scope for a
rigorous impact assessment. (No further work on impact evaluation is anticipated by
government.)

M&E UTILIZATION
4.6    Monitoring feedback helped inform the decision to twice-extend the project’s closing
date and reallocate funds among components in response to the profound changes in the
external environment. The project’s evaluation system included qualitative surveys that had
some bearing on actions taken; although the information came rather too late in the day to
fundamentally influence implementation procedures.




17 This observation is reported in Section 10 of the ICR Review and is confirmed by IEG.
18 The M&E design attempted to compare and contrast performance between a sample of direct beneficiaries
and a control group of non-participants. The ICR maintains that substantial initial disparities between the two
underlying populations precluded a meaningful contrast for purposes of identifying project impact. In fact, this
result likely reflects the combined results of inadequate sample design(s) and a basically flawed analytical
approach. Rather, the samples should have been drawn from the entire farming population in the targeted
communes/judets and from the population of rural enterprises, irrespective of whether they were beneficiaries
(e.g. Sub-borrowers) or not.
                                              14


4.7    On balance, the design, implementation and utilization of the M&E component is
rated modest.



5.     Risk to Development Outcome

5.1      The project’s achievements, particularly the institution building that took place (not
least, central bank oversight of financial intermediaries), would—in normal circumstances—
be resistant to risk. Capital adequacy and liquidity provisions appear more than adequate to
sustain the banks, leasing companies and micro-finance institutions through a normal
downturn in economic activity. But the current global economic crisis is severe enough to
cast doubt on the sustainability of the project’s development results.

5.2             Four problems have emerged as a consequence of the global crisis. First, the
laying off of Romanian guest workers who had moved to Western and Central Europe has
led to a drop in euro-denominated remittances. This disproportionately affects rural
households, making them less able to pay back bank and micro-finance loans. Second, the
drop in remittances has weakened Romania’s balance of payments. Third, credit lines from
Euro-zone banks have disappeared, leading to a depreciation of the Romanian Leu. Borrower
obligations under the project are dollar-denominated while those outside the project are
mainly euro-denominated, the combined effect being a likely increase in arrears and
defaults. Fourth, attempts to bring Romania into the Euro Zone have recently been rebuffed
by the European Central Bank, which could reduce the viability of the financial
intermediaries supported by this project.

5.3     Given these uncertainties, all external to the project, the risk to development outcome
is rated significant.


6.     Bank Performance

QUALITY AT ENTRY
6.1     QAG rated Quality at Entry satisfactory but identified several weaknesses in project
design, a judgment with which IEG concurs. On the positive side, the project was
underpinned by substantial analytical work that was carried out jointly by the Bank and the
Government. At the time of project preparation, the focus on the direct supply of credit was
appropriate, but this focus became less relevant as implementation proceeded.

6.2     QAG pointed to flaws in the project’s institutional and implementation arrangements,
flaws that subsequently resulted in restructuring of the project and two extensions of its
closing date. Various items were not ready at entry: agreements with financial intermediaries
had not been sealed, appraisals of financial institutions were incomplete, consultant terms of
reference had not been finalized, and the responsibilities of the implementing agency had not
                                                        15


been spelled out. Second, procurement procedures were onerous and out of step with the
private sector environment in Romania. These deficiencies in design contributed both to the
prolonged delay prior to effectiveness, and slow disbursements during the first 18 months of
implementation, leading to a 30-month period of unsatisfactory supervision ratings. With the
benefit of hindsight, the project should have been cancelled or at least reappraised, with
negotiations postponed until the project was ready to implement.

6.3     There were two further problems. First, the project’s development objectives were too
ambitious. Second, the flaws in the M&E system noted in the previous section made it
difficult to verify government’s compliance with the commitments set out in the policy letter,
as well as making it difficult to assess project impact.

6.4     Because the project was not ready to implement when it was approved, quality at
entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

PROJECT SUPERVISION
6.5     Once implementation began, an intensive (and expensive) supervision effort was
made to accelerate disbursements and correct some of the design flaws. The Bank conducted
eleven supervision missions and one mid-term review mission (see Annex D). Field
supervision missions to review project results and discuss key issues with the borrower were
carried out on average twice a year and more often during the initial period of delayed
implementation.

6.6     Supervision teams had the right skills mix, with appropriate use of consultants with
specialized expertise. The Bank tried to mitigate as much as possible the loss of continuity
involved by changes in the composition and leadership of the project team (a new task team
leader was appointed in February 2004). But the early supervision effort was ineffective and
the project’s implementation progress was rated unsatisfactory by nine consecutive
supervisions between June 2002 and June 2004.

6.7    All of the design issues initially identified by QAG were reflected in the May 2003
amendment to the loan agreement. By mid-2004, these changes had visibly accelerated the
pace of implementation. One of the key amendments was to permit the use of Romanian
commercial procurement practices, including the purchase of goods needed for developing
branches under Part B of the project. A second was to extend the definition of ―rural‖ to all
market towns and cities having a resident population of 200,000 people or fewer.19

6.8     The supervision effort was generally intensive and well conceived, especially in the
second half of the implementation period. But there was some unevenness of performance.
On a positive note, in February 2004, a Bank headquarters staff member was assigned to
Bucharest for four months to help the project management unit and the Ministry of Finance
step up implementation. On the other hand, the Bank could have pushed harder to rectify the



19 By this convention, only the cities of Bucharest and Clug would have been excluded from the revised
definition of ―rural‖, were it applied nationwide and not just for purposes of the targeted administrative zones in
the project.
                                              16


flaws in monitoring and evaluation. Also, when it became clear that the government would
not proceed with a second phase, the Bank missed an opportunity to bring forward some of
the planned second-phase activities—particularly the strengthening of non-bank financial
institutions.

6.9    The quality of the Bank’s supervision effort is rated moderately satisfactory.

OVERALL RATING
6.10 Overall, IEG rates Bank performance as moderately satisfactory because, on
balance, supervision performance made up for the flawed quality at entry and helped to
account for the satisfactory project outcome.



7.     Borrower Performance

GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE
7.1     The government made an initial commitment to the program, entering fully into the
joint analytical work with the Bank that laid the foundations for the project. However,
enthusiasm waned as the project was being appraised. The 22 month delay in declaring
project effectiveness reflected resistance by ministries to implementation arrangements and
the burden imposed by the Bank’s procurement and disbursement procedures. But as
Romania’s EU accession date got closer, the government became generally more serious
about its international obligations, and project implementation was stepped up. Government
fully assumed its responsibilities, incorporating the project management unit and appointing
a well qualified staff and manager. Ministries involved in the project began to work closely
with the Bank to solve institutional and procedural problems.

In this second phase the government was constructive and flexible, helping to make the
project more responsive to the needs of its intended clients while weathering the new
challenges posed by the external environment. In particular, government speeded up the
approval of grant applications under the EU’s SAPARD program. Counterpart financing,
including funding received from the Romanian Government was satisfactory during the life
of the project.

7.2    Balancing the early shortcomings with the improvement later on, IEG rates Borrower
Performance as moderately satisfactory.


IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

7.3     The original project management unit performed poorly but once management was
incorporated by the Finance Ministry performance picked up. This change is reflected in
supervision mission reports and the ICR, and was confirmed when IEG met with the former
director of the project management unit (that is, the manager responsible after transfer of the
                                              17


unit to the Finance Ministry). However, the implementing agency shares with the Bank some
of the responsibility for the failures of M&E.

Throughout implementation a satisfactory financial management system was maintained. The
Borrower respected the relevant loan and financial covenants, by submitting to the Bank the
quarterly financial monitoring reports and the annual audit reports in a timely manner and in
a format acceptable to the Bank. Capital adequacy was enforced per stipulations in the
BASEL framework agreements and adequate provisions for short-term liquidity were
similarly required (for all of Romania’s commercial banks). Audit opinions were all
unqualified and no internal control issues were mentioned, including for the final audit of the
project, covering the eleven months ending November 30, 2007, submitted in January 2008.
The Bank’s Financial Management System (FMS) regularly reviewed the financial
management arrangements for the project, as part of the Bank’s supervision missions and
rated the financial management arrangements satisfactory.

7.4    Implementing agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

OVERALL RATING
7.5    IEG rates overall Borrower performance as moderately satisfactory.


8.     Lessons Learned

Four lessons may be drawn:

       (1) Before a loan is negotiated it is vital to secure the implementing agency’s
       agreement to project components and implementation procedures. If QAG’s quality
       at entry reservations had been addressed early on this project’s start-up lag may have
       been reduced.

       (2) Investment projects need to be sufficiently flexible to allow for rapid and often
       unanticipated changes in the economy and the external environment. In this case, the
       project had to be adjusted to take into account the speeding up of Romania’s
       accession to the European Union.

       (3) Changes in financial sector conditions during project implementation may make it
       difficult to forecast the demand for Bank-financed credit lines. This project showed
       that it is better to address the underlying reasons for limited credit access—factors
       such as high risks and the heavy transaction costs entailed by lending to small
       enterprises—rather than directly supplying credit.

       (4) Before governments enter into an agency relationship with microfinance
       institutions (MFIs) the possible consequences for overall investment flow need to be
       fully understood. In the RFP, no legal framework existed that would allow the
       Government to lend to MFIs through their umbrella organizations, which signed the
       SLAs and assumed the fiduciary obligations. (The legal framework is now being
                                      18


developed.) Instead, an agency role was developed for MFIs that required them to
reimburse the Government in the brief period stipulated in the project’s operating
manual. The inability of the MFIs to intermediate the funds they administered
impeded a fuller flow of investment capital to rural entrepreneurs and farmers, as the
MFIs could not readily recycle sub-borrower repayments under the agency
arrangement.

Annex C. Intended Performance Triggers for RFM2

   (a) Credit allocation triggers.
         Disbursements: At least 70 percent of the project's rural credit and leasing
          facility disbursed.
         Extent of outreach: At least 4,500 clients served.
         Depth of outreach: Average outstanding sub-loan, micro-loan and sub-
          lease balances of less than 8 times per capita income.
         Arrears: Accumulated loan losses of not more than 7 percent per year of
          the average outstanding sub-loans, micro-loans, and sub-leases financed
          under the project.

    (b) Distribution network triggers.
         Breadth of outreach: At least 65 rural communes with experimental retail
          branches and SP points of service.
         Sustainability: Subsidy Dependence Index of less than 20 percent and
          adjusted returns on assets greater than 2.5 percent.

    (c) Policy Environment Conditions.
         Rural credit lines: Any future credit lines made available by government
          to the sector will have market terms and conditions and will not represent
          unfair competition to the credit and leasing facilities financed under the
          program.
         Financial sector policy: The government will commit to an adequate
          environment for the country's financial sector. One possible way to verify
          the presence of such environment is compliance with the relevant
          conditions of the PSAL II, currently under preparation.

Annex D. NRB Regulation of Non-Bank Financial
Institutions

Non-bank financial institutions (NBFI’s) are those entities performing lending activities in the
normal course of their business, the main difference from credit institutions being that they are
not allowed to accept deposits or other repayable funds from the general public.

Ordinance no.28/2006 governing certain financial and fiscal measures regulates the minimum
access requirements for NBFI’s to lending activity, with a view of ensuring and maintaining
financial stability.

The NBFI’s are structured on three levels: mutual benefit societies, pawnshops and entities
whose financing sources are limited to public funds (recorded in Entry Register) and the other
NBFI’s (recorded in General Register), from which the NBFI’s that fulfill simultaneous, for a
period of 9 months, two criteria regarding the potential and effective volume of their lending
activity are recorded also in the Special Register. The criteria for the registration in Special
Register are: the sum of shareholders’ equity and borrowed sources is over 50 mil. RON
(equivalent of 11,6 mil.EURO) and the volume of credits granted and commitments assumed is
over 25 mil. RON (equivalent of 5,8 mil.EURO).

National Bank of Romania supervises the NBFI’s recorded in the Special Register, monitors the
NBFI’s recorded only in the General Register and takes in evidence the NBFI’s recorded in the
Evidence Register.

The NBFI’s recorded in the Special Register are the only NBFI’s that are supervised by NBR
and are obliged to obey prudential requirements:
    Norm no.16/2006 on the own funds of non-bank financial institutions included in the
        Special Register, regulates the minimum level of own funds that NBFI’s are required to
        maintain (not less than the share capital: 200.000 euro and 3.000.000 euro for NBFI’s
        providing mortgage credit), as well as the method of calculating and reporting the
        amounts. According to the provisions of this norm, the NBFI’s have the obligation of
        calculating and verifying on a monthly basis compliance with the own funds minimum
        regulatory level, based on data contained in the trial balance drawn up at the end of each
        month. Also, the NBFI’s have the obligation to prepare, quarterly, a written and
        electronic report on the level of own funds, and submit it to NBR – Supervision
        Department, within 25 calendar days from the end of the quarter to which the report
        refers.

       Norm no.17/2006 regarding the supervision of exposures of non-bank financial
        institutions included in the Special Register, which regulates the maximum exposure
        limits of these entities towards counterparts. According to the above-mentioned norm,
        the sum of net significant exposures of a NBFI recorded against a single debtor and
        against entities having special relationships with the institution shall not be higher than
        600% of the total value of its own funds. The total aggregate exposure of a NBFI shall
        not be more than 1500% its own funds.
Annex D                                           32



      Norm no.18/2006 regarding the organization and internal control, management of
       significant risks as well as the internal audit activity of non-bank financial institutions
       included in the Special Register provides the general framework that shall be observed
       for:

           organization and internal control of the activity of non-bank financial institutions;
           management of significant risks by non-bank financial institutions; and
           organization and operation of the internal audit activity of non-bank financial
            institutions.

      Regulation no.9/2008 on know-your-customer for the purpose of money laundering and
       terrorism financing prevention represents a general framework for drawing up of their customer
       due diligence policies and procedures, for the purposes of fighting money laundering and terrorist
       financing.

      Regulation no.3/2007 on limiting credit risk for loans granted to individuals, establishes
       minimum requirements to be observed by NBFIs included in the Special Register in
       granting loans to individuals aimed at implementing a responsible lending standard.
       Under this regulation the Romanian creditors intending to exceed the established limit of
       35% for the total debt service ratio are required to draw up specific internal rules on
       individuals’ lending, which are subject to NBR – Supervision Department validation.
       Creditors are permitted to establish the maximum level of indebtedness for each clients
       category take into consideration the interest rate risk and exchange rate risk – and they
       have to demonstrate to the NBR that the proposed level is appropriate in view of their
       risks policies and the creditor’s overall condition.

      Regulation no.5/2002 and Norms No. 12/2002 regarding the classification of loans and
       the determination, adjustment and use of loan loss provisions by the non-bank financial
       institutions.
