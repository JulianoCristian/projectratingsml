Services\n            Project for Timor-Leste were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            high, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: effective bank project support in\n            fragile and conflict and or post conflict states requires\n            intensive on the ground implementation support. The presence\n            on the ground of more experienced staff can help to unblock\n            many of the constraints that affected implementation.\n            Ideally policy reform components should not be handled\n            through investment lending, but where this was unavoidable\n            because for example a policy action is closely related to an\n            investment and or for lack of an alternative vehicle,\n            borrower ownership and commitment should be assured at\n            design stage and should be managed and monitored during\n            implementation. The risk of Borrower\u0092s lack of commitment to\n            the strategic planning and reform elements of the\n            institutional and capacity building component were not\n            explicitly identified at project design stage. Thus, in the\n            end this component had to be dropped, although interestingly\n            the Government of Timor-Leste (GoTL) is showing a keen\n            interest to reform its power sector. As time progressed it\n            became apparent that Ministry of Natural Resources, Minerals\n            and Energy Policy (MNRMEP), Ministry of Infrastructure (MoI)\n            and Electricidade de Timor-Leste\u0092s (EDTL\u0092s) senior\n            management attention is focused on the large system\n            expansion that the government had embarked on and reduced\n            attention was being given the Energy Services Delivery\n            Project (ESDP). Flexible partnership with Borrowers and the\n            exercise of sound judgment are critical for achieving results."}, "docdt": "2013-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
