The project includes two main components: (a)\n            investments; and (b) capacity building. The investment\n            component would include: (i) emergency repair and\n            maintenance of the Comoro Power Station; (ii) rehabilitation\n            and upgrading of the power distribution system in Dili; and\n            (iii) distribution of energy efficient light bulbs, and\n            compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). Timely repair of the power\n            station and energy savings from the above investments will\n            increase availability and reliability of power supply for\n            both existing customers and new customers. A substantial\n            capacity building component is proposed to support project\n            implementation and for institutional and policy\n            strengthening to help lay the groundwork for increased\n            commercial orientation and long-term sustainability of the\n            power sector."}, "docdt": "2007-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
