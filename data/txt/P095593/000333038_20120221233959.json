The\n            restructuring (level two) does not involve any change in the\n            project development objective; but includes a minor\n            reallocation among disbursement categories (one and half\n            percent), some changes in outcome indicators, and a\n            reallocation of a substantial portion of the grant funds\n            from activities under parts 1, 3 and 4 of the project to\n            part two. The GoTL's request was first communicated to\n            the Bank's supervision mission in April 2011 and\n            subsequently confirmed through a letter dated October 28,\n            2011 from the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The letter also\n            requested an extension of the Grant's closing date from\n            December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012. The Bank approved the\n            extension of Grant's closing date to June 30, 2012 on\n            December 21, 2011."}, "docdt": "2012-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
