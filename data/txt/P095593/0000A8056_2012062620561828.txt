                         The objectives are to stabilize the power services in Dili, by restoring or improving operational efficiency, reliability, safety and availability of the power supply, and to
                         promote long-term sustainability of the power sector. These would, in turn, contribute to the social stability and economic development of the country.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made good progress toward achieving its development objectives by focusing on reducing system losses, installing prepayment meters, removing Illegal connections,
                         reinstalling meters, and increasing the number of paying customers and revenue collection. Other activities related to emergency repair and maintenance of the Comoro Power
                         Station, distribution of energy-efficient light bulbs, and institutional capacity building have achieved less progress and have been either dropped or scaled down substantially through
                         project restructuring.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project Closing date was extended in December 2011 by six months to June 30, 2012 to allow enough time for delivery of critical distribution equipment and materials and to
                         enable the Bank to provide supervision support during the installation of the materials. The project was then restructured in February 2012 in order to formally allow the shift of
                         resources from poorly performing activities to the more successful distribution component, which has yielded significant benefits by expanding the customer metering program and
