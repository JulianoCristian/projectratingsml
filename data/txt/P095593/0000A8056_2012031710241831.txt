                         The objectives are to stabilize the power services in Dili, by restoring or improving operational efficiency, reliability, safety and availability of the power supply, and to
                         promote long-term sustainability of the power sector. These would, in turn, contribute to the social stability and economic development of the country.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made progress toward achieving its development objectives by focusing on reducing system losses, installing prepayment meters, removing Illegal connections and
                         reinstalling meters, and increasing the number of paying customers and revenue collection. However, while rehabilitation and upgrading of the Dili power distribution system
                         component has been successful, activities related to emergency repair and maintenance of the Comoro Power Station, distribution of energy-efficient light bulbs, and institutional
                         capacity building in the power sector have not made significant progress and are being discontinued.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is being restructured to shift resources from poorly performing activities to the more successful distribution component, which has yielded significant benefits by
                         expanding the customer metering program and rehabilitating and upgrading the distribution network. The closing date was extended by six months, primarily to allow the Bank to
                         provide supervision support during the government’s installation of critical distribution system equipment and materials procured under the project.
