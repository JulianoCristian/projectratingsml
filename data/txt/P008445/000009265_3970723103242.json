Pipelines\n            (SNGPL) Project in West Pakistan was successfully completed.\n            The Bank played an important role in the successful\n            completion of the project. However, more attention might\n            have been given to SNGPL's tariff structure and the\n            adequacy of the telecontrol equipment. Development of\n            experience in pipeline construction by SNGPL was an\n            important achievement during the project period, even though\n            it was not an explicit objective of the project. The\n            Bank's participation in it was limited to the first\n            stage of the process. It seems that a more active Bank role\n            by participating in the later stages of the process and\n            providing technical assistance might have been very\n            valuable. In this way, the inefficiencies associated with\n            the trial and error method finally used by SNGPL in\n            developing their experience might have been avoided."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
