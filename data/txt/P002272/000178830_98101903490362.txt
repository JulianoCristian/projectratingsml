REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
APPRAISAL OF PORT OF DAKAR PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Bank has been requested by the Government of Senegal
and the Port Authority of Dakar to help finance improvements to the
port of Dakar.
ii.       The port of Dakar handles about 2.4 million tons of dry
cargo which is expected to rise to 3.7 million tons by 1970/71. In
addition, by virtue of its geographical position, Dakar is an important
bunkering port.
iii.      The port is controlled by an autonomous Governnent-owned Port
Authority, the decisions of which are subject to Government approval.
Operations and maintenance are well conducted; all cargo and stevedoring
operations are carried out by private companies which rent the facilities
from the Port Authority.
iv.       The project consists of the larger part of the Government's
Second Four-Year Development Plan 1965-69 for the port; it comprises
those items in the Plan that the Bank considers justified at the
present time, that is:  the extension of one mole, which is operated
as a custom-free zone for Mali traffic; the reconstruction of two quay
walls; dredging totalling about 500,000 m3; and consulting services.
The first part of the project (30% of its total cost) has already been
placed under contract in accordance with international bidding
procedures considered satisfactory by the Bank; it is proposed to
reimburse from the loan part of the project expenditures incurred
since November 15, 1966. Future contracts will also be let on the
basis of international competitive bidding. The Port Authority,
assisted by consultants, would be responsible for executing the project.
v.        The total cost of the project is estimated at CFAF 1,705
million (US$ 6.9 million equivalent), and the proposed loan of CFAF 989
million (US$ 4.0 million equivalent) would cover the estimated foreign
exchange cost of the project, and which represents 58% of the total
cost.
vi.       In addition to the project investments, other measures will
be taken to increase revenue and reduce costs which will enable the
Port Authority to earn a satisfactory return on its investment.
vii.      The project is technically sound ard is justified on economic
grounds. In addition it will help to ensure continued cooperation
between Senegal and Mali.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$ 4.0 million. The loan would be made to the Port Authority of
Dakar with a term of 15 years, including 3½ years of grace.



REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
APPRAISAL OF PORT OF DAKAR PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government of Senegal and the Port Authority of Dakar
have requested assistance from the Bank in financing a project wlhich
comprises the high priority elements in the Government's Second Four-
Year Development Plan (1965-1969) for the port. The proposed loan of
US$ 4.0 million equivalent would cover the estimated foreign exchange
cost, or 58% of the total cost of the project (US$ 6.9 million
equivalent).
1.2       The proposed loan would be the third operation of the Bank
Group in Senegal. On June 10, 1954 the Bank made a loan (No. 100-FR)
of US$ 7.5 million equivalent to the Office Central des Chemins de Fer
de la France d'Outre-Mer for completion of the conversion from steam
to diesel traction of the Dakar-Niger and Abidjan-Niger railways;
this project was successfully implemented. On September 29, 1966
I.D.A. made a credit (No. 96-SE) of US$ 9.0 million equivalent to the
Government of Senegal to help finance the Senegal Railwaysl Second
Four-Year Development Plan 1965-1969.
1.3       This report is based on:  i) information supplied by the
Government of Senegal and the Port Authority of Dakar; ii) data
contained in the appraisal reports for the Senegal and Mali Railways
Projects signed September 29, 1966 (credits No. 95-MLI and 96-SE),
and iii) the findings of a Bank appraisal mission which visited
Dakar in April/May, 1966, the members of which were Messrs. Bickers,
De Gryse, Heien, Higginbottom and Horavar.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.1       The Republic of Senegal (Map No. 2) covers an area of
200,000 kv2, about one-third of the area of France; its borders are
the Atlantic to the west, Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east,
Guinea and Portuguese Guinea to the south, and it virtually surrounds
The Gambia, a narrow enclave stretching 320 km along the banks of the
river Gambia. Senegal has a population of about 3.4 million, which
is estimated to be increasing at an annual rate of 2.5%. About 25%
of the population is urban and concentrated particularly in the
provinces of Cap Vert (Dakar) and Thies. Dakar, the capital, was
originally built up as the administrative, industrial and commercial
center of French West Africa; it has a population of over 400,000
and its port facilities serve the whole country as well as land-locked
Mali and Mauritania.



- 2 -
2.2       The economy of Senegal is based primarily on subsistence
agriculture, with groundnuts the only important export crop. It has
also some limited mineral resources. The independence of Senegal
and other territories of former French West Africa has brought
problems of adjusting from a position of dominance to one of loss of
markets and increasing competition as the other newly-independent
nations have developed similar industries.
2.3       Senegal's per capita domestic product, approximately US$ 190
per annum, is relatively high for West Africa.  However, due to several
serious handicaps, the growth in domestic product is estimated to have
been about 3% per annum since 1960; allowing for population increase,
per capita domestic product has increased at about ? per annum.
(Bank Economic Report No. AF 44a, dated M4ay 26, 1966.)
2.4       The port of Dakar is the natural maritime trade outlet for
the Republic of Mali, approximately six times the size of Senegal in
area, but one of the poorest and least developed countries of Africa,
with a per capita domestic product of about US$ 70 per annum. In 1960,
the short-lived Federation of M4ali was dissolved and the frontier
between Senegal and Mali closed. Mali then exported and imported by
a longer and in general more expensive route, through the port of
Abidjan, Ivory Coast.  In July 1963, however, traffic between Senegal
and Mali was resumed;  it is regulated by an International Traffic
Agreement; a Railway Convention; a Customs Agreement, providing
tax-free transit of Mali goods through Senegal; and a Free-Zone
Agreement, providing off-bound facilities for Mali goods in the ports
of Dakar and Kaolack. The continued cooperation of the two countries
within the framework of the International Traffic Agreement, the
Customs Agreement and the Railway Convention was agreed during the
negotiations of both the Senegal and Mali Railway Projects. Similar
assurances were obtained from the Government of Senegal, particularly
with regard to the continuation of the Free-Zone Agreement, and are
included in the loan documents of this project.
2.5       The port of Dakar also handles the imports for Mauritania
on the basis of a Customs Union because of the lack of Mauritanian
ports for handling general cargo. This situation will change as the
wharf at Nouakchott is put into operation and the road from 1Nouakchott
to Rosso, jointly financed by IDA and FED*, is completed. The amount
of traffic involved represents a small part (about 1h%) of Dakar's
present traffic.
B. Transport System
2.6       The railway and roads fan out from the Dakar-Thies region,
which contains nearly all of Senegal's industry. The railway system
consists of a main line from Dakar to Kidira, on the frontier, and on
to Bamako in Mali. This provides the most direct and cheapest route
* Fonds Européen de Développement



- 3 -
for the bulk of Mali imports and exports. A major branch connects
Dakar to St. Louis in the north. Other branches run as far as Linguere
and Touba, serving groundnut production centers, and the calcium
phosphate extraction works at Taiba. The railway is directly connected
with the port of Dakar.
2.7       There is an extensive and well developed system of paved
roads covering the area within approximately 300 km of the coastline.
Inland roads are generally not paved and are less developed.
2.8       River transport is not a major factor.  A joint committee
was recently set up to plan and execute, on behalf of Senegal, Guinea,
Mali and Mauritania, regulatory works for the better use and control
of the Senegal river; there are also schemes to develop traffic on
the rivers Saloum and Casamance; it is not thought that any of these
schemes is likely to develop for 5 to 10 years and the final effect,
if successful, will probably be an increase in coastal shipping to
Dakar for transshipment of cargos.
C. Ports System
2.9       Senegalese ports, in addition to Dakar, are:  St. Louis, at
the mouth of the Senegal river; Kaolack, Les Salins and Lyndiane at
the mouth. of the Saloum river; and Ziguinchor located some 65 km from
the mouth of the Casamance river. The ports of St. Louis, Kaolack and
Ziguinchor are controlled by the local Chambers of Commerce; Les
Salins and Lyndiane are privately owned and operated. All five ports
account for about 250,000 tons per annum of maritime traffic.  The
proposals, at present in the planning stage, for the survey and
improvement of the rivers on which the above secondary ports are
located, are expected to lead to tonnages about double the above
figure.
III. PORT OF DAKAR
A. General
3.1       Dakar port is adequately protected from the ocean swell by
northern and southern breakwaters, both of which have been developed
to provide cargo-handling facilities. They enclose a total area of
210 ha. of water of depths varying from 5 m to  l m., with an area of
89 ha. immediately inside the entrance dredged to between 10 and 11 m.
All depths are below mean low water; the mean tidal range is 1.5 m.
3.2       The entrance to the port is 250 m wide and 11 m deep; seaward
the access channel is to a large extent protected by the island of
Goree where a depth of 15 m is attained.
3.3       There is, for all practical purposes, no littoral drift of
sand in the vicinity of Dakar, and no rivers enter the harbor; conse-
quently neither the approach channel nor the port itself requires any
maintenance dredging.



B.   Organization and Management
3.4       The Port Authority of Dakar (Port Autonome de Dakar) was created
by law on December 17., 1959, as an autonomous agency of the Federation of
Mali. When the Federation was dissolved, the Port Authority became, by
Ordinance dated August 27, 1960, an agency of the Republic of Senegal.
Its statutes were established in 1960; they have been revised by decree
dated February 10, 1967 and incorporate .various recommendations made by the
Bank. The Port Authority's boundaries, which exclude the naval instal-
lations, are adequate for its operations.
3.5       The powers of the Port Authority are strictly limited by the
overriding authority of the Governnent exercised through the Minister of
Transport's right of veto. The resolutions of the Port Authority Board
are enforceable only if not opposed by the Minister of Transport within
8 days. In addition, Governnent prior approval is required for invest-
ments, changes in harbor dues, long-term lease of equipment, borrowing
and lending operations, budgets and accounts. The autonomy of the Port
Authority is thus quite limited, but these limitations do not noticeably
impair its ability to carry out the functions for which it is directly
responsible.
3.6       Health and immigration services, police, customs, lighthouses
and buoys and railways in the port are the responsibility of separate
Government departments, which conduct them efficiently. Cargo handling
and stevedoring are carried out by authorized private companies as is
the provision and operation of tugs.
3.7       The Authority operates and maintains the facilities provided
in the port and is responsible for all improvement and expansion works.
3.8       The Board of the Port Authority has 27 members.  The Chairman
is appointed by the President of the Republic; the Vice-Chairman represents
the Minister of Finance. Fourteen members of the Board are Government
representatives, seven represent the port users, two the port's personnel.
The statutes of the Port Authority provide for one representative of each
adjacent country interested in Dakar port operations to be a member of the
Board and the Governments of Mali and Mauritania have a representative
accordingly. In addition, to ensure the continuation of the cooperation
between Senegal and Mali with regard to the operations of the port of
Dakar, and in particular those of the port's custom-free zone, the
Governnent of Senegal guarantees for the future the right of Board
representation to Mali.
3.9       The Board meets at least four times a year.  Board resolutions
are valid only if a quorum of members is present at the meeting; however,
the quorum requirement is waived in the case of resolutions which have
twice previously failed for lack of a quorum. In any case, a majority
of Governnent representatives is required, so that the public interest
can be safeguarded.



- 5 -
3.10      With the exception of the operating and capital budgets and
the accounts, the Board has delegated its authority to a Permanent
Committee of 15 members subject to the same quorum rule.
3.11      All executive functions are vested in the Director.  He also
acts, under the authority of the 1Minister of Transport, as coordinator
of all activities in the. port of various governnent departments and.  -
agencies; As noted previously these services are efficient.
3.12      There are four departments reporting to the Director:  Operations,
Construction and Maintenance, Finance, and Secretariat; the latter also
dealing with personnel and statistical matters. The organization is
satisfactory and suffices for the functions performed by the Port Authority.
3.13      The total personnel establishment is as follows:
Senegalese:   Governnent civil servants
seconded to the port                59
Government auxiliary personnel
seconded to the port               220
Personnel directly engaged by
the port                           300
French:       Technical Assistants                20
Other                                8
TOTAL               607
The Port Authority as a whole is over-staffed for its present and fore-
seeable future operations. MIeasures to put this right are explained
in the chapter "Future Earnings and Project Financing".
3.14      Governnent staff comprises most of the officials and super-
visory personnel and the Director has no authority to promote, dismiss,
or transfer them; his only course of action is to submit proposals to
the Ministers from whom the staff are seconded. This adversely affects
the Port Authority's efficiency. To correct this, the Government has
transferred to the Director the limited disciplinary powers which,
according to the present statutes governing Governnent staff, can be
delegated. The Governnent has also agreed to expand in the future the
delegation of authority to the Director to the fullest extent consistent
with the legal provisions and regulations in force governing the status
of Government personnel; the statutes of the Port Authority have Veen
amended accordingly.



- 6 -
3.15      There are 20 French Technical Assistants employed by the Port
Authority. Some of them hold key positions, e.g., Deputy Director and
Chief Engineer.  Expatriates have so far been replaced only by adequately-
trained Senegalese staff, thus assuring continuity of management.
Assurances have been obtained that this policy will not be changed.
C.   Present Facilities and Traffic Distribution
3.16      The general layout of the port of Dakar is shown in Map No. 3;
particulars of the moles and wharves are given in Table 1; details of
transit sheds and storage areas are in Table 2.
3.17      In general, the different types of cargo are handled in separate
sectors and, as far as practical, berths are specialized. The southern
sector accommodates general cargo vessels and handles passenger traffic,
Mole 3 being operated as a custom-free zone for Mali traffic. The north-
east sector deals with petroleum imports and bunkering; tank farms are
located immediately behind the berths. Cargo to and from vessels calling
to bunker is handled at Mole 8. The northwest sector is for bulk cargos,
mainly exports of groundnuts and phosphates. The northern part of the
western sector is used as a fishing port; modern refrigeration facilities
are available. The southern part of this sector is used by the French
Navy;  this area is outside the Port Authority's control and, therefore,
there is no land access within the custom area between the southern and
northern sectors of the port.
3.18      Road access is available to the port from the public highways
which pass along all sides of the port outside the customs fence. There
are adequate rail facilities throughout the port with collection sidings
in the northwest sector.
3.19      The port is well equipped;  in addition to the cargo-handling
equipment, owned and operated by the private companies (paragraph 4.5),
sufficient equipment, including quay, floating and mobile cranes, is
available for lease from the Port Authority.
3.20      The port facilities, both civil and mechanical, are well
maintained by the Authority's staff. The difficulty experienced with
the quay walls in the middle and east basins, referred to later in the
report, is not due to lack of maintenance.
IV. OPERATIONS AND TRAFFIC
A.   Shipping
4.1       During the year 1965, 4,256 ships with a net registered tonnage*
of 11.7 million entered the port. Of these, 2,224 ships came with cargo
and the remainder for fuel and/or water. The total includes 328 petroleum
tankers and 130 passenger ships.
*Net registered tonnage is the sum in cubic feet of all the various enclos-ed
spaces of a vessel divided by 100, less certain deductions on account of
crew spaces, engine room, water ballast and other space not used for pas-
sengers or cargo.



- 7 -
4.2       Shipping over the years has grown as follows; for details see
Table 3:
No. of Ships       Net Registered Tons
(millions)
1955                       3,806                   9.7
1960                       3,972                  10.5
1965                      41,256                  11.7
The number of ships has been increasing at an annual rate of a little over
1% over the ten-year period while the net registered tonnage has been
growing at 2% per annum. This indicates a slight increase in the
capacity of ships entering the port.
4.3       Table 4 gives details about the occupancy of berths and cargo
handled at each of them. Although berth occupancy has been increasing,
ships have not had to wait for berthing space, since the existing facil-
ities, except for the items discussed later, are adequate for the present
volume of traffic. They will be inadequate, however, by 1970, unless the
works provided for in the project are completed.
B. qperational Factors
4.4       Day and night pilotage is available from the Port Authority and
adequate tug services are supplied by a private company.
4.5       All cargo is handled from the vessels to the quays by private
stevedore companies, authorized by the Port Authority. Cargo handled
at the quay side is by private operators who rent specific shed space
from the Port Authority. The Authority allocates space to the different
companies on an annual basis according to the amount of cargo handled in
the previous year. The operators supply necessary tractor, trailers and
mobile cranes. Consignees collect cargo at the port.
4.6       The cargo operations are reasonably efficient.  Allocation of
sheds for the exclusive use of individual companies results in consider-
able under-usage of the sheds on the general cargo berths. It is
expected that the overall utilization of the sheds will improve with the
increased rent charges proposed in this report (paragraph 7.2).
4.7       In 1962, French consultants, Société d'Etudes Techniques et
Economiques (SETEC), prepared a report covering the operations until 1961
of the private operators in the port; the report contained very useful
information for controlling the charges levied by the private operators
in relation to those of the Port Authority. Unfortunately, the informa-
tion in this report has not been kept up to date. The Authority is,
therefore, in no position, at the present time, to advise the Minister of
Commerce regarding the charges made by the private operators. To correct
this, the Port Authority has agreed to set up a unit, not later than



- 8 -
July 1, 1967, to compile and maintain up-to-date information perteining
to the financial results of the private companies operating stevedoring,
cargo-handling and transit services in the port. The first task of the
unit will be to bring up to date the information contained in the above-
mentioned report.  In order to facilitate the task of the unit, the Goveri-
ment has agreed to take the necessary legal action to obligate the private
operators to provide the Port Authority with financial information and
statistical data related to their operations; the Government has also
undertaken to consult the Port Authority before taking decisions on
requests by the private operators for modifications to their charges.
4.8       Mole 3 handled only 33,000 tons in 1965. Due to difficulties
in clearing traffic from the berth, which is the free zone for Mali
traffic, 126,000 additional tons consigned to Mali had to be handled in
other sections of the port, entailing considerable expense in reassembling
Mlali consignments.
4.9       Dock labor is organized in one union, and is hired directly by
the individual cargo-operating companies.  There are about 1,000 permanently
employed, and 1,000 in casual employment. Labor relations are good and
there have been no strikes since independence. Casual labor can be
dismissed at short notice.
4.10      The Port Authority which hitherto did not insure its assets, has
agreed to take out an all-risks policy which, as an interim measure, will
be based on the value of its assets as provisionally assessed in January,
1967. The insurance is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
It has also been agreed that, following the revaluation of its assets (sea
paragraph 5.5), the Port Authority shall extend the risk coverage in
accordance with sound insurance practices and in agreement with the Bank.
C.   Traffic
4.11      Cargo handled rose as follows between 1955 and 1965:
Total
Imports (000 tons)          Exports (000 tons)     Traffic

*  Includes 159,000 tons Mali traffic
A commodity breakdown for the years 1962-1970/71 is given in Tables 5 and
6. No separate figures are available for Mali traffic through Dakar prior
to 1960 as both Senegal and Mali were then part of French West Africa. Due
to political trouble between 1960 and 1963, ?Iali traffic did not pass
through Dakar.  In 1963 traffic resumed and imports and exports for Mali
amounted to 91,000 tons in 1964 and in 1965 they had risen to 159,000 tons.



- 9 -
4.12      Exports excluding petroleum products more than doubled between
1960 and 1965 due to the rapid growth in the exports of phosphate, ground-
nuts, groundnut oil and groundnut cake. In terms of tonnage, phosphates
were the most important, they more than quadrupled between 1960 and 1965
and accounted for two-thirds of the dry cargo tonnage in 1965. Exports
of groundnuts and groundnut products which were more important in value,
also showed sizeable increases over these years. Other exports, partic-
ularly manufactured products,did not improve much because of the break-up
of French West Africa. (See paragraph 2.2.)
4.13      Imports other than petroleum products have increased at a rate
of about 3.5% per annum over the period 1962-1965. The most important
imports are rice and wheat, followed by sugar, iron and steel products,
timber and fertilizer. The failure of local food production to keep pace
with an increasing population has led to rising imports of rice. The
Governnent's development programs have been responsible for larger imports
of timber and building materials. Fertilizer imports have been part of
the agricultural development program. Imports of petroleum products
show a sharp decrease due to the combined effect of reduced bunkering
activities and the establishment of a refinery, with off-shore facilities,
outside the port boundaries.
V. ACCOUNTS AND FINANCE
A.   Accounts
5.1       The unsatisfactory financial results achieved by many Government-
owned agencies in Senegal and their inability to produce accounts
reflecting their true financial position led the Government to establish
a Central Accounting Agency (Agence Comptable Centrale - ACC), the purpose
of which is to keep the accounts, on a mechanised basis, of all public
enterprises in Senegal. The ACC was put into operation on July 1, 1966.
Experience has shown that such a venture, dealing with numerous agencies,
all different in nature and function, is difficult to operate efficiently.
It also runs counter to the principle of autonomy, on the basis of which
many of the agencies were established. In view of the expected difficulties
and delays inherent to the ACC operations, particularly in the initial
stages, and taking into account the need for the Port Authority to be
informed promptly and accurately of its current financial position without
relying on an outside agency, the Government and the Port Authority have
agreed that, without regard to the accounts kept for the Port Authority
by the ACC, the Port Authority will continue to maintain its own accounts.
The accounting procedures of the ACC are currently being adapted, as
required, to ensure the fullest consistency between the two sets of accounts.
5.2       The accounting system of the Port Authority stems from a decree
of 1960 which lays down rules, a number of which do not conform with
accepted accounting principles. The Government and the Port Authority
have agreed that the accounting system maintained by the Port Authority



- 10 -
shall be in accordance with generally accepted principles of moden
commercial and industrial accounting; to that end, the Port Authority has
appointed in April, 1967, a qualified accountant experienced in the
procedures of port authorities.
5.3       It was further agreed that the arrangement of maintaining tolo
sets of accounts, as explained in paragraph 5.1, will be discontinued
when there is evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that the ACC is capable
of keeping the Port Authority's accounts and of submitting within a
reasonable period of time the balance sheets and related financial state-
ments of the Port Authority.
B.   Valuation of Fixed Assets
5.4       The opening balance sheet of the Port Authority as of August 1,
1960 recorded a State investment of CFAF 2,229 million. This investment
was represented by fixed assets of CFAF 2,070 million and working capital
of CFAF 159 million. The amount of CFAF 2,070 million was the estimated
replacement value, as new, of those superstructure assets whose replace-
ment will be necessary. No allowance was made for non-renewable super-
structure assets, nor for the infrastructure assets.
5.5       However, in the Port Authority's balance sheet at June 30, 1963,
the infrastructure assets were introduced at a valuation of CFAF 18,000
million and the State-held equity was increased accordingly. This amount
was calculated on the estimated replacement value of the infrastructure
investments as if they had been newly constructed, whereas in actual fact
some of the works date back 80 years or more. Such a valuation of the
fixed assets incorrectly inflates the investment base. The balance sheets
of the Port Authority during the period 1960-1965, as presented by the
Authority, are summarized in Table 7. For the purpose of assessing the
future financial position of the Authority an approximate valuation has
been made by the Bank, the bases of calculation and results obtained being
explained in Annex A. The figure of CFAF 4.7 billion so determined is
considered sufficiently accurate for the purpose of this report but it
requires further investigation. Agreement was reached with the Port
Authority that the valuation of the fixed assets will be revised not later
than July 1, 1968, following consultation and agreement with the Bank on
the methods and procedures, the basic principles of which are incorpor-
ated in the loan documents. A tentative revaluation of the fixed assets
was made in January, 1967; it will be used provisionally as a basis for
insurance purposes (see paragraph 4.10).
C.   Income Accounts
5.6       The financial results for 1960/65, as recorded in the books of
the Port Authority, are reproduced in Table 8. As stated above, they do
not reflect the true results of the Port's financial activities and require
many adjustments, the detail of which is given in Annex B. These adjust-
ments have been used in the Bank restatement of the income accounts shown
in Table 9; whilst the approximate revaluation of the fixed assets
referred to above has been included in the balance sheets shown in Table
10.  The restated income accounts can be summarized as follows:

Net Surplus (deficit)                   _     __3 22      3    47   -lT
Since 1961, the Port Authority has shown a small profit each year, the
operating ratio varying between 92 and 98. Debt service has been amply
covered.
5.7       However, the rate of return (net operating revenue as a percentage
of the average net fixed assets as recalculated by the Bank) is unsatis-
factory; the most favorable return achieved by the Port Authority was 1.2%
in 1963/64. This is largely due to the present level of port charges.
Measures have been agreed upon, and are explained later in this report,
for the gradual increase of revenues and the containment of working
expenses leading to an improved rate of return.
D.   Financial Position
5.8       The comparative summary balance sheets reproduced in Table 10
reflect the static financial position of the Port Authority. Since its
inception in 1960, the Port Authority has made little investment: CFAF
32h million total. No new long-term debt has been incurred, resulting
in a favorable 1/99 debt/equity ratio. The current position is good and
working capital adequate. In accordance with the statutes, reserves have
been kept at a level of not less than 20% of the average annual working
expenses of the last three fiscal years. Stores are also kept at a
reasonable level. Receivables from sundry debtors are high, some 30% of
gross operating revenues; it has been agreed that the Port Authority will
immediately take measures to reduce its current receivables to no more
than 15% of its gross operating revenues.
E.   Control and Auditing
5.9       It has been customary in Senegal to have all public entities
controlled on a day-to-day basis by Government Commissioners who have
to approve all commitments of expenditures over a certain amount. This
control, although limiting managerial action, worked satisfactorily and
did not result in serious delays in authorization.  Since July 1, 1966,



- 12 -
the Govermment Commissioners have been replaced by Financial Comptrollers
attached to the Central Accounting Agency referred to in paragraph 5.01,
which approves aU expenditures regardless of amount. This hinders the
ability of the Port Authority to conduct its daily financial operations
with adequate flexibility. In order to minimize delays, the Government
has agreed to take action, prior to May 31, 1967, to authorize the Port
Authority to effect expenditures not exceeding CFAF 500,000 (about US$
2,000) without prior approval of the Financial Comptroller; likewise
minor expenditures of less than CFAF 50,000 (about US$ 200) will be
authorized without prior recording by the ACC.
5.10      In Senegal, auditing of public agencies is the responsibility
of the "Commission des Comptes de la Cour Supreme". As delays in
auditing have occurred, it has been agreed that, beginning with fiscal
year 1966/67, the Port Authority will have its accounts audited and its
balance sheet and related financial statements certified within a
maximum period of six months, by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank. Should the "Commission des Comptes" not be in a position to carry
out its auditing function,expeditiously, other auditors would be appointed.
VI.  THE PORT'S SECOND FOUR-YEAR DEVELOPMENT
PlI'il 1965-1969 AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Plan
6.1       The objectives of the Second Four-Year Development Plan for
the port of Dakar are:
(i)  extension and reconstruction works to improve berthing
capacity and cargo handling efficiency, particularly
for Mali traffic;
(ii)  provision for dredging to improve access to quays and
movement of ships and to meet future traffic require-
ments;
(iii) construction of transit sheds and passenger terminal;
(iv) improvements to surfacing and drainage of port access
roads.
The Plan calls for expenditure originally estimated at CFAF 1,975
million (US$ 8.0 million equivalent), without contingencies and consulting
services.
6.2       The contents of the Plan have been reviewed by the Bank and the
project includes those items in the Plan that the Bank considers to be of
high priority. Items included in the Plan but excluded from the project
are:



- 13 -
(i)  reconstruction of the west basin quay wall to provide a
new fishing quay with 5 m depth;
(ii)  deepening from 5 to 6 m at the existing fishing quay in
the west sector of the port;
(iii)  construction of five transit sheds and one passenger
terminal (the latter item has already been completed
at Port Authority's expense);
(iv) improvement of the port access roads.
6.3       It is considered that the above items (i), (ii) and (iii) are
not justified for the time being, and the Government and the Port
Authority have agreed not to undertake any works included in the Second
Four-Year Development Plan for the port which are not a part of the
project until completion of the latter.
6.4       The cost of item (iv) is estimated at CFAF 91 million (US$
370,000), and the Government has agreed that the road improvement works
will be carried out during the Second Four-Year Plan period, at no expense
to the Port Authority.
B.   Description of the Project
6.5       The project consists of that part of the Second Four-Year Plan
for the port of Dakar, which is considered necessary at the present time.
Details are shown in Map 4 and are listed below:
(i)  extension of the existing Mole 3 to increase the overall
length of quay allocated to Mali traffic to 360 m and
reconstruction of the quay wall between Mole 2 and the
extended Mole 3; both to be dredged to 10 m depth along-
side;
(ii)  reconstruction of the middle basin quay wall to give
increased stacking space, with depth alongside of 10 m;
(iii) dredging to provide:
(a) a turning circle with a depth of 11 m for vessels
using the west side of Mole 5 (Taiba calcium
phosphate quay);
(b) 10 m depth on the west side of Mole 8 and at the
Thies aluminum phosphate quay, with necessary access
thereto;
(c)  8.5 m depth at all berths on the west side of Mole 1,
and necessary access thereto;



- 14 -
(d)  10 m depth at all berths in the east and middle
basins (except alongside Mole 2 with a maximum
permissible depth of 8.5 m) and necessary access
thereto.
6.6       The project, which is technically justified, is further des-
cribed below:
()   Extension of Mole 3 and Reconstruction of East Basin Quay Wall
The extension of Mole 3 is necessary to enable all Mali
traffic to be handled in the custom-free zone. By 1970/71
it is expected that increased traffic will make it necessary
for the free zone to be extended to include the east basin
quay wall which has collapsed and must be reconstructed.
(ii) Reconstruction of Middle Basin Quay Wall
This wall is in danger of collapse and requires urgent
reconstruction;  it has only 6 m of water alongside.
Reconstruction of the quay wall will ensure the continued
availability of the berths on Mole 2 and the middle basin
quay wall, and 10 m depth will enable them to be used to
full capacity.
(iii) Dredging
(a)  the use of Mole 5, the export quay of calcium
phosphate, is limited at present to 9.5 m draft
vessels due to difficulty in navigating the access
channel; provision for an 11 m depth turning circle
will enable any vessel, capable of being loaded at
the quay, to enter and leave at all states of the
tide;
(b)  at the aluminum phosphate quay, the present depth
of 8.5 m limits the size of vessels to about 7,500/
8,000 dwt*. The dredging to 10 m will permit
vessels up to 12,000/1h,000 dwt to berth, and will
facilitate movement past ships berthed at Mole 8;
(c)  dredging is proposed in the southern sector west of
Mole 1 to 8.5 m. At present two berths on the west
side of Mole 1 are not used by cargo vessels due to
insufficient depth of water and difficulty of access;
these berths will be required by 1970/71 (see
paragraph 8.12);
* dwt - dead weight tonnage - is the number of long tons (2,2h0 lbs)
a vessel can carry in cargo, stores and bunkers.



- 15 -
(d) dredging in the middle and east basins to 10 m is
necessary to enable the new construction proposed
in the project in these areas to be used to its
full capacity; it will also improve access to the
east side of Mole 1.
C.   Execution of the Project
6.7       The extension of Mole 3 and the reconstruction of the east basin
quay wall are an important part of the project and are urgently needed.
Design and tender documents for this item have been prepared by the Port
Authority for some time and a contract was let in July 1966 following
consultation with the Bank. Since the specifications for the work w'ere
amended at the Bank's suggestion and the contract was modified according
to the Bank's recommendations and placed following satisfactory inter-
national bidding procedures, it is recommended that the Bank reimburse
payments made by the Port Authority to the contractor since the inception
of the work, i.e. November 15, 1966.
6.8       It has been agreed with the Government of qenegal and the Port
Authority that contracts for the remainder of the project will be let in
accordance with the Bank1s guidelines regarding international bidding.
In order to attract foreign contractors, items (ii) and (iii) will each
be awarded as a single large contract.
6.9       Consultants, satisfactory to the Bank, will be appointed to
design and prepare, in conjunction with the Port Authority's staff,
tender documents for items (ii) and (iii); they will also supervise the
execution of all project items. In addition, for item (i) the consultants
will be required to report on work undertaken up to the date of their
appointment. The appointment of the consultants is a condition of effectivsq-
ness of the proposed loan.
6.10      Work on item (i) of the project is scheduled for completion by
the end of 1968; assuming work on items (ii) and (iii) commences by mid-
1967, the project is expected to be completed by the end of 1969.
6.11      The Port Authority of Dakar is competent to carry out the project
with the help of the consultants referred to in paragraph 6.9.
D. Project Cost
6.12      The estimated cost of the project amounts to CFAF 1,705 million
(US$ 6.9 million equivalent), with an overall foreign exchange component
estimated by the Bank at CFAF 989 million (US$ 4.0 million equivalent),
or about 58% of the total project cost. The breakdown per item is given
below:

Total                 1, 705           6.90    4.oo
6.13      The estimated cost for the construction works is based on the
actual contract for item (i) and estimates based on current costs for
the remainder of the works. Dredging costs in Dakar have been high in
the past, due to the presence of a considerable amount of rock. This is
particularly the case as depth increases. The present estimates are
related to past costs. However, it is possible that, as a result of
international bidding and the large quantity to be dredged, in excess
of 500,000 m3, there may be some savings compared with the estimate.
Consulting services have been estimated at 6% of the cost of works. A
contingency of 10% on construction items and 12% on dredging, with an
overall addition of 4% for price contingencies has been allowed. The
cost estimates are considered realistic.
6.14      Customs duties and similar levies on imports included in the
project are relatively high. They adversely affect the Port Authority's
future profitability because of the higher depreciation provisions
entailed. In addition, Senegal, as an associate member country of the
European Economic Community (EEC), grants preferential customs tariffs
to the other members of the Community. This might discourage contractors
from countries outside the EEC from participating in the bidding on a
duty-paid basis, or create difficulties for an equitable comparison of
bid. For these reasons the Government has agreed to waive the custom



- 17 -
duties for materials and equipment imported for the carrying out of the
project. It has also agreed to exempt their reexport from tax, except
for duties on depreciation of equipment during execution of the project;
the latter will be borne by the Port Authority. These arrangements,
however, do not apply to item (i) of the project which has already been
let without provision for custom waiver.
VII. FUTURE EARNINGS AND PROJECT FINANCING
A.   Port Charges
7.1       The Port Authority's income is derived from (i) rents, (ii)
fees, (iii) harbor dues, and (iv) miscellaneous revenues, which together,
have averaged about CFAF 600 million (US$ 2.4 million equivalent) annually
since 1962. At this level of income the Port Authority does not earn an
adequate rate of return on the net investment in the port, and increases
in charges were discussed and agreed during the negotiations; they are
detailed in the following paragraphs. The agreed increases are not
expected to result in any loss or diversion of traffic, nor in any
redistribution of Mali traffic between the Dakar and Abidjan routes.
Increases in bunkering charges are not included because of the strong
competition from the Canary Islands.
7.2       Income from rents of stacking areas, transit sheds, buildings,
cranes and floating equipment amounts to approximately CFAF 150 million
per annum, representing about 25% of the Port Authority's gross revenues.
The present rental charges for stacking areas and transit sheds are
insufficient to caver maintenance and depreciation charges and to provide
an adequate return on the investment in the facilities. The average
annual rent per m2 of shed is only US$ 3.0 equivalent; one modern two-
storey shed valued by the Port Authority at CFAF 100 million is rented
at only CFAF 2.4 million a year, which is little more than sufficient
to defray the cost of maintenance. The Governnent and the Port Authority
have agreed to increase progressively the rental charges for stacking
areas and transit sheds so as to reach not less than 50% above their
present overall level by July 1, 1969; a first increase of at least 25%
will be implemented not later than July 1, 1967.
7.3       Pilotage, mooring and wharfage fees represent 13% of the Port
Authority's revenues; they are recovered from the ships and are assessed
on a Net Registered Tonnage (NRT) basis. Fees are reduced by half for
ships calling only for bunkering. These comprise about 45% of the total
NRT visiting Dakar. The average fee per ship is US$ 75 equivalent.
Although this is relatively low, increases may not be practical, because
of competition from other ports.



- 18 -
7.4      Hlarbor dues account for 50% of the Port Authority's revenues.
They are levied on most exports and imports and on passengers, and vary
widely from CFAF 20 per ton (for coal) to CFAF 1,000 per ton (for wine
and alcohol). Except for phosphates, fish, and petroleum products, which
are dealt with separately below, harbor dues on imports and exports
average a low CFAF 130 per ton (uS$ 0.53 equivalent). The Government
and the Port Authority have agreed to an overall increase of 40% to be
applied by July 1, 1969; as a first stage, an increase of at least 20%
will be implemented not later than July 1, 1967; by July 1, 1968 the
increases will total at least 30%.
7.5       Until recently calcium phosphate from Taiba and aluminum
phosphate from Thies were both charged CFAF 30 per ton (US$ 0.12 equivalentb),
which is an insignificant amount when compared with an average of US$ 4.2
freight rate to Europe. Since a substantial part of the project is for
dredging, which will improve the approaches to the phosphate quays and
give access to larger ships, with a consequent lowering of freight
charges (see Chapter VIII), it is reasonable to expect the exporters,
who will benefit thereby, to contribute to the cost of these improvements
through increased harbor dues. On December 1, 1966, by applying the
formula for revision provided in the 1959 convention with the Taiba
concessionnaire, export harbor dues on calcium phosphate were raised to
CFAF 43 per ton (US$ 0.17 equivalent), and the Government and the Port
Authority have agreed that the dues will henceforth be determined each
year by implementing the formula;  furthermore, in case of renewal of
the convention, the formula will be revised only in favor of the Port
Authority. As for aluminum phosphate, the convention with the Thies
concessionnaire expires at the end of 1969, and a formula for periodic
revision of export harbor dues, established in consultation with the Bank,
will be incorporated in the expected renewed convention; in no event shal'
the export harbor dues on aluminum phosphate be lower than the presently
applied tariff of CFAF 30 per ton.
7.6       No increases are proposed for the handling of fish, on which
the second highest dues apply (US$ 2 equivalent per ton); for petroleum
products, 97% of which are bunkers; or for passengers who are already
charged US$ 2.2 equivalent per capita.
7.7       Miscellaneous revenues are 12% of the Port Authority's total
revenues, the largest proportion of which come from the sale of water.
Roads, railway track, lighthouses and buoys in the port area are main-
tained by the Government and partly by the Railways on an agreed basis.
B.   Forecast Operating Income and Expenses
7.8       An improvement in the net revenue of the Port Authority is
dependent on the increased charges mentioned above, coupled with contain-
ment of operating expenses. About 55% of the Port Authority's working
expenses are for staff costs and, as stated in paragraph 3.13, the number
of men employed is excessive. Present staff of about 607 could be
reduced without impairing operations. The Government and the Port Authority
have agreed to achieve progressively a staff reduction by attrition spread



- 19 -
over a period of 10 years; this will be linked with limitation of recruit-
ment to about 25% of attrition; in combination, these will reduce the
Port Authority's staff to about 500 by 1976/77.
7.9       The Port Authority's accounts show an annual depreciation of
CFAF 109 million based on the estimated life and replacement cost of the
superstructure assets whose replacement will be necessary; no allowance
is made for the depreciable infrastructure assets. It has been agreed
with the Governuent and the Port Authority that, beginning in the fiscal
year 1968/69, i.e. after revaluation of the fixed assets (see paragraph
5.5), the Port Authority will provide for an adequate straight-line
depreciation allowance based on the replacement values of all depreciable
fixed assets and on their useful lives calculated in accordance with
sound accounting principles.
7.10      A detailed operating income and expenditure forecast which
incorporates the agreed tariff increases, expenditure reductions, and the
depreciation allowance mentioned above, is given in Table 11. Notes on
its compilation are in Annex C.  Revenue is expected to rise from CFAF
592 million in 1964/65 to CFAF 956 million in 1970/71, an average annual
increase of 10%, while operating expenses, including depreciation, would
increase from CFAF 574 million in 1964/65 to CFAF 631 million in 1970/71,
an average annual increase of less than 2%. The following is a summary
of operating revenue and expenditure forecasts during the period 1965/66
to 1970/71, taking into account the various adjustments detailed
previously.

The operating ratio, which was 97 in 1964/65, is expected to improve to
77 in 1968/69, at the end of the Second Four-Year Plan period, and to
66 in 1970/71. The interest earned and debt coverage ratios would remain
satisfactory over the period. The rate of return, net operating revenue
calculated as a percentage of the average net fixed assets, should
improve fron 0.4% in 1964/65 to 3.4% in 1968/69 and to 5.8% in 1970/71,
and may be expected to improve further in subsequent years.  Rates of
return of 3% and 6% have been agreed during the negotiations as the goals
to be reached in 1968/69 and 1970/71, respectively; and an undertaking
to this effect is incorporated in the loan documents.
7.11      The above rates of return are assessed on the value of the
Port Authority's net fixed assets as recalculated by the Bank (see Annex A).
For lack of detailed historical data, this recalculation is necessarily
approximate.  The Port Authority has agreed to revalue its fixed assets
not later than July 1, 1968, on a sound financial basis and in consulta-
tion and agreement with the Bank, and the rates of return will be
calculated on the new valuation.
7.12      It has also been agreed that the Port Authority will adjust
its tariffs and take all other action as may be required to provide
revenues sufficient to ensure the above rates of return; to meet its debt
service; to maintain adequate working capital amounting to about 20% of
its annual operating expenses, excluding depreciation; to maintain
statutory reserves; and to finance an agreed portion of its capital
expenditures.  The Governnent has agreed to take the necessary action to
ensure prompt compliance by the Port Authority with these obligations.
C.   Project Financing and Proposed Bank Loan
7.13      The foreign exchange element of the project cost has been
estimated by Bank staff at about 40% for project items (i) and (ii) and
at about 80% for project item (iii) and for the consulting services;
the total is US$ 4.0 million equivalent, or 58% of the total project
cost. It is proposed that the project be financed by a Bank loan of
this amount and the balance, US$ 2.9 million equivalent, by the Port
Authority. Since the CFA franc is the common currency of seven African
countries, and is freely convertible into French francs, tender documents
in Senegal do not provide for a breakdown of the bids in foreign exchange
and local currency. Disbursements from the loan account cannot therefore
be related to the actual foreign cost, and it is proposed that disburse-
ments be made on the basis of an overall 58%. However, it has been
agreed during the negotiations that, should the actual cost of the project
be lower than the present estimate of US$ 6.9 million, the Bank would
participate in the savings resulting from the lower costs.
7.14      The proposed loan would be made to the Port Authority of Dakar
which has the right to borrow, subject to approval by the Ministers of
Transport and Finance. Because of the relatively strong cash position
of the Port Authority in the future which is expected to result from the
proposals agreed upon (paragraphs 7.2 - 7.8), a term of 15 years, including
a A½ year period of grace, would be appropriate.



- 21 -
D.   Forecast Cash Flow
7.15      The cash flow f orecast for 1966/71 is given in Table 12.  It
shows that the Port Authority will need no financial help £rom the Govern-
ment; however, should the need for some assistance arise, it has been
agreed that the Government will provide the Port Authority with Treasury
advances, at a maximum 3Fs annual rate of interest;  repayment of the
advances will be made only after consultation with the Bank.
7.16      The cash flow allows for capital expenditures outside the
project; it has been agreed that these will not exceed CFAF 300 million
during the construction period of the project. This amount includes the
cost of port facilities the Government is committed by convention to
provide the "Société Industrielle des Engrais au Sénégall" (S.I.E.S.) for
the handling of its cargo. In case the existing port facilities cannot
be used for such purpose and if other investments prove necessary, it
has been agreed that the above limit of CFAF 300 million would be
increased but that in no case shall the total of capital expenditures
outside the project exceed CFAF 400 million.
7.17      A summary of the forecast cash flow for the period 1965/66 to
1970/71, which is shown in more detail in Table 12, is as follows:
1965/66            1965/66

Total           2,155              3,293
As indicated in the preceding Table, the cash availability in the years
to 1968/69 will be little more than adequate for efficient operation of
the port, and without the assistance of a loan the Port Authority could
not undertake the project. If traffic and revenues develop as expected,
a fairly substantial cash surplus should accumulate in the period beginning



- 22 -
in 1970. Since the port does not appear at present to need any major works
in addition to those included in the project, it has been agreed that,
after annual approval of the Port Authority's balance sheet by its Board
and the Governnent, surplus funds will be paid over on a non-reimbursable
basis to the Governnent, to be used exclusively for the financing of
economic and social development programs. Surplus funds are defined as
those funds remaining after (i) covering operating expenses, including
adequate depreciation, and debt service, and (ii) maintaining adequate
working capital, statutory reserves and a special reserve to finance in
total the capital expenditures to be made in the current fiscal year.
To provide a legal basis for the above arrangement, the statutes of the
Port Authority have been amended.
E.   Forecast Balance Sheets
7.18      The forecast balance sheet position 1966/71 is given in Table 13
and may be summarized as follows:
(CFAF Million)
6/30/65     6/30/69     6/30/71
Net current assets              204         226         860
Net fixed assets              4,520       5,732       5,638
Total              4,724       5,958       6,498
Debt                             67         885         931
Equity                        h,657       5,073       5,567
Total              , 724       5,958       6,498
The current ratio is projected to increase from 2.3 to 6.7 during the
period. The debt/equity ratio would change from 1/99 in 1966 to 13/87
in 1969/70 at the full drawing of the proposed Bank loan and improve
thereafter.
VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   Traffic Forecasts
8.1       The Bank's forecasts of future traffic are shown in detail in
Tables 5 and 6, and can be summarized as follows:
(000 tons)
Iaorts             Fxaorts            Total
1965/66 1970/71    1965/66 1970/71    1965/66  1970/71

Total   1,799    2,010     2,377    3,265    L4,176    5,275



- 23 -
Of petroleum products, all the exports and nearly all the imports
represent bunker fuel. So far as the project is concerned, the important
item is dry cargo traffic. This is estimated to increase by 1.2 million
tons over the five years from 1966 to 1971; of this figure, calcium
phosphate exports account for 0.8 million tons; other dry cargo exports
are expected to increase by about 0.1 million tons, and dry cargo imports
by about 0.3 million tons; imports of capital goods for the development
program are expected to outweigh the effects of import substitution and
of reduced demand for imports due to departures of French personnel.
8.2       Exports of calcium phosphate are expected to level off at about
1.7 million tons per annum, but it seems likely that other dry cargo
exports will continue to rise by 3 to 4% a year after 1970/71. A higher
rate of increase seems unlikely in view of the large proportion of ground-
nuts processed locally and exported as oil and cake, and the progressive
withdrawal of the price support that Senegalese groundnuts enjoyed in
France. Dry cargo imports are expected to increase by about 5% per annum
after 1970/71.
8.3       The traffic to and from Mali passing through Dakar is also
expected to show substantial increases up to 1971. The re-opening of the
frontier between the two countries led to a resumption of traffic amounting
to 91,000 tons in 1964 and 159,000 tons in 1965. Improvements in com-
mercial relations, railway facilities, and provision of better port
facilities at Dakar are expected to encourage more of the Mali traffic
to return to the more direct and traditional route through Dakar. By
1970/71 the traffic is expected to reach about 230,000 tons and is then
expected to grow by about 3% per annum.
B. Economic Justification of the Project
Mole 3, Reconstruction of the East Basin Quay Wall, and Dredging in the
East Basin
8.4       Part of the project is needed essentially to provide suitable
facilities for a free zone for the Mali traffic. First, the extension
of Mole 3 will provide enough capacity for handling all of this traffic
at its present level. Secondly, the reconstruction of the East Basin quay
wall will protect the access to Mole 3 and accommodate future increases
in the traffic by providing an extension of the free zone. Thirdly,
dredging of the East Basin to 10 m will make the berths of the free zone
available for larger cargo vessels and allow full advantage to be taken
of the new Mole 3 and East Basin wall. The total expenditure on these
items is expected to be US$ 2.56 million (including consulting services).
8.5       Of the 159,000 tons of Mali traffic in 1965, only 33,000 tons
were handled in the free zone on Mole 3; this was partly due to inadequate
railway service.  However, it is unlikely that, in any event, Mole 3
could handle more than 60,000 tons per annum, with the existing limita-
tions of shed and stacking area, inadequate apron, and severe restrictions
on movement caused by the narrow access.



8.6       The Government of Senegal has undertaken, by International
Agreement with Mali, to provide an adequate free zone in the port, and,
if the present inadequacies continue, they are likely to provide a source
of irritation between the two countries. Mali traffic that cannot
presently be dealt with on Mole 3 (126,000 tons in .1965) is distributed
haphazardly on other quays. The additional charge of US$ 2 per ton raised
by the port operators against Mali for reassembling its consignments
reflects a saving that would be achieved if ail the traffic could be
handled and collected on Mole 3. This would have amounted to US$ 252,000
in 1965. By 1969/70, when work on extending Mole 3 should be completed,
and when all the traffic, estimated by that time to be about 210,000 tons,
can be dealt with in the free zone, the potential saving will have grown
to US$ 300,000 per annum.  The direct beneficiary of this saving would,
of course, be Mali but, in addition, Senegal would indirectly benefit
from the improved port operations since it would help prevent possible
diversion of Mali traffic to the alternative Abidjan route. Over an
assumed life of 25 years, the proposed investment would yield a rate
of return of about 14%.
Reconstruction of the Middle Basin Quay Wall
8.7       Expenditure of US$ 1.32 million (including consulting services)
is proposed for reconstruction of the south wall of the Middle Basin
which, as in the case of the East Basin wall, protects the dock area
connecting the south-eastern corner with the rest of the port (see Map 4).
Its collapse would jeopardize access to the whole of M4oles 2 and 3 and
the East Basin, and would isolate roughly one-half of all available
quay space on the southern side. In addition, this area contains four
berths for general cargo - three alongside Mole 2 and one on the south
side of the Middle Basin - which,together with the seven berths available
in future on Mole 1, will be required to handle an estimated 850,000 tons
of traffic by 1970/71. It is impracticable to consider handling this
volume on Mole 1 alone, and there is a clear case for retaining the
additional berths on the south side as an integral part of the port, by
reconstructing the Middle Basin quay wall.
8.8       It is not possible to calculate the net value to Senegal of
the traffic that would be lost to the port if Moles 2 and 3 and the Middle
and East Basins had to be abandoned. However, the present replacement
value of these facilities is estimated to amount to US$ 4 million, or
about three times the expenditure required for reconstructing the wall.
There can be little doubt that retention of the traffic to be handled
at these facilities provides ample justification for the work proposed.
Dredging Alongside Mole 1, and in the Middle Basin
8.9       The utilization of berths on the south side of the port is at
present restricted by the lack of an adequate depth of water alongside
some of the quays. This will become a more serious limitation in future,
due to the tendency for cargo vessels in general to increase in size, and
to the substantial increase in traffic that these quays will be expected
to handle in a few years' time.



- 25 -
8.10      At present, two of the berths on the west side of Mole 1 have
an effective depth of less than 5 m in their approaches, though the quay
itself is founded at 10 m. Similarly, the south wall of the Middle
Basin will be founded at 10 m after its reconstruction, but the depth of
water available in this berth is at present only 6 m. The intention is
to dredge the berths on the west of Mole 1, and the approaches, to 8.5 m
and the berth in the Middle Basin to 10 m and s0 provide adequate facil-
ities to meet expected future traffic demands.
8.11      If these increased depths are not provided, it is considered
that Moles 1 and 2, and the Middle Basin, could together only handle
about 700,000 tons of cargo a year without difficulty; any further
increases are likely to lead to congestion and to cause increasing delay
to ships awaiting berths. In 1965, the traffic handled over these quays
amounted to only 480,000 tons, but is expected to rise to about 850,000
tons by 1970/71.
8.12      By providing additional berthing space for vessels of about
8,000 to 14,000 dwt - a range accounting for an increasingly important
proportion of general cargo vessels - this area of the port could handle
850,000 tons a year with only an occasional and quite acceptable measure
of delay to ships. Even assuming that the improved facilities would mean
savings of no more than 3% in the average time the ships will spend in
the port, this would mean a saving of about 70 ship-days a year, equivalent
to ships' time costs of about Us$ 100,000 a year, with the level of
traffic expected in 1970/71. This would give a rate of return of about
12% on the US$ 810,000 expenditure on the dredging (including consulting
services). In view of the modest assumption of delay required to provide
benefits of this order, the work is considered to be amply justified.
Dredging for the Calcium Phosphate Quay
8.13      The turning circle to be dredged to a depth of 11 m is required
for ships berthing at the western side of Mole 5, which is used exclusively
for loading the Taiba calcium phosphate. There is already an adequate
depth of 11 m alongside the quay, but in the absence of the turning circle,
and with depths of less than 8 m in parts of this area, the loaded vessels
have difficulty in manoeuvring. As the size of the bulk carriers become
progressively larger, the delays caused by the need to wait, in any case,
for periods of high tide will also increase.
8.14      The exports of calcium phosphate increased from 450,000 tons in
1963 to 870,000 tons in 1965, and are expected to reach 1.7 million tons
by 1967/68. To handle traffic of this order over Mole 5 implies not only
that many more ships will berth at this quay, but that a higher proportion
of them must be of the larger tonnages. With the existing facilities,
congestion will arise. A modest estimate of the delays that can be
avoided if an adequate turning circle is provided would be perhaps 20 ship-
days a year, giving rise to savings of about US$ 30,000 a year in terms of
the time costs to shipping.



- 26 -
8.15      By reducing the risk of accidents, as well as delays, to the
larger vessels, the improvement in facilities would encourage the use
of larger bulk carriers, which would in turn be reflected in lower freight
charges.  For example, the freight rate to Rotterdam is about US$ 3.75
per ton for a 10,000 ton consignment, falling to about TJS$ 3.50 per ton
for a consignnent of 17,000 tons, and to lower levels still for larger
shipments.  Some of the traffic will no doubt continue to pass in the
smaller vessels, but, assuming that perhaps 500,000 tons of the 1.7
million tons a year manages in this way to achieve reductions of no more
than US$ 0.25 per ton, this would amount to an annual saving of US$
125,000.
8.16      Taking these two sources of benefits together, the investment
of US$ 920,000 (including consulting services) for the turning circle
would offer a rate of return of about 16% over a 25-year life.
Dredging for the Aluminum Phosphate Quay
8.17      Dredging is required alongside the aluminum phosphate quay
and in the approaches to it on the western side of Mole 8 (see Map 4).
The existing depth is only 8.5 m which means that the 110,000 tons of
phosphate exported to France annually must be accommodated in ships with
a capacity of no more than 7,500 to 8,000 dwt. The shipping rate is
consequently higher than the usual charge for similar cargoes, and with
the increasing size of vessels generally, and the greater difficulty of
finding smaller ships for the traffic, it is possible that the market
might soon be lost altogether.
8.18      The present shipping rate for aluminum phosphate to the west
coast of France is US$ 4.20 per ton.  It is estimated that the increased
size of vessels permitted by dredging to 10 m would be reflected in a
reduction to about US$ 3.70 per ton, which is about the same as that
prevailing for calcium phosphate exported to Western Europe. This would
mean a saving of US$ 55,000 on the 110,000 tons per annum, which represents
a rate of return of about 12% on the US$ 410,000 investment (including
consulting services).over a 25-year life.
Conclusion
8.19      The rates of return on those items for which quantification of
benefits is possible have been calculated to range between 12% and 16%
per annumi, with an average return of 14%. These are thought to have been
based on modest assumptions of' the likely benefits from the project,
which is considered in total, and in its constituent parts, to have ample
economic justification.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.1       The Dakar Port project provides for additional berthing and
stacking space and for improved access, by deeper dredging, to existing
quays. The project will increase the efficiency of port operations,
reduce freight charges, and enable the Port Authority to meet the expected
increases in traffic. The project is technically sound, of economic
benefit to the country and should bring about an improvement of the Port
Authority's finances.
9.2       The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$ 4.O million equivalent to the Port Authority of Dakar with a term
of 15 years, including 3½ years of grace.

PORT AUTHORTIY OF DAKAR
Valuaticn of Net Fixed As sets
at August 1, 1960
1.        The bases adopted for the valuation of the net fixed assets are:
(a) the estimated 1960 replacemzent value of depreciating
assets whose replacement will be necessary, reduced to
provide for accumulated depreciation;
(b)  the estimated original cost of non-depreciable assets,
and of depreciable assets the replacement of which will
never be required.
Assets under (a) are:
(i) renewable superstructure items;
(ii) quay walls.
Assets under (b) are:
(i) non-renewable superstructure items;
(ii)  fil] behind quay walls;
(iii) dredging.
2.        The Port Authority has prepared a detailed and comprehensive
inventory of the superstructure items, separating the items whose re-
placement will be necessary from those which will not require to be re-
placed. The total replacement value, as new, is as follows:
Renewable items          CFAF  2070 million
Non-renewable items      CFAF   968    "
Total      CFAF  3038    "
The renewable superstructure items have been acquired over a long period
of years and their useful life was originally estimated at 5 to 50 years.
In the absence of historical records, it has been assumed that these assets
are evenly depreciated and that their 1960 value is 50% of their value new,
thus amounting to CFAF 1,035 million.



ANNEX A
Page 2
3.        The replacement value of the quays was estimated by the Port
Authority at CFAF 9,600 million divisible as to CFAF 4,830 million for
the quay walls and CFAF 4,770 million for fill behind the w%alls. Research
by the Bank into the history of Dakar port construction shows that on the
basis of the Port Authority's estimates, the present-day value of the quay
walls is CFAF 1,037 million, after allowing 2% per annum depreciation from
the year following completion of each section thereof. As for the fill,
in the absence of original records, an estimate on comparitive costs has
been made, resulting in CFAF 1,600 million.
4.        A similar estimate for the non-renewable superstructure items
produced the figure of CFAF 180 million.
5.        The total quantity of dredging has amounted to some 5.7 million
m3, estimated by the Port Authority to have a total replacement cost,
as new, of CFAF 8,40o million. The estimate is based on an overall unit
price of Us$ 6.0 equivalent per m3, which is substantially over-valued.
A more realistic unit price would be US$ 2.0 equivalent for dredging up
to -9 m and US$ 4.0 equivalent for deeper dredging. Wen deflating these
prices, the estimated original cost of dredging becomes OFAF 840 million.
6.        As a result of the above computations, the value of the net
fixed assets of the Port Authority in 1960 can reasonably be assessed as
follows:
---     -- CFAF Million ----------

CFAF Million
Revenue of previous periods                           66.8
Expenses of previous periods                         (33.2)
Licenses and taxes 1958, 1959 and the
first 7 months of 1960                             (25.6)
Net excess of revenue over expenses of
previous periods                                     8.0
This sum has been added to the opening balance of the Reserve Fund and
deducted from the Governnent capital contribution.
2.        The following long-term debts have been incorporated in the
accounts:
CFAF Million
(a) CCCEL/ loan for construction of the
petroleum wharf                               105.3
(b)  Petroleum companies' outlay on
surfacing the petroleum area, repayable
from rents and harbor dues or from
budgetary appropriations                      112.8
218.1
This sum has been deducted from the Government capital contribution.
3.        In the period imnediately after the Port Authority's vesting
day, considerable suns were spent on major repairs and charged either
to capital or revenue. To reflect the true position, a provision for
deferred maintenance as of August 1, 1960 has been set up as follows:
CFAF Million
(a)  Suns charged to capital                         67.9
(b)  Suns charged to Reserve Fund                     26.2
94.1

ANNEX B

This sum is shown as a provision for deferred maintenance and is treated
as a deduction from the fixed assets with a corresponding reduction of the
Government capital contribution.
4.        At August 1, 1960 a CFAF 55.5 million reserve for renewal of
fixed assets was created. It is assumed that this reserve is included
in the overall 50% accumulated deprecation applied to the renewable
superstructure assets (see Annex A, paragraph 2).
B.   Capital Expenditure
5.        The recorded capital expenditure includes items of debt service
and of maintenance. An analysis is as follows:
CFAF Million

In addition to the sum of CFAF 312.1 million shown in the last column
above, a further CFAF 12.1 million incorrectly charged to the Reserve
Fund has been transferred therefrom, making CFAF 324.2 million the total
capital expenditure of the Port Authority from August 1, 1960 to June
30, 1965.
C. Debt Service
6.        The opening balance of long-term debt is as shown in paragraph
2 above. In the case of the CCCE loan, the Government pays in the first
instance and claims reimbursement from the Port Authority in arrears.
Entries in the Port Authority's accounts are therefore irregular as to
both timing and amount, as shown below:

Total                   88.2                  17.1
7.        In the case of the petroleum companies, reimbursement of
expenditure they have incurred on surfacing their areas of occupancy
in the port was to be made by off-setting the amounts they were due to
pay in harbor dues and rents.  In addition, however, the Port Authority
made paynents from its capital budget.  The suns reimbursed by waiver
of harbor dues and rents were not passed through the accounts. This
omission has been corrected and the true position is shown below:

Total          6.1     23.7     32.5        62.3          50.5
8.        Interest charges were normally debited to income account except
in the case of the reimbursement to the Governnent of the CCCE debt service
in the period January/June 1962, when they were incorrectly charged to
capital. This has been corrected in the restated income accounts and
balance sheets shown in Tables 9 and 10.

NOTES ON FORECAST OPERATING INCOI'E AND EXPENDITURE (TABLE 11)
A.   Income
1.        Receipts from stacking area and transit shed rents in 1964/65
averaged CFAF 103 per ton. It is expected that receipts will vary
proportionally with the tonnage of imported and exported cargo (excluding
petroleum productse fish and phosphates). In the forecast, the above
average has been applied taking into account the agreed increase of 50%
in tariffs referred to in paragraph 7.2.
2.        No substantial change is expected for the receipts from rental
of cranes and other equipment.
3.        It is considered that by and large the ratio between NRT and
cargo will remain the same.  Therefore, receipts from fees are expected
to increase proportionally to tonnage excluding bunkering traffic.
4.        The number of passengers is declining substantially (82,000 in
1964, 65,ooo in 1965) and this trend is likely to be maintained mainly
because of diversion to air travel. Receipts from handling of passengers
are likely to fall to an estimated CFAF 20 million a year.
5.        Although bunkering is forecast to decline, receipts from
petroleum products are expected to increase slightly because of increased
imports of high octane gas-oil which is not produced by the local refinery
at M'Bao.
6.        Receipts from phosphate are computed on the basis of future
exports taking into account the increase from CFAF 30 to CFAF 43 per ton
for calcium phosphate; the latter tariff is expected to be applied also
to aluminum phosphate by January 1, 1970. It is further expected that
for both calcium and aluminum phosphate, export harbor dues will rise to
CFAF 50 per ton by 1970/71.
7.        Since the import/export ratio of general cargo is expected to
remain as at present (about two-thirds imports, one-third exports) and
no substantial change is likely in the distribtuion of commodities, the
average receipt of CFAF 130 per ton mentioned in paragraph 7.4 has been
applied to the forecast traffic on the basis of the agreed 40% increase
of dues.
8.        Receipts from fish are forecast proportionally to the expected
increase in this traffic.
9.        No changes are expected for the miscellaneous revenues which are
projected on a flat basis.



ANNEX C
Page 2
B.   Expenditure
10.       Since no salary increase is expected within the foreseeable
future, staff reductions referred to in paragraph 7.8 are reflected in
the forecast of staff costs.
11.       No major changes are expected for the other working expenses
which have been computed on the average basis of the last fiscal years.
12.       Depreciation of the existing fixed assets has been computed
on the basis of useful life and replacement value of the depreciable
assets whose replacement will be necessary. The basis used for the
valuation of the Port Authority's fixed assets (see Annex A) has been
used for assessing the depreciation allowvance. The same basis has been
applied for the depreciable items of the project (quay walls and super-
structure).
13.       It is assumed that the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan will
be lent to the Port Authority at 6% interest per annun with a term of 15
years including a 3½2 year period of grace.
