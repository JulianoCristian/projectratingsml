will support the Government's program, as\n            articulated in the Economic Agenda for the New Millennium\n            (NEA), and the accompanying public finance reform. It will\n            finance specific actions taken by the Government during\n            budget year 2001/2002, and in particular, will focus on key\n            reforms in education, training, poverty alleviation,\n            environment, and economic management. Complementary\n            knowledge assistance will concentrate on human capital\n            development, and economic management. The project will be\n            beneficial in implementing, and sustaining the\n            Government's reform program that focuses on\n            transforming Mauritius into a \"high-tech high income\n            service and knowledge economy\" over the medium term.\n            However, the shortfall of political support in implementing\n            reforms, uncertainty about the Government's\n            achievements in meeting deficit targets, and, the public\n            sector's capacity constraints in technical knowledge,\n            are potential risks which should be mitigated by consensus\n            building, continued dialogue, and assisting the Government\n            in institutionalizing a medium-term macroeconomic framework,\n            and, strengthening relevant technical and managerial capacity."}, "docdt": "2002-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
