1. Country and Sector Background
Since independence, Mauritius has evolved from a low-income
country that heavily relied on agriculture and had a per capita
income of about US$700 in 1970 to a diversified upper middle-
income economy with a per capita income of about US$3,800 in
2000. This impressive economic growth has predominantly been
driven by the development of additional sectors, other than
sugar, namely tourism and textiles.
Despite its solid economic performance of the past 20 years (the
country has averaged GDP growth of about 5.5 percent per annum)
Mauritius is facing idiosyncratic challenges which could
undermine hard-earned economic and social gains. These
challenges are: increased competition from lower cost producers,
phasing out of preferential trade agreements for Mauritius main
exports, low quality labor force.
The elections in late 2000 brought to power a new coalition
government that has committed itself to implement a
comprehensive reform program which is aimed at consolidating and
enhancing economic and social achievements. The GoM vision has
been specified in two key strategic documents: "The State of the
Economy" (November 2000) entails a comprehensive review and
analysis of the economic situation of Mauritius. The "Economic
Agenda for the New Millennium" (published as part of the Budget
Speech in June 2001) presents an action plan to establish a
"high-tech high income service and knowledge economy" in
Mauritius in about five years time while concurrently addressing
pressing needs for modernization of the private and public



sector, curtailing unemployment, and improving social policy.
The Budget for 2001/02 is the first budget that intends to
implement the Economic Agenda. It supports a comprehensive
expenditure package totaling 24.9 percent of GDP, compared to
24.1 percent in the previous year. The new budget foresees
significant efforts to increase revenues. The combined impact of
all the measures on tax revenues is estimated at 0.4 percent of
GDP. On the basis of the new budget total revenues will reach
16.3 percent of GDP, compared to 15.9 percent of GDP in the
previous year.
Despite these revenue generation efforts, the overall fiscal
deficit for the 2001/02 budget, as indicated in the Economic
Agenda, is estimated at 6.5 percent of GDP, similar to the
previous year. Financing of the 2001/02 deficit is currently
expected to come primarily from domestic non-banking (3.5
percent of GDP) and banking sources (2.1 percent of GDP).
Financing from other domestic sources (including privatization
proceeds) is expected to mobilize another 0.8 percent of GDP,
for total domestic financing of 6.4 percent of GDP). About 0.1
percent of GDP will be externally financed. The financing
strategy mirrors Mauritius' preference of the past few years of
financing deficits from domestic sources.
With a projected deficit of about 6 percent of GDP in the second
year in a row, central government debt being close to 50 percent
of GDP and significant parastatal debt of approximately 20
percent of GDP, Mauritius runs the risk of entering a debt
spiral.
2. Objectives
The proposed lending operation aims to support the Government of
Mauritius' budget for 2001/02 and the implementation of the
Economic Agenda. The operation would make available US$40
million, which would disburse in its entirety upon effectiveness
of the loan agreement. The loan amount reflects a decision by
the GoM to request Bank support for approximately 20 percent of
its budget deficit. The PERL is designated to support policy
initiatives undertaken by GoM on the basis of the Economic
Agenda from September 2000 to date and financed under the Budget
2001/02 in the following reform areas (i) increase of
competitiveness and productivity, (ii) investment in people and
society , and (iii) preservation of the environment.
An integral part of the preparation of the proposed PERL will be
the policy advice and dialogue on the Economic Agenda which are
considered vital by the Bank and the Government of Mauritius
(such as economic management, education, poverty alleviation,
social assistance etc.). The Bank will continue to offer such
advice as part of its commitment to assist Mauritius in meeting
its medium term development objectives.
