Loan Project for Mauritius was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. The Public Expenditure\n            Reform Loan (PERL) was designed to disburse against actions\n            already taken, and it did so immediately upon effectiveness,\n            giving timely support to the FY 2001/02 budget, avoiding\n            disbursement delays. Shifting the majority of internal\n            resources from investment project management to medium term\n            program support. Advisory services requires that funding for\n            advisory services is consistent, and that the quality and\n            impact of those services are assessed. One way to assure\n            quality is to establish periodic internal reviews for policy\n            advice. Mauritius has a broad reform agenda and has not yet\n            adopted a culture of monitoring and program evaluation\n            performance. It is in the process of developing a medium\n            term expenditure framework to fill the gap."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
