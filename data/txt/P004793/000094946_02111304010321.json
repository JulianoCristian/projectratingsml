Overall the performances of the World Bank\n            and the Borrower are assessed as satisfactory. Key lessons\n            from this project are: 1) Early identification of\n            implementation problems, and Borrower commitment to\n            aggressively address those issues were key factors to the\n            success of its outcomes. 2) Strong identification teams with\n            extensive project design experience offer more assurance\n            that estimates of implementation capacity, costs, and\n            expected outcomes are accurate and articulated with national\n            priorities and Bank policies. 3) Future operations should\n            establish a Performance Management Framework to provide\n            early and continuous assessment of both outcomes and project\n            impacts on stakeholders. This should include evaluations to\n            measure the effect of investments in capacity building,\n            improved training facilities and better trained staff, and\n            the cost effectiveness of public sector training. 4) Bank\n            projects have to be better planned and coordinated\n            especially because project management is made more complex\n            in matrix organizations."}, "docdt": "2002-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
