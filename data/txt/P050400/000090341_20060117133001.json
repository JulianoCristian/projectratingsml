Lessons learned from the project: Project\n            design should be focused and not overly ambitious. A\n            realistic assessment of the Borrower's implementation\n            capacity can result in an implementation schedule grounded\n            on Borrower capacity, a more realistic design and better\n            risk management. The mid term review process should be used\n            as an opportunity to question whether a project requires\n            restructuring. Project funding should mirror project\n            components. Political and policy analyses of the project\n            context contribute to project success. The design of complex\n            interventions such as IFMIS should take account of\n            government capacity to conceptualize, design, implement and\n            manage such interventions. Early proactive interventions in\n            response to slow implementation by the Bank and Borrower may\n            assist in identifying design and implementation problems."}, "docdt": "2005-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
