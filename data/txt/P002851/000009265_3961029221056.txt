IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TOGO
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(Credit 1808-TO)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agricultural Extension
Project (PVA) for which IDA credit No. 1808-TO in the amount of US$ 9.7 million (equivalent to
SDR 7.6 million) was approved on July 31, 1987 and made effective on July 25, 1988.
The credit was closed on June 30, 1994, a year later than the original closing date of
June 30, 1993. The last disbursement took place on October 19, 1994, at which time a balance of US$
4,852,618 (SDR 4,170,003) was cancelled.
The ICR was prepared by a FAO/CP (FAO/WB Cooperative Programme) mission,
which visited the country from December 3 to 14, 1994. The findings are based on discussions with
the task manager and a review of the documentation available at the Regional World Bank Office in
Abidjan and at the Country Office in Lome. Discussions were also held with officials from the
various agencies responsible for project implementation; a field visit was made to the DRDR's
(Direction Regionale de Developpement Rural) of the Maritime and Plateaux Regions on December
12 and 13, 1994. The ICR was reviewed by Christian Fauliau and Surjit Singh of AF4AE and
Bertrand de Chazal on behalf of Operations Adviser, AF4DR.
The Borrower has submitted a summary evaluation in French, the translation of which is
provided in Appendix B.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TOGO
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(Credit 1808-TO)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.        Togo's agricultural sector accounts for about 30% of GDP and about 30% of exports
and employs about 80% of the national labor force. Therefore, Togo's overall economic growth
depends heavily on growth in agriculture. However, productivity has remained below its
potential due to poor price incentives, poor resource allocation by Government, poorly articulated
strategy for agriculture and ineffective dissemination of improved technology for adoption by
farmers. The Government began to redress the basic problems of the sector in 1985 during the
two structural adjustment programns which the Bank actively supported. The Government asked
IDA to assist in starting-up pilot actions through a PPF in March 1985 which resulted in the
Agriculture Extension Project. The project formed an integral part of Government's agricultural
sector development strategy and was closely related to the extension efforts of the then ongoing
Second Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas (Cr. 1302) and the Second Cocoa/Coffee
Project (Cr. 945). Two additional follow-up projects were subsequently approved and these were
the Third Cocoa/Coffee Project (Cr. 1745) in FY87, which has been completed, and the Cotton
Sector Development Project (Cr. 1929) in FY88, which is ongoing.
Project Objectives
2.        The main objective of the Agricultural Extension Project (Projet de vulgarisation
agricole, PVA) was to support over a four-year period, Government's program for improving
agricultural extension services executed through Regional Directorates of Rural Development
with a long-term objective of establishing a unified national service. The project had to
reorganize and strengthen the existing extension services managed by four of the five General
Directorates of Rural Development (Direction generale du developpement rural, DGDRs), at
national and regional levels, and to introduce principles similar to the Training and Visit (T&V)
system of extension. The project would strengthen the links between extension and research,
which were weak, and also develop an institutional framework within the Ministry of Rural
Development (MDR) to better define extension priorities and programs. The project was to
concentrate on food crop production and thus complement similar extension and production
efforts under way in the IDA-assisted projects for cotton, cocoa and coffee. The project
objectives were appropriate since these augmented the Government's policy  of seeking
agricultural growth through well-tested research recommendations reaching the farmers.
Achievement of objectives
3.        Although the project made some progress in institutional rationalization, it did not
reach its basic objectives of reorganizing and strengthening of the extension services. The major



ii
contributory factors for the weak performance were (a) delays and short-falls in counterpart
funding resulting in shortage of operating funds; (b) socio-political unrest which set in shortly
after the start of the PVA and eventually led to a virtual halt in field activities after mid-1992; and
(c) ineffective project management (technical and financial) arising from a poor definition of
responsibilities which resulted in some key technical positions remaining vacant for an extended
period.  Also foreign technical assistance  (TA) was of questionable quality and largely
ineffective.
4.         The objective of laying a foundation for a unified national extension service was not
achieved. However, some efforts towards harmonizing of actions between the PVA and other
agencies were made especially with the Soci6te Togolaise du Coton (SOTOCO). In the areas
where extension activities continued despite the difficulties, the adoption of new technologies was
constrained by poor availability of inputs, credit, and access to markets. These problems were a
consequence of a weak private sector and ineffective rural producers' organizations. Field trials
at the five established points (points d'essai, PE) produced interesting results which confirmed the
potential of the new techniques and technologies for production improvements. However, only
few farmer field trials (Tests en milieu paysan, TMP) were executed at village level and these did
not meet producers expectations; visits to PE and TMP by farmers and extensionists were rare,
limiting their impact on agricultural production.
5.         The biggest achievement of the Project was the generation of the desire within MDR
to improve the organization of the extension system and the establishment of contacts between
producers and extension staff in spite of many difficulties, including strikes, lack of funds and
means of transport. The adaptation of the T&V system to the "Togolese System" (STER-Systeme
togolais d'encadrement rural) helped in this regard. The linkages between the various institutions
responsible for rural development, however, remained very weak.
Project Costs
6.         The PVA was approved for a total cost of US$12.6 million from which IDA was to
provide US$ 9.7 million (SDR 7.6 million). The project cost has now been re-estimated at US$
5.1 million. Management problems as well as social and political unrest, which set in during the
later part of 1991 and continued into 1994, delayed credit disbursement. The loan closing date
was extended by one year to June 30, 1994. In spite of this extension, total disbursement
amounted to US$ 4.7 million and the remaining balance of SDR 4.2 million, or about 55 percent
of the credit had to be cancelled as of October 1994.
Project Sustainability.
7.         As a result of changes in the political structure and consequential adjustment of the
legal and institutional framework governing agriculture extension and related services, the project
cannot be continued in its present form. However, the STER system still remains valid as a



iii
National Extension System  that could be incorporated into follow-up activities.  The
Government's financial situation suggests that maintenance of relevant operations and facilities
such as buildings and vehicles will continue to be difficult and replacement of capital items even
more so.
World Bank's Performance
8.        The project was prepared on the basis of extremely limited experience gained from a
pilot program. The project implementation experience has proven that the general principles of a
T & V system can be adapted to the Togolese context. However, the assumed doubling or even
tripling of yields throughout the project areas has proven to be largely overoptimistic. IDA carried
out 12 full supervision missions, but there was lack of continuity of staffing of supervision
missions and this resulted in inconsistent recommendations from missions. The Bank's appraisal
documents could have been more specific on delineation of project management functions and
this could have possibly reduced delays in disbursement and management actions. Although the
Bank was aware of this problem and successive supervision missions made precise
recommendations, no corrective action was taken by the Government. IDA should have also
reacted to the serious shortfall in counterpart funds, possibly by increasing IDA's share of
operating cost financing which would have allowed the continuation of field operations at more
meaningful levels.
Borrower's Performance
9.         The Borrower's performance during project implementation was not satisfactory.
Initial weaknesses in project management/coordination led to delayed project start-up. The
Borrower failed to regularly replenish the project account with the required counterpart funds.
Work programs and budgets were mostly submitted with delays and not all audit reports were
satisfactory. Only towards the end of the project did the Borrower make better progress in
preparing bidding documents, work programs and budgets. On the other hand, the Borrwoer did
select Togolese nationals of high calibre as heads of Directorate of Coop. and Extension (DCV),
Direction Administrative et Financiere (DAF) and General Directorate of Rural Development
(DRDRs) and also designated well qualified counterparts to the TA specialists.
Assessment of Overall Outcome
10.       The overall outcome of the project is unsatisfactory. The reorganization and
strengthening of the agricultural extension services showed little progress. The Government has
still not assumed its post-project funding and organizational responsibilities. Due to lack of
adequate monitoring and evaluation data, the project's impact on agricultural production and the
standard of living at village level is difficult to assess, but secondary data seem to indicate that
there has been no significant impact.



iv
Future Operations
11.       The Government does not anticipate to continue the PVA activities in their present
form and is in the process of preparing a new project which would utilize the facilities and
equipment provided under the PVA, and take into account the lessons learnt during its
implementation. It plans to seek financing from the Bank and other donors.
Key Lessons Learnt
12.       The main lessons learnt from the project are:
(a)   in agricultural extension, the availability of adequate and timely operating
funds is critical to the success of technology adaptation and dissemination
processes which are linked to time-based activities dependant on climatic
considerations; consequently, there has to be a conservative assessment of the
Government's ability to meet its financial obligations under the project and
the Bank has to be more responsive to increasing its share of financing
operating costs;
(b)   project management responsibilities must be clearly defined and detailed from
the onset of the project to facilitate working relationships and coordination
between units;
(c)   implementation of technology disseminaton processes cannot be done in
isolation of availability of farm inputs, market demand and accessibility, and
producer credit;
(d)   although the Borrower has the ultimate responsibility for the selection of TA
staff, "no objection" to the selection should only be given after a thorough
review of qualifications, experience and skills;
(e)   staffing of Bank supervision missions should give importance to continuity;
and
(f)   an extension system must respond to local environmental, technical and socio-
economic conditions and evolve accordingly.

AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(Credit 1808-TO)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
1. Introduction
1.01    The Agricultural Extension Project of US$12.6 million was an integral part of Government's
agricultural sector development strategy and was closely related to the extension efforts of the ongoing
Second Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas (Cr. 1302) and Second Cocoa/Coffee Project (Cr.
945). IDA had assisted in the formulation of this strategy which it continued to support. It is also related
to the two structural adjustment programs which specifically called for a reorganization and rehabilitation
of key agricultural services.
1.02    Implementation of Government's policy for seeking agricultural growth depended on simple,
well-tested research recommendations reaching Togolese farmers. This could only be done by improving
the current linkages between research and extension and improving the efficiency of the outreach efforts.
Following completion of this extension project, a follow-up project was envisaged which would
incorporate and harmonize under a national extension service all of the currently dispersed extension
projects. IDA has significant experience in the agricultural extension field which could be applied
effectively in Togo. IDA's continuous involvement, both financially and through the provision of
technical advice, was therefore important for the success of Togo's agricultural strategy.
1.03    The Government asked IDA to assist in financing pilot extension actions through a PPF in
March 1985 which resulted in the current agriculture extension project. Two follow-up projects have
since been approved in Cocoa, Coffee and Cotton Sectors, i.e, Third Cocoa/Coffee Project (Cr. 1745) in
FY87 which is now completed, and Cotton Sector Development Project (Cr. 1929) in FY88 which is
ongoing.
2. Project Objectives
2.01    The project's main objective was to support, over a four-year period, the Government's program
for improving agricultural extension services executed through the DRDRs (Directions regionales de
developpement rural), within a longer-term objective of establishing a unified national extension service.
The project had to reorganize and strengthen the existing extension services managed by four of the five
DRDRs, in the areas which were not, at that time, receiving external aid, at both national and regional
levels, and to introduce principles similar to the Training and Visit (T&V) extension system. Therefore,
institution building was to be dominant in the project and principally aimed at strengthening the Direction
generale du developpement rural (DGDR) within the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) and its
decentralized regional operations, the DRDRs. Thus, the PVA was not meant to be an autonomous
project, but a program to be implemented through existing structures. IDA support was intended to



2
accelerate agricultural growth and to harmonize activities of the different agricultural development
institutions in various agricultural projects, 29 of which were financed by 12 donors. Special attention
was to be given to organizational improvement, training of regional staff as well as to the provision and
the proper management of funds by MDR down to the DRDRs. It was intended that over the project
period, the DRDRs would gradually assume responsibility for managing all extension services in their
region as each of the ongoing projects came to an end.
2.02    The project was to focus on food crop production and thus complement similar extension and
production efforts under way in other IDA-assisted projects for cotton and rural development executed by
SOTOCO, and coffee and cocoa development executed by SRCC (Societe nationale pour la renovation et
le developpment de la cacaoyere et de la cafeiere togolaises). The main components of the project were:
(a)    reorganizing and strengthening MDR's agricultural extension services at the DRDR
level along the basic principles of the T&V system;
(b)    the provision of systematic in-service training of extension staff at all levels;
(c)    improvement of the links between extension and research through more direct,
decentralized involvement of DRA (Direction de la recherche agricole) in adaptive
research and farm trials, with the active participation of extension staff and farmers;
(d)    establishment of a monitoring and evaluation (M & E) unit within each DRDR to
supervise extension and research activities and to provide sufficient feed-back from
farmers so as to determine the appropriateness of extension's recommended messages;
(e)    introduction of improved financial management practices for DGDR and the DRDRs.
2.03    Project financing was mainly for the following:
(a)    the recruitment of a limited number of additional Togolese staff for (i) improved
technical support of field staff; (ii) expanded training programs; (iii) adaptive research
programs; (iv) the new monitoring and evaluation (M & E) units; and (v) improved
management;
(b)    the purchase of vehicles, field and office equipment for project staff, and a small civil
works program;
(c)    incremental operating costs for the units involved;
(d)    the cost of setting up six small experimentation sites and rehabilitating six existing
ones;
(e)    the cost of technical assistance to MDR, consultancies on financial management and
training, and a study of women's role in agriculture.

3. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01    The project did not make much progress in achieving its basic objective of reorganizing and
strengthening the extension services of the four DRDR's (the fifth DRDR was covered by a GTZ project)
and DGDR. The main reason for this failure was the delay in the provision of counterpart funds in the
early years of the project and the non-payment in the later years. Without an adequate and timely supply
of operating funds, MDR was unable to provide extension services at meaningful levels. Socio-political
unrest from the start of the PVA, and the general strike from mid-1992 to end 1993 also contributed
significantly to slowing down project activities. As a result, program implementation (particularly during
the last two years) was in inertia, with work at the village level scarce and fragmented, and dependent on
isolated individuals or volunteers. At the end of the project period in 1994 the situation was particularly
difficult because vehicles were mostly out of order and operating funds were scarce.
3.02    The institutional arrangements for project organization and management were not well
designed at appraisal. The line of command for project management remained unclear and the respective
roles and responsibilities of the implementing agencies were not clearly defined. This led to difficulties in
co-ordination and co-operation between the Ministry of Rural Development (NDR) and the Ministry of
Planning (MP); and inside the Ministry of Rural Development between the DGDR and the DCV. As a
result, the project suffered constantly from delays during implementation caused by uncertainties over
responsibilities and "turf' issues. The reorganization of the MDR (by Decree of April 3, 1991, and the
"Application Arrete" of January 14, 1994), under which it was intended to streamline, decentralize and
restructure the new Directorate of Agricultural Extension into three services (Extension, Rural Animation
and Youth Group Formation), had not been implemented at project closing.
3.03    One of the major and long-standing weaknesses of the project was the absence of a sufficiently
detailed budget backed by a coherent and detailed program of activities tied to a calendar of execution.
Although repeated recommendations by supervision missions succeeded in slightly improving the
situation, the central management did not actively engage in defining regional budgets by activity. The
management of accounts in the Maritime and Plateaux regions was considered satisfactory, but this was
not the case in the Kara and Savanes regions.
3.04    Programmning of activities was not carried out on a regular basis mainly due to a lack of funds,
frequent removal of staff, abandoning of posts by staff, and social unrest. The filling of vacant posts was
difficult and the nomination of a new Director for the DCV took over one year (1991-1992); the position
of the national training officer remained vacant for two years (1990-1992); and no regional monitoring
and evaluation specialists were recruited for three regions (Maritime, Plateaux and Savanes). Foreign
technical assistance was not effective and was heavily criticized by national staff. The Bank, too was
disappointed with the performance of TA staff and in the case of the extension specialist, agreed to
discontinue the contract after nine months instead of three years, as planned in the SAR. Given the
difficult operating conditions in the country, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the lack of
effective TA contributed to the poor performance of the project.



4
3.05    The objective of creating a quality extension service, which would be unified in the future, was
not achieved due to the low professional level of the extension staff, and the insufficient funding
provided to the DRDRs. Other projects, including those financed by IDA, continued their extension
activities in parallel but some efforts were made under the PVA to achieve complementarity of actions
with thenm (especially with the SOTOCO). Most of the extension staff were in place in the first year of
the project, and changes in the following years were marginal. The Togolese system of rural extension
coverage (STER- Systeme togolais d'encadrement rural), based on the T&V principles but adapted to the
socio-cultural conditions in Togo, was adopted by the project. The program for the 15 days' work cycle
for the extension agent included: 8 days for visits, 1 day for training and I day for meetings. After a good
start with about 5,000 demonstration plots in 1989, the work with producers slowed down and was almost
totally disrupted from 1992 onwards due to lack of operating funds and progressively deteriorating
transport vehicles . The training of the extensionists at the Apprentice School of Agriculture/National
Agricultural Training Institute (EAA/INFA) at Tove was stopped in October 1992 for socio-political
reasons and taken over by regional staff from the DRDR who were not qualified for the job. In-house
training for front-line extension agents was generally well carried out but was often disrupted by events
already mentioned. Monthly technology workshops, on the contrary, were poorly conducted or non-
existent over the last two years.
3.06    One achievement of the project was that it was able to organize the establishment of contacts
between producers and extension staff in spite of the many difficulties, strikes, lack of funds and means of
transport. f-lowever, the results would have been much more meaningful if the extension messages had
been more specifically tailored to producers' requirements. Participative diagnosis at village level was not
carried out and the participative methods of rural appraisal (MARP- Methode acceleree de recherche
participative, and RRA- Rapid rural appraisal) were unknown to the extension staff. The provision of TA
did not seem to have helped in addressing these issues. The assumption that during the project life issues
of input distribution, marketing of farm produce and rural credit would be resolved was too optimistic in
an environment of ineffective producer organizations and a weak private sector. However, project impact
was more positive in Kara where these issues were specifically addressed in collaboration with the
European Community and Project Sassakawa 2000 supported by USAID.
3.07    In order to develop a basis for carrying out extension in line with producers' interests, a study of
the findings in agricultural research and a review of technical requirements was carried out in 1989. This
was used to determine work programs for trial plots (PE). Only five of the 12 planned PEs were
established. Besides, only a few trials (TMP) were executed at village level and they did not meet with
producers' expectations; visits to PE and TMP by farmers and extensionists were rare, so their impact on
agricultural production was limited. However, the trials did produce some interesting results which
confirmed the potential of new techniques and technologies for production improvements. It was
unfortunate that the efforts to introduce innovations neglected the financial aspects at farm level and only
emphasized the technical aspects.
3.08    In general, it can be stated that the different service units preferred working in isolation, and the
linkages between the Research Institutes, the Rural Development, the Extension Service, the Technical
Services (livestock, forestry and environment), the training system and the producers were very weak.
The findings and recommendations of the Monitoring and Evaluation units were rarely taken into



5
consideration by the respective services. Farmers' problems (land fertility, weeds, availability of inputs,
marketing, etc.) were not addressed and the envisaged strengthening of the co-ordination between the
different agencies involved in rural development (MDR, Ministry of Social Affairs, Non-Government
Organizations and donors) did not take place.
3.09    Sustainability: Wide ranging changes in political structures since the period of SAR
preparation (1987), together with the institutional restructuring of agricultural services and a new
definition of their role with the decentralization of all activities and management, require that a fresh look
be taken at the implementation arrangements for activities envisaged under the project. However, the
National Extension System (STER) is still valid, even though it needs to be adapted to the new socio-
economic situation of the country, and the experience gained under the PVA could be utilized by follow-
up support projects. The project had also made considerable investments in infrastructure (office,
housing, stores, etc.), vehicles and equipment, which require repair, maintenance and eventual
replacement. Given the prevailing financial situation of the Government, funding is expected to be
insufficient to maintain these facilities and sustain operational activities. The Government can hardly
afford to pay staff salaries currently. Thus the work to design a follow-up project in extension will be
quite a challenging one.
3.10    Project Costs and Financing: At appraisal the total project costs were estimated at US$ 12.6
million, of which, IDA would cover US$ 9.7 million (equivalent to SDR 7.6 million), and the
Government US$ 2.9 million. Project costs have now been re-estimated at US$ 5.1 million. The countryl
and project circumstances as described in paragraph 3.01 explain this reduction. At mid-term in FY 1991
only US$ 3.7 million had been disbursed, i.e., almost half of the SAR estimate of US$ 7.1 million.
Disbursement continued to remain behind schedule and in 1992 the Borrower requested an extension of
the project closing date by one year from June 30, 1993 to June 30, 1994. In spite of this extension total
disbursement amounted to only US$ 4.7 million, equivalent to SDR 3.4 million. The remaining balance
of SDR 4.2 million, or about 55% of the credit, had to be cancelled with effect from October 1994.
3.11    Disbursement for buildings, vehicles and equipment reached 66%, 25%, and 55% of the
planned allocation respectively. The unit cost of many items exceeded the SAR estimates by over 100%,
e.g. in the civil works program the cost of housing for a manager, which had been originally estimated at
CFAF 4.35 million, reached CFAF 9.35 million, and the cost of a warehouse had increased from CFAF
0.43 to 1.41 million. Quantitatively, most of the construction targets were not achieved, i.e. training
centers (7 planned/O built); housing for extensionists (32/0); village warehouses (125/19); wells (12/0);
drying spaces (12/5); and less than 50% of the vehicles were purchased (see Table 5).
3.12    According to SAR estimates strengthening of extension services would have amounted to 39%
of total project base cost; training and research 13% and 18% respectively, monitoring and evaluation
9%, and introduction of proper financial management 21%. According to the ICR reestimated cost, these
ratios changed to 47%, 10%, 13%, 12% and 18% respectively and showed a shift to more support for
extension services. Also, the GovernmentllDA financing ratio which the SAR had estimated at 23:77,
fell to about 6:94 due to the general financial crisis in Togo.  I

3.13    Performance of the Bank: An Initial Project Brief was issued in March 1985 outlining in
broad terms the overall project objectives, components and financing requirements. Subsequently, with
the assistance of the Agricultural Extension Unit of the Bank's Regional Mission in Western Africa, a
pilot program to introduce and adapt the principles of the T & V system of extension was established and
test activities were initiated in March-April 1986. In April/May project preparation was carried out by a
team of private consultants and appraisal took place in November of the same year. Based on the
extremely limited experience gained from the test activities, the appraisal mission concluded that (a) the
main principles of the T & V system can be adapted to the Togolese context; (b) improved productivity
practices introduced through the extension system have resulted in production increases; and (c) extension
research links can be improved and a considerable number of simple and low risk research results await
transfer to farmers. The project design was formulated on the basis of these assumptions.
3.14    Although the principles of a T & V system were adapted to suit Togolese conditions and some
extension/research linkages established, the assumed doubling or even tripling of yields throughout the
area covered by the T & V system was largely over-optimistic. Furthermore, the appraisal considerably
overestimated the availability of research results suitable for transfer to farmers. The dearth of extension
messages in later years resulted in a considerable decrease in contact farmers.
3.15    IDA carried out 12 full supervision missions, including the mid-term review mission in June
1991 and two technical missions to review the research and development component (April 1989) and the
financial and accounting aspects (June 1989). This is considered adequate. However, because of a lack of
continuity in the staffing of supervision missions, recommendations from the missions were not always
consistent.
3.16    The unclear definition of project management functions caused delays in project start-up and
subsequent implementation. Although the Bank was aware of this problem at an early stage and
successive supervision missions made precise recommendations on how to resolve it, no corrective action
was taken by the Government.
3.17    One of the main project activities was to establish a monitoring and evaluation system.
However, even in the last project year there was no adequate system in place to monitor the key
indicators for project implementation and operation, neither has a comprehensive system been introduced
to assess the project's impact on production. These facts were known to IDA at an early stage of
implementation and the Government should have been urged to take corrective actions at that stage.
3.18    IDA should have reacted early (by 1992) to the serious shortfall in counterpart financing,
possibly by increasing IDA's share in operating cost, which would have allowed the continuation of field
operations at more meaningful levels.
3.19    Borrower's Performance: The Borrower's performance during project implementation was
not satisfactory. Initial weaknesses in project management/co-ordination led to serious delays in project
start-up. The Borrower also failed to comply with critical legal covenants. In particular, it did not
replenish the project account for local counterpart funds on a regular basis and in adequate amounts,
thereby seriously affecting project implementation. Furthermore, work programs and budgets were



7
submitted with considerable delays and not all audit reports were satisfactory. Of the two studies to be
carried out by December 1988 and December 1989 (stipulated in section 3.02 of the Development Credit
Agreement) and subsequently extended to June 1992, one is now available but the other has not been
carried out.
3.21    In the last year of the project the Borrower showed improvement in preparing bidding
documents and work programs and budgets. In adherence with the legal covenants, it employed Togolese
nationals of high calibre as heads of DCV, DAF and DRDR's and designated well-qualified counterparts
to the TA specialists
3.21     Assessment of Project Outcome: The overall outcome of the project has been
unsatisfactory. The reorganizing and strengthening of MDR's agricultural extension services has barely
made any advancement. The DRDRs are still not in a position to:
(a) establish and adopt a time-bound and supervised work program;
(b) regularly and continuously train staff at all levels; and
(c) strengthen the links with research.
Furthermore, monitoring and evaluation remains weak and sporadic. As a result, the impact
of the project on agricultural productivity and living conditions at village level is difficult to assess but is
most likely negligible as an analysis of agricultural production statistics does not show any changes in
agricultural productivity during the project period.
4. Future Operations
4.01    The Government does not intend to continue the PVA activities in their present form. An
ongoing FAO project (FAO/TCP/TOG/4451) is assisting the Government in the preparation of a
restructuring plan for agricultural institutions ("Preparation du Plan de restructuration des
institutions rurales, PRIR") which would form the basis of a new project. It would take into
consideration the lessons learnt from the PVA. The Government intends to request financing of this
project from the Bank and other donors.



8
4.02   Key Lessons Learned: The main lessons learnt from the project are:
(a)   in agricultural extension, the availability of adequate and timely operating funds is
critical to the success of technology adaptation and dissemination processes which are
linked to time-based activities dependent on climatic considerations; consequently    i
there has to be a conservative assessment of the Government's ability to meet its
financial obligations under the project and the Bank has to be more responsive to
increasing its share of financing of operating costs;
(b)   project management responsibilities must be clearly defined and detailed from the
onset of the project to facilitate working relationships and coordination between
units;
(c)   implementation of technology dissemination processes cannot be done in isolation
of availability of farm inputs, market demand and accessibility, and producer credit;
(d)   although the Borrower has the ultimate responsibility for the selection of TA staff,
''no objection" to the selection should only be given after a thorough review of
qualifications, experience and skills;
(e)   staffing of Bank supervision missions should give importance to continuity;
(f)   an extension system  must respond to local environmental, technical and socio-
economic conditions and evolve accordingly.

COMMENTS ON CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS
No adverse comments on contractors' performance have arisen. However, the
performance of expatriate consultants has been criticized by the Borrower and in one
case the Bank agreed to the early termination of the contract.

PROJET DE VULGARISATION AGRICOLE
MISSION DE SUPERVISION
20 - 23 DECEMBRE 1993
AIDE MEMOIRE
1.            La mission dirigee par Monsieur Christian Fauliau (mission residente Abidjan) assiste
de Monsieur Kofi Egbeto (mission residente Lomrn) visait a faire le point sur l'evaluation du Projet de
Vulgarisation Agricole (PVA).
2.            La mission tient a remercier les cadres techniques Togolais pour leur disponibilite et
leur participation effective aux travaux dans un contexte general difficile.
SITUATION GENERALE DU PVA
3.            Ce projet 6tant execute par une structure administrative a e  handicap6 par les
differents evenements intervenus au cours de l'annee 1993 (longue greve et retard prolonge dans le
paiement des salaires des fonctionnaires), consequence d'une profonde crise financiere de l'Etat qui
n'a pas non plus mis a disposition les fonds prevus pour les investissements et le fonctionnement des
projets.
4.            Pendant cette ann6e 1993, les equipes de terrain ont donc fonctionne avec des moyens
reduits et quelques fois dans des conditions de securite qui limitaient les deplacements. Le dispositif
de terrain a e  tres serieusement destabilises par des abandons de poste ou des mutations peu
preparees. Le travail de contact avec les paysans prenant syst6matiquement une connotation politique
consideree comnme partisane dans un sens ou dans l'autre a du etre tres souvent interrompu ou
abandonn6. En bref, le programme s'est trouv6 quasiment bloque n'offrant que quelques opportunites
de travail ponctuelles, volontaristes et individualises. Meme la formation de perfectionnement des
cadres de terrain a Lome a dO Wtre suspendue pour cette annee.
5.            La perspective de la cl6ture du projet en juin 1994 ajout6e au d6lai indispensable a la
remise a flot des finances publiques permettant un reel soutien a ce type de projet impose une analyse
realiste de la situation. 11 s'agit maintenant beaucoup plus de maintenir les acquis du PVA dans la
perspective de servir de base a un futur projet d'appui a des services agricoles restructures en fonction
des realites actuelles du pays. Dans ce sens, la cloture du PVA en juin 1994 devrait s'accompagner
d'une acceleration de la preparation de ce futur projet.
6.            Dans l'immediat, il serait peu realiste de relancer un PVA dont le financement externe
s'arreterait dans 4 mois et dont le financement national ne serait pas encore garanti. II apparait
souhaitable que les cadres techniques du PVA approfondissent le travail theorique entrepris pendant
l'annee 93 (voir Annexe A) pour mieux preparer les bases du futur projet.
7.            Des op6rations de formation ponctuelle visant a satisfaire des besoins clairement
identifies de certains paysans, ou de renforcement des competences des cadres nationaux telles que
decrites dans l'Annexe B pourront etre engagees jusqu'au 30 juin 1994 date de cl6ture du projet.

ASPECTS BUDGETAIRES
8.            L'une des faiblesses du Projet a ete pendant longtemps l'absence d'un budget bati
autour d'un programme coherent et detaille d'activites avec un calendrier d'execution. Les missions
de supervision pr6cedentes ont attire l'attention des Responsables sur la necessite pour le Projet de
disposer chaque annee d'un tel budget. La Mission a constate avec satisfaction la mise en application
progressive de ces recommandations. Sous les auspices de la DAF, un manuel de procedures
budgetaires a ete elabore pour I'ensemble du Ministbre.
9.            La procedure de budgetisation pour ce qui est du PVA se resume comme suit: dans
une premiere phase, Chaque Responsable Technique Central du Projet envoie aux Regions, les
grandes actions prioritaires a budgetiser. Dans la deuxieme phase, les Directions Regionales
confectionnent les budgets en fonction des orientations prealablement definies et les font parvenir a la
Direction du Projet. Chaque Responsable Technique emet des avis qui font l'objet d'arbitrage entre
les Directeurs Regionaux et la Direction du Projet, puis etablit son plan de travail en fonction du
budget regional qui lui est soumis. Apres l'arbitrage technique, intervient le DAF pour la
consolidation financiere.
10.           Dans ce processus, on constate que la participation des Responsables Techniques
Centraux n'est pas active notamment dans l'elaboration des budgets issus des Regions. On constate
egalement que le DAF n'intervient qu'au dernier moment pour faire l'arbitrage financier en fonction
des reliquats sur les categories du Projet. Dans le cadre d'un projet qui a des objectifs et des
composantes clairement definis, un personnel adapte a son fonctionnement, un financement approprie
a sa duree de vie et un cadre d'execution bien precis, un tel schema budgetaire, pourrait engendrer
des distorsions tant au niveau central que regional et c'est le cas du PVA.
11.           La pratique actuelle en matiere de budget pourrait etre am6lioree en impliquant de
maniere active les Responsables Techniques Centraux dans la confection du budget au niveau regional
et en portant a temps a la connaissance des Responsables Centraux ainsi que de ceux des regions, les
contraintes financieres du Projet. Dans cette optique, la demarche pourrait etre la suivante:
Phase 1       Concertation DAF/Responsables Techniques centraux. L'avantage de cette
concertation est qu'avant le declenchement du processus budgetaire, les cadres
techniques sont sensibilis6s aux contraintes financieres du Projet et ont une
idee plus precise de 1'enveloppe financiere qui pourra etre affectee a leurs
operations sur le terrain. Cette demarche presente I'interet de permettre aux
cadres techniques de definir les activites prioritaires dans le cadre des
contraintes budgetaires fixees et d'alleger la tAche du DAF au moment de la
consolidation financiere. Cette demarche est conseillee pour favoriser un reel
travail d'equipe.
Phase 2       Definition des grandes orientations sectorielles par chaque Responsable
Technique en fonction des besoins de chaque region. Ces orientations doivent
etre envoyees aux Directions Regionales du Developpement Rural comme cela
se fait maintenant, mais avec une proposition de calendrier de seance de
travail pour l1'laboration de budgets sectoriels.
Phase 3       Elaboration de budgets sectoriels au niveau regional avec la participation
effective du Responsable Technique Central. Pour eviter la lourdeur et le

blocage de travail dans les Directions Regionales, il ne devrait pas y avoir
plus de deux cadres techniques centraux a la fois. Les propositions du
responsable regional doivent etre le resultat de seances de travail prealable
tenues avec ses cadres de terrain qui eux-mames doivent transmettre les
besoins reels des paysans qu'ils encadrent. Le rOle du Responsable est surtout
d'assister son correspondant regional et toute la division regionale concernee a
elaborer le budget qui doit Wtre tres detaille et contenir un calendrier
d'execution avec des indicateurs techniques verifiables. 11 devra etre egalement
chiffre avec l'aide du DAF regional. 11 convient de noter que les propositions
du Responsable Regional doivent etre le resultat de seances de travail
prealable tenues avec ses cadres de terrain qui eux-memes doivent transmettre
les besoins r6els des paysans qu'ils encadrent. Le Directeur R6gional est
regulierement tenu inform6 du deroulement des travaux. Une reunion de
synthese devra etre prevue avec ce dernier pour harmoniser les points de vue.
Cette collaboration etroite entre les Regions et le niveau central a un effet
positif sur l'execution du projet en ce sens que les hommes se connaissent
mieux et que le projet s'execute dans un cadre plus consensuel.
Phase 4       Consolidation sectorielle et regionale. Chaque Responsable Technique Central
apres la phase 3, procede a son niveau a une consolidation regionale, puis
definit son plan de travail detailIl en fonction des besoins sur le terrain.
Phase 5       Consolidation technique et financiere. Les budgets sectoriels regionaux ainsi
que les plans de travail des Responsables Techniques Centraux sont soumis au
Directeur General du Developpement Rural et au Directeur du Projet. Si un
changement devait intervenir au niveau d'une region donnee, le Directeur
regional ainsi que son collaborateur concerne doivent en etre tenus informrs
dans les plus brefs delais. Lorsque les plans de travail detailles des
Responsables sont acceptes, le DAF procede a leur evaluation financiere.
Phase 6       Une seance pl6nibre s'avere necessaire pour que toute I'Equipe du Projet soit
informee du plan d'activite global et des engagements financiers au cours de
1'exercice.
Phase 7       Consolidation financiere globaleNVersion definitive du document de budget par
la DAF.
12.           Ce canevas budgetaire propose, bien que n'ayant pas une chance d'application
imrnediate dans le cadre du PVA en raison du fait qu'il prend fin en juin 94 et que le budget 94 a ete
deja e1abore, pourra atre tres utile a la reflexion concernant le projet qui succedera au PVA.
13.           Concernant le budget 94, la derniere mission de supervision avait, en accord avec la
Direction du PVA, defini les operations a financer jusqu'en juin 94 en tenant compte des difficultes
socio-economiques que vit le pays et qui ne favorisent pas l'ex6cution normale du Projet. En bref, il
s'agit d'un budget qui vise a maintenir les acquis du PVA en mettant un accent particulier sur la
formation des cadres au detriment des investissements en equipements dont l'utilisation immediate
n'est pas garantie.

14.           Suite a la devaluation du FCFA, une restructuration du portefeuille des projets au
Togo est envisagee. Dans ce cadre, la cloture du PVA prevue en juin 94 sera maintenue et la
preparation d'un projet de restructuration des services agricoles acc6l&r6e. Une modification de la cle
de financement en cours est envisageable ; elle dependra du resultat des negociations entre la Banque
Mondiale et le Gouvernement Togolais qui devraient avoir lieu en mars 94.
COMPTE SPECIAL, SOEs
15.           La Mission a constate avec satisfaction que les recommandations des missions de
supervision pr6c6dentes sur le fonctionnement du compte special ont ete suivies. Ceci a permis
d'avoir un taux nul de rejet des DRFs depuis mars 92. Le classement des pieces justificatives est
satisfaisant et sur chacune d'elle est marque le pourcentage des charges supportees par l'IDA facilitant
ainsi le controle. C'est un acquis pour le futur projet. La position du DAFIDGDR a permis au Projet
de satisfaire a la cle de repartition en pre-financant la contrepartie togolaise qui fait defaut par
d'autres sources de fonds a la disposition de la Direction Generale du Developpement Rural-DGDR-.
AUDIT DES ETATS FINANCIERS, DU COMPTE SPECIAL ET DES ETATS CERTIFIES
DES DEPENSES
16.           Les etats financiers audites de 1'exercice 92, n'appellent pas de commentaires
particuliers. La Mission a revu avec le DAF, les recommandations des Auditeurs qui portent sur la
nacessite pour le Projet de disposer
-      d'un outil de gestion/suivi budgetaire
-      d'une comptabilite analytique
-      d'une Cellule de controle de gestion et d'audit interne
-      d'un manuel de procedure comptable (a actualiser)
-      d'un outil informatique pour la gestion des immobilisations dans les regions
-      d'un logiciel de gestion comptable multi-entites
d'une consolidation des etats financiers (DRDRs et PVA) afin d'eviter des circuits
parallles.
17.           Etant donn6 la fin du Projet en juin 94, la mise en place effective de ces
recommandations s'avere tres difficile. Par contre, elles pourraient Wtre prises en compte aisement
dans le cadre du futur Projet "Appui aux Services Agricoles".

FINAL REPORT
(Summary)
(Translation From the French Original)
May 1995

I.    THE AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
The Agricultural Extension Project financed jointly by the World Bank and the
Togolese Government was negotiated in 1987 and culminated in Credit Agreement No.
1808-TO, signed on July 17, 1987.
Over a four-year period, the Project sought to:
- improve the efficiency of the agricultural extension system
- help boost the productivity of foodcrops and farm income.
The Project was carried out in four economic regions of Togo and was to cover
20 to 30% of the country's rural dwellers, representing the most disadvantaged segment,
seeking to increase foodcrop production and productivity through the use of improved
techniques and to generate additional income.
Project components were as follows:  extension services; research and
development; training, monitoring and evaluation, financial management and technical
assistance.
1.1   RESULTS AND STRENGTHS
Project results must be sustained and consolidated.
(a)   From the organizational standpoint: The structure of all support services
from the base to the top of the organizational pyramid was standardized;
(b)   From the technical standpoint: Greater awareness of the real role that
extension services should play vis-a-vis small farmers and in the various
agricultural or rural development philosophies. The potential increase in
farmer yields were 140% for maize; 25% for sorghum; 60% for rice, 80%
for cowpeas, 114% for groundnuts and 86% for cassava;
(c)   Training:  Major efforts were expended in the training of extension
officials and agents, as well as small farmers;
(d)   Research and development:  Small farmers were introduced to the
agricultural research process;
(e)   Monitoring and evaluation:  Long considered to be controlling and
repressive by extension officials, this component was gradually
demystified and accepted by all;



30
(f)   From the financial standpoint:  56.13%  of the Credit was utilized,
excluding the unallocated component, and 46.06% including that
component, in relation to the overall amount of the Credit at December 5,
1994.
1.2   PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES
Project operations suffered greatly from the poor design of the institutional
aspects.
Because the Project had no human resource management policy to maintain
motivation, it lacked stability.
Local personnel did not prove competent in their duties to maintain operations,
as envisaged by Project design.
II.   NEW AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
Agriculture is still key to Togo's economic growth, but its expansion has been
constrained by demographic growth, difficulties relating to the agricultural context and
the current performance of support services.
Agricultural development priorities consequently center on:
-     greater small farmer accountability to prevent risks linked to
current public services;
-     enhancement of the country's human and natural agricultural
production potential;
-     improvement in the extension environment through the adoption of
an agricultural and rural credit policy, the supply of inputs and the
marketing of agricultural projects;
-     the more sustainable exploitation of ecosystems;
-     diversification of production and higher productivity;
-     reorganization and regionalization of agricultural services;
-     agricultural legislation and regulations
