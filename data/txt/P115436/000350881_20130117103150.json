moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, and both the Bank and the borrower performance\n            were moderately satisfactory. Some important project lessons\n            learned were: (1) Teams should make sure that governments\n            and the GPE are aware of the implications choices made with\n            regards to options offered by the Bank. Retaining the same\n            number of classrooms in the project after the decision to\n            include taxes suggests that the government was not aware\n            that the amount of financing would not be increased to\n            include taxes. (2) Prepare communities properly if they are\n            to participate in school construction. Some of the schools\n            in the project were not completed because not all\n            communities were aware that they should provide the windows\n            and doors and finish the buildings and did not know details\n            related to their contribution. (3) Community based approach\n            to construction should be adopted in difficult to reach\n            areas. Construction of classrooms in some areas had to be\n            abandoned because contractors were unwilling to work in\n            these areas when the security situation had deteriorated.\n            (4) Limit project area coverage when resources are limited.\n            When project inputs are limited investments should be\n            concentrated in a limited area to reduce supervision costs.\n            (5) Addressing girls' education requires attention to\n            various constraints to their participation and the potential\n            impact of this new approach to promote girls\u0092 education\n            should be explored further. Advocacy for increasing\n            participation of girls in school should be combined with\n            other interventions which address the economic and security\n            issues which constrain access. The provision of cash prizes\n            to families with the best performing girls helped reduce\n            household costs and promote retention and should be further\n            studied. (6) Construction of latrines is not sufficient for\n            promoting girls' education. Provision of good\n            sanitation in school to increase girls' enrollment\n            should not be limited to provision of latrines but should be\n            part of a package that facilitates proper use and\n            maintenance of the latrines and an awareness program."}, "docdt": "2013-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
