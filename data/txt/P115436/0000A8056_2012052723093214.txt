                         Program Development Objectives: The development objective of the Basic Education Support Project (FTI-BESP) is to contribute to the implementation of the Education
                         Sector Program by improving access to better quality primary education. In order to achieve this objective, the project will focus on the three components to: a) increase
                         access and equity in primary education; b) improve quality in primary education; and c) strengthen capacity of the Ministry of Education (MoE), and decentralized
                         entities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is achieving its planned objectives as per the Sector Development Plan. Four project development outcome indicators, out of five, have been surpassed. These include:
                         primary gross enrollment rate (GER), primary GER for rural areas, completion rate and primary pass rate. The gender parity the target has almost been reached (44.2 against 45) and
                         is likely to be attained during the 2011-2012 school year based on preliminary data.

                         Although the indicators cover the whole of the Sector Development Plan, the positive outcomes can be partly attributed to the project. The key features of the project that helped in
                         the achievement of the outcome indicators are the coherent approach to decentralized management (including COGES), targeted interventions to increase female participation and
                         increased transfer of resources to the local level which served as incentives for parents to enroll their children in school. Despite the difficult political context, all the planned

                         classrooms in Niamey were built and about 77% of the planned regular classrooms for the rural areas have been completed. COGES were also more intensively involved in school
                         management and teacher training was partly decentralized to the school level. Over 3100 teachers have been provided with pre and in-service training. All of this provided a positive
                         atmosphere at the local level and built confidence that further improvements would occur. The key capacity/institutional change was the expansion and institutionalization of the
                         COGES which resulted in increased efficiency and lower actual unit costs of implementation for most of the components than appraisal estimates. The reduced number of
                         classrooms built was due to the inclusion of taxes of about 25% in contract prices although this had not been assessed at appraisal.
