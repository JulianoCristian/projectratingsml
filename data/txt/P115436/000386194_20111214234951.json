In order to achieve this objective, the project\n            will focus on the following tree specific objectives: (i)\n            increase access and equity in primary education; (ii)\n            improve quality in primary education; and (iii) strengthen\n            the capacity of the Ministry of Education (MoE), and\n            decentralized entities. The original grant was in the amount\n            of US$8.0 million and approved on October 15, 2009. The\n            purpose of this extension request is to allow for completion\n            of (i) the construction program; and (ii) other ongoing\n            activities necessary to achieve Project objectives. The\n            extension is necessary to complete activities critical for\n            attaining the Project Development Objective (PDO) and for\n            improving access to and the quality of education in Niger\n            under implementation: (i) the construction of 314 classrooms\n            (including the construction of several latrine facilities\n            where necessary) and the corresponding acquisition of\n            classroom furniture (student desks and tables); and (ii) the\n            acquisition of 958,000 textbooks and 31,000 teacher guides\n            for grades 3-6. The implementation of these activities was\n            initially delayed due to weak procurement capacity and the\n            lack of the necessary key experts, but these issues have\n            been resolved and the implementation of these activities is\n            making good progress. The reallocation is necessary to\n            compensate for the higher than initially estimated costs of\n            the civil works activities, i.e. classroom construction. In\n            addition, while the execution of the construction program\n            was carried out in accordance which the grant agreement\n            which includes value added tax, the cost estimate of the\n            construction program did not include value added tax."}, "docdt": "2011-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
