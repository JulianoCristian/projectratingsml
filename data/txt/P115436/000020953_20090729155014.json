In\n            order to achieve this objective, the project will focus on\n            the three components to: a) increase access and equity in\n            primary education; b) improve quality in primary education;\n            and c) strengthen capacity of the Ministry of Education\n            (MoE), and decentralized entities. The aim of the present\n            study is to evaluate the social and environmental\n            consequences of the second stage activities particularly\n            concerning the activities of the classroom building and the\n            setting up of the toilets and to define the measures of\n            attenuation, monitoring as well as the institutional\n            measures to be taken in order to eliminate or attenuate the\n            unfavourable environmental and social impacts. The extent of\n            the environmental and social measures required for the\n            project activities will depend on the results of the\n            selection process. This selection process aims to: (i)\n            determine the Basic Education Support Project (BESP) actions\n            susceptible  to get negative impacts at environmental and\n            social level, (ii) determine the adequate attenuation\n            measures for the activities having detrimental impacts,\n            (iii) identify the activities necessitating simple\n            attenuation measures or simplified environmental and social\n            impact study, (iv) describe  the institutional\n            responsibilities for the analysis and approval of the\n            selection results, the implementation of the suggested\n            attenuation measures and the preparation of the\n            environmental impact study , (v) ensure the monitoring of\n            the  environmental parameters during the project\n            implementation. The project will generally have positive\n            impacts concerning the access to a qualitative basic\n            education, at socio-economic plan and even at  biophysical\n            plan through the improvement of the primary schooling rate,\n            the reduction of the repeating rate, a better access to\n            school furniture, the capacity reinforcement of the teaching\n            staff and the Ministry of the national education, the\n            improvement of the school population welfare and the\n            environmental protection through the improvement of the\n            sanitation conditions and the maintenance works of the\n            facilities set up. Negative impacts of a weak to moderate\n            intensity will equally be observed during the building and\n            exploitation of the facilities (classrooms, toilets, etc.).\n            They include the degradation of sites and quarries, the\n            destruction of the ground cover, relative loss of\n            biodiversity, the pollution of the excavations left by the\n            quarries  especially during the rainy season, the erosion of\n            the borrowed sites, the site waste management, the social\n            conflicts related to the choice of the sites, the eventual\n            dislocation of the populations ; etc. but, most of these\n            negative impacts are attenuated with the implementation of\n            an environmental and social management plan (ESMP) which has\n            been developed in the framework of this study."}, "docdt": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
