                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Program Development Objectives: The development objective of the Basic Education Support Project (FTI-BESP) is to contribute to the implementation of the
                         Education Sector Program by improving access to better quality primary education. In order to achieve this objective, the project will focus on the three
                         components to: a) increase access and equity in primary education; b) improve quality in primary education; and c) strengthen capacity of the Ministry of
                         Education (MoE), and decentralized entities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making sound progress toward its planned objectives. Target indicators for the academic year 2010/2011 are on track as shown by the list of indicators. However, the
                         closing date of the project was extended by 6 months, from November 30, 2011 to May31, 2012 due to delays in the implementation of the school construction program and of the
                         textbook acquisition and distribution. These implementation issues have been addressed and will allow for the completion of all project activities within the extended project period.

                         Several project development indicators that have been met or surpassed, these include: primary gross enrollment rate (GER), primary GER for rural areas, completion rate, and
                         primary pass rate. The gender parity index for primary in 2010-2011 is 44%, just slightly below the goal of 45%. Based on these achievements, the PDO rating was maintained as
                         satisfactory.
