                         Implementation Status Overview
                          The project is making sound progress toward its planned objectives. Target indicators for the academic year 2009/2010 are on track as shown by the list of indicators. The
                         implementation issues mentioned in the previous ISR which delayed project activities have been addressed and largely resolved. Several project development indicators that have
                         been met or surpassed, these include: primary gross enrollment rate (GER), primary GER for rural areas, gender parity index for primary, primary pass rate. The completion rate in
                         2010 was 49.3% just slightly below the goal of 50%. As a result of these considerable achievements, the PDO rating was increased from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory.
