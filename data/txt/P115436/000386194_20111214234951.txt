                                      ANNEX 1:

                         Extension of Closing Date
1.      The closing date for the Niger EFA-FTI Basic Education Project, Grant No.
TF94742, P115436, will be extended by six months, from November 30, 2011 until May
31, 2012. The original grant was in the amount of US$8.0 million and approved on
October 15, 2009. The purpose of this extension request is to allow for completion of (i)
the construction program; and (ii) other ongoing activities necessary to achieve Project
objectives.

2.      In spite of some implementation delays at the onset of the project, which have
since then been resolved, the project has been making substantial progress over the past
year, increasing disbursement from 47 percent in February 2011 to 66 percent as of
September 29, 2011, with major further commitments expected to be disbursed within the
next month, and is on track to achieve 100 percent disbursement if granted an extension.
The PDO indicators have been achieved or surpassed, with only one indicator, primary
completion rate, being very close to achievement, currently at 49.3 percent with a target
of 50.0 percent. More specifically, the project’s accomplishments consist of three of the
five PDO indicators surpassing their target values, notably: (i) the total primary gross
enrolment rate increased from 62 percent to 72.9 percent (target 70.0 percent); (ii) the
rural primary gross enrolment rate improved from 58.9 to 70.3 percent (target 67.0
percent); and (iii) the gender parity index from 42.7 to 58.6 (target 45.0).

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to complete activities critical for attaining
the PDO and for improving access to and the quality of education in Niger under
implementation: (i) the construction of 314 classrooms (including the construction of
several latrine facilities where necessary) and the corresponding acquisition of classroom
furniture (student desks and tables); and (ii) the acquisition of 958,000 textbooks and
31,000 teacher guides for grades 3-6. The implementation of these activities was initially
delayed due to weak procurement capacity and the lack of the necessary key experts, but
these issues have been resolved and the implementation of these activities is making good
progress. Regarding classroom construction activities, in a first phase, 242 classrooms are
being constructed and are currently in various stages of completion (varying from 95
percent completion to below 20 percent). In a second and final phase of the construction
activities, 72 classrooms are to be delivered. Contracts with construction firms are
currently being signed and the completion of all classrooms is expected for February

                                            4
2012. The acquisition of the textbooks is expected to be completed by end November
2011.

4.     An extension of the closing date would ensure the completion of those activities
and the achievement of the PDOs. The government provided a revised action plan (see
annex 2) to allow for completion of the ongoing activities in an orderly manner.

5.     The financial audits are planned for 2011 and 2012. The audit reports and
management letters are expected at the Bank by June 30, 2012 for the 2011 reports and
by June 2013 for the 2012 reports. The terms of reference for the external auditor will be
amended to cover the audit for the extended period.

6.      The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on closing dates.
The OP requires that (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the
performance of the Recipient and other project implementing agencies be satisfactory;
and (iii) the Recipient prepare a specific action plan acceptable to IDA to complete the
remaining activities under the project. This will be the first extension of the project.

2.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to compensate for the higher than initially
estimated costs of the civil works activities, i.e. classroom construction due to significant
fluctuations in the USD-FCFA exchange rate. In addition, while the execution of the
construction program was carried out in accordance which the Grant agreement which
includes value added tax, the cost estimate of the construction program did not include
value added tax. This resulted in an underestimated cost of the construction program.
Furthermore, the costs of materials for classroom construction and furniture increased
considerably.
