This is t h e Completion Report on t h e Second Rural Development
P r o j e c t i n Paraguay (Loan 1418-PA),            f o r which a loan of USS22.0
m i l l i o n w a s approved on May 10, 1977.              The l e g a l documents were
signed on May 18, 1977 and t h e p r o j e c t became e f f e c t i v e on
January 17, 1978.             The o r i g i n a l closing d a t e f o r t h e loan was
December 31, 1981.            Two extensions were granted, and t h e f i n a l
closing d a t e was December 31, 1984.                 However, disbursements were
authorized f o r a p p l i c a t i o n s s e n t t o t h e Bank before June 30, 1985.
About USS21.9 m i l l i o n of t h e loan was disbursed, and US$41,644.98
w a s cancelled.

The p r o j e c t was t h e second Bank-financed r u r a l development and
c r e d i t operation f o r small-scale farmers.               The f i r s t r u r a l develop-
ment loan, IDA Credit 509-PA (US$11.0 million), was completed
December 30, 1980.             It financed rural development i n three public
smallholder settlements i n t h e e a s t e r n region of Paraguay:
Mallorquin, Repatriation, and General Stroessner.                          The second Rural
Development Project was aimed mainly at helping small farmers i n
newly developing settlements along t h e Parana River i n t h e south
e a s t e r n p a r t of t h e Itapua department.

This r e p o r t was prepared by Pgriculture Division A of the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of a country
v i s i t i n November 1985 and a Completion Report prepared by t h e
technical cabinet of t h e Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
(MAG),       delivered t o t h e Bank on January 10, 1985.                 Other sources of
information f o r t h e Completion Report were the Appraisal Report
No. 1448-PA dated April 12, 1977; the Project Loan Agreement
No. 77-100-PA dated May 18, 1977; supervision reports; correspon-
dence with t h e Borrower; and i n t e r n a l Bank memoranda as contained
i n relevant Bank f i l e s .          Following a review by OED, it w a s decided
not t o a u d i t t h e p r o j e c t , and the PCR was s e n t t o the Borrower f o r
comments i n October 1986.               The Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock (MAG)         and t h e National Office f o r the Coordination of
Rural Development P r o j e c t s (ONCP), provided comments.                    However, no
modifications of t h e t e x t of the r e p o r t were required.                  The ONCP
requested t h a t d e t a i l e d information r e s u l t i n g from t h e implementa-
t i o n of Loan 1418-PA be made a v a i l a b l e t o them t o improve t h e
implementation of ongoing Loans 2141-PA and 2087-PA.                           This request
w i l l be met during t h e Bank's supervision of those projects.

                                       PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

                                               Highlights

The Project

1.            This project was t h e Second Rural Development Project financed by
t h e Bank i n Paraguay.            The main objectives of t h e project were to:
(a) increase mainly small-farmers (20 ha o r l e s s ) incomes, (b) expand t h e
area cultivated, (c) strengthen t h e regional o f f i c e s of t h e National Develop-
ment Bank (BNF), National Council For Social Progress (CNSP), Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock, and t h e Ministry of Public Health (MSPBS).                     The
project included short and medium c r e d i t ; construction of a road network;
construction and upgrading of health centers and posts; construction of two
community centers; purchase of vehicles and equipment and operational
expenses f o r t h e Project Coordination Unit.


Implementation Experience

2.            The overall project objectives of increasing income, a g r i c u l t u r e
productive capacity, and improving i n f r a s t r u c t u r e and project administration
have been s a t i s f a c t o r i l y accomplished.  The supervised c r e d i t program
successfully a s s i s t e d small farmers i n increasing t h e i r cropping a r e a and
diversifying i n t o cash crops such a s soybeans and wheat.               The road component
has given access t o markets f o r t h e i r a g r i c u l t u r a l surplus t o even t h e most
remote settlers i n the project area, and permitted a reduction i n the costs
of transport (para. 7.01).               There was however, delay i n implementing t h e
project.      Despite t h e delay, project objectives were achieved, and there was
no cost over-run.

Results

3.            One of the most important s t r a t e g i e s of the project was t o help new
and existing s e t t l e r s increase other cultivated area and together with
improved technology, increase a g r i c u l t u r a l production.         This strategy was
successfully implemented with the support of the projects c r e d i t and road
construction components.               The cropped areas of soybeans, wheat, maize and
cassava increased a s did t h e y i e l d s of these crops (paras. 6.01-02).              The
c r e d i t component did not meet t h e appraisal expectations of providing 90% of
its loans t o small farmers (10-20 has) instead about 70% of subloans were t o
small farmers.        This was, i n p a r t , due t o delays i n processing land t i t l e s
f o r small farmers (para. 3.05).             The economic r a t e of return over 30 years,
is estimated t o be about 31% compared t o appraisal estimate of 14%.

The higher ERR a t project completion can be a t t r i b u t e d to: ( i ) the c r e d i t
component w a s granted t o a reduced number of l a r g e r , more e f f i c i e n t farms;
( i i ) higher than expected commodity prices; ( i i i ) l a r g e r areas were cleared
per beneficiary; ( i v ) l a r g e r areas were devoted t o annual cash crops;
( v ) higher y i e l d increases i n maize, soybeans, and wheat; and(vi) additional
benefits from mainly the road system i n the form of reduced transport costs
(para. 6.07 )          .
S u s t a i n a b i l i t y

4.                The prospects f o r s u s t a i n a b i l i t y of benefits from individual
project beneficiaries is p a r t i c u l a r l y encouraging f o r the medium s i z e
producer who has d i v e r s i f i e d i n t o perennial crops such a s tung, yerba mate,
and c i t r u s e s (para. 6.04).             The smaller and l a r g e r farmers a r e overly depen-
dent on annual crops and w i l l be subjected t o market prices of inter-
nationally traded commodities of wheat and soybeans both of which, i n t h e
immediate f u t u r e , a r e declining i n value; however, the farmers are responsive
t o incentives, and a r e l i k e l y t o change t h e i r cropping pattern should the
market d i c t a t e t h i s .

Findings and Less ions (Para. 7.02 )

                  The principle lessons from the projects implementation are:

                  l e a s t some of the roads before Board Presentation of the Loan.
                  This would have permitted timely construction of roads and would
                  have avoided delays i n supporting project components dependent on

                  how t o f u l f i l l the e l i g i b i l i t y requirements. The on-lending
                  i n s t i t u t i o n should adapt its loan processing requirements t o the

                                                 I. INTRODUCTION

1.01.              A t project appraisal i n September 1976, GNP per c a p i t a i n Paraguay
was about USS650.             The a g r i c u l t u r a l s e c t o r was t h e major source of n a t i o n a l
income, export earnings and employment.                            The s e c t o r contributed approximately
35% of GDP, 97% of export value (including wood and processed products) and
50% of employment.              The country's population was 2.6 million, 60% l i v e d i n
r u r a l areas.        Paraguay has one of the least densely s e t t l e d r u r a l areas of
Latin America with an average of 6.3 persons per square kilometer.                                  About 65%
of t h e r u r a l population earned less than US$188 per annum and therefore f e l l
within t h e poverty t a r g e t group as defined by t h e Bank at t h e t i m e of
appraisal.

1.02                Since t h e mid-1970s and e a r l y 1980s GNP has expanded, with a GDP
growth rate of about 10%per year.                        I n t h e 19708, land devoted t o crops
expanded rapidly.              Buoyant e x t e r n a l demand and favorable p r i c e s l e d t o
accelerated growth of production, from about 2.5% per annum between 1962 and
1972 t o over 7% per annum between 1972 and 1979.                               Ihring t h e latter period,
production of soybeans and cotton ( p r i n c i p a l export crops) increased by over
20% per annum, while t h a t of corn and cassava ( p r i n c i p a l domestic crops) grew
by about 10%per annum.               Exports of soybeans increased from 12,000 tons i n
1971 t o 334,000 tons i n 1979; cotton exports increased from 2,900 tons t o
about 77,000 tons i n t h e same period.                       Benefits of t h i s growth have 'been
d i s t r i b u t e d widely among t h e r u r a l population, r a i s i n g r u r a l incomes and
lessening urban migration.                 However, t h i s r a t e of growth has slowed, public
revenues have declined, and t h e Government faces severe budgetary problems.
I n f l a t i o n has accelerated and t h e real value of t h e Guaranie has f a l l e n
markedly r e l a t i v e t o t h e US dollar.

1.03               The Government's a g r i c u l t u r a l s t r a t e g y has been t o finance p r o j e c t s
t h a t would increase and improve t h e q u a l i t y of production, improve t h e qual-
i t y of r u r a l l i f e and promote improved use and conservation of n a t u r a l
resources.            These objectives were t o be achieved through increased a v a i l a b i l -
i t y of c r e d i t , building improved roads t o open up new lands and through
improving research and extension.                        The Bank has helped t o support t h i s
s t r a t e g y and has approved f i v e loans, t o t a l i n g USS136.2 million, t o help
finance r u r a l development p r o j e c t s ; most of these operations have benefitted
smallholder farmers.              The f i r s t , IDA 509-PA (USS11.0 million), effective
April 1975, financed t h e USS15.8 million Small Farmer Credit and Rural
Development Project along t h e East-West Highway; t h e second, Loan 1418-PA
(USS22.0 million), which closed December 31, 1984 financed Second Rural
Development Project ; t h e t h i r d , Loan 1674-PA (USS25.0 million) , which closed
June 1985, financed t h e Livestock and Development Project; t h e f o u r t h ,

Loan 2087-PA (USS31.0 million), which was approved January 1982, is financing
the Caazapa Area Development Project; the f i f t h , Loan 2141-PA
(USS22.4 million) , approved May 1982, is financing t h e Eje Norte Kural
Development Project.          The Second Rural Project (Loan 1418-PA), which is the
subject of t h i s Completion Report, supported the Government's a g r i c u l t u r a l
s t r a t e g y through components i n c r e d i t , health, i n s t i t u t i o n a l strengthening, and
road construction.

                       A.   Identification, Preparation and Appraisal

2.01             The project was i d e n t i f i e d i n September 1975 and prepared by April/
May 1976 by FAO/CP.          It was appraised by the Bank i n September/October 1976.

                             B.   Neaot iations and Board A D D ~ O V ~ ~

2.02             Negotiations were held i n Asuncion, from March, 28, t o April 1,
1977.        The loan was approved by t h e Board on May, 10, 1977.                   Questions during
t h e Board presentation included: ( i ) would BNF be able t o f i n d expertise t o
improve its financial management; ( i i ) would BNF become decapitalized i f
farmers could not repay loans; ( i i i ) would BNF and SEAG be a b l e t o provide
extension and farm-planning services t o settlers; ( i v ) were the s o i l s and
land forms i n the project area s u i t a b l e f o r continuous cropping; and (v) was
the economic r a t e of r e t u r n an adequate measure of s o c i a l , ecological and
economic performance f o r t h i s type of project.

                            C.  Project Objectives and Components

2.03             Objectives.   The objectives of t h e project were t o : (a) increase
mainly small-farmers'         (20 ha o r l e s s ) incomes ; (b) expand t h e area
cultivated, ( c ) improve physical and s o c i a l infrastructure i n the project
area; and (d) strengthen t h e regional o f f i c e s of t h e National Development
Bank (BNF) within the project area, National Council f o r Social Programs
(CNPS), Ministry of Agricultural and Livestock, Agricultural Extension
Services (SEAG), and t h e Ministry of Public Health (MSPBS).

2.04             Components.   The Appraisal Report describes two project areas:
Area A centered i n Encarnacion, and Area B centered i n D.                       Robledo and
M.    Otano.      Subsequently, cof inancing by Kreditansalt Fur Wiederauf bau (KFW)
financed the c r e d i t component and supporting a c t i v i t i e s f o r Area A.            The Bank
loan focused on Area B, and financed:                  (a) short- and medium-term c r e d i t ;
(b) construction of a road network; (c) construction on upgrading of health
centers and posts; (d) construction of two community centers; (e) purchase of
vehicles f o r incremental project s t a f f ; and ( f ) equipment and operational
expenses f o r the Project Coordinator, Deputy Coordinator and support s t a f f .

                                D.     Project Cost and Financing

2.05             A t appraisal, t o t a l project c o s t s were estimated a t USS37.8 million
( f o r Area B), of which foreign exchange costs t o be m e t by t h e Bank amounted t o
USS22 million (58%); the Government's contribution was USS14.4 million (38%)

and by farmers, USS1.4 million (4%). The t o t a l cost f o r Area A was USS5
million.         Kreditansalt FGr Wiederaufbau (KFW) contributed the foreign exchange
component of USS2.6 million (52%); the Government contributed USS2.0 million
(39%) and farmers USS0.4 million (9%).

                                     I1I. IMPLEMENTATION

3.01             Introduction.   This chapter compares actual performance of project
Area B (the Bank-funded area of the project) with targets established a t
appraisal.          From the outset, it was planned t h a t the project would be
parallel-financed with KFW taking f u l l responsibility f o r Area A.               However,
because KFW processing was so much behind that of the Bank, the Bank loan was
approved on t h e basis of having both Area A and B i n the project, even though
Bank financing was only provided f o r Area B.            Subsequently KFW financing was
approved (about a year l a t e ) and from t h a t point on the project was vertically
s p l i t with the Bank having f u l l responsibility f o r part B and KFW f u l l respon-
s i b i l i t y f o r Area A. Bank supervision was limited t o part B with supervision
of part A being l e f t t o KFW.      The data i n the PCR r e f e r only t o part B even
though the SAR r e f e r s t o project area A and B.        The analysis of project perfor-
mance i n Area B covers t h e implementation of the different components (credit,
roads, health, community centers, and i n s t i t u t i o n a l strengthening).        It also
includes assessments of project cost, disbursements, procurement, reporting and
auditing, and compliance with loan covenants.              Annex 1 presents a t a b l e of key
performance indicators.

                                 A.  Implementation Schedule

3.02             Effectiveness.   The loan became effective on January 17, 1978, nine
months a f t e r it had been approved by t h e Board.        This was due t o delays i n
Government's review of subsidiary loan agreements and i n the r a t i f i c a t i o n by
the Paraguayan Congress.

3.03              Implementation Period.  According t o appraisal projections, Area B
of the project was expected t o be completed by June 30, 1981 and the Closing
Date t o be December 31, 1981.         Completion was delayed by about 32 months u n t i l
December 31, 1984, due mainly t o i n i t i a l delays i n road design and subsequent
low levels of counterpart funding of construction.

                            B. Implementation of Project Components

3.04             Agricultural Credit.   The t o t a l cost of t h e c r e d i t component,
including farmer contributions (lo%), was estimated a t appraisal t o be USS15.4
million.          This included investments and incremental working c a p i t a l f o r 2,955
farmers.         Of these some 2,690 were expected t o farm 20 hectares o r l e s s , t h e
remaining 265 would operate farms of 20-50 ha.              The c r e d i t component was t o
develop 20,000 ha a t an approximate cost of USS780 per hectare.

3.05             By project completion, the c r e d i t component had cost USS13.8 million
including farmer contributions (10%) and had opened 7,700 hectares through land
clearing and improved 13,700 hectares by destumping.               The lowered cost of t h i s
component compared t o appraisal estimate w a s i n part due t o fewer loans.               The
average t o t a l investment per ha was about USS646.           The National Development

Bank (BNF) made 3,931 loans to approximately 1,431 farmers; of these 979
(68%) were small farms of 10-20 ha and about 452 (32%) were larger farms of
20-50 ha. This contrasts with appraisal estimates of 90% for small farms and
10% for larger farms. The operational credit financed mainly inputs for
annual cropping of soya beans (70%), maize (8%), cotton (6%), wheat (5%) and
other crops 11% (comprising tobacco, cassava and sunflower).  The appraisal
had assumed the following percentages of crops to be financed by the credit
component soybeans (40%), maize (7%), wheat (lo%), cassava (24%), beans (2%)

3.06     At project completion about USS9.7 million (70%) of the value of
subloans were lent to finance investments and about USS2.7 million (20%) were
lent to finance the purchase of agricultural inputs. This closely followed
the appraisal report estimate that 78% of the value of subloans would finance
on-farm investments and 22% would finance inputs. However, investments made
for land clearing estimated at 29% during appraisal, rose to 43%. Investments
in animal traction, estimated during appraisal at 21% were actually only 3%.
Farmers did invest in animal traction, but used informal sources of
financing.

3.07      The implementation of the credit component was successful in provi-
ding medium-term investment credit for land-clearing and destumping. BNF's
procedures for processing this particular type of credit were adequate to
meet beneficiary needs. However, the granting of production or short-term
credit was less successful because BNF and SEAG were slow in processing loans
and it often became necessary for farmers to seek production loans at higher
      .
interest rates from informal sources in order to apply inputs in a timely
manner

3.08      The technical assistance to project beneficiaries was considered an
integral part of the credit component taking as its model the "Program de
Accion Conjunta (PAC)", a system of supervised credit proven in previous
Paraguayan credit programs. BNF subcontracted the services of the National
Extension Services (SEAG) agents to elaborate farm plans for potential
borrowers. This gave the extension agent detailed knowledge of local
farmers' needs and helped in the promotion of improved technology. The
agents of SEAG and BNF also had access to advisors provided under a UNDP
grant for technical assistance to this project. In the earlier stages of the
project this organization proved satisfactory. However, as the demand for
production credit increased, SEAG agents were unable to keep up with the
load. Also farmers' perception of SEAG agents as (BNF) employees, who may
have been more concerned with control than impartial technical recommenda-
tions, limited SEAG effectiveness in promoting improved technologies in the
project area.

3.09     -Roads. The project was to finance construction of a road network
costing USS17.8 million that would bring almost all farmers to within 5 km of
a road. The network was to include 99 km of all-weather paved roads, provi-
ding direct access to the whole area, with about 238 km of feeder earth
roads. Investments were to cover civil works such as land clearing,
drainage, erosion control, culverts, bridges, stone paving, together with
supervision, equipment, and maintenance. Civil works for all-weather roads
was to be done under contract while civil works for earth roads was to be
either under contract or force account.

3.10          Roads constructed under the project corresponded with appraisal
projections.         The estimated cost of road construction a t project completion
was USS18.1 million.         About 150 km of the feeder roads were connected directly
t o the main all-weather road system.

3.11          Road construction was t o begin i n 1978 and be completed i n three
years.     However, construction began i n l a t e 1980 and was completed by June 30,
1985.     Two factors accounted f o r t h i s delay: (1) the hiring of designand
construction engineers from Pre-Investment Studies (Loan 587-PA) was delayed
u n t i l 1980; and (11) the low level of Government counterpart funding.            The
f i r s t 38 km section of asphalt paved road was completed January 1984 with the
remaining gravel surfaced all-weather roads being completed by mid 1985.                 The
construction of 238 km feeder roads was completed i n December 1983.             These
delays i n road construction were partially responsible f o r low levels of credit
processing due t o poor access t o isolated project areas.           The maintenance of
the project roads was carried out by the Ministry of Public Works and Communi-
cations (MOPC) under force account and was adequate during the e a r l i e r project
stages.     However, by project completion some earth-feeder roads could not be
adequately maintained due t o lower levels of counterpart funds.

3.12           Health.     The project was t o develop, a t a cost of US$l. 1 million, a
rural health services delivery system, based on community organization and
auxiliary personnel.          The program t o be implemented by the MSPBS was t o stress-
environmental sanitation, communicable disease control, health and nutrition
education, a s w e l l a s family planning mother and child health.         In order t o
carry out the above program the project was t o finance construction and equip-
ment of eight community health posts, two new health centers, and upgrading two
existing centers.          Funding for operational costs, including s t a f f and training
expenses, were t o be provided during the project, a f t e r which the Government
was t o be responsible f o r maintaining the f a c i l i t i e s .

3.13           A t project completion, construction and equipment of health centers
and s a t e l l i t e health posts had been completed f o r an estimated cost of USS0.5        -
million (para. 3.16).          The component was successful i n bringing considerable
improvement t o the health services i n the area.          One of the major accomplish-
ments was i n preventive health care i n particular the prophylactic vaccination
against diphtheria, polio, tuberculosis and measles.              Health information cam-
paigns f o r project beneficiaries on prevention of internal parasites and diar-
rhea control lead t o a decrease i n mortality from diarrhea-related illness.
The component also provided training f o r health professionals assigned t o
health posts and centers constructed i n the project area.             Three one-year
courses i n preventive medicine and a one-year course f o r rural mid-wifes were
financed by the project.

3.14           Institutional Strengthening.      This component included the following :-
community centers, vehicles f o r incremental s t a f f , equipment and operational
expenses f o r the project coordinator, and additional personnel f o r IBR, SEAG,
and BNF.       The project was t o construct two community centers adjacent t o a l l
weather roads f o r the purpose of concentrating the services of the I n s t i t u t e of
Rural Welfare (IBR), BNF, and SEAG and provide housing f o r t h e i r o f f i c i a l s a t
an estimated cost of USS1.1 million.           The community centers were b u i l t , a f t e r
two years delay, a t a cost of USS0.3 million (para. 3.16), and f u l f i l l e d t h e i r

intended purpose.           However, a t project completion t h e r e were administrative and
maintenance problems associated with these centers mainly due t o low l e v e l s of
counterpart funds and t h e l a c k of a centralized administrative authority.                    The
project was t o purchase vehicles and equipment costing USS0.7 million.                        A t
project completion, vehicles and road construction equipment were purchased and
t h e i r operating c o s t s increased t o USS2.6 million.              This increase resulted from
p r i c e increases and a d d i t i o n a l purchase of road contruction equipment.            The
operating and equipment expenses f o r t h e Project Coordinator and support s t a f f
were t o be financed up t o USS0.3 million.                  The amount a t completion was
USS0.5 million.         The cost of 38 incremental s t a f f estimated at appraisal t o be
about USS0.7 million, closely approximated t h e c o s t a t p r o j e c t completion.
However, t h e number of project s t a f f decreased i n t h e l a t e r stages of t h e
p r o j e c t due t o lower counterpart funding.

                                             C.   Cost Estimate

3.15           The t o t a l c o s t of t h e Bank-funded portion of t h e project was
USS36.8 million compared t o an a p p r a i s a l estimate of USS37.8 million ( a s
shown below).         The a c t u a l c o s t s associated with construction of h e a l t h and
community centers were lower than a p p r a i s a l estimates due t o a high l e v e l of
competition among l o c a l construction companies f o r t h i s work s i n c e completion
of t h e Itapua Dam.        The lower c o s t s of t h e c r e d i t component were i n p a r t due
t o t h e lower than expected number of loans being granted and g r e a t e r farmer
contribution.        The increases i n t h e c o s t s of roads and vehicles were caused

3.17            The accumulated disbursements as of June 30, 1981, the original
closing date, were USS4.5 million which was only 20%of the t o t a l loan
amount.        Four more years were needed t o disburse the remainder of the loan.

3.18            The f i r s t reallocation of loan funds was December 6, 1981 and
allowed the 12-month extension of a contract (previously financed by UNDP f o r
the Federated Production Cooperatives (FECOPROD)) t o a s s i s t i n the organiza-
tion of farmer groups i n the project area.               The second reallocation of
August 23, 1982 was t o finance a consultant needed by IBR t o improve land
t i t l i n g services.      The third, and f i n a l reallocation on June 30, 1983 was t o
increase funds i n categories 1 and 2 t o meet rising costs of road construc-
tion and equipment.            The reduction of category 3 was possible because of a
reduced need for specialized consultants.               A new category 6 was created t o
provide funds f o r project evaluation t o f a c i l i t a t e preparation of the PCR.
This eliminated funds i n the unallocated category.

                                         E.  Procurement

3.19            Procurement of engineering and design consultants f o r the roads was
delayed two years.            The design contract was t o be funded from the Bank's
Pre-Investment Studies Project (Loan 587-PA), but the procedure for the
release of funds associated with t h i s loan proved time consuming and delayed
contracting of design consultants.              A further delay of about one year
occured during 1982, because it became necessary t o rebid f o r the construc-
tion of the second and third sections of the road as local contractors had
over-estimated their contract price because of erroneous calculations i n
determining the foreign exchange component of their contracts.                There were no
problems with the selection and appointment of consultants f o r technical
assistance t o BNF, MAG and cooperative development.               Contracts were completed
on time t o the satisfaction of GOP and the Bank.

                                           F.  Reporting

3.20          The Loan Agreement called f o r the submission of quarterly reports
by the project coordination unit.             The i n i t i a l project reporting (1978-1981)
was irregular; f i n a l l y a consolidated report was received on December 14,
1982.      From that date, quarterly reports were received with delays of
2-3 months.      The d e t a i l and presentation of these reports was judged
inadequate with the e a r l i e r submissions; but a f t e r Bank suggestions
concerning the use of objective key indicators, there was an improvement.
Monthly progress reports were received from BNF detailing the progress of the
c r e d i t component; these were received on time and presented with satisfactory
detail.

                                            G.  Auditing

3.21          The f i r s t audit reports were received i n 1983 covering the period
from 1978-82.       These were given a minor qualification by the Government
controller regarding the non-depreciation of project assets.                   There were
delays i n submission of subsequent reports.                 However, by project completion
a l l outstanding audit reports had been submitted.

                             H.      Comvliance With Loan Covenants

3.22          The Borrower and its implementing agencies have complied with
Covenants i n both the Loan and Project Agreements.                  There were, however,
instances where the Borrower and its implementing agencies did not comply
f u l l y or at a specified time.         The former case applies t o hiring of extension
and other project staff.             The required s t a f f were recruited i n i t i a l l y , but
the number was reduced a f t e r 1983 because of reductions i n the allocations of
recurrent expenditures (LA 4.02 (b) and 4.03 (a)); this,however, did not have
a significant adverse impact on t h e attainment of the intended objectives of
t h e project.    The l a t t e r case applies t o submission t o the Bank of audit
reports on project accounts.             Although a l l the audit reports were submitted
t o the Bank, t h i s was done later than the due date.               This was brought t o the
attention of t h e Borrower on many occasions, but that did not r e s u l t i n
timely submissions t o the Bank.


                                 I V .  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE

4.01          Introduction.        This chapter evaluates the performance of those
institutions that played key roles i n the projects implementation.

4.02          The National Council f o r Social Progress (CNPS) was t o coordinate
the various institutions involved both a t the national and project levels and
appoint a Project Coordinator responsible f o r overall project coordination
and implementation.          Its previous good performance under Loan 509-PA, as well
as its inter-ministerial character made it an ideal coordinating agency for
the project.      However, its performance was .unsatisfactory under t h i s project
as explained below.

4.03           During project implementation t h e CNPS, plus its technical
committee composed of directors from each of the implementing agencies, was
t o meet on a regular basis, t o assure a harmonious working relationship at
the national level between agencies.                  However, i n practice it was d i f f i c u l t
to call meetings of t h i s committee due t o the existing workload of its
directors and lack of o f f i c i a l l y accepted mechanism t o assure participation
i n meetings on a regular basis.             The effectiveness of the CNPS designated
project coordinator at the project operational l e v e l was successful; he
provided the l i n k a t the national l e v e l between implementing agencies, not
the CNPS technical committee.             The technical committee did not produce the
yearly work plans as anticipated during appraisal; i n practice, they were
produced by the Project Coordinator.

4.04            I B R 1 s role under the project was t o carry out a land demarcating
and t i t l i n g program of sufficient magnitude t o assure a s o l i d base of t i t l e d
land holders within the project area who could then qualify f o r farm credit.
Since credit could not be granted unless farmers had titles or c e r t i f i c a t e s
of intent, it was necessary f o r IBR t o begin work before the project actually
started.        IBR did i n f a c t begin t i t l i n g before project effectiveness.
However, toward the end of the project, the processing of land t i t l e s
declined.         This was due t o shortages of personnel and the poor administration
of beneficiary accounts.            Because of these limitations the performance of
IBR, especially i n the l a t e r project stages w a s mixed.

4.05            A t the s t a r t of the project, the BNF regional offices, D.          Robledo
and M.    Otano, responsible f o r the project credit component, faced
considerable arrears (20-30%) because poor crop harvests i n the preceeding
two years had seriously reduced farmers capacity t o repay loans.                    Moreover,
there was insufficient s t a f f at the regional office t o enable proper
supervision of subloans, a problem that was exacerbated by lack of vehicles,
office space, and access roads.              Several actions were i n i t i a t e d during the
project t o strengthen the BNF which have led t o improvements i n BNF1s
performance.           Under the Second Rural Development Project, the objective was
t o strengthen the loan processing and supervision capacity of the regional
offices i n D.         Robledo and Mayor Otano through the provision of vehicles and
equipment, i n conjunction with technical assistance t o improve management
funded by UNDP and IDB.             A t the national level, the Bank financed Industrial
Credit Project (Ln 1419-PA) included the strengthening of BNF1s overall
financial program as its f i r s t objective.              The Project Completion Report f o r
the Industrial Credit Project (Ln 1419-PA) reported i n 1984 that BNF made
substancial progress i n the development of the i n s t i t u t i o n and improved its
overall financial performance.              The 1985 audit statements of BNF showed an
improved financial position from t h a t of project effectiveness i n 1978.                     In
particular, foreign reserves were increasing, a s w e l l as savings deposits.
This is being monitored under a follow-up Second Industrial Credit Project
(Ln 1866-PA).            With regard t o the performance of t h e regional office serving
the project area, there was considerable improvement i n the management,
staffing, and level of supervision as indicated by the large increment i n the
number of farmers taking c r e d i t under the project and t h e f a c t t h a t arrears
were down t o 10-15%.           However, delays i n processing new subloans, especially
before planting periods, persist i n the project area.

4.06      The organization of farmer groups was carried out by consultants
from FECOPROD and was considered successful; both by officials of the project
implementing agencies and by project beneficiaries. The earlier stages of
farmer organization concentrated on marketing of agricultural output and
purchase of inputs. Farmer groups consolidated their production, thereby
obtaining lower prices for transport and higher prices for their production.
In the project area, three pre-cooperatives have been organized and have
associated themselves with established cooperatives in Encarnacion. The
organization of farmer groups also has helped project beneficiaries gain
access to increased technical assistance apart from the credit component and
improve their living conditions in general. Beneficiaries expressed the
opinion that their respective organizations allowed them to bargain on better
terms with local merchants and government support agencies.

                             V.   RaLE OF THE BANK

5.01      The role played by the Bank throughout project implementation was
satisfactory. During project implementation there was a cooperative working
relationship between the Bank, the project coordinating unit, implementing
agencies, and Government officials. The Bank proved flexible in responding
to Government request for reallocation of loan funds, extending the closing
date to allow completion of road construction and in allowing an extension of
the FECOPROD contract to assist with the organization of farmer groups
(para. 3.19).   The appraisal was overly optimistic by expecting timely
funding for road design from pre-investment Loan 587-PA.  This delay in road
design had a significant impact on delaying project road construction.
During project start-up, Bank supervision missions tended to be component
specific and provided essential advice and guidance in technical matters.

                           VI. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT

6.01      One of the most important strategies of the project was to help new
and existing settlers to increase their cultivated area and together with
improved technology, increase agricultural production. The project compo-
nents that most directly influenced the increased production were credit and
roads. The project was successful in pursuing this strategy. One of the
results of the project strategy was to increase the area devoted to
commercial crops such as soyabeans, wheat, sunflower, and improve the yields
of maize and cassava.
                                    Yields

Beans                0.9 -

-a/The SAR estimated a yield increase for cassava of 4 mt/ha (from 12 mt/ha
   to 16 mt/ha).   The "without project" yield estimated at appraisal was too
   low for the larger than expected farms which actually applied for the
   credit. This PCR corrects this estimate for its analysis.

6.02              Yield increases i n annual cash crops l i k e soybeans, wheat and maize
resulted from using improved v a r i e t i e s and cultural practices.          In the
particular case of soya beans, v a r i e t i e s introduced by the project gave
project beneficiaries a choice of three planting dates allowing improved
adaptation t o an irregular rainfed growing environment.               The yield increases
i n wheat were the r e s u l t of improved weed control and f e r t i l i z e r .  Two
subsistence crops whose yields increased during project execution were maize
and cassava.            These crops were planted i n newly cleared land and benefitted
from high residual s o i l f e r t i l i t y .  The yield increase i n other subsistence
crops was not a s significant a s cash crops due t o the high level of inputs
c r e d i t users employed on t h e i r cash crops.

                                       Incremental Production

Sunflower                 1.6
Wheat                    0.4

A t Year 4 the project attained almost eight times t h e production of maize a s
predicted f o r Year 4 and feur t i m e s the production of soybeans projected f o r
the same year.

6.04               There was a trend among those farms of less than 20 ha t o increase
t h e i r area devoted t o perennial crops, while larger landholders (30-50 ha)
increased annual cropping.             The strategy employed by smaller farmers was t o
plant part of t h e i r holding t o perennial crops i n order t o avoid a perceived
i n s t a b i l i t y i n income from annual cropping.      The perennial crops most often
planted by project beneficiaries were Tung, Yerba mate, and citrus.                   A l l of
these crops have not yet reached f u l l maturity under the project.

6.05                In response t o increased use of animal traction i n t h e project area
farmers planted permanent pastures, a feature which did not e x i s t i n the
project area before the implementation of the project.                 The area devoted t o
permanent pasture among the smaller farmers (less than 20 ha) averaged about
1.9 hectares.             The pasture was planted i n areas of the farm t h a t would
otherwise be subject t o erosion i f not under continuous ground cover.

6.06               The environmental impact of land clearing and destumping under the
project can be considered only over the long term.                 The project has promoted
technologies t o avoid t h e worst e f f e c t s of long-term degradation.         The
extension agents of SEAG have helped prevent erosion; each agent was given a
target amount of land terracing t o introduce among project beneficiaries.
This program was successful.             As a p a r t of the project reforestation,
nurseries were planted t o provide low cost seedlings t o local farmers and a
study was financed f o r the "Arroyo Yaguarazapa" t o propose improved
conservation measures.             The completion mission observed conservation measures
taken by 60% of the individual farmers interviewed i n t h e project area t o
plant permanent pastures on erodable s o i l s and the use of permanent grass

covered terraces.                 Future information campaigns are planned by SEAG t o
promote crop r o t a t i o n t h a t o f f e r s maximum ground cover and the use of minimum
t i l l a g e techniques.

6.07               The analysis of t h e project impact has been based on surveys
conducted by t h e s t a f f of t h e Ministry of Agriculture's technical advisory
group (Gabinete Tecnico).                   The survey work began a t t h e end of t h e 83/84
a g r i c u l t u r a l year a f t e r s i x years of project development.         The mission
analyzed data from s i t u a t i o n s before and a t project completion.                   The t o t a l
value of incremental prod~ictioni n 1983/84 was about USS3.6 million.                              The
economic r a t e of return over 30 years, is estimated t o be about 31%compared
t o appraisal estimate of 14%. The higher ERR a t project completion, can be
a t t r i b u t e d to: ( i ) the c r e d i t component was granted t o a reduced number of
l a r g e r , more e f f i c i e n t farms ; ( i i ) higher than expected commodity prices ;
( i i i ) l a r g e r areas were cleared per beneficiary; ( i v ) l a r g e r areas were
devoted t o annual cash crops (v) higher y i e l d increases i n maize, soya beans,
and wheat; ( v i ) additional benefits from t h e mainly road system i n t h e form
of reduced transport costs.

                                     V I I . SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED

7.01               The o v e r a l l project objectives of increasing income, a g r i c u l t u r e
productive capacity, and improving i n f r a s t r u c t u r e and project administration
have been s a t i s f a c t o r i l y accomplished,       Some of t h e project components
suffered because of delays i n t h e construction of roads and i n t h e lower than
expected l e v e l s of counterpart funding available t o the project i n the l a t e r
years of its implementation.                  The supervised c r e d i t program successfully
a s s i s t e d small farmers i n increasing t h e i r cropping area and diversifying
i n t o cash crops such a s soya beans and wheat.                 The road component has given
access t o markets f o r t h e i r a g r i c u l t u r a l surplus t o even the most remote
settlers in the project area, and permitted a reduction i n the costs of
transport.

7.02               The following a r e some general lessons t h a t have emerged from the
implementation of t h i s project:

          ( a )    The road system being one of t h e most v i t a l l i n k s i n t h e develop-
                  ment of t h e project area, t h e delays i n its construction cons-
                   trained other important a c t i v i t i e s , i.e.   land t i t l i n g and c r e d i t .
                   It w i l l be very important that future setlement projects take steps
                   t o avoid similar delays by: ( i ) assuring t h a t road design and loca-
                   t i o n a r e agreed before Board Presentation of the Loan; ( i i ) seeking
                   assurances t h a t l o c a l road construction capacity can meet deadlines
                   and t h a t counterpart funding requirements f o r construction and
                   maintenance have a high Government p r i o r i t y ; and ( i i i ) t h a t design
                   and construction consultants a l s o provide a cost e f f e c t i v e
                   maintenance plan f o r constructed roads.

          (b)      The assisted c r e d i t scheme of the project was successful, however,
                   c e r t a i n improvements could be made i n BNF's loan processing a t t h e
                   f i e l d level.

   1.   BNF should develop a systematic approach to inform potential
        borrowers of their requirements for loan eligibility. This
        dialogue should also make the borrowers more aware of their
        credit obligations and expected margins required in order to
        meet loan payments.  This could be done either by the
        extension service or by selected BNF personnel.

   2.   BNF should be more flexible in its processing of loan
        applications during peak production periods, allocating more
        personnel on a temporary basis to meet the peak demands, or
        perhaps developing some type of mobile office to meet the
        needs of more isolated communities.

(c) The provision of technical assistance as part of the credit scheme
   was greatly assisted by the UNDP agricultural extension funded con-
   sultant. However, institutional constraints limited the effective-
   ness of SEAG agents with respect to BNF clients and other settlers
   in the project area.

    1.  In the first instance SEAG's agents became too closely identi-
        fied with the BNF and were perceived by BNF clients as agents
        for bank control and not as impartial technicians making tech-
        nical recommendations. In the case of non-credit users, the
        effectiveness of technical assistance was limited by SEAG
         agents concentration on BNF clients. While in the initial
         stages of project development this combined BNF/SEAG effort
        was effective and concentrated efforts on those project bene-
        ficiaries who had access to credit, in the later stages as
         settlement becomes more stable and technical assistance
        becomes more complex, a division of responsibility for credit
         planning and agricultural extension should be considered.

d)  The construction of community centers in the project area was
    planned to be completed at an early phase in project implementation
    in order to facilitate coordination of IBR, BNF and SEAG; and to
    provide housing to these agencies' officials.  Unfortunately their
    late construction did not allow complete fulfillment of the
    intended purpose.  If such community centers are to be part of
    future projects, it would be important that their construction be
    completed early and to have assurances that a mechanism existed for
    their administration and maintenance.

(e) The provision of legal land titles to project beneficiaries was one
    of the key factors that contributed to stability of the settlement
    effort. It gave beneficiaries access to credit and technical
    assistance but more importantly stimulated them to improve their
    resource base.  To improve this type of activity in future
    projects, it will be important to give greater emphasis to the
    concept of land use planning and a systematic administration of
    land registration.

Re: Rural Development Project in the Department of Itapua, Loan 1418-PA.


          In relation to the draft PCR on the above project, forwarded to me
with your letter of October 27, 1986, I wish to report that the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock has no comments to add, since the report in general
covers the major aspects oE execution of the project.

          However, I should be pleased if you would mention the Evaluation
Report carried out by this Ministry's Technical Bureau, the Oficina Nacional
de Progreso Social and the Secretaria ~hcnicade Planificacidn.   Copies of
this report have been sent to Messrs. M. McGarry and Haile-Mariam.

          Regards. Hernando Bertoni, Minister of Agriculture and Livestock.
