The supervised credit program successfully\n            assisted small farmers in increasing their cropping area and\n            diversifying into cash crops such as soya beans and wheat.\n            The road component has given access to markets for their\n            agricultural surplus to even the most remote settlers in the\n            project area, and permitted a reduction in the costs of\n            transport. Some of the lessons learned from the project are:\n            a) the road system being one of the most vital links in the\n            development of the project area, the delays in its\n            construction constrained other important activities, i.e.\n            land titling and credit. It will be very important that\n            future settlement projects take steps to avoid similar\n            delays by: (i) assuring that road design and location are\n            agreed before Board Presentation of the Loan; (ii) seeking\n            assurances that local road construction capacity can meet\n            deadlines and that counterpart funding requirements for\n            construction and maintenance have a high Government\n            priority; and (iii) that design and construction consultants\n            also provide a cost effective maintenance plan for\n            constructed roads; and (b) the assisted credit scheme of the\n            project was successful, however, certain improvements could\n            be made in National Develoment Bank (BNF) loan processing at\n            the field level."}, "docdt": "1986-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
