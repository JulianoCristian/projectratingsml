                         This is a desk review of the project. An implementation support and supervision mission is planned for the 3rd week of June 2012 after which the ISR will be updated. Overall the
                         project is being implemented in a satisfactory manner based on teleconferences with the project implementation unit. It is noted that: (ii) the creation of the 2 targeted Marine
                         Protected Areas (MPAs) for a total surface area of 90,000 ha by project end, has been achieved, through Ministerial Arretes. The presidential decree to finalize the creation process
                         is still pending for the President Signature. The PIU is closely following up on this process; (ii) all 11 participating rural communities adjacent to the MPAs have identified and included

                         environmental protection and natural resource management micro-projects in their Annual Investment Plan. Implementation of the micro-projects is underway.

                         In addition to the above two PDO level indicators, all intermediate level indicators at components level have also registered significant progress. Therefore the potential of achieving
                         the project objectives is positive.
