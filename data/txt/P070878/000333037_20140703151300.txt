F. RESULTS FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS
Project Development Objective (PDO) – as presented in the Grant Agreement: To
promote rational management of the Recipient’s coastal biodiversity for both
conservation and sustainable development ends in selected priority areas (up to 17 of the
Recipient’s Rural Development Communities), with a focus on those around sites
identified under the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance and shared
watersheds, notably Alcatraz Island, Rio Pongo and Tristao Islands), with a particular
emphasis on assisting communities in and around these priority areas to plan, implement
and maintain environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive alternative livelihood
options.

Global Environment Objectives (GEO) – as presented in the PAD: To strengthen the
conversation of globally and nationally significant habitats and species in Guinea’s
Coastal Zone in priority areas encompassing several coastal RAMSAR sites.

Revised PDO and GEO - as presented in the Level One Restructuring of April 22, 2011
and the Reinstated Grant Agreement: To improve the conservation of the Recipient’s
coastal and marine biological resources in selected Ramsar Sites.

I. DISBURSEMENT PROFILE




                          xviii
1. PROJECT CONTEXT, GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT OBJECTIVE, AND
DESIGN

1.1 CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL
1.      The Coastal zone of Guinea, which comprises 15 percent of the country’s
territory, is home to about 40 percent of Guinea’s population. Studies of coastal
population trends over time indicate a dramatic increase of 290 percent between 1963 and
1996. This population explosion is due to the fact that the coast is traditionally a
resource-rich area (agro-pastoralism, minerals, and fish) and most of the cities are located
on the coast, including the capital city of Conakry.
2.      One-quarter of West Africa’s mangrove wetland ecosystem, which stretches from
Senegal to northern Angola, lies along Guinea’s coast. The diversity of Guinea’s
mangrove-dominated shoreline provides a multitude of ecological niches. These habitats,
particularly the marine and estuarine waters, are also among the richest on the West
African coast in terms of productivity and food potential. They are essential for the
survival of several species of migrating birds that are globally endangered or threatened,
and for species that are economically important (fish and game).
3.      The ecology of this wetland system is closely entwined with that of both the
‘upstream’ coastal plateau and the ‘downstream’ continental shelf. However, this coastal
ecology is coming under tremendous pressure from increased demand for land for food
production, transhumance, and fuel wood. These pressures have been exacerbated by the
persistence of poverty and lack of alternative sources of income or access to adapted
technologies among the rural population.
4.      The Coastal Marine and Biodiversity Management Project (CMBMP) was
designed to address these issues in collaboration with other, ongoing regional initiatives.
It was designed as a five-year project focused on developing the local and institutional
capacity necessary to halt and, where possible, reverse the consequences of unsustainable
resource use and to conserve key biodiversity in target sites. It was also intended to
develop instruments and test approaches for sustainable natural resource use and
conservation and was designed to complement a Bank-financed community-driven
development operation – the Village Communities Support Project (VCSP), which was
conceived as an APL with three phases. The CMBMP was to overlap with the first and
second phase of the VCSP and was to be implemented from 2006-2011. Start-up of the
GEF Project was to coincide with the last year of the ongoing first phase of the VCSP,
while full implementation was to coincide with the second phase (2007-2011). The VCSP
did not support biodiversity conservation, but its Project Coordination Unit was
strengthened under the GEF project so as to manage implementation of both projects.

1.2 ORIGINAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND INDICATORS
5.      The Global Environmental Objective (GEO) was to promote conservation of
globally and nationally significant habitats and species in Guinea’s coastal zone in
selected priority areas encompassing coastal Ramsar Sites.



                                             1
6.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) as presented the Grant Agreement
was to promote rational management of the Recipient’s coastal biodiversity for both
conservation and sustainable development ends in selected priority areas (up to 17 of the
Recipient’s Rural Development Communities), with a focus on those around sites,
identified under the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance and shared
watersheds, notably Alcatraz Island, Rio Pongo and Tristao Islands), with a particular
emphasis on assisting communities in and around these priority areas to plan, implement
and maintain environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive alternative livelihood
options.

achieving project outcomes were: (i) Effective participation of communities living around
the protected area in its management, through the establishment of a stakeholder
management committee; (ii) Stabilization of natural resource base in areas under
cultivation in project watershed target sites by end of project (about 10,000 ha) as
measured through technical audits; (iii) Positive trend for key species and water quality
indicators (baseline to end of project) based on the indicators detailed in the Project
Impact Evaluation Manual; and (iv) Ministry of Environment capable of guiding
proposed and on-going development activities in coastal zone as measured through the
technical audits.

1.3 REVISED PDO AND GEO AND INDICATORS
8.      Due to political turmoil, which led to suspension of disbursements in the country
from December 2008 to end 2010, project implementation came to a halt. After
democratic elections in 2010, and the subsequent lifting of the disbursement suspension,
the Bank re-engaged with the country during the first quarter of 2011 and the whole
portfolio was reassessed and restructured. The Government of Guinea and the World
Bank agreed to a level one restructuring 2 of this project that entailed the revision of the
PDO and its combination with the GEO.
9.     The revised combined PDO/GEO was to improve the conservation of the
Recipient’s coastal and marine biological resources in selected Ramsar Sites.
10.     The revised PDO/GEO indicators were: (i) Surface area classified as Protected
Marine Areas (MPAs); and (ii) Number of communities practicing conservation measures
in the MPAs.

1.4 MAIN BENEFICIARIES
11.     The target population was defined as local communities and resource users,
selected government agencies and decision makers at all levels, local NGOs, and the
private sector in the vicinity of the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Project beneficiaries

  PDO indicators as presented in the PAD’s results framework in Annex 3. PDO indicators were presented
in the PAD, not in the Grant Agreement. The Grant Agreement only outlined Intermediate Result
Indicators.

  A level one restructuring pertains to restructurings that require, inter alia, a change in the PDO or results
indicators, and are to be submitted for Board approval.

                                                       2
are located in 11 (before restructuring 17) Rural Development Communes (Communauté
Rurale de Développement – CRD) that: (i) were covered by the VCSP; and (ii) where the
economic activities of the population directly impacted the wetland and areas of high
biodiversity value (i.e., the watersheds of the selected RAMSAR sites: the islands of
Tristao and Alcatraz).

1.5 ORIGINAL COMPONENTS
12.   The components as presented here are taken from the PAD. In the Grant
Agreement they are stated slightly differently, but the substance is the same.
13.   The project had five closely interlinked components, three of which –
Components 3, 4 and 5 - provided incremental support to the Village Communities
Support Program (VCSP).
14.    Component 1: Protection and Conservation of Coastal RAMSAR Sites, with
three subcomponents:
   •   Establishment of an Integrated Conservation Zone. Intervention areas,
       incorporating wetlands recognized under the RAMSAR Convention were to be
       included: Islands of Tristao, Alcatraz, and Rio Pongo.
   •   Conservation Zone Management. This sub-component was to provide the Rural
       Communes (CRDs), local communities and local development/change agents
       with the core technical tools and financial support for the establishment and
       management of the coastal conservation zones.
   •   Impact Monitoring and Evaluation.
15.  Component 2: Enabling Environment                  for   Integrated   Coastal    Zone
Management (ICZM), with two subcomponents:
   •   Institutional strengthening. Four sets of activities were included: studies, targeted
       capacity building of the Ministry of Environment, a review of the adequacy of the
       legal framework related to Integrated Conservation Zones (ICZs), and basic
       training and workshops.
   •   Coastal Zone Knowledge and Communication. Two sets of activities were
       included: (i) establishment of institutionalized integrated coastal zone
       coordination exchange mechanism under the Ministry of Planning; and (ii)
       support to the existing Information center of the Observatoire Guinee Maritime
       (OGM) to facilitate and enhance access to coastal and marine related information.
16.     Component 3: Local Investment Fund. This component was to provide micro
grants to communities for activities that would have an incremental positive impact on
biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource use.
17.    Component 4: Support for Local Capacity Building. This component was to assist
populations of targeted CRDs to revise existing local development plan (PDLs) by using
a more holistic development approach emphasizing sustainable natural resource use and
conservation activities.


                                            3
18.     Component 5: Program Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The objective
of this component was to ensure efficient and cost-effective implementation of the other
four components.

1.6 REVISED COMPONENTS
19.     At the time of project restructuring (April 22, 2011), the components were
reduced in scope to focus on those activities that would have a rapid positive impact on
the rural population, thereby reducing pressure on the natural resources, while attaining
the objective of improved conservation of Guinea’s marine biological resources. As a
result, project activities were consolidated and restructured into four components: (i)
Creation of MPAs in Ramsar Sites and support to their management; (ii) Capacity
Building for MPAs management; (iii) Support to participative local development; and
(iv) Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation.

1.7 OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
20.     In addition to revising the PDO and combining it with the GEO, the level one
restructuring included: (i) an extension of the project closing date by two years (from
December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2013) in order to compensate for the two years
suspension; (ii) a reduction of project scope to focus on 11 communities, instead of the
original 17 and on activities that could be potentially completed within the extension
period and contribute to the achievement of the revised PDO; (iii) a reallocation of funds;
and (iv) an increase of the ceiling of the Special Account from USD550,000 to
USD1,000,000.
21.     Furthermore, institutional changes made after the 2010 Presidential elections
affected the project institutional arrangement as followed: The National Coordination
Unit (NCU) in charge of implementing this project in addition to the Village Community
Support Project (VCSP) and the GEF-financed Land Management Project (CBLMP),
which was previously under the Ministry of Planning, was moved to the Ministry of
Decentralization. The newly created Office of Biological Diversity and Protected Areas
(OGDBAP), which operated under the purview of the Ministry of Environment, was put
in charge of the creation of marine protected areas - MPAs (Component 1) and related
capacity building activities (Component 2). Later on, the OGDBAP changed name to
become the Office Guinéen des Parcs (OGUIPAR) but its attributions remained
unchanged. The institutional changes did not affect project implementation.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND QUALITY AT ENTRY
Preparation
22.      The project was identified in 2001 and preparation started at the end of 2003 with
a GEF preparation grant in the amount of USD350,000. Project preparation took over two
years as many preparation and baseline studies had to be carried out, and the final
institutional arrangement was completed only after lengthy discussions with the
Government. Instead of housing the project under the Ministry of Environment whose
capacity was weak, the Government made the decision to have the project prepared and
implemented by the Ministry of Planning, because its responsibilities cut across sectoral
lines. During the whole preparation phase, Guinean counterparts were fully involved and
the Government’s commitment was evidenced by the fact that it provided the counterpart
funds (USD60,000) requested by the GEF.
Lessons reflected in project design
23.      The project benefitted from previous experience in Guinea and other coastal
management projects and was designed to take into account: (i) inter related ecosystems
(i.e., the coastal plain, the maritime wetlands, and the continental shelf); (ii) land tenure
issues related to the development of micro-projects; (iii) capacity building of project
beneficiaries in the use of improved techniques for natural resource management; (iv)
establishment of an independent scientific structure capable of measuring trends of key
species and water quality of the marine protected areas; and, (v) establishment of a
sustainability instrument for long term management of marine protected areas created
under the project.
24.    In line with these lessons, the project started off with practical technical
demonstration activities around the island of Tristao (pilot site) and community
awareness raising activities with the view to expanding coverage to the remaining
planned 17 Rural Development Communes (CRDs), until the political instability which
hindered these efforts.
Assessment of project design

25.     Overall, the design of the project was complex. The PAD was well written and
comprehensive but did not provide sufficient information on how to operationalize the
project’s objectives. Furthermore, the initial PDO 3 was not focused, therefore difficult to
measure. Initially, the Task Team considered over 50 indicators related to the
stabilization of the natural resource base in the project area, mainly to respond to GEF

3
 Original PDO: To promote rational management of the Recipient’s coastal biodiversity for both
conservation and sustainable development ends in selected priority areas (up to 17 of the Recipient’s Rural
Development Communities), with a focus on those around sites, identified under the Ramsar List of
Wetlands of International Importance and shared watersheds, notably Alcatraz Island, Rio Pongo and
Tristao Islands, with a particular emphasis on assisting communities in and around these priority areas to
plan, implement and maintain environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive alternative livelihood
options.

                                                     5
requirements in order to secure financing. These indicators were meant to measure trends
related to key species and water quality. This proved to be overambitious in terms of
what could realistically be achieved with a small project in a relatively short period of
time and in a country characterized by weak institutions and political and institutional
instability. During appraisal the number of indicators was reduced to 19, but this was still
unrealistic, as some of the GEF indicators would have been very difficult to measure. On
the other hand, the decision to link this project closely with the Village Communities
Support Program (VCSP II) 4 and to use the National Coordination Unit (CNC) of VCSP
for overall management and coordination of the GEF project was the right decision.
Initially, because the two projects were linked and the intention was to have the same
launch date for this project as for the VCSP, but this led to delays as the VCSP
processing took longer than originally expected. However, closely linking VCSP II and
the GEF project proved crucial for project execution on the ground over the long run. The
CNC had experienced staff with the required capacity to deal with the Bank’s fiduciary
and safeguard policies. In addition, VCSP was well versed with participatory local
development project planning and execution. Finally, the socio-economic infrastructure
micro-projects financed by VCSP and the natural resource management and income
generating micro-projects of this project were complementary and, thus, supported each
other.
Assessment of risks and their mitigation
26.    The critical risks identified and the risk mitigation measures proposed in the PAD
were pertinent. The overall risk rating of “Substantial” (S) was also appropriate.
However, in hindsight, the risk of political and institutional instability should have
received more attention. Also, the overlapping and ill-defined institutional mandates and
the weak capacity of the Ministry of Environment to execute its responsibilities were
highlighted, but no strategy was presented to deal with these issues in a comprehensive
manner. Instead, the PAD relied almost exclusively on short-term technical assistance
and did not include sufficient longer-term training for local technical staff of the various
agencies involved in project execution.

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION
27.     Project implementation can be divided into two very distinct phases: (i) a first
phase (from effectiveness in July 2007 to December 2010) during which the project was
stalled; and (ii) a second phase (after restructuring in April 2011 until project closing in
December 2013) during which project implementation accelerated greatly and most
actions were taken according to the revised plans.



4
  The Village Communities Support Program (PACV) is an Adaptable Lending Program (APL) consisting
of several phases. The second phase which overlaps with this project was approved on August 14, 2007 and
its closing date is currently December 31, 2014. The PDO of the PACV is to enable rural governments
(CRDs) to fulfill their mandate by planning and implementing inclusive local development activities, and
improving revenue performance to sustain recurrent costs. The PACV strengthened local development
planning and financed local social infrastructure and as such is complementary to this project. The PACV
project management unit was used to implement this GEF project by adding key technical staff to it.

                                                   6
28.    During the first phase, which can be divided in two sub-phases, the project
experienced serious problems and delays.
   a. From 2006 to 2008, when not much happened, primarily because of delays in
      meeting effectiveness conditions and the fact that the project was not well
      understood by the Guineans:
       •   Civil unrest and meeting effectiveness conditions caused initial delays: Project
           signing only took place on November 4, 2006 (i.e., four months after Board
           presentation) and effectiveness conditions were only met in July 2007 (about
           one year after Board approval) as a result of strikes and civil unrest
           culminating in a new Government during January and February 2007. In
           particular, the ratification of the grant agreement by the Government, and the
           recruitment of a technical specialist responsible for the project acceptable to
           the Bank, were lengthy procedures and caused delays.
       •   Communication challenges: The project launch workshop was delayed until
           November 2008 because it was tied to the project launch of the second phase
           of VCSP. During this launch workshop the task team in charge of the project
           could not attend because of scheduling difficulties as the dates for project
           launch had changed several times. Therefore, there was no thorough
           discussion in a participatory manner of project objectives, components and
           implementation procedures, between the task team and national project staff.
           This seriously affected successful project start-up as ownership of the project
           by the PIU had not adequately been fostered.
       •   Institutional challenges: During 2006–2008 hardly any activities were carried
           out on the ground and disbursements were negligible. Furthermore, there was
           high turnover of national project staff which impeded smooth implementation.
           For example, the new PIU staff was unfamiliar with the project and they
           seemed to be under the erroneous impression that Component 3: Local
           Investment Fund could only be started once all the legal measures related to
           the establishment of the MPAs had been concluded. This contributed to the
           delay in starting development and implementation of the micro-projects. If a
           proper project launch had been conducted with training of the PIU on the
           project, this misunderstanding would have been avoided.
   b. From 2008 to 2010, the country experienced political upheaval and turmoil, and
      disbursements were suspended for two years. In the first quarter of 2011, at the
      time the suspension was lifted, disbursement rate was 12%.
29.    The second phase started after the Presidential elections in November 2010. The
Bank reengaged with the country and the task team conducted a crucial implementation
support and supervision mission from March 28 to April 10, 2011. The mission
thoroughly reassessed the project and covered all aspects usually reserved for a mid-term
review (MTR). As a result of this mission, the Government and the Bank team agreed to
undertake a level one restructuring of the project, and the closing date was extended by
two years (December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2013). After a year of implementation
during the extension period, the team nevertheless conducted a formal MTR in January


                                            7
2013 to assess whether adequate progress had been made since the restructuring mission
and the remedial actions had been taken as needed.
30.      The restructuring paper was developed in a participatory manner with the
Government to ensure ownership and smooth onward implementation. Furthermore, the
project team organized training sessions on the results framework, financial management,
disbursement, procurement and on the implementation manuals to ensure full
understanding of the project by the PIU. This was well received by the PIU which
remained in “the driver’s seat” during the remaining two years of implementation. As a
result, the project was turned around, activities in the field were implemented in a timely
manner and disbursement rates increased accordingly.

2.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)
31.     M&E Design: As designed and described in the PAD, the M&E system was
supposed to use the following methods and tools: (i) detailed baseline studies covering
biodiversity, activity systems and poverty; and (ii) an evaluation system consisting of
four modules: state of coastal and marine ecosystem; rural activity systems evolution;
poverty; and capacities. Each module was supposed to include a certain number of
surveys with a common sample of households/production units. Comparison of the
evolution of different indicators and cross-analysis based on multi-theme data should
have made it possible to characterize the evolution of each theme at each site. In theory,
this would have made it possible to determine the overall evolution of the links between
poverty reduction/activity systems dynamics and the state of biodiversity, to determine
the pertinence, efficacy and replicability of the new approach toward sustainable local
development, and to assess the overall impact of the project. Ecosystem state evaluation
was planned to take place at mid-term and end-term. These surveys were supposed to be
coupled with consumer surveys that would have made it possible to know the type and
amount of resources extracted from the natural environment by the households and used
for the different domestic and commercial purposes. Finally, there was supposed to be a
poverty dashboard that would use indicators such as monetary poverty, living standards
indicators, access to resources, and qualitative indicators to identify local perception of
poverty.
32.      The system as designed was too ambitious, too research and science oriented with
little regard for practical implementation and, therefore, unrealistic. The PAD (Annex 3)
provides hardly any information on the key operational elements of the project’s M&E
system. There were too many indicators and some of those selected were next to
impossible to measure. There would have been a need for periodic technical audits and
the existence of rigorous baseline studies. Examples of such hard-to-measure outcome
indicators were: “Stabilization of natural resource base in areas under cultivation in
project watershed target sites.” and “Positive trend for key species and water quality
indicators.”
33.    M&E Implementation: The lack of specificity in the description of the M&E
system in the PAD, its overemphasis on research and science aspects, and the technical
capacity constraints of the implementing agencies made its establishment and
implementation a difficult task. The initial Bank implementation support teams were not

                                            8
able to correct the original lack of clarity in the design of the M&E system and to provide
timely assistance to the Government implementing agencies. This only changed with the
restructuring in April 2011. At restructuring, the original PDO and GEO were
considerably simplified. The results framework and monitoring indicators were adjusted
accordingly, and the indicators that were more difficult to measure were dropped or
replaced. It was also agreed to simplify the M&E system and to eliminate indicators inter
alia related to the stabilization of the natural resource base and the measurement of trends
for key species and water quality, as they could only be measured after a longer period
than the newly agreed upon closing date of the project of December 31, 2013. Certain
studies related to ecosystem development were also canceled for this very reason.
Towards the end of the project the M&E system was expanded to include an ecological
monitoring system for MPA management.
34.     M&E Utilization: With the modifications introduced during the restructuring, the
M&E system performed much better. With the reduction in indicators and the
introduction of more measurable ones, data collection and use became much more
systematic and the monitoring framework was regularly updated. Data were collected by
the different executing agencies at the local, regional and national levels and synthesized
by the National Coordination Unit. The baseline study carried out by the Observatoire
Guinée Maritime (OGM) during project preparation was supposed to be repeated at the
end of the project. However, due to time constraints, this did not happen. In any event,
the baseline study was a voluminous three part descriptive report of several hundred
pages that was not synthesized and could not readily have served to measure progress.
The operationalization of the ecological monitoring system for MPA management, which
was only started during the final year of project implementation, is still ongoing. The
local conservation teams established under the decrees creating the two MPAs have
received the necessary equipment (boat, radio VHF, GPS, motor cycles) and have been
trained. The Management Effectiveness Tracking Tools for biodiversity (METTs) 5 for
Tristao and Alcatraz have been filled out by OGUIPAR.

2.4 SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
35.     Environmental and Social Safeguards: This GEF project was classified in
category B and the following safeguard policies were triggered: environmental
assessment (OP 4.01), natural habitats (OP 4.04), and involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12).
The necessary safeguards instruments were prepared and disclosed prior to appraisal.
Safeguard specialists regularly reviewed environmental and social safeguard aspects
during implementation support missions and did not report any major issues
36.     Environmental aspects. For the micro-projects, screening forms were developed
that allowed to exclude those that might have had a negative environmental impact. No
micro-project was funded unless it passed this test. Committees to follow-up the
environmental aspects of micro-projects were set up by the project. Local staff of the

55
  METT - Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool. This is a self-evaluation tool to be filled out by
conservation managers to measure protected area management effectiveness over time. It is filled out a
project preparation to collect baseline data of the protected area, at mid-term review and at project end to
measure progress.

                                                      9
various technical ministries, especially forest guards and agricultural extension agents but
also local elected officials, were trained in environmental safeguard measures and in
filling out the screening forms. During one of the implementation support missions in
2011, it was noted that the field staff involved with the selection of the last batch of
micro-projects had little knowledge of the content of the ESMF. This was brought to the
attention of the safeguard specialist in the National Coordination Unit. Subsequently,
training for the involved persons on safeguard issues was conducted and implementation
support missions reported that the problem had been resolved. During its last year, the
project was instrumental in promoting a nation-wide use of the World Bank’s safeguard
policies in all of the micro-projects carried out by VCSP 2.
37.      Natural habitats. One of the main objectives of the project was to protect
biodiversity by protecting natural habitats and reducing human pressure on natural
resources. By their very nature, the MPAs secured coastal natural habitats and mangrove
forests.
38.    Involuntary resettlement. No resettlement was involved under the project. The
approach taken by the project was to accept that people would continue living within the
MPAs. However, they had to accept binding rules on the access and use of natural
resources and were compensated through income generating activities promoted under
the micro-projects.
39.    At project closing, safeguard performance was rated satisfactory.
40.     Financial Management, Procurement and Auditing: The financial management
system of the project benefitted from being part of the VCSP set-up. It used the same
financial management procedures that had been adapted from the manual prepared for the
first phase of the VCSP. Project accounts were regularly kept and withdrawal
applications were prepared directly from the project’s accounting software. Nevertheless,
given the fact that financial matters involved local communities and a regional project
unit, justifications for expenditures at times were delayed. Specialists, who participated in
the implementation support missions, rated the internal financial control mechanisms
moderately satisfactory throughout project implementation.
41.    Financial statements were audited and certified without qualifications. The
accounting software used had its weaknesses as it did not allow for automatic
consolidation of data for the preparation of financial statements, which had to be done by
hand. The manual process did not have a negative impact on project implementation
although it required close supervision by the Bank Financial Management Specialist.
42.     Procurement was centralized in the CNC and whenever possible, purchases were
grouped with procurements under VCSP2 for economies of scale. At times, procurement
plans were not updated in a timely manner and some issues regarding the recording of
procurement files at the national and, especially, regional level were noted and corrected.
Procurement of consultancy services for studies was often delayed as the quality of
Terms of References was most of the time poor and had to be thoroughly reviewed by the
task team, and involved lengthy interactions with the PIU. Most studies should have been
carried out much earlier during project implementation to enhance their value.
Procurement was judged as unsatisfactory in the initial years but later on was rated
moderately satisfactory.

                                             10
2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE
43.     The Government, through the Ministry of Natural Resources, is in the process of
searching for follow-up financing for the MPAs created under the project. Until the end
of VCSP 2 (December 31, 2014), the PCU will continue to provide technical support to
the MPAs. Independently of this, the Ministry of Environment continues its efforts to
establish a conservation trust fund for long-term environmental management, with a
specific financing window for MPAs. This initiative is likely to take several years before
coming to fruition since many legal and tax issues are involved and negotiations between
the Government and private mining companies will be needed before there is an
agreement.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
44.    The relevance of objectives, design, and implementation is rated Modest.
45.     Objectives: The relevance of the global objective to improve the productive and
sustainable use of the natural resource base in Guinea’s coastal zone has declined over
time. At the time of project preparation biodiversity conservation was a high priority
both in the CAS and on the Government agenda. In contrast, at the time of the ICR, a
follow up operation was not included in the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) due
to the Bank’s selectivity criteria, and coastal marine protection was not clearly mentioned
in the Government’s National Development Plan. Nevertheless, natural resources
conservation remains as an indicator in the CPF framework and the signing of Alcatraz
and Tristao as MPAs by presidential decree shows that the Government still considers
biodiversity as important.
46.     Design: The project’s development and environmental objective were not well
designed in the original results framework. The participatory ecosystem approach to
conservation is still valid, but project design did not sufficiently take into account the
time needed to: (i) strengthen local and national institutional capacity to address
environmental issues, especially by developing a sustainable institutional and legal
framework for promoting biodiversity conservation and management; and (ii) favor
participatory models that devolve biodiversity decision-making and management to
stakeholders at the local level, through the implementation of micro-projects that provide
alternative income opportunities without destroying the natural resource base. These are
long-term processes that were not sufficiently taken into account in project design.
47.      Implementation: As a consequence of project restructuring with its significant
cuts and elimination of key PDO indicators, the project lost its broader national
relevance. What had been a project with ambitions to influence national policy and
institutions with regard to coastal, marine and biodiversity management became a
localized project to protect two MPAs.

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
48.      Taking account of the project’s level one restructuring in April 2011, the project
has been evaluated against both its original and revised PDO by measuring achievements
at the time of project closing (December 2013).
49.     Original PDO achievement – Rating Unsatisfactory: The original PDO of the
project was not achieved. The project has been evaluated by its original four PDO
indicators, three of which were not achieved. In addition, fifteen intermediate result
indicators framed the assessment: five of those were fully (100%), two partly (25%), and
eight not (0%) achieved.
50.     Revised PDO achievement – Rating Satisfactory: The revised PDO was achieved
to a satisfactory extent. The assessment took the project’s two revised PDO indicators
into account, both of which were fully (100%) achieved, i.e:
   •   Surface area classified as Protected Marine Areas (MPAs): The surface area
       classified as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is 90,000 ha covering the islands of
       Tristao (90,000 ha) and Alcatraz (1 ha). Alcatraz is a rock in the sea without
       vegetation and fresh water. It is the nesting place for endangered bird species (Fou
       brun and probably Sterne Royale). Both MPAs were formally created by
       Ministerial decrees and a Presidential decree of May 30, 2013.
   •   Number of communities practicing conservation measures in the MPAs: Eleven
       Rural Development Communes (CRDs) are practicing conservation measures in
       the areas adjacent to the MPAs (the revised target being 11 CRDs). This objective
       was fully achieved. The local development plans (LDPs) of these CRDs contain
       conservation measures and 94 micro-projects were executed that have had a
       positive impact on the environment, ranging from reforestation activities to the
       use of more efficient wood burning stoves and production of salt through solar
       drying.
   •   The revised PDO indicators and their high degree of achievement show that
       Guinea has made considerable progress concerning coastal, marine and
       biodiversity management, albeit on a geographically limited basis. An M&E
       system for MPAs has been set up and staff of the Ministry of Environment has
       been trained for MPA management. Finally, and most importantly, the micro-
       projects that were implemented during the last two years of the project have
       provided the population in and around the MPAs with alternative income
       opportunities and it is expected that this will help reduce anthropic pressure
       natural resources.
   •   In addition, twelve intermediate result indicators informed the evaluation. Seven
       of those were fully (100%) achieved, two exceeded targets by 167% and 142%,
       respectively, one was partly achieved (50%), and two not achieved (0%). The
       two that were not achieved did not directly contribute to PDO achievement, i.e. (i)
       detailed proposal of sustainable financing for MPAs including local and regional
       contributions developed with particular emphasis on financing scheme for MPAs;
       and (ii) permanent environmental information and data hub related to Guinea’s
       coastal zone in place and widely used.

                                            12
    •    Finally, the assessment of achievement of the project development objective took
         into account the information contained in the two Management Effectiveness
         Tracking Tools (METT): the baseline METT of June 2012 and the one of October
         2013. This site-level tool shows that the overall management effectiveness score
         improved 12 points in the following areas: 6
             1. The MPA has been gazetted;
             2. The available information is sufficient for planning purposes;
             3. 75% of stakeholders are sensitized to the marine resources and their
                threats;
             4. An approved management plan exists but is only partly applied due to
                financial constraints;
             5. A research inventory addressing the needs of the AMP exists;
             6. The available staff is sufficient to manage the AMP;
             7. An M&E system exists, although the results are not systematically used
                for management purposes;
             8. Management objectives are sufficiently clear;
             9. Threats to the AMP have been somewhat reduced;
             10. Living conditions of the population have been somewhat improved;
             11. Environmental awareness has been improved; and
             12. 50% - 75% of stakeholders are satisfied with the process of creating the
                 AMP.
51.     Weighted average PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: At
restructuring in April 2011, the project had disbursed USD0.62 million, representing
12.6% of total disbursed funds of USD4.91 million. On this basis and as illustrated by the
table below, the weighted average of the project’s PDO achievement is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

 The METT is a part of the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) framework for assessment. It
allows reporting progress on management effectiveness and uses a scoring system. It is based on 30
questions that cover aspects related to: context, planning, inputs, processes, inputs, outputs and outcomes.
Each question can be answered by assigning a simple score ranging between 0 (poor) to 3 (excellent). So a
1 point improvement means that some aspect (answer to a given question) has either improved from poor to
satisfactory or from satisfactory to excellent.

3.5 EFFICIENCY
52.     Rating Modest: This GEF Project, like the companion Village Communities
Support Program (VCSP), does not lend itself to a traditional cost-benefit analysis. The
environmental, social and capacity-building benefits in particular are difficult to quantify.
Also, the value and cost-effectiveness of the many studies/consultancies (close to 20% of
project costs) that were carried out is hard to assess. Many of them were produced with
significant delays and a consultant had to summarize the different studies so that they
could be internalized by project staff. What remains are the micro-projects (which also
accounted for about 20% of project costs) that were financed. Unfortunately, their costs
and benefits were not systematically recorded and analyzed and, in any event, the
economic results of these investments could only be reliably assessed after several years.
53.     Nevertheless, during December 2013, a socio-economic survey was carried out by
an independent local consultant in 9 of the 11 Rural Communes (CRs) in the project area.
It covered topics related to the economic, social, organizational and institutional impact
of the micro-projects that had been financed by the project. Within the 9 CRs, a sample of
33 groups, 119 households and 146 individuals was taken. The survey instruments were
different questionnaires for each category. The groups benefitted from the following
types of micro-projects financed by the project: i) training activities (72.7%); ii)
improved seeds (48.5%); iii) creation of irrigated vegetable gardens in low lying areas
(39.4%); iv) supply of small-scale agricultural equipment (12.1%); v) supply of
equipment for solar salt drying (18.2%); vi) supply of equipment for bee keeping
(12.1%); and vii) supply of appropriate fishing nets and equipment (9.1%).
54.     The results of this survey show that the micro-projects were highly beneficial and
greatly appreciated. Some of the key findings were as follows (see Annex 3 for details):
   •      The volume of production of all groups increased considerably, and those groups
          that only had one production cycle per year decreased from 75.8% to 30.3%. Most
          groups produced two, three, or more times per year.
   •      The number of markets supplied by these groups increased from 75 to 104. Prior
          to the project most groups delivered their production to two markets and now,
          they serve three markets. Before the project, the markets served were mostly local
          (84%) and now 50% of the groups reach markets beyond their village.



                                              14
   •   The business volume of 4 out of 5 groups has increased. The increases vary from
       > 6 million GNF (9%); 3-6 million GNF (14.8% of groups); 1-3 million GNF
       (55.6% of groups); and < 1 million GNF (22.2% of groups).
   •   The main organizational changes that were brought about as a consequence of the
       micro-projects were: regular holding of meetings (97%); consensual group
       decision making (81.1%); keeping of accounting books (54.5%); application of
       technical advice by extension agents (48.5%); participative planning of activities
       (39.4%); increase in mutual financial support among group members (39.4%);
       support and advice to other village groups (21.2%); and organization of practical
       training sessions with extension agents (21.2%).

3.4 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
55.     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The discussion above shows that: (i)
relevance of the project is modest; (ii) achievement of PDO is moderately satisfactory
(MS); and (iii) efficiency is modest. Combining these ratings, the overall outcome rating
is moderately unsatisfactory (MU). Although the project performed very well after the
restructuring and achieved its revised PDO, its relevance diminished and due to the lack
of greater economic data, the efficiency of resource use cannot be definitively
determined. Also, the MS rating for achievement of PDO is the outcome of weighing the
amounts of money spent before and after restructuring. This obscures the fact that the
project’s relevance diminished considerably as a consequence of the restructuring.

3.5 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
56.     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: The income
generating activities carried out in the form of micro-projects by some 100 groups in
communities adjacent to the MPAs have had a noticeable impact on their revenues. Most
of the micro-projects seem to be economically viable since they still exist and group
members have opened up bank accounts and deposited some of their profits. Of the 94
micro-projects financed, 56 were for women’s groups (59%). This was a higher
percentage of women’s groups than the originally expected 30%.
57.     Outreach and communication activities: The project succeeded in training some
400 local beneficiaries in various topics related to environmental management and in
preparing 150 members of village and inter-village committees for their roles and
responsibilities in the co-management of the MPAs. Furthermore, in collaboration with
the National Institute of Research and Pedagogical Action, a textbook on environmental
education for primary schools was prepared and is being tested in four pilot schools. In
addition, a collaboration agreement between the CNC and local radio stations has been
signed and programs to sensitize and educate the public about environmental issues and
the protection of the MPAs are being transmitted on the air on a regular basis.
58.    Institutional Change/Strengthening: The principal Guinean institutions dealing
with coastal, marine and biodiversity management, namely OGUIPAR, the Department
of Forestry and the National Fisheries Research Institute (Centre National des Sciences
Halieutiques de Boussora), received considerable support at the national and local levels
under the project. Staff received training in topics related to social and environmental
                                           15
management of projects, environmental screening of projects and impact assessment, and
monitoring and evaluation of environmental and social safeguard policies. In addition,
staff received equipment and carried out several of the studies that were identified in the
PAD and during implementation support missions. These studies were based on specific
terms of reference and their results were thoroughly reviewed in meetings of project
stakeholders before the findings and conclusions were accepted. This contributed to a
culture of management by results otherwise lacking within the public administration.
59.     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts: The project has had a demonstration
effect that goes beyond the project area. World Bank safeguard policies regarding
environmental and social aspects of projects are now applied to all socio-economic
infrastructure projects financed by VCSP 2, which are systematically screened.
Furthermore, according to statements by the project director and the safeguards specialist,
the types of micro-projects included in local development plans (LDPs) have evolved. In
the past, environmental concerns and projects addressing them, used to be one of the least
concerns of villagers and mayors. However, over the last two years, due to the training
and sensitization activities of the project, micro-projects that protect natural resources
directly and indirectly, such as reforestation activities and more intensive agriculture in
the form of irrigated vegetable growing in low lying areas, have become more and more
frequent. They are now often in second place after social infrastructure investments such
as schools and health posts and no longer at the end of the list of priorities in local
development plans.

3.6 SUMMARY OF FINDING OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY
60.     The results of the beneficiary survey are discussed in session 3.5 (Efficiency) and
are detailed in Annex 3.


4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

61.     Rating - Substantial: After only two years of actual project implementation on
the ground, what is now needed is to consolidate the achievements. This requires the
continued reinforcement of the capacity of the institutions charged with managing the
MPAs and of the micro-projects that provide an alternative to the destructive use of
natural resources. In addition, the management committees that were created in the two
MPAs, including the village surveillance committees, need to be supported in order to
remain operational. Most important is the funding for the implementation of the
management plans for the two MPAs that have been developed. However, this funding is
not assured. The study on sustainable financing was not carried out and, so far, no
resources have been earmarked to finance the implementation of the management plans
developed for the Tristao and Alcatraz MPAs. While the Government, through the
Ministry of the Environment, is actively pursuing the establishment of a trust fund for
natural resources management, including a window for the financing of coastal/marine
protected areas, as in other countries, this initiative can be expected to take several years.
Ultimately, the fate of the MPAs will depend on what happens in the surrounding areas
and whether Guinea will follow a sustainable economic development path. But the


                                             16
project has had a demonstration effect and the Government is now better aware of the
importance and benefits of protecting the coastal marine zone and its biodiversity.


5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 BANK PERFORMANCE
62.     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry – Rating Unsatisfactory:
Overall, the PAD was comprehensive and had several detailed annexes on such topics as:
a) incremental cost analysis, b) roots-threats-analysis, and c) project intervention area and
target sites. Where the PAD was weak is in analyzing project institutional and
implementation arrangements. Nowhere does the reader get a sense of what the capacities
of the various project execution agencies were, what their staffing was and what their
budget resources were. Therefore, there was no comprehensive strategy for institutional
strengthening. It was assumed that this could be done through a series of uncoordinated
studies with technical assistance, which also led to too many consultancy contracts.
Likewise, there was insufficient attention to what would happen once the project came to
an end and no short and longer-term training plan was prepared. Furthermore, an
unsubstantiated claim was made that packages of technologies existed that would allow
the project to replace destructive use of natural resources by environmentally friendly
ones and that they had been tested during project preparation. In the end, the technical
reference manual for selected micro-projects was only prepared in 2011 and execution of
the micro-projects only started afterwards. In addition, the project as originally designed,
had too much of a pure research orientation. The results framework was overly complex
and the great number of environmental indicators with no baseline, that were supposed to
be followed and measured beyond what is feasible given local capacity constraints.
Finally, the risks of political and institutional instability were not even considered.
63.      Quality of supervision - Rating Moderately Satisfactory: During the initial years
of the project, implementation support missions did not achieve much. This was primarily
due to: (i) the overly complex project design that was not sufficiently understood by
national project staff, and (ii) political and institutional instability in the country which
led to suspension of disbursements and supervision missions by the Bank between
November 2008 and 2010. This only changed once the situation in the country was again
stable after a democratically elected government was installed during the second half of
2010. The re-engagement mission in March/April 2011 was a turning point. It greatly
simplified the project, which allowed it to get back on track. As pointed out, the
PDO/GEO and components were simplified, the results framework was redone in a
realistic manner, with baseline data, funds were reallocated, and the closing date was
extended. Also, the restructuring paper was elaborated in a participatory manner, training
in project management was provided to project staff which led to the development of a
greater sense of ownership by the client. As a result, the dialogue between the Recipient
and the Bank improved significantly and more of a partnership developed.
Recommendations that were made by implementation support missions were followed up
by actions on the part of the National Coordination Unit. The improved partnership was
most likely due to a combination of factors: a) a change in TTL/task teams and b) a more

                                             17
clearly defined project that was better understood by the Guineans, therefore easier to
successfully implement with fewer disappointments and criticisms on both sides.
Altogether, there were some 15 implementation support missions and three TTLs. The
implementation support missions only became regular at the beginning of 2011, once the
political situation had stabilized and the Bank had reengaged with the country. The
composition and skill mix of project implementation support missions were adequate and
regularly included, in addition to the TTL, environmental specialist, and specialized staff
for finance, procurement, accounting, disbursement and social safeguard measures.
Mission members came from both HQ and the field.
64.      Overall Bank performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Weaknesses in
project design and the initial poor supervision performance of Bank teams has to be
considered together with the more positive proactive approach taken at the time of
restructuring. While at the time of restructuring, a decision to cancel the project would
have been justified, the Bank was willing to take a longer-term view and to stay engaged
even while the project was at a standstill due mainly to the internal political upheaval.
The Bank prepared itself well for reengagement with the country and the project, and the
task team was well prepared once the opportunity for resumption of activities presented
itself. The task team succeeded in successfully restructuring and simplifying the project.
However, on balance, Bank performance was Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
65.      Government Performance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: Political and
institutional instability over two years negatively affected project implementation
progress and government commitment. However, once the political turmoil in the country
had been overcome, the newly elected government showed its interest and commitment
to the project. The Presidential Decree creating the two MPAs was signed on May 30,
2013. In 2012, the Government organized a multi-donor workshop, including
representatives of the mining companies, international donors and NGOs, to discuss
possibilities for establishing a trust fund for natural resource conservation with the
participation of all the major international donors of Guinea and the international mining
companies active in the country. Unfortunately, this initiative has not yet led to tangible
results but the Ministry of Environment is continuing to work on the establishment of a
trust fund for natural resource management and protection of specific sites.
66.     Implementing Agency Performance - Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The
overall management and coordination of the project was ensured by the Project National
Coordination Unit (Cellule Nationale de Coordination, CNC) initially under the Ministry
of Planning and later on under the Ministry of Territorial Administration and
Decentralization. The VCSP CNC had already shown its strength during the
implementation of the first phase of VCSP. It was strengthened under the project with the
addition of key staff: a technical specialist in NRM familiar with GEF policies and
procedures, a safeguards specialist, an M&E specialist, and a specialist in environmental
education and training for people at the local level. This team was competent and
committed and did a good job of explaining the project’s objective to local stakeholders
(population, local politicians and elected officials, and decentralized staff of the various
ministries involved) and in getting them to buy in. This required sociological, as well as

                                            18
technical and pedagogical, skills. It was supported by a Natural Resource Management
(NRM) focal point based in Boke (provincial capital close to the MPAs) and by
decentralized teams at the local level. This project management set-up was supported by
various ministerial staff at the local level and allowed for efficient identification,
implementation and supervision of NRM and income generating micro-projects.
However, project management had some weaknesses in the administration of consultancy
contracts and studies and in the timely preparation of procurement plans. Also, the results
of some of the studies were not fully internalized and diffused beyond the PIU. For
components 1 and 2 of the project, OGUIPAR (formerly OGDBAP), under the Ministry
of Environment, Forests and Water, the National Directorate for Forestry and Water
(DNEF) and the National Fisheries Institute (CNSH-B) were in charge. With the support
of the CNC, these institutions performed their responsibilities in a satisfactory manner.
67.     Overall Borrower Performance - Rating Moderately Satisfactory: After a
difficult start-up period and once political stability had returned to the country and the
project had been restructured and simplified, the recipient and the implementing agencies
performed remarkably well. It is also noteworthy, that all project staff was selected on a
competitive basis and that the Government abstained from interference in project day-to-
day management decisions. The Ministry of Environment continues its efforts to set up a
trust fund with a special window to finance activities related to MPAs, although short-run
prospects are doubtful.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

68.    Creation and effective MPA management is a long term process and should be
contingent upon securing funding for several phases of a project. Even if there is a
very strong project management unit, it is unlikely that this process can be finalized
within the usual 5-year time framework. Consequently, this type of project should only
be launched if there are good prospects for one or more follow-on operations, financed by
the Bank and/or other donors. At least two 5-year consecutive projects project funding
should be considered.
69.    Sustainability of biodiversity conservation projects: Given the fact that the long-
term impact of projects of this type depends primarily on financing the recurrent costs for
managing the protected areas created, a sustainability instrument must be put in place
before project end. Conservation Trust Funds are the current instruments used in many
Latin American and African countries, and this should also be pursued in Guinea.
70.     A regional approach to managing coastal marine biodiversity should be
fostered: Given that there are several coastal, marine and biodiversity management
projects ongoing in West Africa, the GEF and the World Bank should consider
developing a regional approach for their collective management rather than the present
country by country approach
71.    To enhance sustainability of outcomes of this biodiversity project, consideration
should be given to use a regional approach and to use the Conservation Trust Fund
already in place in neighboring Guinea Bissau with a window for Guinea-Conakry.



                                            19
72.     Stability of the Bank and Borrower core teams are important for high-risk
environments like Guinea and the use of frequent contacts between the TTL and the
project management unit via Skype for example is crucial for timely trouble-shooting.
73.     The CDD approach melded with conservation incentives (income generating
micro-projects) works well even at times of political instability. Such investments can
proceed “under the radar” at decentralized levels, building local organizational
frameworks, economic activities and social capital insulated from troubled national
politics.
74.    Building capacity and empowering community beneficiaries through
continuous “learning by doing” which extends beyond the specific micro-project cycle
in important and is to be encouraged.
75.     Technologies for sustainable use of ecosystem resources: The mere existence of
technologies for sustainable use of ecosystem resources that can reduce pressure on
natural resources and habitats is not enough. These technologies must be thoroughly
mastered and adapted to the local circumstances. In addition, there must be an institution
with adequately trained technical staff that can demonstrate their feasibility and benefits
to the local population before they will be adopted to replace older, more destructive
technologies.
76.     For income generating activities and micro-projects, two manuals should be
prepared (one technical and the other one concentrating on management aspects) that
cover the most common issues, problems, challenges and technology solutions for
sustainable use of mangrove wetland ecosystems that stretch from Senegal to northern
Angola. Sociological aspects of group formation and selection of participants and
leadership development need particular attention to avoid elite capture or failure. Also,
rudimentary business plans must be developed to ensure a reasonable chance for
sustainability.
77.    Institutional strengthening: No single institution can implement this kind of
multi-dimensional and multi-sectorial project. Therefore, institutional strengthening
needs focused attention, and an integrated approach should be considered that goes
beyond short-term consultancies and disparate studies.
78.     M&E: Project indicators and outcomes have to be carefully defined, baseline data
should be collected at project preparation, and indicators must be smart and measurable.
If no baseline data is available for an indicator, such indicator should not be included in
the project.
79.    Use of global environmental indicators. Project teams should not be forced to
include global environmental indicators which are over-ambitious and cannot be
measured during the project’s lifetime for the sole purpose of obtaining GEF financing.
A harmonization of Bank and GEF core indicators should be conducted to agree on a set
of measurable indicators acceptable to both the Bank and GEF.

ANNEX 2: OUTPUT BY COMPONENT

1. Component 1: Protection and Conservation of Coastal RAMSAR sites (PAD) -
   (Supporting the Creation and Management of Marine Protected Areas in Ramsar List
   Sites – Title after restructuring)
2. The sub-components of this component were the establishment of integrated
   conservation zones; conservation zone management, and impact monitoring and
   evaluation.
3. The results obtained were as follows:
   •   Result 1: Two MPAs of Alcatraz and Tristao have been created by Ministerial
       order and subsequently by Presidential Decrees (No. D/2013/037/PRG/SGG and
       No. D/2013/038/PRG/SGG of February 20, 2013). Also, the management plans
       for the two MPAs are available. However, their funding is not yet assured.
   •   Result 2: A permanent environmental monitoring system for the MPAs has been
       put in place and is operational. The system includes the installation and training of
       local conservation teams, including the necessary surveillance and control
       equipment (speed boats, radio VHS, GPS, motorcycles). Also, local committees
       for the co-management and supervision of the MPAs have been put in place. The
       GEF Management Effectiveness Tracking Tools (METT) that allows measuring
       the effectiveness of the management of the MPAs is available and has been
       transmitted to the GEF Secretariat.
   •   Result 3: A tool kit to create, manage and follow the development of MPAs has
       been developed. This tool kit will facilitate the creation and the management of
       other MPAs.
   •   In addition, several studies have been carried out in the MPAs (inventories of
       marine turtles, sharks, other native animals, flowers, and birds) as well as a study
       concerning land tenure dynamics and conflict). These studies have been available
       since September 2011. Provisional reports concerning three inventories (fish,
       reptiles and frogs. Finally, a mapping of potential future MPAs has been
       undertaken.
4. Component 2: Enabling Environment for Integrated Coastal Zone Management
   (PAD) - (Capacity Building for MPAs Management – Title after restructuring)
5. This component included targeted capacity building of the Ministry of Environment,
   a study to identify options for financial sustainability of the establishment and
   management of coastal conservation zones, the creation of an environmental
   information system, the creation of a permanent forum regarding the conservation of
   marine and coastal areas, and the creation and operationalization of local committees
   to manage the MPAs.
6. The results obtained were as follows:
   •   Result 1: 100 staff of the Ministry of Environment have been trained in various
       topics related to the management of MPAs compared to an original target of
       70.The main topics covered were social and environmental impact analysis;

                                            23
       project management; environmental monitoring; and screening of micro-projects
       for their environmental impact. Alone in two years, during 2011 and 2912, 80
       staff of ME has received some form of training. Nevertheless, specialized
       training for four trainers of ME in participatory management of MPAs that were
       foreseen could not be carried out due to time constraints, as the training would
       have lasted beyond the closing date.
   •   Result 2: The study to identify options for financial sustainability of the
       establishment and management of coastal conservation zones was not carried out.
       However, a national workshop was held in March 2012 to discuss this topic. In
       addition to government representatives, representatives of international donors
       and mining companies participated and there was a consensus that such a fund is
       needed. The Ministry of Environment is pursuing this initiative.
   •   Result 3: The equipment for the management of the database of the environmental
       information system have been acquired and installed. Before going any further,
       the last implementation support and supervision mission recommended evaluating
       in more detail the existing system within the Ministry of the Environment to
       decide on the next steps. This study has been completed and awaits actions by
       ME. The Ministry will have to establish functional links with decentralized
       government institutions in order to collect data at the local level. Unless and until
       this is done, the environmental information system will not be fully integrated.
   •   Result 4: Three fora regarding the conservation of marine and coastal areas have
       been held in December 2008, March 2012 and September 2013. Each forum was
       well attended and has provided a space for the exchange of information and
       allowed for coordination of activities among the key stakeholders. During the last
       forum in September 2013, participants recommended that an inter-ministerial
       committee be created whereby the participants will be nominated by ministerial
       decisions. This committee will be charged to implement the recommendations
       that come out of these fora. The Ministry of Environment will have to provide the
       institutional support and operating costs necessary to ensure that the for a will
       continue to function after project closure.
   •   Result 5: Village supervision committees (comites villageois de suivi – CVS) and
       inter-district committees have been formally established in all of the 7 CRDs that
       constitute the MPAs of Tristao and Alcatraz. Members of these organizations
       have received initial training and were equipped with a motorcycle so that they
       can be operational. However, given the short period of time since their creation
       these CVCs are not very strong. They will continue to receive some minimal
       support from staff of VCSP, which closes in December 2014. Thereafter, funding
       should be earmarked by the Government to support the committees, otherwise it
       is unlikely they will remain functional after project closure.
7. Component 3: Local Investment Fund (PAD). Eliminated during restructuring
   mission and merged with new Component 3.
8. Component 4: Support for Local Capacity Building (PAD) – merged with new
   category 2 above.


                                            24
9. New Component 3: Support to participative local development (Title after
   restructuring)
10. This component provided funding to assist populations of targeted CRDs adapt
    existing local development plans (PDL) using a more holistic development approach
    emphasizing sustainable use and conservation activities. It provided grants to
    communities for such micro-projects that were not eligible under VCSP. The
    objective was to reduce human pressure on the natural resource base. The target after
    the restructuring was to have 66 micro-projects financed.
   •   Result 1: Each of the 11 CRD covered by the project has today an up-to-date local
       development plan (PDL). These plans were developed jointly with the local
       population and personnel of the technical services at this level. The PDL: a)
       allowed for the full participation of all social strata; b) took into account all the
       preoccupations of the population; and c) took into account the environmental
       dimension in the planning process. This process has allowed the beneficiaries to
       improve their planning capacity and to better understand and incorporate NRM
       issues in their PDLs and their Annual Investments Plans (PAI).
   •   Result 2: In total, the project financed 31 annual investment programs (PAI).
       Instead of a planned number of 66 micro-projects, 94 were financed. 56 micro-
       projects were for women (59%). The total cost of these PAI was GNF 8 909 582
       782 (USD 1,310,232) and the contribution of the beneficiaries was 363 million
       GNF (USD 53,382). The micro-projects were for the following activities: (i) 27%
       for irrigated vegetable growing in low laying areas; (ii) 35% for NRM projects
       (restoration of vegetative cover, creation of communal forests); (iii) 9% for
       fisheries; and (iv) 29% for other types of micro-projects (livestock, salt
       production, production of honey).
11. Component 5 – now Component 4: Program Management, Monitoring and
    Evaluation
12. The objective of this component was to ensure cost-effective, efficient and
    streamlined implementation of the project as a whole.
13. Overall, project management was satisfactory in all domains: M&E, financial
    management, procurement, environmental and social aspects, and environmental
    education.

ANNEX 3: FINDINGS OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY

1. As indicated in the main text, this type of project does not lend itself to classical
   quantitative cost-benefit analysis. Especially the environmental, social and capacity-
   building benefits defy quantification. Nevertheless, during December 2013, a socio-
   economic survey was carried out by a consultant, Mr. Saliou Cherif Diallo to shed
   light on the changes that were brought about as a consequence of the project. This
   study shows that the micro-projects were instrumental in building up considerable
   social capital that will allow these groups to be successful in the future. Each project
   – and that was one of the selection criteria – allows to reduce the pressure on the
   consumption of wood either directly, as in the case of solar salt production instead of
   using firewood, or indirectly by providing income to women from vegetable growing
   in low laying areas instead of having to sell firewood.
2. The following is a summary of the survey and its results: The socio-economic
   survey was carried out during November/December 2013 in 9 Rural Communes (CR)
   in the project area. It covered topics related to the economic, social, organizational
   and institutional impact of the micro-projects that had been financed by the project.
   Within the 9 CR, a sample of 33 groups, 119 households and 146 individuals was
   taken. The survey instruments were different questionnaires for each category.
3. The key results for the groups interviewed were as follows:
   •   The size of the 33 groups interviewed was 912 people. Of the interviewees, 25%
       were women and 75% were men. The average size of the groups is 28 people.
   •   The principal activities of these groups were: vegetable growing (48.5%), salt
       production (18.2%), bee keeping (12.1%), fishing (12.1%), and rice production
       (9.1%).
4. The groups benefitted from the following types of micro-projects financed by the
   project:
   •   Training activities (72.7%)
   •   Improved seeds ((48.5%)
   •   Creation of vegetable gardens in low laying areas (39.4%)
   •   Supply of small-scale agricultural equipment (12.1%)
   •   Supply of equipment for solar salt drying (18.2%)
   •   Supply of equipment for bee keeping (12.1%)
   •   Supply of fishing nets and equipment (9.1%)
5. The volume of production of all groups increased considerably, and those groups that
   only had one production cycle per year decreased from 75.8% to 30.3%. Most groups
   produced two, three and more times per year.
6. The number of markets that were supplied by these groups increased from 75 to 104.
   Before most groups delivered their production to two markets and now, they serve


                                            26
   three markets. Before the project, the markets served were mostly local (84%) and
   now 50% of the groups reach markets beyond their village.
7. The business volume of 4 out of 5 groups has increased. The increases vary from
   •   >6 million GNF (9%)
   •   3-6 million GNF (14.8% of groups)
   •   1-3 million GNF (55.6% of groups)
   •   < 1 million GNF (22.2% of groups).
8. The main organizational changes that were brought about as a consequence of the
   micro-projects were:
   •   Regular holding of meetings (97%)
   •   Consensual group decision-making (81.1%)
   •   Keeping of accounting books (54.5%)
   •   Application of technical advice by extension agents (48.5%)
   •   Participative planning of activities (39.4%)
   •   Increase in mutual financial support among group members (39.4%)
   •   Support and advice to other village groups (21.2%)
   •   Organization of practical training sessions with extension agents (21.2%)
9. Also, as a consequence of the project, the following group internal initiatives were
   developed: a) membership contributions, b) search for credit from various sources, c)
   capacity building of members through greater interaction with technical services of
   the Government, d) demand for support from other partners, e) purchase and sale of
   products on a group basis, and f) demand for land allocation from land owners for
   vegetable growing.
10. All groups that were interviewed stated that they would continue their activities
    initiated under the project.
11. The main reasons for this new group dynamic are:
   •   Solidarity of members
   •   Cohesion among members
   •   Giving of cash credit to members
   •   Capacity increases among members/ Investment in human capital formation
   •   Collective will for development
   •   Fact that group members get together regularly on the same site
   •   Transparency in group affairs
   •   Increase in revenues.

                                  République de Guinée

 PROJET DE GESTION COTIERE ET MARINE DE LA BIODIVERSITE (PGCMB)

                      RAPPORT D’ACHEVEMENT -RESUME-
                               - Décembre 2013 -

Le Projet de Gestion Côtière et Marine de la Biodiversité -PGCMB- (le Projet) a été initié
par le Gouvernement guinéen (l’emprunteur) avec l’appui financier du Fonds pour
l’Environnement Mondial (FEM), à hauteur de 5 millions USD, pour résoudre des
problèmes liés à la préservation des écosystèmes et à la protection de la biodiversité de la
zone côtière de la Guinée. Le PGCMB, mis en œuvre avec l’appui technique de la
Banque Mondiale (la Banque), a été approuvé par le Conseil d’Administration de la
Banque le 22 juin 2006, et est entré en vigueur le 20 juillet 2007. La date de clôture
initialement fixée au 31 décembre 2011 a été reportée au 31 décembre 2013 suite à la
suspension des décaissements par Banque due à la transition militaire intervenue en
Guinée entre 2008 et 2010.
Le PGCMB est considéré comme un projet complémentaire au VCSP2 dans les
Communes Rurales (CR) où il est mis en œuvre. L’effet synergique attendu lors de
l’exécution concomitante des deux (2) Projets se décrit comme suit : l’appui du VCSP2
pour mettre en œuvre des plans de développement local des CR côtières est plus axé sur
la réalisation d’infrastructures sociales et le renforcement des capacités locales pour une
meilleure gouvernance ; tandis que le PGCMB se focalise sur une assistance technique
permettant d’évoluer vers une approche de planification locale intégrant la gestion
durable des ressources naturelles, l’élaboration et le suivi des plans de gestion des AMP
de façon inclusive et concertée.
L’objectif de développement global du PGCMB (initial) est de promouvoir la gestion
rationnelle de la biodiversité côtière de la Guinée tant à des fins de conservation que de
développement durable dans les zones prioritaires choisies, en mettant un accent
particulier sur l’assistance aux communautés vivant à l’intérieur et autour de ces zones
prioritaires. L’objectif environnemental global du PGCMB est de promouvoir la
conservation d’habitats et d’espèces d’importance nationale et mondiale le long de la côte
guinéenne, dans les zones prioritaires sélectionnées englobant les sites RAMSAR côtiers.
 En 2011, une mission conjointe Banque -gouvernement guinéen a permis de restructurer
 le Projet. Cette restructuration a donné lieu : (i) à la simplification et la fusion de
 L’Objectif de Développement du Projet (ODP) et l’Objectif de Gestion
 Environnementale (OGE) ; (ii) au regroupement des activités du projet sous 4
 composantes au lieu des 5 initiales; et (iii) à la réallocation des fonds et au rehaussement
 du seuil du Compte Spécial afin d’accélérer l’exécution physique et financière du projet,
 interrompue suite à la suspension des décaissements.
Le PGCMB s’achèvera le 31 décembre 2013.. Dans le rapport d’achèvement élaboré, la
performance globale et les résultats des composantes ont été notés à partir des indicateurs

                                             29
clés de performance définis dans le document d’évaluation du projet et amendés à l’issue
de la restructuration du projet.

1. EVALUATION DE LA CONCEPTION DU PROJET

La qualité de la conception est satisfaisante. Les objectifs du projet sont jugés :
 i) pertinents, au regard des enjeux environnementaux de la zone de projet et de son
    importance pour la protection de la biodiversité ;
 ii) cohérents, avec les axes prioritaires de la Stratégie d’Assistance à la Guinée (SAG)
     et les priorités du gouvernement guinéen exprimées dans le DSRP, ils sont aussi
     conformes aux différentes conventions internationales auxquelles la Guinée s’est
     engagée, et, la logique d’intervention est maîtrisée
 iii) efficaces, les objectifs globaux tels que stipulés dans le document de restructuration
     du Projet, ont été atteints. Certains impacts attendus ont été confirmés par les
     résultats des enquêtes socio-économiques. Cependant, concernant les aspects de
     pérennisation, il aurait été souhaitable d'avoir plus de temps et de ressources pour la
     consolidation des acquis à travers la poursuite du renforcement de capacités des
     acteurs locaux.

2. ATTEINTE DES OBJECTIFS ET RÉALISATIONS
2.1 Objectif de développement
Selon les conclusions de l’étude d’impact du projet sur le changement socio économique
autour des AMP, le renforcement des capacités des CR et des groupements a permis
d’asseoir les bases solides en matière de gestion responsable et concertée des ressources
naturelles. Les infrastructures réalisées ont eu un impact important sur le bien être des
populations bénéficiaires et les activités alternatives se sont développées. Le projet a eu
des effets positifs sensibles sur l’intensification et la sédentarisation de la production
agricole au niveau des CR. L’atteinte de l’objectif de développement et l’Objectif de
gestion environnementale est jugés satisfaisante.

2.2 Réalisations par composante
A l’issue de la mise en œuvre du projet, le niveau des principaux indicateurs de résultat
montre de façon générale une exécution satisfaisante des activités.
2.2.1 Composante 1 : Création et appui à la gestion d’Aires Marines Protégées (AMP)
dans les sites Ramsar : Deux AMP d’une superficie respective de 85 000 et 5 000 ha ont
été créées par décret présidentiel. Le plan de gestion de Tristao a été élaboré et validé par
l’ensemble des acteurs impliqués dans le processus de gestion des AMP. Un projet de
Plan de Gestion d’Alcatraz a été élaboré et le processus de sa validation est en attente de
l’avis de différents partenaires techniques et financiers.
Des inventaires ont été effectués par les techniciens du Centre National des Sciences
Halieutiques de Boussoura (CNSHB) et de la Direction Nationale des Eaux et Forêts pour
alimenter les différents Plans de Gestion des deux AMP. La synthèse de ces différentes
études a été restituée aux acteurs locaux pour améliorer leur connaissance sur
l’environnement des AMP.


                                             30
Un système de suivi des AMP a été mis en place à travers : i) la formation de l’équipe de
conservateurs et de surveillants locaux et leur dotation en équipements de surveillance et
de contrôles (vedettes, Radio VHF, GPS, moto et moyens de fonctionnement) et, ii) la
réalisations des études et des inventaires pour permettre d’avoir une situation de référence
sur la biodiversité des AMP. Les fiches METT 7 décrivant la situation de référence et la
situation à date de chaque AMP sont disponibles. Ces fiches ont été renseignées par
l’Office Guinéen des Parcs et Réserves (OGUIPAR). Les organes de gestion et de
surveillance dans les zones d’influence directes des AMP de Tristao et Alcatraz ont
bénéficié également de l’appui logistique (fourniture de 10 vélos) pour les rendre
opérationnels sur le terrain.

Une boîte à outils transposables pour créer, gérer et suivre les AMP a été développée.
Les résultats de cette composante sont jugés très satisfaisants.

2.2.2 Composante 2 : Renforcement des capacités pour la gestion participative des
AMP : Le Projet a appuyé la formation de cadres et agents sur différents thèmes relatifs à
la gestion des AMP.
Un appui logistique (motos tout terrain), a été fait en faveur des ADL, CCF et aux
conservateurs des AMP, un véhicule de liaison, deux vedettes équipées et des radios VHF
pour la surveillance des AMP, ainsi que de nombreux équipements et matériels
informatiques ont été livrés au Ministère de l’environnement.

Un atelier sur le processus de mise en place d’un mécanisme de financement durable des
AMP tenu en mars 2012 qui a regroupé les principaux partenaires techniques financiers
et, le Gouvernement Guinéen, ,des Sociétés Minières et de consultants internationaux a
recommandé principalement la mise en place d’un fonds fiduciaire pour la conservation
de la biodiversité en Guinée permettant d’assurer un financement durable de la stratégie
nationale de la biodiversité et des projets d’offset.
Le projet a mis à la disposition du centre d’observation de suivi et d’informations
environnementales (COSIE). des équipements informatiques (serveur) pour la mise en
place d’une base de données. Une évaluation du système d’information existant au niveau
du COSIE a été réalisée.
 Un espace de concertation entre les acteurs intervenant dans la zone du Projet, dont les
Sociétés minières, a été mis en place à travers un forum qui a réalisé trois sessions.. Des
Comités Villageois de Suivi et des comités Inter Districts sont mis en place dans toutes
les CR constituant les AMP de Tristao et Alcatraz. Ces structures ont bénéficié des
formations et ont été dotées en moyens (vélos) pour les rendre opérationnels.
Les résultats de la composante sont jugés satisfaisants
2.2.3 Composante 3 : Appui au processus de développement local participatif et
décentralisé : Un dispositif d’appui des CR bénéficiaires a été mis en place pour aider les
collectivités à élaborer, mettre en œuvre et suivre leurs Plans de Développement Locale
(PDL) et leurs Programmes Annuels d’Investissement (PAI) et subventionner les
microprojets offrant des moyens d’existence alternatifs aux acteurs locaux.

                                                 31
 Planification locale : chacune des 11 CR couvertes par le PGCMB a actualisé son PDL
   en y incluant les aspects liés à la gestion des ressources naturelles. Les activités
   d’actualisation se sont déroulées avec l’appui des intermédiaires techniques publics
   (SPD, STD, CCF, CA) et privés (Agent de Développement Local, Consultants GRN,
   ONG et PME), mobilisés et formés à cet effet.
 Financement des Programmes Annuels d’Investissement (PAI): le Projet a financé 31
   PAI, comprenant 94 microprojets dont 59% en faveur des femmes. La répartition des
   microprojets par domaine : 27% du domaine de la valorisation des terres basses
   (aménagement des périmètres maraîchers), 35 % l’environnement (restauration du
   couvert végétal création de forêts communautaires à travers la production d’essences
   forestière), 9% de la pêche et autres activités (élevage, saliculture, apiculture, etc.)
   représentant 29%.
En outre, des études techniques ont été également réalisées portant sur l’identification et
la description des meilleures pratiques de conservation et de restauration des sols ainsi
que sur l’identification des modules de formation en gestion des ressources naturelles et
de la biodiversité.
Les résultats de la composante sont jugés satisfaisants
2.2.4 Composante 4 : Gestion, Suivi et Evaluation du Programme :
 Gestion Fiduciaire : La comptabilité du projet a été régulièrement tenue et les états ont
  été élaborés directement à partir du logiciel SUCESS. Le projet a élaboré et produit
  régulièrement les Rapports de Suivi Financier. Les états financiers du Projet ont été
  audités et jugés sans réserve et les rapports ont été transmis à l’IDA avant la date du
  30 juin de chaque année comme stipulé dans l’accord de don. Le taux de décaissement
  global du Projet est de 98, 24% au 16 décembre 2013.
   A la reprise des activités en 2011, marquée par la restructuration du projet, un nouveau
   Plan de Passation des Marchés (PPM) a été préparé pour la période de janvier 2011 au
   30 juin 2013. Durant cette période, le PPM a été actualisé à l’occasion de chacune des
   six missions de supervision.
 Suivi-évaluation : Un dispositif de suivi-évaluation a été mis en place dans toutes les
  CR couvertes par le projet à travers des outils de collecte et de traitement des données.
  Les principaux acteurs ont été formés. Des outils de suivi écologique et de
  surveillance des AMP ont été développés et intégrés dans le dispositif de suivi-
  évaluation du projet. Un SIG avec des fonds de cartes géo référencés a été développé.
  Le cadre de suivi des résultats a été régulièrement renseigné. Un outil de suivi du
  PTBA et du PPM a été conçu par le projet et régulièrement mis à jour.
 Suivi des mesures de sauvegardes environnementales et sociales : Le Cadre de Gestion
  Environnementale et Sociale et le Cadre de Politiques de Réinstallation élaborés lors
  de la préparation du projet ont été actualisés et validés. Le Projet a formé les agents de
  terrain (CCF et ADL), les membres des Comités de Suivi des Actions
  Environnementales (COSAE) et élus locaux en politique de sauvegarde et hygiène
  environnementale en les familiarisant avec le nouveau formulaire simplifié et le PGES
  des microprojets. Pour faire face au financement des mesures d’atténuation des
  impacts négatifs éventuels des microprojets, une allocation budgétaire a toujours été
  réservée chaque année dans le budget du Projet. Le projet a communiqué
  régulièrement avec le BGEEE en lui transmettant les exemplaires des formulaires de

                                             32
   screening renseignés pour chacun des microprojets contenus dans le Programme
   Annuel d’Investissement (PAI) ainsi que les rapports de mise en œuvre du Cadre de
   Gestion Environnementale et Sociale (CGES).
 Education Environnementale : Les acteurs locaux les membres des Comités Villageois
  de Surveillance (CVS) et Comités Interdistricts de Surveillance (CIDS) ont été formés
  sur des thématiques diverses et sur leurs rôles et responsabilités dans la cogestion des
  AMP. Dans le cadre de la collaboration avec l’Institut National de Recherche et
  d’Actions Pédagogiques un manuel d’éducation environnementale destiné aux écoles
  élémentaires, a été élaboré et vulgarisé au niveau de 4 écoles pilotes. Par ailleurs, une
  convention de collaboration a été signée avec les radios rurales et communautaires de
  la zone côtière pour la diffusion des messages de sensibilisation et d’éducation à
  l’environnement et à la protection des AMP.
Les résultats de la composante 4 sont jugés très satisfaisants.
                  2.3. Performance de la Banque et de l'emprunteur :

a. Performance de la Banque
La Banque a été régulièrement présente auprès des équipes nationales et a contribué à la
mobilisation des équipes pluridisciplinaires de consultants ayant une bonne connaissance
et de l’expérience en matière de gestion des ressources naturelles, de la biodiversité et du
développement local durable. Le projet a été conçu sur la base d’expériences vécues dans
d’autres pays. Toutefois, la phase préparatoire du projet a été très longue, près de quatre
(4) ans même si à terme, les délais d’approbation du projet ont été relativement courts.
L’option d’intégrer le Projet à la structure déjà opérationnelle du VCSP2 a permis de
faciliter sa mise en œuvre dès la mise en vigueur.
La performance de la Banque sur la préparation est jugée satisfaisante.
De 2007 à 2009, seulement deux missions de supervision ont été réalisées par la Banque.
Pendant cette période l’efficacité de la Banque a été jugée insuffisante. Après la période
de transition 2009-2010, le Projet a régulièrement bénéficié de deux missions de
supervision par an y compris la mission de revue à mi-parcours qui s’est déroulée en
janvier 2012. Ces missions de supervision ont abouti à des constats et des
recommandations pertinentes contenues dans les aide-mémoires transmis à la partie
guinéenne.
Suite à la suspension des décaissements consécutive à la détérioration de la situation
sociopolitique du pays (2009-2010), une de ces missions de supervision a conduit à la
restructuration du Projet.
Par ailleurs, depuis le démarrage du Projet en 2007, le PGCMB a connu trois chargés de
Projet. Les relations de travail de l’organisme d’exécution avec la chargée du projet (Task
manager) à la Banque d’une part, la mission résidente d’autre part, après la
restructuration du Projet, n’ont souffert d’aucune ambiguïté dans la définition des
domaines de compétences et des rôles respectifs. Pour cette période, l’efficacité de la
Banque a été jugée très satisfaisante.
La supervision globale de la Banque est jugée satisfaisante.
Performance d’ensemble : Dans l’ensemble, l’efficacité de la Banque est jugée
satisfaisante.

                                            33
         b. Performance de l’emprunteur
b.1. Performance du Gouvernement
Le Gouvernement a favorisé le processus consultatif de la base au sommet dans la
conception du projet. Il avait procédé à la ratification de plusieurs conventions relatives à
la gestion de la biodiversité et des zones humides, donnant ainsi une base légale au projet.
L’emprunteur a activement participé à la préparation à la diffusion des informations sur
le projet auprès des bailleurs de fonds et des ONG. Par ailleurs, l’emprunteur a
pleinement participé à la conception et à la préparation du projet par l’allocation de fonds
de contrepartie.
La performance du gouvernement dans la préparation du projet est jugée satisfaisante.
Le démarrage du projet a accusé quelques difficultés, en raison des troubles sociaux à
l’époque. A la date de clôture initiale (31/12/2011), toutes les activités n’avaient pas pu
être terminées à cause des problèmes internes liés à l’instabilité politique que le pays a
connue de 2009-2010. En conséquence, un temps additionnel était nécessaire pour
l’atteinte des PDO du Projet.
Le Gouvernement a fait signer dans les délais les actes relatifs à la création des deux
AMP de Tristao et d’Alcatraz. Aussi, la tutelle exercée a été orientée vers l’appui conseil
que le contrôle ; l’organisme d’exécution a évolué sans ingérence de la tutelle.
Le comité de pilotage du PACV qui a servi de CP au Projet, s’est réunit de façon
régulière, une fois par an, pour valider les différents PTBA et rapports d’exécution, et
approuver les différentes modifications des manuels de procédures.
Malgré ces résultats, le processus qui devrait aboutir à la mise en place d’un fonds de
financement durable des AMP, n’est pas encore été finalisé à l’achèvement du Projet.
La performance du Gouvernement dans la mise en œuvre du Projet a été jugée
satisfaisante.
Performance d’ensemble : La performance d’ensemble du Gouvernement est jugée
satisfaisante.
b.2. Performance de l’organe d’exécution
En plus des études qui ont été réalisées et vulgarisées auprès de différents acteurs, la
CNC a appuyé la mise à la disposition des CR et des services techniques d’un référentiel
technique des microprojets GRN/AGR, des documents portant sur les textes
réglementaires de GRN traduits dans les principales langues de la zone d’intervention,
des formulaires de sélections environnementales et sociales des microprojets et, un guide
de passation des marchés au niveau communautaire. Une base de données relationnelle
pour le suivi des indicateurs d’exécution et d’impact a été créée. L’analyse de la matrice
des résultats a montré que tous les indicateurs du Projet sont atteints.
Le Comité Technique d’Exécution (CTE) s’est tenu régulièrement pour le cadrage et le
suivi de la mise des activités du Projet. Des missions d’appui et de supervision interne ont
été réalisées régulièrement.
Les performances de l’organisme d’exécution sont jugées très satisfaisantes.
Performance d’ensemble de l’emprunteur : La performance d’ensemble de
l’emprunteur est jugée satisfaisante
3. Pérennisation
3.1 Durabilité



                                             34
Dans l’ensemble, le maintien des acquis du PGCMB est probable à condition que les CR
arrivent à mobiliser plus de ressources financières locales en faveur de la gestion des
ressources naturelles pour soutenir la dynamique. En ce sens, l’implication des sociétés
privées comme les compagnies minières dans l’appui aux CR selon l’approche
participative est un facteur de durabilité du projet. De nouvelles activités alternatives,
autres que celles financées par le PGCMB sont réalisées et suivies par les structures
mises en place avec l’appui du projet. Selon l’enquête menée, tous les groupements
enquêtés s’accordent à ce que les activités entreprises seront continuelles après l’arrêt du
projet.
3.2. Reproductibilité :

  Dans le cadre de la Composante 1, il a été développé une boîte à outils qui
  capitalise les outils conçus, les étapes de leur mise en œuvre ainsi que les expériences
  acquises.
  Pour la Composante 2, une plate-forme de coordination (forum côtier)
  comprenant des représentants de toutes les parties prenantes au Projet a été mise en
  place pour échanger sur les enjeux de la gestion de l’environnement côtier et marin, et
  accéder aux leçons apprises sur le projet.
  La Composante 3 mise en œuvre dans le cadre du PACV2, a permis de dérouler
  des expériences opérationnelles en matière de gestion transparente des fonds et
  d’identification des enjeux environnementaux à la base à travers le diagnostic
  socioéconomique local.
  La composante 4 a élaboré et vulgarisé des manuels de gestion et de suivi ainsi
  que des formulaires de sélection environnementale des projets, auprès des
  bénéficiaires. De même plusieurs études sur les pratiques locales et la dynamique
  environnementale ont été capitalisés.
