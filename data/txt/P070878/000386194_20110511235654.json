coastal\n            biodiversity for both conservation and sustainable\n            development ends in selected priority areas. The project was\n            approved on June 22, 2006 and became effective on July 20,\n            2007. The Global Environment Fund (GEF) grant amount is USD5\n            million and the disbursement amount to date is USD0.62\n            million representing a 12.32 percent disbursement rate.\n            Given the suspension of disbursements, implementation of\n            project activities came to a halt which led to a rating of\n            moderately unsatisfactory of both progress towards achieving\n            the objective and the overall implementation progress. The\n            restructuring paper seeks the approval of the Executive\n            Directors to introduce changes to the project, and\n            accompanying amendments to the Project's legal\n            documents. The changes include: (i) a revision of the\n            Project Development Objectives (PDO); (ii) a reduction in\n            the scope of project components; (iii) an extension of the\n            project closing date by 24 months, from December 31, 2011 to\n            December 31, 2013; and (iv) a reallocation of the grant\n            proceeds and an increase in the ceiling of the special\n            account from its current USD550, 000 to USD1, 000,000. The\n            main reason for the changes is to minimize the impact of the\n            suspension of disbursements since December 2008 following\n            the political and social unrest in the country."}, "docdt": "2011-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
