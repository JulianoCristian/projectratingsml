     environment outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            given the fact that the long-term impact of projects of this\n            type depends primarily on financing the recurrent costs for\n            managing the protected areas created, a sustainability\n            instrument must be put in place before project end.\n            Conservation Trust Funds are the current instruments used in\n            many Latin American and African countries, and this should\n            also be pursued in Guinea.  To enhance sustainability of\n            outcomes of this biodiversity project, consideration should\n            be given to use a regional approach and to use the\n            Conservation Trust Fund already in place in neighboring\n            Guinea Bissau with a window for Guinea-Conakry. No single\n            institution can implement this kind of multi-dimensional and\n            multi-sectorial project. Therefore, institutional\n            strengthening needs focused attention, and an integrated\n            approach should be considered that goes beyond short-term\n            consultancies and disparate studies.  Project indicators and\n            outcomes have to be carefully defined, baseline data should\n            be collected at project preparation, and indicators must be\n            smart and measurable. If no baseline data is available for\n            an indicator, such indicator should not be included in the project."}, "docdt": "2014-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
