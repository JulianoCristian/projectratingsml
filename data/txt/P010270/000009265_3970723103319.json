"The Fifth Telecommunications Project\n            will encompass the entire FY 1987-90 investment program for\n            Pakistan's Telegraph and Telephone (T&T)\n            Department.  It will expand local, long-distance, and\n            international telephone and telex networks, while increasing\n            the management, organizational, and implementation capacity\n            of T&T. This growth will be reinforced with a program of\n            rehabilitation, replacement, and improved operations and\n            maintenance.  In strengthening the telecommunications\n            system, the project will address one of the chief\n            bottlenecks to future economic and social development.\n            While business and government subscribers will benefit most\n            from the improvement in long distance, nationwide dialling,\n            international and telex facilities, the provision of new\n            subsidiary routes, rural exchanges, and public call offices\n            will benefit currently unserviced rural areas."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
