The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. For the Bank, previous implementation\n            experience in the country must be used when setting progress\n            rates for projects. Second, bilateral co-financing can\n            influence project performance if it affects the supply of\n            appropriate equipment. Third, supervision staffing should\n            take into account the problems being experienced by the\n            project. Lastly, arrangements for O&M need to be\n            fostered by establishing a budget for the O&M\n            organization well before the expenditure will commence. For\n            the Borrower, pre-qualification of bidders needs careful\n            thought if a good short list is to be established. Second,\n            contracts extending for more than one year should include\n            price escalation clauses, as required in the Bank's\n            guidelines. Lastly, an offer of grant aid tied to purchase\n            of supplies or equipment must be carefully considered to\n            ensure that adequate after-scale service is provided within\n            the country."}, "docdt": "1995-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
