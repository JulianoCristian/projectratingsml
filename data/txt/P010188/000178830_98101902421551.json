improved\n            system of surface drains in 295,000 ac; to increase\n            irrigation water supplies by improving on-farm water\n            management practices; and to strengthen the capabilities of\n            WAPDA and Punjab's Departments of Irrigation and\n            Agriculture in carrying out similar projects."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
