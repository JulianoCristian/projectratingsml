availability of fertilizer to farmers by expediting\n            fertilizer handling and distribution, increasing the\n            efficiency and capacity of the transport sector, and\n            encouraging private sector participation in fertilizer\n            distribution and transport. The project would rationalize\n            BADC's current fertilizer distribution system, improve\n            transport handling contracting procedures, and remove major\n            physical bottlenecks in the fertilizer transport system. The\n            physical components of the project include: (i) port\n            improvements - landing and storage facilities at river ports\n            and channel dredging at Chittagong; and (ii) unit\n            block/train operations - rehabilitation of railroad wagons\n            and improvement of a rail wagon ferry service, construction\n            of transit storage facilities and establishment of a\n            fertilizer operations control center. The primary\n            beneficiaries would be the farmers obtaining more reliable\n            access to fertilizer at reduced cost. However, the movement\n            of fertilizer is interrelated with movement of other\n            products. Consequently, the economy, in general, would\n            benefit from lower movement cost for many products."}, "docdt": "1980-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
