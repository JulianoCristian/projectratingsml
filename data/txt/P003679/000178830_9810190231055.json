and includes construction of: a 60 m\n            high embankment dam; a water conductor system; and an\n            overground power station with an initial capacity of 40 MW,\n            which can be extended to 80 MW later. The project will help\n            minimize further expansion of the diesel generating\n            capacity, with corresponding savings in foreign exchange\n            which will otherwise be required for importing fuel. The\n            foreign exchange savings at current prices are expected to\n            be about US$180 million during the life of the project.\n            Additional benefits will arise from an institutional reform\n            of Fiji's power sector and a stabilization of\n            electricity tarfiffs which will make electricity more\n            affordable for rural customers. The risks associated with\n            the project are those inherent in all hydroelectric\n            projects, such as possible geological problems and\n            hydrological uncertainties, but the investigations carried\n            out indicate that they will be minimal. The Asian\n            development Bank (ADB) is expected to finance as a separate\n            project the transmission facilities necessary to market the\n            energy produced by the proposed project."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
