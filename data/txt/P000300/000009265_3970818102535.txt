PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Public Works and Employment
Project in Burkina Faso, for which Credit 2282-BUR, in the amount of SDR 15.0 million (US$ 20
million) was approved on June 27, 1991 and declared effective on December 31. 1991.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1996. after a one year extensioni. The final disbursement
took place on August 15, 1996 and the credit was fully disbursed.
This Implementation Completion Report was prepared by Gerard Tenaille, Consultant, and
Christian Diou, Senior Municipal Engineer. AFTU2. task manager for the Project. It has also
benefited from comments from Alberto Harth, AFTU2. Preparation of the report started during a
mission to Burkina Faso in April 1996, of which the aide-memnoire is attached. The Implementation
Completion Report is based on project files, correspondence., the Staff Appraisal Report and the
Credit Agreement. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the Implementation Completion
Report by preparing its own project implementation report in [ebruary 1996 and through its
comments on the draft ICR.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BURKINA FASO
PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 2282-BUR
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    This Implementation Completion Report evaluates the Public Works and Employment
Project (TIPE) in Burkina Faso, implemented by the Faso Baara Agency, an institution created on
the model of the AGETIP Agency in Senegal.
Project Objectives
2.    The major objective of the project was to reduce under-employment by the financing of
small urban labor-intensive works, executed by local enterprises and consulting firms, which the
project would assist via training and very rapid payment conditions. The other objectives are closely
linked (para. 4). On the whole, these objectives were reasonable and within the capacities of the
authorities and contractors in Burkina Faso. But the implementation schedule of three years was not
realistic (para. 5).
Experience and results
3.    The project attained most of its objectives, both as r egards the number ofjobs created and
physical achievements (para. 16):
(a)    The number of jobs created was always higher than the estimates made at appraisal:
16,010 at the end of 1994 as against 11,700 projected, and 19,680 at the end of June 1996. It
should be noted that 1994 was the expected date for the completion of the project, and that
the extension of the closing date of the Credit allowed the implementing agency to continue
the execution of the project till June 1996. During that extension, other financing made it
possible to increase the volume of works;
(b)    The number of contracts awarded in 5 years w\as 3 14, as against 270 estimated at
appraisal for 3 years;
(c)    The number of contractors and consulting firms which obtained contracts was 175
and 53, respectively; and
(d)    The number of contractors and consulting firms which benefited from training under
the project was 122 and 25, respectively.
4.    On the other hand, the objectives as regards the percentage of contracts conforming to the
initial time schedule and budget were not met. The appraisal report put those percentages at 88



v
percent in both cases, but in practice they were only 58.82 percent and 83.1 percent, respectively.
The first of these figures seems very low, but an in-depth review shows that the consulting firms are
mainly responsible because in the bidding documents they almost systematically stipulated a three-
month construction period (para. 17).
5.    The impact of the project on the public procurement procedures was also very positive.
The project financed a study to identify the bottlenecks in public procurement and to propose
measures to improve it. The conclusions were discussed with the ministries concerned and the
Public Institutional Development Project (PID) financed the preparation of a new decree on public
procurement. This decree was signed by the President of Burkina Faso on March 7. It constitutes an
appreciable improvement compared to previous procedures (para. 18).
6.    The cost of the project was estimated in 1991 at CFAF 9.45 billion, of which 7.5 billion
related to the IDA financed project and 1.95 billion to parallel financing. At the Credit closing date,
the cost of the project amounted to CFAF 18.04 billion, of which 6.84 billion represented IDA
financing, 0.94 billion the national counterpart and 10.27 billion parallel financing. These
considerable amounts in CFAF of executed works are due in particular to the devaluation of January
1994, the IDA Credit being denominated in SDRs.
7.    The implementation schedule was exceeded by 18 months. This delay is due to the
Government's decision not to renew the contract of the director general of Faso Baara, in March
1994. This led to a notable slowing of activity until the nomination of a new director general
acceptable to IDA, in June 1995. At this date, operations returned to normal and the management
ratios were restored.
8.    Important factors affecting the project. The only major factor affecting the project was
the non-renewal of the director general's contract, on March 11, 1994, without any valid reason.
Even though IDA would have been justified in taking remedies leading to cancellation of the Credit,
it preferred to leave the project dormant, letting Faso Baara execute the sub-projects already
approved (sub-projects of less than CFAF 125 million for which at least five bids had been received,
and for which, according to the procedures manual, para. 20, it was not necessary to obtain IDA's
no-objection). This event would have only been a passing incident if the director general had been
replaced quickly. However, the new director general was nominated and accepted by the Bank only
on June 5, 1995, 15 months after the departure of the previous one. This gap had a negative impact
on the project: what should have been done in 4 years took 6, and Faso Baara survived only by
financing its activities from other sources (para. 21).
9.    Sustainability of the project. In the medium term, the agency's sustainability is assured by
the capacity it demonstrated to mobilize funds other than those of IDA and the Government. In the
long term, the agency's sustainability will be a function of the capacity of its beneficiaries, whether
communes or administrations, to finance the sub-projects and the maintenance of the executed works
on their own, or to find the necessary funds. The same is true of the sustainability of the works
themselves, which will depend on the ability of the beneficiaries to mobilize the necessary resources
for their maintenance (para. 24).



vi
10.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory, particularly during the supervision phase (para.
26).
H1.   The Borrower's performance was mixed. The Government respected its commitment to
provide the funds needed to complete the project, and indeed went much further, since it provided
CFAF 1,600 million, compared to an initial commitment of CFAF 555 million. But its decision not
to renew the director general's contract, in March 1994, had negative consequences (para. 27). The
performance of the implementing agency, Faso Baara, would have been excellent if an accounting
error at the end of the project had not led to an over-commitment of CFAF 780 million in relation to
the funds available. This problem was resolved by transferring the liabilities of Faso Baara to the
Urban Environment Project (Credit 2728-BUR), under an agreement existing between the two
projects (para. 29).
Conclusions, Future Operations, and Major Lessons
12.   The project can be deemed highly satisfactory. (para. 31).
13.   The project's good results could justify pursuing the experience with a second project of a
similar type, to support the development of local capacities (para. 32).
14.   The lessons to be drawn from the project are important and confirm those learnt from other
AGETIP projects which have been completed. The project showed:
(a) that a private institution like Faso Baara is perfectly capable of executing works of public
interest quickly and efficiently, without any external technical assistance. It is important to
specify clearly, in advance, the procedures to be followed, to choose the right persons to
implement them, and to apply them in an appropriate framework;
(b) that Faso Baara is an executing agency at the service of the Borrower. Such an agency
cannot by itself compensate for the lack of a sector policy (urban development, health,
education, etc.). The links between Faso Baara and the programs or sectoral projects using its
services should be carefully reviewed during the preparation of the agreement delegating the
project management to Faso Baara; and
(c) that provision must be made for grassroots participation in the definition of sub-projects
so as to ensure the sustainability. Systematic maintenance of facilities built under the project
is an issue that will be addressed under the follow-up project.
15.   External technical assistance, limited in this project to training provided by GTZ, should not
be necessary if another project is considered (para. 33).

INTRODUCTION
I.    Between 1980 and 1990, a high population growth rate of 3.3 percent and a heavy migration
towards the cities led to accelerated urbanization in Burkina Faso. Employment creation could not
keep up with the rise in demand: in 1987, a survey carried out by the National Office for
Employment Promotion (ONPE) showed that, for the principal cities (Ouagadougou, Bobo-
Dioulasso and Koudougou), demand for jobs was 3 1,974 as against a supply of 5,470, giving a
demand satisfaction rate of 17 percent. At Ouagadougou, the ratio was even worse : 14.8 percent.
In 1990, the urban unemployment rate was II percent taking into account the informal sector, and 25
percent if it was omitted.
2.    While preparing a structural adjustment program with a view to improving the management
of public resources, the Government of Burkina Faso requested IDA, on September 3, 1990, to
finance a feasibility study for a National Employment Promotion Fund. It was then proposed to
undertake a program of small labor-intensive works for improvement and rehabilitation of urban
infrastructure, whose impact on employment would be incremental to that of more important works
planned under the Second Urban Project (Cr.2067-BUR) : road repair and maintenance,
rehabilitation of drainage systems, restoration of schools and dispensaries, etc.
3.    Taking advantage of its experience in similar projects in Senegal and Niger (AGETIP
projects), IDA was able to help the Government rapidly prepare a similar project for Burkina Faso.
In a context of ongoing reforms at the macro-economic level, this project provided private
contractors with an opportunity to develop and to demonstrate their capacity to carry out programs
of public works and housing efficiently.



- 2 -
A. Project Objectives
4.     The project's objectives were to: (a) finance a program of small municipal works in the area
of urban infrastructure upgrading and rehabilitation; (b) encourage local private contractors and
consulting firms to participate in project execution; (c) improve, through execution of the works
financed by the project, the individual skills of the workers employed as a result, and the
competitiveness of the firms carrying out the works, so as to develop their capacity to respond to
increased opportunities for sustained employment, after completion of the project; (d) create, at least
temporarily, substantial new employment in urban areas as rapidly as possible using the private
sector, thereby stimulating small local private contractors and consulting firms; (e) review existing
public works programs and recast them with the intent of speeding up their implementation and
overall performance; and (f) demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive projects and test the
procedures that would ensure the public sector's ability to commission such projects.
5.     These objectives were clear and reasonable. However, the implementation schedule of three
years was not realistic.
Project Description
6.     To meet these objectives, the project included the following components:
(a)    a program of public facility and infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance in
urban areas to be carried out in a labor-intensive manner by local contractors;
(b)    a package of services related to work organization, management, and labor force
training to be offered on a voluntary basis to the local contractors awarded contracts under
component (a);
(c)    a supervision and monitoring component in order to closely monitor the progress of
the project and to prepare the transition toward locally-supported employment of the target
group;
(d)    a selective audit of public works programs to identify bottlenecks and design system
improvements; and
(e)    a package of consultant services to design a program to train the beneficiaries and
engineering firms in the preparation of feasibility studies and technical project proposals;
and a program aimed at increasing grassroots participation in urban infrastructure
maintenance.
7.     The project's design was based on project management being delegated by the beneficiary (a
public body, ministry or local authority) to an executing agency independent of the Government
(Faso Baara), which was to be created to execute the project. The objective was to allow the
Government to delegate the responsibility for project execution, while retaining the responsibilities
for planning and budget preparation.

Project Organization
8.    The functioning of the agency was based on the Procedures Manual (annex 2 of the appraisal
report) approved during negotiations, which specified in particular the eligibility criteria for the sub-
projects submitted by the beneficiaries to Faso Baara. If the sub-project was declared eligible, Faso
Baara appraised it and signed a delegated project management agreement with the beneficiary, by
which all rights and obligations of the beneficiary were transferred to Faso Baara for the
construction period of the sub-project. Faso Baara financed all the sub-projects with funds provided
by the IDA Credit and other donors, as well as the Government, and no reimbursement was required
from the beneficiaries. As a consequence, these works became part of their investment programs,
without impacting their financial situation.
9.    Faso Baara took care of all the bidding procedures and awarded the contracts for sub-project
studies and works. It supervised the works, paid the consulting firms and contractors, and attended
the commissioning of the works after completion. The role and responsibilities of Faso Baara were
made very explicit in the procedures manual, which the agency always followed rigorously during
the project execution. So that all the entities involved in the project perfectly understood their role
and the procedures to be followed, Faso Baara organized meetings for all the beneficiaries and
qualified bidders.
Project Preparation
10.   Because of the urgency, and thanks to the experience acquired in Senegal with the first
AGETIP Project (Credit 2075-SE, approved on 12/14/89), project preparation was very rapid. The
project was identified in October/November 1990, and appraised in March/April 1991. The project
was well prepared, thanks to a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance of US$ 600,000, requested
on November 6, 1990, and approved on November 28, 1990, under the number P.654-BUR. The
appraisal mission took place from March 23 to April 9, 1991.
I.   To ensure the project would start on time, a sample of five sub-projects was reviewed and
approved by IDA during the appraisal mission including: (i) paving and maintenance of streets; (ii)
construction of small embankments; (iii) rehabilitation of a public building; (iv) cleaning of the
urban drainage network; and (v) collection of household garbage. These works were financed by a
second PPF advance, in an amount of US$900,000, requested by the Government on April 30, 1991,
and approved on May 31, 1991, under the number P.654-1-BUR. In fact, five sub-projects got off to
a good start in October 1991, but were somewhat different from those planned at the appraisal: (i)
paving of a street; (ii) rehabilitation of two public buildings (national assembly and a maternity
center); (iii) construction of new drainage ditches; and (iv) collection of solid waste. Thus, the
construction of small dams was replaced by the rehabilitation of a second public building, and the
cleaning of the drainage network by the construction of new ditches. These justified changes had no
effect on project preparation.
12.   The negotiations were held in Washington from May 17 through 21, 1991. At the request of
the Burkinabe delegation, the amount of the Credit was increased from US$ 15 million to 20 million.
The Credit was approved on June 27, 1991, by the IDA Board and signed on July 5, 1991. The
conditions of effectiveness were : (a) the appointment of the director general, technical director and



- 4 -
financial director of Faso Baara, all to be acceptable to IDA; (b) the selection and approval by IDA
of a first portfolio of sub-projects for at least US$ 4.78 million; (c) signing of an agreement between
Faso Baara and the Government, defining the agency's missions; (d) the pre-qualification of an
initial list of contractors and consulting firms; and (e) the introduction of an accounting system, the
selection of auditors and the submission to IDA of a training program for the beneficiaries and
consulting firms. Initially projected for October 3, 1991, the effectiveness of the Credit was finally
declared on December 31, 1991.
Project Implementation
13.   The start-up of the project was rapid and satisfactory: as early as October 1991, before the
Credit became effective, the five test projects defined during the appraisal mission were launched
using PPF funds. During the first year, in 1992, 9,467 jobs were created, for an average of 37 days.
In 1993, these figures were increased to 15,406 jobs (cumulative) and 44.2 days. Activity slowed
down in 1994 and 1995 because of the departure on March 11, 1994, of the director general, who
was only replaced on June 5, 1995 (para. 20 below). During those fifteen months, IDA suspended
all no-objections. Only contracts for less than CFAF 125 million for which at least five bids had
been received and which were included in a portfolio already approved by IDA could be executed,
since they did not require a no-objection from IDA. Job creation was limited to 604 in 1994 and 264
in 1995. In 1996, 31 sub-projects were executed for a total amount of CFAF 1,904 million; 3,406
jobs were created, and CFAF 132.9 million were distributed as wages. By June 30, 1996, the closing
date of Credit 2282-BUR, 19,680 jobs had been created for a global amount of wages of CFAF
1,178,265,313. The average wage by job and by day were CFAF 59,871 and CFAF 1,267
respectively, for an average job duration of 47.25 days. The Credit financed mainly rehabilitation
and construction of small buildings (60 percent), drains (17 percent) and road upgrading (13
percent).
14.   In 1994-95, the Agency's activity continued at a high level, even in the absence of the
director general, but using other financing. Faso Baara since its creation has been responsible for
numerous sub-projects financed by other donors:
Special Development Fund, financed by the Caidsse Francaise de Developpement (CFD)
and FAC (French aid agency), covering 24 sub-projects completed at the end of December
1995, for an amount of CFAF 1,389.6 million, which generated 147,000 person/days of
work;
Fourth Education Project, concerning the construction and equipment of 100 schools,
covering 61 contracts for a total amount of CFAF 2,327.3 million, completed in February
1996;
Health Services Development Project, for which 3 contracts were signed, for an amount of
CFAF 127.5 million. The works which had been stopped because of the closing of the
Credit were started again under the Health and Nutrition Services Project (see below);
National Institute of Agronomic Studies and Research (INERA), for which CFAF 351.2
million have been committed, involving on one hand studies awarded to consulting firms for

15.    Faso Baara also obtained from KfW  (the Germana aid agency) a credit of DM 21 illion
(about CFAF 7,350 million). The works relating to a first portfolio of sub-projects, for an amount of
CFAF 1,012.8 million, are almost completed. A second portflolio of suh-projects is in preparation.

amount of CFAF 412.2 million,. but the works have not started v et.

B. Achievement of Objectives
16.    The project's results are very satisfactory in terms of job creation, private sector
development and contractors' technical capacity, as well as physical achievements. Table 5 in Part
IlI shows that the number of contracts awarded in five years exceeded the appraisal estimate for
three years (314 against 270). and the cumulative number ofjobs created has always been higher
than the appraisal estilmate: 16,010 at the end of 1 994 as against 1 1,700, and 1 9,680 at the end of
June 1996. The impact of the project was also very beneficial for the consulting firms and
contractors who obtained contracts: about CFAF 6 billion of the IDA Credit was shared among 175
contractors and 53 consulting Firms, and the traininig provided under the project to 122 contractors
and 25 consulting firms impr-oved the quality of'the works. Somlie weaknesses identified during
execution, notably in quality control and the establishlimlent ot' procedures for grassroots participation,
are being corrected by the updating of the Procedures Manual and the positioning of the agency as a

17.    On the other hand. project objectives were not met as regards the proportion of contracts
conforming to the original schedule and budget. The appraisal report fixed those percentages at 88
percent for the entire durationi of the project, while the actual figures were only 58.82 percent and
83.1 percent, respectively. This last number is not surprising, sinec unexpected events often affect
the final amiount of a contr-act, and to have 82 percenit of the contracts avoid any cost overrun is not a
bad result. But it is not nor mal for 41.18 percent of'the colltracts to exceed the stipulated period.
The main responsibility here lies with the consultilIg firm>, who almost systematically hicorporated a
three-month contract period in all the bidding documelits. The reasoii is probably that the
Procedures Manual stated that tor a sub-project to be eligible, the works must be started within three
months. But this does not meani that the construCtion period must not exceed three months! The
main cause of delay is the period of about one monith reqLilred for the contractor to obtain tax and
custom duties exemption.
18.    The project's ilmpact on national procurement procedures was also very positive. The project
financed a study to identify the bottlenecks in public procurement, and propose measures to improve
it. The conclusions were discussed with the miniistries concerned and the PID project financed the
preparation of a new decree on procurement. TI'his decr-ee w as signed by BLurkina Faso's President on
March 7. 1996. under the numiber- 96/059/PRFS/"MiM\1F1 . It represents a marked improvement
compared to previous procedul-es.
19.    However. three reser vations can be expressed about this decree:
(a)    State firms (S'ocLiLs d'Ewt,) should not have been included in its provisions and
could have been left f'ree to establish their own procedures;
(b)    "the Minister of Finance or his representatives shall sign all public contracts". It
should have been preferable to specify a ceililg below whichi the signature of the minister
concerned would have been sufficient: and
(c)    Articles 82 and 83 stipulate that an amenidimlenit is mandatory if the volume of the
works is 20 percent less than anticipated, and thai a new contract must be signed. following
the procedure used ftor the initial contract. if the \ariation exceeds 20 percent. This should
be corrected, because this provision is too restrictive. An amendimient is clearly not



-7 -
necessary if the overrun in the volume ol'the works is onl\ one percenit. The regulations in
most countries authorize an overrun o '20 per-ccntt \ithout the necd 'for an amendment, and
require an amendmenit he ond 20 percent.
C.     Important Factors Affecting the Project
20.    The only major factor atfecting the pr-oject \\as the noni-renen\al oflthe conitiact of'the
director general without any valid reasoni on March I I 1 994. 1i he Government took this decision
without advising the Banik. and without inl'orninii- it oflficialkl alter\ ards. 'rhe appointment of the
director general acceptable to IDA wvas a condition of  rcrdit cffectiveness: the non-renewal of his
contract. without IDAI approval. was a violationl ol thc (Credit \Vrcerment. Although lI)A would have
been justified in taking rciiedies lcading to cancellation of th ( Credit. it prefcrr-ed to leave thle
project dornant and allov\ Faso Baara to implenlitcit sub-proljcts of less thlian ('IAF1 125 million for
which at least five bids had hecn received anid that xxcre alread\ part ofla portfolio approved by IDA
(according to the Procedures Manual, it vvas not necessar\ in hese Ci-cumlistanices to request a no-
objection from IDA).
21     This event would have onlr beeni a passing incIidti't hte director  Ieneral had been quickly
replaced. However. the candidates proposed by the (io0ernmcenlt could not obtain the approval of the
Bank, whiclh insistcd oln that thev should have a substantial c\pcliencc in the private sector. After
difficult discussions. whose near failure almost led to the cancellation oi'the Credit, a new director
general was nominated and accepted by the Bank 0sOn J1un1e 5. I 995. l'ifteeni months after the departure
of the previous one. This gap had a negative impact o.n the progress of thie project: what should have
been done in four years in fact took six. and the niana.^emient ratios sufl'ered fiomil the reduction
in turniover. The closing downi ol'Faso Baai-a \%as onI\ ai\oidcd h\ I n;inincinL) its activities from other
sources of funds.
22.    The non-renewal ol'the director i,eneral's contract hai.d another bad el'f'ect: in February 1994,
a Bank supervision mission visited Burkinia FaSo to rc ie\\ tihe If'lects of thie devaluation of the CFA
franc. It proposed a suppleicientarx credit of l IS, I 0 mlililoni. in order to rapidly inject additional
liquidities into the domestic economy. The l'ormalities  ere ulider xx aN in Washington when the
departure of'the director general became knovin. Ihich -Lut a1n enid to the supplementary credit
project.
D.     Project Sustainability
23.    The project's sustainability can be assessed at txNo I. cis: ( i) thc capacit\ of the
implementing agency, Faso Baara. to outlive the IDA ( redit and miaintain its assistance to the
beneficiaries, local governments and ministerial departinents x\ hich ricque.,t its help; and (ii) the
capacity of these beneficiaries. notably the ncx v\-ccctecd n1LonIicipal itiesC to maobilize the funds
needed for maintenianice of thc xxorks executed itnder thc pr( Ject.
24.    In the mediulIl tCerill the agency's sustainlahility 1i astiircd hy its demonstrated capacity to
mobilize funds other than those of' IDA and Cio crinecnt It \\,as al-ead\ noted (para. 14) that Faso

CFAF 15.0 billion. This represents threl-cc caIrs olfact ix        thc prescnt rte. I o this caLi be added



the Kf\V Credit t'or DM 21 millioni (]SS 14.0 millioni equi\alent). A possible TIPE2 project.
fhianiced bv IDA. would ensul-e the sustainabilitx ot Faso Baara until 2002. Beyond that date. the
agenicy's sustainabilitv will be a fuLictioni of the beneficiaries' capacity to finance the sub-projects
themilselves. or to find the necessary fiiianicinig on their owIn . Thie same applies to the sustainability of
the works: maintenance can onlI be assured bv the beneficiaries themselves, in the context of the
deccntralizatioIl goiig onl in 13urkinia Faso. 'I'he Seconid UJrbani Project (Credit 2067-BUR) has
helped to strengthen local g(overnments. especially Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. Maintenance
of facilities finaniced ulider- the project is not set systemnatic. however. This issue will be addressed
under the f'ollo -up pro ject. It can therefor-e bc said that the project s sustainability is probable in
short and medium1l termii, and unlcel-tail In the long teillm.
E.    Bank I'erforniance
25.    Thle 3anik took advanitagc of' its experienice of'a '11'1 project in Senegal to shorten the
preparationi of the project: an identificationi mIissioni In October/November 1990 led directly to the
appraisal missioni in March/April 1991 withIout any intervciling preparation mission. The appraisal
report coIntainls soIme iniconisistenicies: paragraph 2.05 stipulates that 40 percent of the available funds
would be allocated to services. but the cost estimiates (para. 21) do not mention services. The Credit
Agreemnent, Scihedule I . containis a categorv I .h lor ser\ ices. f'or an amounit of LJS$ 4. In fact. only
SDR 99,000 were Lised tor services. I'herefore. the estimate \Nas unrealistic.
26.    The Bank's super-visiOI of the pro'ject  as satis'actory. The appraisal report forecast three
missions per year until 1994. In fact, there were thiee ImlissiOlns in 1992, two in 1993. one in 1994,
thiee in 1 995 and one in 1 996. This was perfectly adequate, taking into account the execution
agency's excellent perforimiance. Finally, there were three task managers for the project over a
period of five years. which is too many, but this did not have a negative impact on the project.
F.     Borrower's Performance
27.    The Borrower's performance was mixed. Th'le (iovernment met the negotiation and
eff'ectiveness conditionis relatively fast and well . but its decision not to renew the director general's
conti'act was a blow to the project that could have been fatal. The matter was all the more serious in
that during the negotiationis. "thc G,overnimienit had given an assurance that it would ensure that any
chanige of the agenicy's di-ector was acceptable to the Associationi" (appraisal report para. 2.26). On
the other hand, thc State grcatly exceeded its commnitments as regards its counterpart financing: so
far it has made available a total of CFAF 1,600( millioni. against an initial commitment of CFAF 550
million.
28.    The perforimianice of'the executing agency. Faso Baara, can be deemed excellent, except for
the over-commllitmenit discussed below. The agenc\. though barely established, started the project
very quickly and maniaged to carryi out its activities at a high rate, while scrupulously respecting the
procedures manlual. Th'le only poilnt worth mentioning is the proportion of its operating costs. Even
though the level of its t'ees is not speciftied Ii any legal or conitractual document, the rate of 5 percent
was used in all the contract maniagemilent agreciiemiets signed with the beneficiaries. However, in
some cases this rate does not cover all its operating expelnses. The solution currently being



9-
implemented, would be to apply a variable rate, as a function of the amount of the works and their
complexity and location, as is already done for the agreements with the consulting firms.
29.   In September 1996, Faso Baara discovered it had undertaken commitments which exceeded
by CFAF 780 million the IDA funds available. This situation was not detected earlier because of the
lack of systematic reconciliation in the agency's accounting system between the project accounts in
CFA Francs and the disbursement data made available by the Bank in SDRs. It would have been
extremely bad to the Agency and the Government if the contractors regularly retained for contracts
not to be paid on time. Given the difficulty of mobilizing counterpart funds rapidly, and to help the
Government solve the problem, it was decided to use unallocated funds from Credit 2728-BUR,
effective since May 27, 1996, for the Urban Environment Project. The Auditor confirmed that the
mistake was indeed an accounting error and not a fraudulent use of Credit funds. Credit 2728-BUR
was able to finance the contracts to be paid if their effectiveness date was later than June 14, 1995
(signing date of Credit 2728-BUR) and if the works conformed to the description of the project in
the Credit Agreement. An agreement between the Urban Environment Project, Faso Baara and the
Ministry of Finance was signed on November 13, 1996, to resolve the problem.
30.   In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the project accounts were audited twice a year by
independent auditors, acceptable to the Association. The audit reports were duly submitted to IDA,
at times somewhat late. They always certified that the accounts faithfully represented the financial
situation of the project. Even though not required by the Credit Agreement, a technical audit and an
analysis of the agency's operations were carried out in 1995 and 1996. They led to an improvement
of the procedures used by the Agency.
G.    Overall Evaluation of the Project
31.   The Project achieved and even surpassed its objectives as regards job creation, its main goal,
as well as its physical targets. Therefore the project can be considered highly satisfactory.
H.    Future Operations
32.   The good result obtained from this first TIPE project would justify following up the
experience with a second project. This new project could extend the agency's activities outside
Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, towards secondary cities, in the context of decentralization.
I.    Major Lessons
33.   The lessons to be drawn from the project are important and confirm those learnt from other
AGETIP projects which have been completed. The project showed:
(a) that a private institution like Faso Baara is perfectly capable of executing works of public
interest quickly and efficiently, without any external technical assistance. It is important to
specify clearly, in advance, the procedures to be followed, to choose the right persons to
implement them, and to apply them in an appropriate framework;



- 10-
(b) that Faso Baara is an executing agency at the service of the Borrower. Such an agency
cannot by itself compensate for the lack of a sector policy (urban development, health,
education, etc.). The links between Faso Baara and the programs or sectoral projects using its
services should be carefully reviewed during the preparation of the agreement delegating the
project management to Faso Baara; and
(c) that provision must be made for grassroots participation in the definition of sub-projects
so as to ensure the sustainability. Systematic maintenance of facilities built under the project
is an issue that will be addressed under the follow-up project.
34.   The training program was prepared and supervised by a technical assistance team financed
by GTZ. It is worth noting that the qualified contractors and consulting firms did not take sufficient
advantage of the training that was proposed to them in technical areas. The courses concentrated on
the procedures of the Faso Baara agency (640 participants), the management of small and medium-
size enterprises (154), and worksite management (201), but there were only 44 participants for
management of human resources and 126 for technical training in building construction. In practice,
the contractors and consulting firms were interested above all in learning how to work with Faso
Baara and their participation was closely linked to the potential number of sub-projects to be
awarded. In future, it would probably be useful to define a more global strategy for the technical
training of contractors and consulting firms. Consequently, the Agency should not manage the
training program directly, although it should retain a key role in awarding contracts in these fields. In
all, 1,344 persons were trained, representing 146 beneficiaries.
