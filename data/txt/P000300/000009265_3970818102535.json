The main objective of the\n            Primary Education Development Project (Education III), was\n            the implementation of a financing strategy aimed at (a)\n            accelerating the expansion of primary education, reducing\n            primary education unit costs, and (b) developing\n            capabilities in education planning, administration, and\n            management, including controlling education costs. Overall,\n            the project was successful in meeting its principal goals.\n            The Bank's overall performance was satisfactory and\n            contributed to the achievement of most of the objectives and\n            improving quality. The Borrower's performance was also\n            satisfactory. A major lesson learned in this project is that\n            project ownership should be well developed and\n            communications between the Bank and the Borrower, including\n            professional aspects of planning, accounting of commitments,\n            and drawdown of proceeds, should be sufficiently well\n            documented so that when major political changes in the\n            government occur, such changes will not unduly affect\n            project implementation. A second lesson to be drawn from\n            this project is the importance of paying more attention to,\n            and defining the roles and responsibilities of, the\n            Government, local communities, and other contributors to\n            primary education at project planning and implementation\n            stages. The third lesson learned is that in countries in\n            which the Government has to ask for community contributions,\n            the system becomes more fragile and dependent first and\n            foremost on usefulness and relevance to its user."}, "docdt": "1997-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
