Excellency,
We refer to the above-mentioned Agreement, dated July 5, 1991 (the Agreement), 
between Burkina Faso (the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the 
Association) and to your request to have the amount of the Authorized Allocation 
specified in the Agreement for the purposes of the Special Account increased from its 
present level to an amount corresponding to the executing agency's projected 
expenditure for a four months' period.
We are pleased to inform you that the Association accedes to your request and 
agrees, accordingly, to amend the Agreement by deleting, in paragraph 1 (c) of 
Schedule 4 thereto, the amount of "$1,300,000" appearing therein, and substituting 
therefor an amount of "$3,000,000".
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment, on behalf of the 
Borrower, by signing and dating the confirmation form on the enclosed copy of this 
letter and returning it to us for our records.
Sincerely yours,
