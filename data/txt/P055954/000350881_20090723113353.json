the Goias State Highway\n            Management Project in Brazil were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons include:\n            when road maintenance is decentralized to municipalities,\n            special consideration needs to be given to fiscal\n            sustainability; and outsourcing routine maintenance under\n            performance-based contracts is practical and the PPAR shows\n            it can lead to lower costs of maintenance; Designing project\n            activities outside the direct area of interest and expertise\n            of the implementing agency, such as strengthening\n            environmental management through road projects, can be\n            problematic, particularly when they are not effectively\n            included in a development objective and supervised accordingly."}, "docdt": "2009-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
