Nonetheless, both the road\n            maintenance/rehabilitation, and paving components will focus\n            on existing roads, thus only limited environmental impacts\n            are expected, with no direct impacts on the habitat of\n            indigenous populations, cultural heritage sites, or, human\n            displacements. Limited environmental adversity, and\n            mitigation measures directly address construction works: 1)\n            To reduce disruption to land degradation, soil erosion, or\n            drainage patterns, as a result of earthworks, adequate\n            drainage, and appropriate size of culverts, and embankments\n            will be provided. Ground leveling will restore quarries, to\n            be replenished with organic soil, and vegetation, while,\n            waste, or spoil will be disposed of in borrow pits. 2)\n            Adequate engineering designs will address land degradation,\n            and soil erosion, including installation of infiltration\n            ditches, to capture silt, and pollutants. 3) Dust, and noise\n            pollution will be reduced by the proper choice of equipment,\n            by installing sound barriers, and by limiting construction\n            works to daytime schedules only. Long-term adversities,\n            i.e., air and water pollution, impacts on flora and fauna,\n            and traffic safety are addressed in the Environmental\n            Regulations for Road Construction (v. 6)."}, "docdt": "2001-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
