The\n            principal project objectives, as stated in the Staff\n            Appraisal Report (SAR), were to: (a) increase round wood\n            production through new plantations; and (b) introduce better\n            planning and management techniques for the forestry\n            sub-sector. Two major problems that confronted the project\n            virtually throughout its life were the inadequacy of local\n            counterpart funding and, as a separate problem, the delays\n            over payments of contracts, which destroyed any sense of\n            urgency in land preparation by contractors and seriously\n            delayed achievement of planting targets. These delays were\n            due to the fact that even when items were budgeted, and\n            contracts signed and work therefore started, funds were not\n            actually available. In some cases, contractors simply walked\n            off jobs, awaiting payment for work already done. There was\n            no action that could have been taken by the Bank or Project\n            Management to avoid this problem."}, "docdt": "1992-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
