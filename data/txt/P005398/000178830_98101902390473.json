replanting with fast growing species of\n            eucalyptus, pines, and acacia; (ii) upgrading of access\n            roads, construction of new roads, road maintenance, and\n            extension of the firebreak network; (iii) pasture\n            improvement over 2,600 ha; (iv) studies on technical,\n            institutional, and financial issues; (v) administrative and\n            logistical support; (vi) technical assistance and training.\n            Employment generation over the 35 year life of the project\n            would amount to about 28,100 man-years, most of which would\n            be for unskilled workers."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
