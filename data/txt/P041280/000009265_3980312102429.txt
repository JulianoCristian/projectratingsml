Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives [see Annex I for key performance indicators]:
The primary objective of the project is to support Government (GOT) policy of divestiture from productive sectors and
promote an accelerated private sector-led development of economic activities. Specific objectives are to: (a) reduce the
size of the Public Enterprise (PE) portfolio; (b) reform the Post and Telecommunications (PT) sector in order to improve
access, price and diversity of communications services, via increasecl competition, and develop an efficient (low-cost and
high quality) postal network in the country through the strengthening of the existing postal infrastructure and introduction
of private sector participation; and (c) support institutional reform and capacity building in the financial sector,
complementing policy reform to be implemented under the upcoming Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC).
Progress towards these objectives will be measured and monitored through: (a) completion of specific privatization
transactions in line with the agreed timetable; (b) setting up a new regulatory framework for posts and
telecommunications activities; (c) privatization of the Telecommunications operator (TOGO TELECOM); (d) increased
access to communications and provision of new services by several private operators both in the postal and telecom
sectors; (e) completion of transformation of Societe des Postes du Togo (SPT) into a self-sustainable institution; and (f)
improved functioning of the financial system resulting from the restructuring/privatization of selected financial
institutions, some improvement of the banking environment, and the strengthening of the microfinance sector.

3. Benefits and target population:
3.1 Expected Benefits:
Public Enterprise. Divestiture of GOT from most PEs would help: (a) improve the competitiveness of the economy
through cheaper and more efficient services; (b) revive a number of key economic activities through new investment by
the private sector including the hotel industry, the transport and agricultural sectors; (c) alleviate the fiscal burden of non-
performing PEs on public finances; and (d) improve the performance of the few PEs that will still remain in the
Government portfolio, at the end of the project, including the post office, the social security agency, and a couple of
minor enterprises. Effective communication on the privatization prog.ram will promote public acceptance of the program
and will provide better information by reaching relevant investors. Strengthening capacity in the MSE will improve
quality of implementation.
Posts and Telecommunications. Implementing the PT reform envisaged by GOT would: (a) increase the volume and
variety of services offered, thus releasing current bottlenecks; (b) decrease the price of service and secure a cost-based
tariff system for postal and telecommunications services; (c) increase the operational and managerial efficiency of the
incumbent operators TOGO TELECOM and SPT; (d) facilitate competitive provision of services and enable private
sector participation in investment, thus increasing total investment resource mobilization; and (e) increase access to
communications and facilitate acquisition of information, in rural azreas as well as in peri-urban areas currently not
covered by the network.
Financial sector. Restructuring the formal financial system would strengthen its capacity to support economic growth.
Improving the financial system's outreach and expertise to efficiently serve economic agents operating in the informal
sector is an effective tool to reduce poverty.



3.2 Target population:
(a) Private sector including both local entrepreneurs and foreign investors; (b) consumers, i.e. the public at large, which
should benefit from better services; and (c) Public Enterprise work force, which will benefit from a more challenging
work environment.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Four years, 1998 to 2002
Executing Agencies:   MMETPT, MSE, MEF and MJ
Project Coordination and Oversight: Overall coordination will be managed by a special unit located in the Prime Minister'
s office. The unit will ensure overall coordination and coherence with sector strategies. This unit will be staffed with two
persons and will specifically be in charge of (a) monitoring progress via the performance indicators and organizing
supervision missions; (b) supervising the setting up of the financial and accounting organization for each component, (c)
monitoring budget preparation and (d) timely delivery of audits. Disbursements for this unit would transit through the
MMETPT special account. Privatization and PE restructuring would be implemented by the two directorates in MSE in
charge of privatization and PE monitoring, respectively. PT reform will be carried out by a coordination team at
MMETPT. The detailed design and preparation of the documents for civil works will be done by the management
contractor. Financial sector restructuring will be coordinated by the Secretariat General and Economy and Finance
Directorate of MEF (also to be in charge of proposed FINSAC). This implementation unit in the MEF would be
responsible for the financial aspects of the legal/judiciary sub-component: disbursements for the sub-component would
transit through the MEF special account.
Accounting, Financial reporting and auditing arrangements: (a) a private accounting firm, acceptable to IDA, has been
hired to set up the project financial and accounting systems using a system satisfactory to IDA; (b) an accountant will be
hired to keep and monitor the projects accounts for each component; (c) project accounts will be audited annually
according to international auditing standards by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA; (d) special accounts and all
disbursements under SOEs will be audited semi-annually; and (e) the annual audit report will be submitted to IDA within
six months of the end of each fiscal year and the semi-annual audit report within three months of each period.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Monitoring and evaluation will be guided by Project Design Summary in Annex
I and the Implementation Plan through: (a) quarterly progress reports, prepared by the Project Coordinator, of the Overall
Coordination Unit of the Prime Minister's Office; (b) Bank's supervision missions, annual progress review and project
mid-term review; (c) Government will transmit a project implementation completion report, within six months of credit
closing to IDA.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective supported by the project: CAS Report NO 14560-TO discussed on June 2, 1995 and the Progress
Report discussed on December 11, 1997:
The project will directly contribute to meeting the CAS objective, which aims at promoting a broad-based, private sector-
led recovery of the Togolese economy, and restore it onto a sustained poverty-reducing growth path. Private sector
involvement in the privatized entities would help restore growth, increase investments, and improve productivity in a
number of key economic sectors.
Relationship to the CAS: The proposed project would help consolidate and extend the policy reform agenda achieved
under ERAC and would provide support to planned FINSAC. Privatization of the PEs will allow greater participation of
the private sector in productive and commercial activities. Implementing a comprehensive reform in the PT sector will not
only increase the services offered, but also ease transactions and reduce costs. This will improve the competitiveness of
the economy, create a more favorable environment for private sector development and thus lead to greater job creation.



6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Public Enterprise. During the 1980s, Togo implemented a major public enterprise reform under several adjustment
operations, which achieved substantial results. Out of a portfolio of 78 PEs, 30 were privatized or liquidated, an
innovative regulatory framework was put in place for the remaining PEs and all PEs were subject to the normal tax
regime. However, the economy experienced major setbacks, as a result of the political turmoil of 1992-1993. The PE
sector incurred losses of CFAF 31 billion during the 1991-1993 period and PEs started to accumulate significant arrears.
Under its economic recovery program, adopted in April 1996, GOT decided to re-energize its public enterprise reform. 25
public enterprises were slated for privatization. The program started slowly, but has gained momentum since October
1996 after the establishment of a new cabinet. As of end-September 1997, four transactions were fully completed (BB,
CIMTOGO, SIT and SGMT), seven PEs had been liquidated (OPAT, SONAPH, SOTED, SITO, SOTONAM, UPROMA
and TOGOGRAIN) and 10 other PEs were on the market, this includes the eight hotels and OTP (the company in charge
of phosphate mining and the major transaction of the program). In addition, GOT decided to privatize the electricity
company (CEET) and to contract out the commercial activities of the water company (RNET). While GOT does not grant
any direct subsidies any longer, large indirect subsidies exist due to non-payment of taxes, utility bills, and debt service
by non-performing PEs such as the ten hotels and EDITOGO (Printing Press). The PE sector includes some 20
enterprises, which account for about 20% of employment in the forrnal sector and about 20% of GDP. The Government
has agreed to carry out an additional privatization program covering 15 enterprises and to implement actions designed to
improve the performance of the few PEs remaining under state ownership.
Posts and Telecommunications. Main issues relating to the telecommunications and postal sectors are as follows: For the
Telecom sector: (a) TOGO TELECOM, a monopoly operator, cannot meet existing market demand (e.g. for basic
service, the current waiting list of about 8,000 represents a third of the existing network of 24,000 and is still growing):
(b) the teledensity (main lines per 100 inhabitants) is extremely low (0.6 %), with 80% of the lines located in Lome, and
about 90% of them in the 4 largest cities; access to public phones is very limited, with only 112 public phones available,
most of them in Lome; (c) TOGO TELECOM operates a saturated network with very limited range of services;
productivity is low (28 lines per employee); the monopoly situation has allowed TOGO TELECOM to remain profitable
by applying high international tariffs (billing recovery is in the range of only 65%, with public administration paying less
than 1% of their bills); (d) the level of liabilities of TOGO TELECOM limits its investment capacity for network
expansion. For the postal sector, the issues are: (a) the inability to respond to demand, for example, the unmet demand for
post office boxes in Lome alone is over 30%; (b) poor quality of service in terms of: (i) mail delivery with less than 12%
of mail from Lome to elsewhere in Togo being delivered within 5 days and less than half of mail within Lome being
delivered in 3 days; (ii) low network coverage with one postal outlet per 77,000 inhabitants; (iii) lack of customer
orientation; (c) weak technical and managerial capability (operations turn around, marketing, finance) has led to the
creation of an institution with very little market orientation and commercial principles; and (d) financial distress of the
postal operator with revenues covering only 55% of cost. Financial drain derives mainly from inefficient and low-utilized
network system and a 30% overstaffing. The Government is covering an annual deficit of over I billion CFAF. Due to its
weak financial situation, SPT has not invested, and, as a result, the Government anticipates a deterioration of SPT's
financial situation and postal service performance in the future. Poor quality of service has resulted in very low mail
volume of 0.84 item per inhabitant. GOT has decided to undertake a major reform outlined in its sector policy statement
of February 1996. This includes updating the legal and regulatory framework to enable liberalization of service
provision, opening TOGO TELECOM's capital to private participation and to turning around the financial performance
of SPT into a profitable or break-even position in five years.
Financial sector issues. Key issues in the sector include: (a) continued involvement of the State in the sector; (b)
institutional inefficiencies affecting the performance of both bank and non-bank financial institutions; (c) the existence o
large arrears owed to domestic banks by PEs and other public sector institutions (about US$78 million-equivalent, the
bulk of which is held by OTP); (d) a weak judiciary system; and (e) a poorly organized microfinance sector lacking
expertise and professionalism. GOT is concerned that continued inefficiencies in the financial sector will inhibit rapid
economic development. It has already taken measures to address the issue of arrears (GOT, along with IMF and Bank
assistance, has designed a strategy intended to deal specifically with this issue), and is now ready to undertake a reform
program, aimed at addressing the remaining constraints. GOT is cornmitted to: (i) privatize banks; (ii) strengthen the
judiciary system; and (iii) improve the environment for microfinance clevelopment.



7. Sector issues to be addressed by the Project and strategic choice:
The proposed operation is designed to support the two key policy based adjustment operations: the ERAC approved in
April 1996 and the upcoming FINSAC.
Public Enterprise. The proposed operation would support the completion of the ongoing privatization program agreed
upon under ERAC, an additional program of 15 enterprises, including seven financial institutions, confirmed during
appraisal, and actions to improve the performance of the few PEs remaining under state ownership. A major issue to be
addressed under the operation is the social dimension of PE reform, which has always been the main stumbling block to
the privatization program. A large number of PEs are overstaffed, and retrenchment is needed to make them attractive to
potential investors. The proposed operation would finance severance payments in conformance with the guidelines
defined in the Bank's operational memorandum dated March 5, 1996.
A recently carried out study on PE sector indicated that some 1,800 employees could be displaced under the program and
recommended a set of social measures to alleviate the hardship of layoffs, including an early retirement scheme for
employees that are 50 years old or older, medical coverage for a limited period and specific actions to ease the re-
absorption into the economy, such as job searching or developing micro or small projects.
Posts and Telecommunications. The proposed operation addresses all the issues outlined in para. 6 related to the Posts
and Telecommunications sectors. As for the Telecom sector, the reform implemented with the project assistance would:
(a) foster new entry in service provision; (b) increase the level of competition in most services, including ultimately basic
service; (c) mobilize additional investment resource; (d) increase access to communications services in unserved areas
(rural and peri-urban); (e) increase the operational and managerial efficiency of the main operator via the partial opening
of its capital; and (f) create a regulator able to enforce fair competition in a opened sector structure. The key strategic
choice of the GOT is the combination of two key dimensions, liberalization of the sector, and privatization of TOGO
TELECOM to increase its productivity. For the postal sector, it would help extend the postal network by establishing an
increased number of franchised postal outlets in a cost-effective manner. It would provide resources to refurbish the
sorting center, rehabilitate the main offices located in Lome and the main cities, and establish additional postal and mail
boxes. The project would also provide funds for acquisition of new vehicles for mail delivery and for strengthening the
management capacity through MIS and office equipment. The project would also promote the transfer of existing postal
facilities to the private sector, thus significantly reducing operating and capital improvement costs. Severance payments
would be financed. Quality enhancement, efficiency improvement and sustainable capacity strengthening would be
achieved through a medium-term management contract where operating and developmental risks would be passed on to
the private sector, and payments would be based on performance.
Financial sector. The proposed operation would provide the Government with the resources needed to carry out key
sector reforms undertaken under the planned FINSAC. The project would address key sector issues including: (a) a large
involvement of GOT in the financial system, as GOT has significant ownership position in seven of the ten Togolese
financial institutions, of which two have major capital adequacy problems; (b) the weakness of the legal and judicial
system evidenced by lengthy procedures and unpredictable results; and (c) the weakness of the institutional environment
for microfinance. These issues would be addressed through: (a) privatization, restructuring or liquidation of seven
financial institutions; (b) raising awareness and building consensus on legal and judiciary issues and providing limited
improvement --through capacity building-- in the legal and judiciary environment for banking and insurance activities,
hence, paving the way to a more comprehensive reform to be developed in the forthcoming Private Sector Assessment;
and (c) improvement in the institutional environment and technical capacity of microfinance institutions to provide
financial services to micro-enterprises, while contributing to overall financial sector development.  In addition, a
deliberate effort would be undertaken under the project to build up technical and managerial capacity in the Ministry of
Economy and Finance and in the financial system, including in the area of microfinance.



8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Alternatives rejected: Continuation of previous practice by which privatization programs were carried out under structural
adjustment operations without an appropriate institutional framework to implement the privatization and specific
resources to finance preparation and implementation of transactions has been rejected. In particular, the lack of resources
to finance severance packages for employees to be laid-off has resulted in major implementation difficulties, which have
slowed the pace of the reform. Another alternative would have been to go ahead with separate projects for the
Telecommunications and Financial Sector reforms. However, it was agreed that despite the apparent complexity of the
project, the three components were basically tackling the main problem of public enterprise reform in the three areas of
Privatization, Post and Telecommunications, and Financial Sector Restructuring. Therefore, the idea of a single operation
was endorsed by the PCD Review Meeting, and adequate arrangements have been designed to ease implementation. One
of the alternatives considered and rejected was for the project not lto finance the priority investment plan but no fund
would have been available from the Treasury to finance it and it would have been too long to mobilize the donor
community. Finally, in the identification stage, developing a small and medium enterprise support component was
considered and discussed with GOT. However, this option was rejected and it was proposed to deal with the SME agenda
in the context of the broader private sector strategy to be developed during this fiscal year. To that effect, a private sector
assessment will be carried out during the first half of 1998.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in proposed project design:
Privatization programs have been previously supported by three technical assistance credits and one pre-investment
credit. The lessons learned from this experience are: (a) ensure that an appropriate institutional framework is in place and
preparation of transactions is contracted out as much as possible; (b) ensure availability of resources to finance severance
packages to employees to be laid-off in the privatization/restructuring process; (c) increase Togolese awareness and
support for the program through an effective communication strategy; (d) increase investor confidence through the
establishment of improved and more transparent procedures; and (e) reinforce post-privatization monitoring and
reporting on the performance of privatized enterprises. The proposed operation will be the first one entirely dedicated to
public enterprise reform.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Public Enterprise. GOT held a seminar on the overall privatization program in November 1996. GOT is now moving into
the transaction phase for most of the 25 enterprises agreed upon under the ERAC: (a) an international advisor has been
hired to assist with preparation or execution of transactions (b) implementation is moving (see para. 6); and (c) GOT is in
the process of hiring a Public Relations firm, which will help define and implement a broad communication strategy.



Posts and Telecommunications. A participatory approach was used to define the policy declaration for PT; a national
workshop was held in Lome in November 1995 with major stakeholders; the telecommunications law has been approved
and the postal law is being discussed in Parliament. GOT has expressed strong interest in the development of a pilot
experiment to increase communications access in rural and peri-urban areas. Separation of the Posts and Telecom has
been made effective since January 1997. A business plan to turn SPT into a profitable customer-oriented firm by
franchising a third of the exiting network and transforming postal offices in profit centers was finalized in June 1997. In
addition, during the appraisal mission, two workshops were held on TOGO-TELECOM and SPT, respectively, in order
to discuss in detail the reform agenda with the employees of the two entities and make sure they understand the issues atl
stake and adhere to the process.
Financial sector. The government has taken steps to accelerate the preparation of the FINSAC recently, including the
establishment of a Steering Committee for the program, and the launching of five preparatory studies designed to analyze
key policy and institutional issues in the sector. Government is presently receiving draft study reports. The project's
success in carrying out reforms in the financial sector will be contingent upon continued government commitment to
FINSAC's policy objectives.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The project will provide resources to: (a) consolidate and extend the policy reforms that are currently implemented underi
ERAC by supporting preparation and execution of transactions for additional PEs slated for divestiture, restructure the I
few PEs that will still remain in the GOT's portfolio, provide resources to finance severance packages; and (b) initiate al
financial sector reform agenda including restructuring/divestiture for the major financial institutions. It will also provide al
unique opportunity to carry out a comprehensive reform in the Posts and Telecoms sector in Togo. GOT is most
interested in benefiting from the Bank's broad experience in privatization and in the reform of telecommunication andi
financial sectors. The reforms involve changes at legal, regulatory, institutional and enterprise levels, and the Bank is|
well positioned to provide much needed support throughout the process.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic            X  Cost-Benefit Analysis:                     [ I  Cost Effectiveness  [] Other
Assessment                  NPV=US$85.4 million;                           Analysis:            [Specify]
(see Annex 4):              ERR= 42.0%
*   The economic benefits in the cost-benefit analysis are measured by: (a) additional income from newly
created employment opportunities in the private sector; (b) gains in productivity and output; (c) consumer
gains in prices and tariffs; and (d) retrenchment program benefits.
.   The economic costs include all project costs.
* The project is economically feasible, as indicated by NPV of $85.4 million equivalent (using 12% discount
rate) and IERR of 42%. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the project is robust even when key assumptions
deteriorate, giving a low probability of the NPV being negative.
* The project has a positive impact on Government finances, in the form of reduced subsidies to PE and gains
in corporate and other taxes of $ 22.7 million.
14. Technical Assessment:
The project is technically sound. Within the CAS agenda of promoting broad-based private sector-led growth, the project
would help increase the scope of private activity through support to: (a) privatization in key sectors such as banking and
telecommunications; (b) liberalization of the posts and telecommunications sector to promote new services and reduce
transaction costs; and (c) development of a vibrant microfinance sector. Design of project components took into account
lessons learned from previous operations in Togo and elsewhere. A pilot scheme is being developed both for the
retrenchment program and the provision of telecommunications services in remote areas. For SPT restructuring, a
technical study was undertaken to confirm the feasibility, scope, and cost-benefit of the business plan.



15. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: The three components will be implemente(d by the respective line ministries. Capacity of each
unit was thoroughly reviewed during project preparation. As a result, it was agreed to reinforce the MMETPT with a
coordination unit which will be supported by the project. The unit has been staffed with qualified staff recruited through
competitive process.
For the privatization program, it was agreed to contract out the bulk of preparation and implementation of transactions.
The unit in MSE will be in charge of monitoring the program. To reinforce capacity, two local consultants from the
private sector will be also hired using competitive procedures.
Activities tied to financial sector development will be coordinated by the Secretariat General at the Ministry of Finance
Capacity of the latter to carry out actions undertaken under both this project and the FINSAC will be reinforced with
support from the project through training of MEF's staff, financing of local consultants and technical expertise.
b. Project management: Given the specific nature of the project, each component will be managed independently.
However, there will be a coordinator located in the Prime Minister's office, who will ensure financial consolidation and
project monitoring in addition to ensuring coherence with sector strategies. He will also be in charge of harmonizing
procedures: the same accounting and reporting system will be put in place in each implementation unit. A private
accounting firm has been hired to design administrative and accounting procedures, produce the operation manual, and
hire and train the accountants.
16. Social Assessment:
The project would help alleviate the hardship resulting from layoffs under the retrenchment program. It would also
support the development of micro-and small enterprises.
17. Environmental Assessment:
Environmental Category [] A     []  B      [X] C

Note: IS=Information sharing; CON = consultation; and COL = collaboration
19. Sustainability:
It is expected that the Public Enterprise Sector will be sharply reduced to a core of PEs by the end of the project. It is also
expected that the Telecommunications sector will be largely liberalized with several operators participating in al
segments of the market. The MSE would be transformed into a small unit to monitor the residual portfolio. The reform
are not easily reversible.

21. Possible Controversial Aspects:
A possible source of controversy could stem from the public's perception of a lack of transparency and scope for
Togolese participation in the privatization process. To mitigate these risks, extensive discussions have been held with
GOT regarding the procedures to be followed and the need for a transparent process. Agreement was reached on the
requirement for public opening of bids, publication of results, etc. A public information campaign will be implemented ir
order to provide regular information on the program, aimed at building consensus as well as providing specifi
information on each transaction. GOT would also be required to pursue strategies for promoting broad nationall
ownership, including initial public offerings.

TOGO
Public Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization Support Project
Detailed Project Description
Overview
The overall objective of the project is to support Government policy of divestiture from productive sectors and
promote an accelerated private sector-led development of economic activities. Specifically, the project will
support: (a) privatization and restructuring of the few PEs remaining in the State portfolio; (b) implementation of
a comprehensive reform in the Post and Telecommunications (PT) sector in order to improve significantly access,
price, and diversity of communications services, via increased competition; and (c) complementing policy reform
in the financial sector to be implemented under the upcoming FINSAC, as well as promoting a vibrant
microfinance sector.
The project has three main components:
1. Public Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization
2. Posts and Telecommunications
3. Financial sector
Each component will be implemented by the respective line ministry. In addition, a small coordination unit,
located in the Prime Minister's office, will ensure global coordination and coherence with sector strategies. A
number of key activities will be contracted out to private consultants.
Project Component 1 - Public Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization USS 13.18 million.
This component will support the government policy of divestiture from productive sectors. More specifically, it
will assist GOT to implement its public enterprise reform and privatization program. The privatization program
will be implemented by contracting out the preparation and execution of transactions to specialized firms. Labor
redundancies issues will be addressed and a public information and communication strategy will be implemented.
The PE restructuring will focus on restructuring and monitoring the few PEs to be maintained in the portfolio; and
on streamlining the Ministry of State Enterprises (MSE) in view of the significant reduction of the PE sector. This
component consists of the following four subcomponents:
(a) Support to the Privatization Program. The Government has already started to implement a significant
privatization program of 25 enterprises under an ongoing adjustment operation (ERAC). In addition, the
Government is committed to implement an additional program of 15 PEs, including seven banks and financial
institutions, as well as the telecommunications entity (Togo Telecom). Under the Ordinance of June 1994 on
privatization, the Minister of State Enterprises is responsible for implementing the privatization program.
Assistance will be provided by a Privatization Committee comprising nine members, of which two come from the
private sector. The Committee has primary responsibility for setting up the minimum sale price when required
(i.e. public offerings) and the evaluation of the bids. The Portfolio Directorate (DP), a unit of the MSE, is
responsible for practical aspects of preparation and implementation. It was agreed that the DP will now play a key
role in coordinating implementation while actual preparation of strategies and execution of transactions will be
contracted out to specialized advisors with hands-on experience in privatization.

The Project will therefore support: (a) capacity building within the DP by financing two local consultants with
private sector experience and one part-time international consultant; (b) equipment and training; and (c) financing
of financial advisors as well as other technical expertise required for specific transactions.
(b) Public Enterprise Restructuring. The project aims at reducing the Government portfolio to a maximum of 5
enterprises by the end of the privatization program (National Social Security Board, Port Authority, Water
Company, Post Office, and National Laboratory of Public Buildings and Works). The project will support the
actions required to restructure and monitor the few enterprises remaining in the Portfolio including the Social
National Security Board (CNSS) and the Port Authority (PAL). In addition, concerning CNSS, the project will
finance the organization of a round table to better inform the private sector about the new Social Security Code
(CIPRES) and provide resources to implement the recommendations of the Regional Commission on CNSS. The
Directorate in charge of PE monitoring (DIGA) will implement this subcomponent. In addition, MSE will be
reduced to a small unit of professionals by the end of the program to reflect its much reduced workload.
(c) Public Information Campaign. During project preparation, GOT has financed a consultant to design a
public information campaign aimed at: (a) informing potential investors on the opportunities offered; (b) building
general public support and investor confidence; and ensuring transparency of the program through wide
dissemination of privatization procedures, disclosure of results of each transaction and general information on
overall results and impact of the program. Implementation of the public information campaign will be contracted
out to specialized communication consultants. In addition, an assessment of the campaign will be done annually
by independent consultants.
(d) Staff Retrenchment Program. A major issue to be addressed is the social dimension of the PE reform. A
large number of PEs are overstaffed and require a retrenchment program in order to become competitive and
attractive to investors. The current program has experienced delays due to the lack of resources and solutions to
facilitate layoffs resulting from liquidation and privatization. During project preparation, a study financed under a
PHRD grant has indicated that some 1,800 employees could be retrenched and has proposed a set of options to
assist in redeployment of employees. So far, about 420 employees have been laid-off in the seven enterprises that
have been liquidated. A pilot operation has been financed by the PPF advance in order to validate the assumptions
made by the consultant and the schemes to adopt for supporting small and micro- projects and job search.
The project will finance the severance payments conforming with the guidelines defined in the operational
memorandum dated March 5, 1996. More specifically, it would finance: (i) minimum retrenchment benefits for
involuntary separation, as defined in the Labor Code and Collective Bargaining Agreements, and salaries in
arrears for these employees at the time of separation; (ii) an incentive scheme for early retirement for employees
at least 50 years of age and (iii) minimum medical coverage for a period of 12 months for laid-off employees. In
addition, the operation will finance two specific schemes to facilitate the re-absorption of laid-off workers into the
economy. It will assist employees in creating their own enterprises, as well as employees seeking new jobs. This
subcomponent will be managed by a small coordinating unit including a coordinator, an accountant and a
secretary. All other activities will be contracted to private consultants. They will include: (a) support for job
search, (b) assistance and training for small and micro-entrepreneurs and (c) contribution to the costs of an SME
Unit in a commercial bank to finance viable projects of laid-off employees.
Financing will be provided to cover the severance payments for the 420 employees that have already been laid
off. IDA will finance these expenditures on a retroactive basis up to January 1, 1997. Payments will be made on
the basis of a summary table per enterprise reviewed by the accountant to make sure that the guidelines of the
retrenchment manual guidelines are adequately applied.
Implementation arrangements. Overall monitoring of this component will be the responsibility of the Ministry
of State Enterprises. A coordinator will be designated to ensure the overall coherence of implementation. He will
be assisted by an accountant and an administrative assistant. DP will be specifically in charge of the privatization
program and DIGA will monitor the residual portfolio as well as the restructuring component. A specific



Page 3 of 6
coordination unit will be set up in order to monitor the Staff Retrenchment Program.
Project Component 2 - Reform of the Post and Telecommunications Sectors US$14.3 million.
This component will support the Government's postal and telecommunications sector reform. More specifically,
it will provide technical assistance to the GOT's program aimed at: (a) implementing an extensive reform of the
telecommunications sector, including the privatization of the main operator and liberalization of
telecommunications service provision under a new regulatory framework ; and (b) restructuring postal activities
designed to improve profitability.
(a) Establishment of a Regulatory Agency. The establishment of a regulatory agency is a priority of the
Govemment, which has decided to open the telecommunications market to competition and to privatize TOGO
TELECOM. During the project preparation, legal assistance has been provided to GOT for the drafting of the
Telecom bill, which provides for an independent regulator for the telecommunications sector. Assistance under
this project consists of: (a) establishment of the regulatory agency; (b) recruitment and training of staff; (c)
definition of new regulatory functions; and (d) establishment of operational procedures for the agency.
Assistance will be initially required for analysis, recommendations, and decision making for the establishment of
the agency, which will be followed by a medium term institutional capacity building. This component will finance
consultants for initial establishment of the agency and on-site medium term assistance for at least the first 12
months to secure the necessary transfer of skills. An intemational training program of the agency staff will also
be financed from the project.
(b) Establishment of Frequency Management System. The electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce physical
resource whose efficient allocation is essential for a country to take full advantage of new radio-based
technologies in telecommunications service provision.  The  existing method of manual allocation and
management of the frequency spectrum in Togo is inadequate under current sector conditions. Efficiency
improvements are required to enable the increased traffic loads and the multiplication of service providers, which
will result from sector liberalization. In order to address this situation, a Frequency Spectrum Management
System (FSMS) needs to be established in TOGO. This component will finance an initial audit of the current
system, the establishment of a national plan of the spectrum, and the design of a number of options for the
spectrum management. Following the Govemment's selection of a management system, the project will finance
specification and purchase of equipment, defining of detailed procedures and training in matters of spectrum
management, allocation, and monitoring.
(c) Liberalization Implementation. The Telecommunications Law sets up a foundation for competitive provision
of services in all segments of the telecommunications market. Under the new legal framework, it is important to
define an adequate market structure and a regulatory framework which will allow effective competition in service
provision. This component will provide support for technical assistance to GOT to elaborate a liberalization strategy
and an effective regulatory framework. The consultants will assist in defining the mid-term to long-term market
strategy and sector policy, the complete regulatory framework such as interconnection regime, tariff policy, universal
service policy and licenses for all operators. The GOT has launched a bidding process in order to license a second
cellular operator with direct intemational access so as to immediately introduce competition in the market. The
Bank has already financed a consultant to assist the GOT in managing the bidding process including : bid
preparation, evaluation, selection, negotiations and finalization of transaction.
(d) Pilot Experiment to Increase Access to Telecommunications Services in Rural Area. A liberalized
telecommunications environment and new technologies allow profitable service operations in rural areas. During
project preparation, the GOT has expressed great interest in establishing a pilot experiment to test the feasibility
and the viability of regional private operations, with the possibility to develop a franchising scheme in areas not
currently covered by TOGO TELECOM. This component is designed to finance technical assistance to carry out
the pilot including : analysis of the situation, identification of options (scope, technical specification, regulatory



Page 4 of 6
options and financial dimensions), and implementation of GOT's options (selection and training of the rural
operator, equipment procurement, supervision and evaluation of the pilot). Contingent upon the findings of the
initial assessment and/or the evaluation of the experiment, a larger scale franchising scheme could be established,
for which additional technical assistance and training and financing equipment may be required.
(e) Privatization of TOGO TELECOM. The decision to open the capital of TOGO TELECOM to private sector
participation has been made by GOT. This component will support the management of the privatization
transaction, which will require the assistance of international transaction advisors, in particular, legal advisors,
financial auditor, investment bankers and public relations/communications advisors. More specifically, this
component will finance both the remuneration of all advisors required by the transaction, and the fixed fee for the
investment bankers.
(f) National Information Strategy. The information revolution provides major opportunities for developing
countries, the advanced telecommunications services allow various service exports and efficient delivery of
public services by increasing business connectivity and access to valuable information. A National Information
Strategy, conceived as a participatory process involving GOT and key stockholders with the objective of
identifying opportunities for TOGO to take advantage of the infornation revolution and telecommunications
sector reform, will be prepared. The technical assistance required for this process will be financed under the
project. The project will also support implementation of initiatives identified in the strategy. Based on existing
experience with the conduct of National Information Strategy (such as the one in Mauritius or Jordan), it is
envisaged that follow-up implementation needs will mainly include training, legal assistance, and possibly
equipment purchase, if the development of specialized applications is envisaged.
(g) Postal Restructuring. Despite the increasing use of telecommunications, postal services in Togo remain the
most important means of communications, especially in the rural areas of the country. Globalization of trade and
services exerts pressure on building reliable postal services to bring the benefits of growth to the entire
population. A reliable and efficient postal service is an effective facilitator of economic growth and an important
vehicle for trading and commercial linkages between the urban and rural areas of the country. With the
separation of post from telecommunications, there is a unique opportunity for SPT to turn around and make
efficient use of its network to promote postal services and become financially autonomous. The core objective of
the project is to support GOT in an accelerated postal reform effort in the following manner: strengthening
institutional capacity to undertake enterprise restructuring initiatives with the objective of improving quality of
service (better access particularly in rural areas) and reducing cost significantly by providing management
support through private sector partnership and increasing labor productivity. In order to meet these objectives
within a relatively short period of time (within 4 years), the sub-component is structured in the following manner:
1.     Capacity Development:  SPT has to undertake significant restructuring measures, including
capital improvement and investment programs, to turnaround the performance of the Post.  The
Government, through its recent experiences of public enterprise reform, has recognized the weaknesses
of traditional capacity development through training and systems, and attaches great importance to
private partnership. In the case of SPT, the Government would like to mobilize high quality management
and technical expertise in the form of a performance-based management contract, as well as transfer the
operations, management, maintenance and developmental responsibilities to a private operator for a fixed
period of time. The project would provide financing for the following activities: (i) Preparation of
Management Contract, (ii) Partial Financing Management Contract, and (iii) Training and Workshops.
Technical assistance for the preparation of private sector partnership would involve the design of all bid
documents, design and implementation of regulatory framework, and transaction assistance to the
Government. The financing of the management contract is for the first three years of operation. After
the third year, the operator's remuneration will be covered by the proceeds generated from operations of
SPT. Additionally, an incentive arrangement will be built into the contract in order to link the size of the



Page 5 of 6
operator's fees to increased profit generated by SPT. Training and workshops are intended for employees
of Togo Post to learn about the experiences of similar reform efforts in other countries and to draw
lessons for Togo Post's restructuring program.
2. Network Strengthening: The postal network of Togo is in a poor state and is limited in its coverage,
as it is able to service only a portion of the inhabitants. The overall objective of strengthening the postal
network is to rehabilitate, modernize and expand the network so that the Post Office is able to provide
market responsive services efficiently to all inhabitants. The network strengthening component has the
following features, it: (i) reduces operating and fixed costs by transferring part of the existing postal retail
network to the private sector; (ii) increases the coverage of the service by expanding the network through
private sector involvement; and (iii) undertakes a prioritized investment program to rehabilitate the postal
network for efficient delivery of services. The project will provide technical assistance for designing a
postal network strategy to expand service coverage in a cost effective manner. The expansion, as well as
some of the existing network operations, will involve the private sector in a significant way in the form of
franchise contracts. The TA will also develop a strategy and program for the effective expansion of the
network for the provision of financial services through the Post Office. Moreover, the TA will assist the
Govemment in selecting appropriate private partners and in establishing franchise contracts and operating
agreements, and it will assist in the transactions.
The project will also finance the prioritized core investments for the rehabilitation and renewal of the
postal network. These investment activities include the following: (i) rehabilitation of three post offices,
reconfiguration of a sorting center, and installment of 6,000 post office boxes in 3 post offices (total cost
of 514 million CFAF); (ii) refurbishment of postal financial services center and 11 post offices (total cost
of 115 million CFAF); (iii) strengthening of the postal fleet (transport and delivery vehicles) of the Post
Office (total cost of 259 million CFAF); (iv) computerization of 34 owned-offices throughout Togo (total
cost of 140 million CFAF); and (v) office equipment and operations material for post offices (total cost of
185 million CFA).
Implementation Arrangements. Overall monitoring of this component will be the responsibility of MMETPT.
During project preparation, severe limitations were identified in the institutional capability of the ministry in
charge of posts and telecommunications (MMETPT). A coordination team, composed of 3 local experts
(telecommunications, legal, and economist), an accountant, and an administrative assistant, will be established.
Project Component 3: Financial Sector - US$ 5.2 million.
This project component will support implementation of reforms to be undertaken under the upcoming FINSAC.
It comprises three sub-activities.
(a) Support to Privatization, Restructuring, or Liquidation of Selected Financial Institutions. The project
will finance advisory services allowing for the privatization/sale of UTB, BTCI (the two largest banking
institutions) and SIAB (a small commercial bank held jointly by GOT and the government of Libya), the possible
privatization/merger of BTD (a development bank), the privatization through capital increase of GTA (an
insurance company), and the privatization/restructuring of CET (a savings bank) and SNI (a national investment
corporation). This sub-component will also finance potential retrenchment expenses, if need be, and limited
capacity building in the insurance sector and for CET as well, if not liquidated. (NB: it should be noted that
specific studies for SNI, CET and GTA are presently ongoing; final reports are due 2 weeks after comments are
sent on draft reports).



Page 6 of 6
(b) Strengthening the Legal and Judiciary System. This component is focused on business laws and
regulations applicable to the financial sector. Based on the conclusions of a study to be launched shortly, the
project will finance: (i) A round table to build a broad consensus about the major legal and judicial issues. (ii)
Knowledge dissemination of applicable new laws and regulations applicable to the banking and insurance sector,
by means of: (a) two seminars on OHADA (common business law for general trade and enterprises) and CIMA
(insurance law) rules and regulations, respectively, from the perspective of lenders and borrowers, on the one
hand, and of insurers and the insured, on the other; and (b) printing and distribution of applicable texts with and
without comments. (iii) This component will also finance some legal consultant work to clean up current
situation whereby domestic texts may be in contradiction with regional texts that are applicable. Finally, (iv)
some equipment for the Ministry of Justice, such as a photocopier ancl a few PCs will be financed to allow for
immediate better functioning of the Judiciary pending the global impro-vement plan and its implementation. This
sub-component will be closely coordinated with the Private Sector Assessment and other activities of donors,
namely, the French Cooperation and UNDP.
(c) Promoting the Microfinance Sector. The project will support the Microfinance sector in four ways. It will
provide (i) resources for training and equipment to a special unit to be established in the MEF, in charge of
supervising microfinance institutions. (These actions will be coordinated with Canada's CIDA, which is also
providing assistance to this end at the regional level, through BCEAO, the regional central bank); (ii) support to
MFI (Microfinance Institutions) network's to disseminate best practices and to provide various services such as
training, information, and accounting methodology. Local consultants will be recruited to assist the network in
producing and implementing its action plan, and to provide institutional support and training; (iii) support to the
"Comite National de Concertation" in order to strengthen the dialogue between GOT and MFIs through provision
of resources for national meetings and seminar; and to design a national strategy for Microfinance; (iv)
consultancy resources to the most important MFI in Togo, FUCEC, to strengthen institutional capacity and
strategic planning and to improve its intermediation role vis a vis MFIs.
(d) Implementation Arrangements. The unit responsible for the irnplementation of the project's financial
sector component will be the General Secretariat of Economy in the MEF, which will also be responsible for the
parallel implementation of the FINSAC. In order to assist the General Secretariat, the project will finance the
salaries of a local consultant and an accountant/assistant, in charge of maintaining proper accounting for that
component. The Terms of Reference for the consultant will also include the organization of capacity building
actions for the MEF in various fields including macro economic management, finance, public accounting, public
debt management. The project will finance the technical expertise required for capacity building and for specific
transactions as needed. Finally, the component will finance some equipment: one photocopier, two computers,
one fax machine, and one car. This implementation unit would be responsible for the financial aspects of the
legal/judiciary sub-component: disbursement for that sub-component would transit through the MEF special
account.
Overall Coordination of the Project US$ 0.69 million
A project coordination unit, located within the Prime Minister' s office, vvill ensure overall coordination and
coherence with sector strategies. This unit will be staffed with two persons and will be specifically in charge of
(a) monitoring progress via the performance indicators and organizing supervision missions; (b) supervising the
setting up of the financial and accounting organization for each component, monitoring budget preparation and
timely delivery of audits. The project will finance both consultants and some equipment, i.e. one photocopier,
two computers, one fax machine, and one car. The IDA credit will finance the audit of the project's accounts.

(a) Using a discount rate of 12%.
(b) Benefits are estimated using incremental taxes obtained from privatized enterprises and new businesses.
(c) Savings derived from reduced subsidies to public enterprises
Main Assumptions:
1. Stable macroeconomics environment as projected in the CAS with real GDP growth averaging at 5%.
2. Additional capital investment will be available for rehabilitation of equipment, new technology, training of
staff, which will boost capacity utilization rates and increase productivity.
3. It has also been assumed that:
(a) GOT is fully committed to Public Enterprise Reform;
(b) the project would develop a market friendly and competitive environment through the establishment
of an appropriate regulatory framework, which, in turn, would help attract foreign capital, technology,
and managerial expertise required to improve the efficiency of the sectors and their value added
contributions to GDP.
4. Detailed quantitative assumptions are described in Annex 4-1
Results
Base Case Results. The net present value of the project is estimated at about US $ 85.4 million for a 12%
discount rate, and its internal economic rate of return is estimated at 42%. The net present value of the project
varies from about US$ 101.9 million to US$ 55.2 million for discount rates of 10% and 17%, respectively. The
IERR for the project components are all estimated to be above 25%.
Switching values of critical items:
Two sensitivity tests were carried out: (a) the first test assumed that gains in productivity & output and the
consumer gains in price/tariff were half of the base case, while (b) the second test assumed a 50% reduction in
gains in productivity & output and the consumer gains in price/tariff, coupled with a zero growth in additional
income from employment opportunities. They show an IRR at 26.6% and a NPV at $ 36.0 million, and an IRR at
24.4% and a NPV at $ 28.9 million, respectively. This table demonstrates that this project produces solid results.

L.    Recent Macro-Economic Developments
I.    After three years of political and social upheaval, Government of Togo (GOT) initiated,
in 1994, a comprehensive adjustment program, aimed at restoring sustained growth and achieving
a viable external position. As a result of the realignment of the CFA franc in January, 1994 and
the implementation of structural reforms, real GDP grew by 14 and 8 percent respectively in
1994 and 1995. Government revenues which had declined to a record low 10 percent of GDP in
1993 rebounded to 15 percent of GDP in 1995 and the external position improved significantly.
Performance in 1996 was mixed. Although the economic recovery remained robust, the
programmed fiscal targets and improvements in expenditure management were not achieved and
the external current account deficit deteriorated slightly to the equivalent of 8.5 percent from 8.3
percent of GDP in 1995. Following the implementation of corrective measures taken by end-1996
and early 1997, a new Policy Framework Paper (PFP) was negotiated with the Government in
April 1997 and was distributed to the Executive Directors. In this context, GOT has decided to
implement a reform program aimed at promoting an accelerated private sector led development
of economic activities and supported by Bank assistance.
I.    Objectives and Description of the Project
2.    The overall objective of the project is to support the Government's policy of divestiture
in the productive sectors and promote an accelerated private sector led development of economic
activities. Specifically, the project will support three major components: (a) privatization and
restructuring of the few Public Enterprises (PEs) remaining in the State portfolio, (b)
implementation of a comprehensive reform in the Post and Telecommunications (PT) sector in
order to improve access, price and diversity of communications services, via increased
competition; and (c) complementing policy reform in the financial sector to be implemented
under the upcoming FINSAC as well as promoting a vibrant Microfinance sub-sector. A specific
retrenchment program has been built into the project to alleviate the hardship of layoffs resulting
from the privatization/restructuring program. The proposed project would finance severance
payments in keeping with the guidelines defined in the operational memorandum of March 5,
1996. It is expected that the project would help increase performance and efficiency of privatized
and restructured enterprises, promote private investment and facilitate private sector and
economic growth and help reduce the level of poverty in the country. The economic analysis of
the overall project is presented in section III and the analysis of the retrenchment program in
section IV.

111.    Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Overall Project
3.     Methodology. The cost-benefit analysis concentrates on identification and measurement
problems that are encountered in all project evaluations. Therefore, to address the identification
issue for the project costs and benefits, only direct ancd indirect incremental impacts on the
Government and society of Togo were considered. The welfare gains and losses were estimated
by using net change in average economic output price. Where explicit prices were not available,
and or non-indicative of true socioeconomic cost and benefits, indicative proxies have been
applied. The evaluation was done in terms of economic cash flow analysis which was developed
from the financial cash flow of the project. Recognition was given to the fact that not all
economic costs and benefits are measurable in monetary terins.
4.     Most of the expected benefits would occur in the medium term since the project is
expected to facilitate essentially institutional development in both public and private sectors. The
identified indirect benefits were quantified to obtain their monetary values because no direct cost
recovery mechanisms have been built into the project. Monetary values inputted to the indirect
benefits represents measurable gains from additional income generated from newly created jobs,
economic efficiency from reduction in factor costs and business cost of capital and consumer
surplusl. Furthermore, expected non-monetized benefits from the project include improved
management, changes in quality and quantity of services, conducive business environment,
changes in poverty alleviation and social distress. Non cash flow financial values such as
amortization charges, sunk costs for physical requirements, and the debt service obligations were
considered only in relation to fiscal impact of the project.
5.     Cost-benefit analysis was done for the three major components (a) PE restructuring and
privatization, (b) post and telecommunication reform, and (c) support to financial sector reform.
This logical extension of the analysis was helpful in assessing the marginal impact of the major
components on the overall project's net benefits. Subsequently, all project components were
evaluated together in a project cost-benefit analysis framework that determined the economic rate
of return and net present value. The distributional aspect of the benefits have been analyzed by
identification of the project beneficiaries. In addition, a separate economic analysis was
conducted for the retrenchment program and the results were incorporated in PE restructuring
and privatization component.
6.    It has been difficult to deal with inter-firm  linkages and inter-industry dependencies
within the PE sector and other firms. For example, Togo-Telecom benefits from monopoly
charges to other PEs and indirectly provides short term financing in form of huge receivable
accounts. It would be difficult to include such costs in the economic analysis. Therefore, it is
assumed that the benefits such as reduction in factor costs, incremental employment
opportunities, value added through productivity enhancements and gains in efficiency of service
delivery, include inter-firn benefits.
7.    Assumptions: It has been assumed:
a) that GOT is fully committed to Public Enterprise Reform. The project design reflects the
need to accelerate PE reform by accommodating country and political objectives of
See Appendix: 4A which illustrate quantification of the benefits.



Page 3 of 11
employment opportunities, public participation and awareness, enterprise continuity and
social obligations.
b) that the GOT will continue with its prudent economic policies to stabilize the country's
macroeconomics environment. The GDP growth rate is estimated to average at 5.0% per
annum during the life of the project.
a) that the project would develop a market friendly and competitive environment through the
establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework which would, in turn, help attract
foreign capital, technology, and managerial expertise required to improve the efficiency of
the sectors and their value added contributions to GDP.
a) that the private sector, both local and foreign investors, will respond positively to the sector
reforms from the project. A positive response is critical for the realization of the indirect
benefits.
8.     Project Costs. The estimated total project costs for the PE  Restructuring and
Privatization support project during the four- year period 1998 to 2001 is US$ 35.7 million. The
costs would finance technical assistance requirements, transaction costs for restructuring and
privatization, retrenchment costs, institutional and capacity building support, management and
operating costs of the project. They include GOT's contribution which is estimated at 16 % of
total project costs. The usual price contingencies amounts of 7 % of the total project costs are
included in the total project costs amount. Price contingencies are usually for the unexpected
changes in the general price level of capital goods and/or project-specific real cost increases. The
real cost increases could be as a result of unforeseen difficulties and expenditures or increases in
the scope of the project.

9.     The proposed project will neither affect the ability of businesses in the private sector to
survive, plan or grow; nor will it affect availability of services to the consumer. Therefore,
indirect costs have not been included in the cost-benefit analysis of the project.
10.    Project Benefits.2 Four major economic benefits have been identified and quantified:
a) Benefits from newly created employment opportunities in the private sector.
(Government and the public enterprise sectors account for about 50% of overall employment,
employment in the private sector has declined by 60/a since 1991). The additional income
from newly created employment opportunities has been estimated on the basis of expected
additional job creation due to new investment and new idemand for services.
b) Benefits in Productivity and Output: Gains are expected from higher total factor
productivity, resulting from expected changes in work ethics, training, better management,
better equipment and new technology. Additional gains will also be derived from efficiency
in the financial system. It will include (i) the additional return linked to an increase in
resource mobilization, (ii) a reduction of intermediation costs and (iii) improved management
in financial institutions which would lead to better allocation of resources in the economy.
c) Consumer Surplus (Gains in price and tariff): Benefits to the consumer are expected in
the formn of lower price/tariffs and improved service quality, wider coverage due to
competition and private sector involvement. Only benefits from reduced prices have been
quantified for the analysis. Gains accrued to consumers due to service accessibility have not
been quantified.
d) Benefits from the Retrenchment Program include the additional contribution to the
economy that the workers will be able to make by working where there is (a) an effective
demand for their services, and or (b) by developing their own economic activities, and (c)
through cost savings from the PE restructuring program referred as "loss of current wages
(see Section IV).

11.   Target groups. Key target groups have been identified and include:
a) Consumers would gain about US $ 74.7million. The sources of benefits (consumer surplus)
include expected reductions in tariffs, expected increase in access to services, expected
elimination of waste, expedited accounts receivable collection and probable productivity
gains.
b) Retrenched employees would benefit from project's resources. These resources would
substantially reduce social distress, anxiety and discomfort during the transition period
estimated at 12 months. Through social cost support, the project would also generate more
sustainable employment opportunities for individuals who will opt to be self-employed. The
severance and social safety net payments would ensure family cohesiveness and eliminate the
risk of family income falling below the poverty line.
c) Employees welfare in the privatized enterprises is expected to increase. This would be
achieved either through employee share purchase plans and new labor contracts, that
normally accompany privatization or through expected gains from increases in the average
wage bill due to private enterprise productivity performance and additional employment
opportunities.
d) Working adult population whose employment is at risk because of the current stagnation of
employment in the private sector would benefit from the project due to expected growth in
the private sector which will generate new employment opportunities to assist in poverty
alleviation.
e) Unemployed people and new graduates would also benefit from the new jobs expected to
be created by privatized firms and new entrants in the productive sectors of the economy.
f) The private sector, including both local and foreign investors, whose investment
opportunities have been restrained due to unfavorable business environment resulting from
public enterprise monopoly power, would benefit from removal of entry barriers and
reduction in factor costs of production like in telecommunications. This is shown on the
economic benefit values on estimated increases in productivity and output, and in reduced
costs of investment. 3 Growth in the private sector is expected to generate employment
opportunities to further alleviate the social costs of unemployment. These economic benefits
are reflected in the estimated benefits from increased employment, productivity and output.
g) Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises would benefit from the project in form of
conducive business environment. Businesses in the informal sector and small and micro
enterprises would be freed from constraints encountered in high factor costs of production
and financial market distortions. In addition the improved financial sector services and
accessibility  of  credit  would  stimulate  further  growth  in  this  sector.
See Table 1.

12.   Base Case Results.4 The net present value of the project is estimated at about US$ 85.4
million for a 12% discount rate, and its internal economic rate of return is estimated at 42.0 %.
The net present value of the project varies from about US$ 101.9 million to US$ 55.2 million for
discount rates of 10% and 17%, respectively. The IRR. for the project components are all
estimated to be above 25%. See Table 3.

13.   Sensitivity Analysis. Two sensitivity tests were carried out: (a) The first assumed that
gains in productivity & output and the gains in consumer gains from price/tariff, were half of the
base case and (b) the second assumed a 50% reduction in Gains in Productivity & Output and a
75% reduction in consumer gains from price/tariff, coupled with a zero growth in additional
income fromr. employment opportunities. The results are shown in Table 4.

They show an IRR at 26.6 % and a NPV at $ 36.0 million, and an IRR at 24.4 % and a NPV at
$ 28.9 million, respectively. This table demonstrates that this project produces robust results.

14.   In addition, the project will generate $ 22.7 million of savings in public finance in the
form of resource allocation efficiency. These savings are expected to come from significant
reduction in direct and indirect subsidies to public enterprises, reduction of transfer of productive
capital resources into the PE sector and increase in corporate and other tax gains from privatized
and new firms. This would reduce government fiscal burden and would free resources for new
investment in the social sectors.
IV.    Staff Retrenchment Program Economic Analysis
Introduction
15.    GOT has agreed to divest its holdings in 25 enterprises under the ERAC and has recently
agreed on a program for the divestiture of an additional 15 PEs to be implemented during the
proposed project. Implementation of the program is being carried out through direct sale of
shares or assets as well as liquidation of non-performing enterprises. So far, out of the 25 PEs,
three have been privatized, five liquidated and another 12 are on the market. A major issue to be
addressed under the program is the social dimension of PE reform. A large number of PEs are
overstaffed and require restructuring and a retrenchment program in order to become competitive
and attractive to potential investors. GOT has decided to implement a set of social measures
aimed at mitigating the impact of layoffs under the privatization and restructuring program.
Labor Market and Characteristics of Laid-off Employees
16.    A detailed study has been carried out in order to identify the likely target groups to be
laid off and possible remedial measures to be implemented, aimed at facilitating their re-
absorption into the productive economy.
17.    Labor situation in Togo.     The labor force accounts for about 48%  of the total
population of 4.1 million with an estimated annual growth rate of 2.8%. The formal employment
includes some 76,000 employees of which 20% are in the public enterprise sector. Formal
employment has decreased by 5000 since 1991 (the beginning of the political turmoil),
representing a decline of 6%. An analysis by sector shows an increase in employment in the
agriculture sector and a significant decrease in the manufacturing and services sectors. The
majority of employment is in the maritime region.
18.    On the other hand, employment in the informal sector has increased significantly. It is
estimated that the informal sector employs some 300,000 employees, including traders,
craftsmen, etc., of which two-thirds are in the capital city. The annual growth rate between 1988
and 1995 has been estimated at 5%.
19.    Key characteristics of employees.   The study reviewed 18 PEs5, comprising most
of those to be affected by the retrenchment program, operating mainly in the hotels, agriculture,
and service sectors, and covering some 1550 employees. The population is, on average, 43 years
5 10 hotels of which 4 are located in the capital city, 5 PEs recently liquidated OPAT (cocoa and cotton
marketing board), SOTONAM (Shipping company), SITO (Real estate), SOTED (Consulting firm) and
SONAPH (Palm-oil mill)], and 3 companies under study: TOGOPHARMA (Drug distribution), EDITOGO
(Printing) and SOTOMA (Marble processing).

of age and with roughly 17 years of service. It includes 8% of executives, 30% of middle
management and 62% of employees. In addition, as pait of the postal and financial sector
reforms, another 250 employees are likely to be laid-off from SPT (Post office), GTA (Insurance)
and SNI (Investment).
Proposed Retrenchment Program
20.    The program would cover the following costs: (i) severance payments for all employees,
(ii) social safety nets, and (iii) assistance for re-absorption in the productive sector, including job
training and support for micro and small enterprise development.
(a)    Severance Payments
The program will finance indemnities to be paid to laid-off employees. This will cover all
legal indemnities, in line with the Labor Code and collective bargaining agreements. It is
estimated that this would represent, on average, eight months of salary.
The program would also finance an early retirement scheme for employees who are more
than 50 years of age. This would include payment of: (a) pension premiums until the date
of retirement and (b) payment of a special indemnity of 1% of the annual salary, per year
of service.
b)     Social Safety Nets
The program would finance limited medical coverage for a period of up to 12 months for
retrenched staff. Provision of this service would be contracted out to an insurance
company. It would also finance a small social fund (US$ 30,000) to provide seed money
for the setting-up of small-scale industries mainly for the spouses of retrenched
employees.
c)     Assistance to Economic Re-absorption
All employees will be interviewed by a team of counselors and will prepare their
assessment of their own achievements and capabilities. After the interviews and a
thorough review of each case, candidates will be divided into two categories: potential
entrepreneurs with a sound project and job seekers. The program will finance a scheme
to assist entrepreneurs to develop their project. This would include: (i) specific training at
the beginning, including assistance for the preparation of a business plan, and (ii)
monitoring during the first years of implementation. It would also provide minimum
training and outplacement services for employees seeking new jobs.
21.    A pilot operation was implemented during project preparation with a sample of 300
employees, drawn from five PEs that were liquidated. The sample represents 25% of the overall
population. The pilot operation has been very useful in helping to define the structure of the
program as its participants reflect a representative sample of the structure and characteristics of
the overall population.



Page 9 of I I
Economic analysis
22.    A cost benefit analysis has been carried out in order to assess the relevance of the
program. It includes a specific analysis of the retrenchment program and an analysis of the
impact on the sectors involved.
23.   Methodology. The economic costs and benefits of the program  are compared as
follows: (a) costs cover both severance payments and redeployment costs, and (b) benefits
include the additional contribution to the economy that the workers will be able to make by
working where there is an effective demand for their services, or by developing their own
economic activities. Severance payments have been calculated on the basis of the collective
bargaining agreements applicable to each economic sector.
24.    Costs. The costs of the retrenchment program are given by the sum of the following
items:
I) Severance payments (SP)
2) Early retirement payments (ER)
3) Outplacement costs to assist job seekers (OC)
4) Support to SMEs (SM)
5) Costs of administering the program (PC)
The marginal productivity value of privatized enterprise retrenched employees has not
been included because the labor reduction does not affect remaining personnel ability to carry out
current production levels. The marginal productivity value of the retrenched employees is equal
to zero. The items (1) and (2) would not have been considered economic costs if there were no
budgetary constraints in Togo. Instead they would have been considered as income-efficient
transfers to the retrenched employees and thus not included in the cost-benefit analysis. The
inclusion recognize the importance of the cost of public funds. The items (3), (4) and (5) have
been included because they have an economic component in each of them that have alternative
use of the resources.
25. , Benefits.      The benefits of redundancy reduction in each year are given by the:
1) Marginal productivity of laid-off employees elsewhere in the economy (PE)
2) Marginal revenues of laid-off employees creating their new enterprises (PSM)
3) Marginal productivity value of the forgone labor cost of privatized enterprises
(LCW)
The marginal productivity value of the retrenched employee (1) and (2) is the product of:
(i) probability of the employee's engagement in another activity, which depends on the
effectiveness of the training and assistance that the employee receives, by (ii) the net income
produced by such activity. The activities could be new employment through replacement or self-
employed activities. The marginal productivity of the value forgone labor cost of privatized
enterprises represents (3) the opportunity cost of the outlays that will be saved by the program.
These savings in labor costs can be used in investments in other sectors of Togo's economy. In
the cost-benefit analysis they have been considered to be equivalent to foregone labor cost.
However, a non-productivity indicator has been factored-in to reflect social factors that have



Page 10 of II
reduce the levels of costs savings to society. 6 In the overa.ll economic analysis of the project, the
savings in labor costs have translated in terms of reduction in the long-run marginal factor costs.
This cost reduction is expected to increase the privatized enterprises competitiveness which
would explain the improvement in the private sector contributions to economic growth.
26.   Assumptions. The model identifies the employees that are likely to develop their own
project and the ones that are likely to seek out new jobs (75% and 25% respectively). These
numbers are derived from the results of the pilot operation which analyzed the case of 300
employees. It is assumed that the probability of finding new jobs is 15%. This result is based on
an analysis of the job market over the past three years, using several sets of available data
(employment agency, national social security board, private placement firms and surveys).
However, with the impact of the outplacement program, the probability of finding new jobs could
go up to 38%. It is also assumed that the salary reduction would be about 30%. This number has
been obtained from a detailed analysis of the private salary structure from the Collective
Bargaining Agreements. Finally, the probability of developing a privately-owned business
successfully has been estimated at around 50%.
27.    Results. The net present value (NPV) of the retrenchment program is estimated at US$
13.0 million for a 12% discount rate and the internal economic rate of return is estimated at
41.9% under the base case. This rate is sensitive to the revenues expected from self-owned
businesses. If revenues from SMEs are assumed to be 50% less than expected, the estimated rate
of return would be reduced to 37.1%. If the probability of successfully established enterprises
increases to 70%, the rate would increase to 48.3%. On the other hand, if the probability of
finding jobs is increased to 38%, the estimated rate of return of the program would also increase
to be as much as 42.3%. Consequently, the program has been designed to focus primarily on
support for the development of new entrepreneurs.
28.    These results shows that the retrenchment program has a social value even under the
most pessimistic assumptions. The social value does not come from the fact that the employees of
privatized enterprises are retrenched, but rather on the fact that the retrenched employees can be
better used in the other sectors of the economy where their demand has been identified, and from
the specific efforts made to ensure that the quality of this labor force will be enhanced through
training and other support programs. Moreover, it also shows that scarce public resources are
better utilized if the beneficiaries are targeted.
29.   In addition, an analysis of the impact of the program for the sectors involved has been
carried out and is included in the overall economic analysis of the project. Based on experience
derived from the former privatization programs and the financial information generated by new
entrants, it appears that the productivity (i.e. revenue per employee) is, at least, twice than that of
the public sector. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that the project would have a significant
impact on the sectors involved. Finally, the program will have a social impact since it includes
safety nets aimed at reducing the hardship of layoffs (inclucding limited medical coverage and a
small social fund) and should therefore maintain family cohesiveness.

All goods and services under the IDA Credit would be procured in accordance with IDA guidelines for
goods, works, and services (Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA Credits, January 1995
and revised in January and August 1996 (Procurement Guidelines) and Guidelines: Use of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing Agency, January 1997 (Consultant Guidelines).
Contracts to supply goods and equipment, and civil works will be the responsibility of each coordination
unit within MMETPT, MEF, and MSE, respectively.
Procurement capacity of the three coordination units
The three coordinators are already familiar with the World Bank's procedures that they applied to
implement preparatory work under a Japanese Grant and a PPF advance. However, given the volume of
consultants contracts and the civil works anticipated under the project, each unit has designated a staff
member to monitor procurement activities and ensure timely project execution. A procurement seminar
will be organized for both procurement and disbursement employees before Credit effectiveness.
Procurement Schedule
A procurement schedule has been prepared by the Borrower and will be available for review at
negotiations. It will include relevant information concerning procurement of goods, works, and timing for
the use of consultants.
Contracts for consultants and training
Most of the procurement for the project will be in the form of technical assistance, and will be carried out
in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the selection of consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January
1997. A list of expected consulting assignments has been published on a General Procurement Notice in
Development Business and will be updated annually. The method of selection will be based mostly on
quality and cost of the offer (including success-fees and similar variations related to privatization
assignments).  Small technical assignments of a value up to $100,000 such as monitoring the
retrenchment program and support to the unit assisting micro-entrepreneurs, for which the need for
preparing and evaluating competitive offers is neither justified nor available, may be awarded on
Consultants Qualification method of selection.
Review by the Bank of the selection of consultants
(a) Procurement Plan for consultancies: The plan for the selection of consultants under the Project
shall be furnished to the Bank for its review and approval, in accordance with the provision of paragraph
I of Appendix I to the Consultant Guidelines. Selections of all consultants' services shall be undertaken in
accordance with such selection plan.
(b) Prior Review: With respect to each contract for the employment of consulting firms estimated to cost
the equivalent of US$50,000 or more, but less than the equivalent of US$100,000, the procedures set
forth in paragraphs 1, 2 (other than the second subparagraph of paragraph 2(a)) and 5 of Appendix I to
the Consultant Guidelines shall apply. With respect to each contract for the employement of the
consulting firms estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more and each contract for the
employment of individual consultants estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more, the
procedures set forth in paragraphs 1, 2 (other than the third subparagraph of paragraph 2(a)) and 5 of
Appendix I to the Consultant Guidelines shall apply.



Page 3 of 5
(c) Post review: With respect to each contract not governed by paragraph 2 of paragraph 4.4(b), the
procedures set forth in paragraph 4 of Appendix I to the Guidelines shall apply.
Procurement of goods
ICB using the World Bank Standard Bidding documents would be used for procurement of the equipment
for spectrum management and for the pilot telecommunications system in rural areas. Other goods will be
grouped, whenever possible, in packages of US$200,000 or more and procured through ICB. NCB
acceptable to IDA would be used for contracts of the range of US$50,000 to US$200,000 per contract,
for procurement of vehicles, computers, and office equipment for SPT and the three coordination units,
for an aggregate expected not to exceed the amount of US$0.5 million. Procurement for both readily
available off-the shelf goods that cannot be grouped and standard specifications commodities for
individual contracts less than US50,000 not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$0.8 million for the life
of the project, will be procured on the basis of comparison of at least three eligible local suppliers. IAPSO
procurement may be used for the purchase of a small number of vehicles or equipment, which may be
needed at the start of the project and which cannot be packaged for competitive tenders, for an aggregate
amount of US$0.3 million.
Procurement of civil works
The project will finance the prioritized core investments for the rehabilitation and renewal of the postal
netwvork. These activities will include: (i) rehabilitation of three post-offices, reconfiguration of a sorting
center, and installation of 1,800 post offices boxes in three post offices; (ii) refurbishment of postal
financial services center and 11 post-offices. Contracts in this category will be procured through
competitive bidding, using national procedures acceptable to IDA, since there are a number of qualified
medium construction firms in Togo and the works to be done are fairly simple and scattered through out
the country. Individual contracts are not expected to exceed US$200,000 and aggregate amount is
estimated at US$1.1. International firms would be allowed to participate, if they wish. Procurement will
be carried out by the private operator to be hired under the project and monitored by the MMETPT.

Project Accounts and Auditing
A private accounting firm has been hired to design accounting and administrative procedures and to produce the operation
manual, hire and train the accountants. Project accounts will be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to
IDA, according to international auditing standards; special accounts and all disbursements under SOEs will be audited
semi-annually; and the annual audit report will be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year, and
the semi-annual audit report within three months of each period.
Prior to credit effectiveness, Government will be required to deposit the first tranche of the counterpart funds equivalent
to US$70 000 (US$20,000 for MSE, US$20,000 for MMETPT and US$30,000 for MEF).
