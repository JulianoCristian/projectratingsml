The\n            overall performance of the World Bank is satisfactory, while\n            the performance of the Borrower is unsatisfactory. These are\n            the lessons learned: 1) Privatization technical assistance\n            projects should be accompanied by a structural adjustment\n            credit which would finance the fiscal cost of the reform and\n            thereby help strengthen and sustain the Government's\n            commitment and ownership. 2) A retrenchment program with\n            some innovative aspects drawing on best practice, is a key\n            element in privatization programs and helps strengthen the\n            whole process. As a testimony of its effectiveness, this\n            example has already been replicated in other existing and\n            potential projects. 3) The institutional arrangements for\n            project implementation are important to the success of the\n            project. During implementation, the Directorate of\n            State-owned Enterprise was entrusted with the privatization\n            component; this was not an effective arrangement for two\n            reasons: (a) the staff of that ministry lacked the\n            experience and competence of handling complex privatization\n            transactions, and (b) there was a conflict of interest since\n            the department was charged with overseeing the\n            state-enterprises and it was in its interest that it remain\n            as large as possible. 4) In high risk projects it is useful\n            that the Bank define a clear exit strategy at the outset,\n            and that this strategy be discussed with Government\n            authorities in order to agree on triggers that would lead to\n            suspension and cancellation of a project. This would greatly\n            facilitate supervision."}, "docdt": "2003-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
