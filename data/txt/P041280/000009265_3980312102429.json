of divesting from\n            productive sectors and promote an accelerated private\n            sector-led development of economic activities. There are\n            three main components. The Public Enterprise Restructuring\n            and Privatization component supports the government's\n            policy of divesting from productive sectors by contracting\n            out the preparation and execution of transactions to\n            specialized firms, reducing the number of public\n            enterprises, addressing labor redundancies, and implementing\n            a public information and communication strategy. The second\n            component, Reform of the Post and Telecommunications\n            Sectors, provides technical assistance that implements\n            extensive reform, including privatizing the main operator\n            and liberalizing telecommunications services under a new\n            regulatory framework; and restructures postal activities\n            designed to improve profitability. The Financial Sector\n            component, the third component, supports privatizing,\n            restructuring, or liquidating selected financial\n            institutions; strengthens the legal and judiciary systems;\n            and promotes the microfinance sector."}, "docdt": "1998-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
