The project partially achieved its physical\n            objectives but achieved little of its institutional\n            development and private sector development objectives. The\n            loan was canceled early and there were project\n            implementation delays. Also, insufficient project resources\n            were applied to institutional development. The Bank's\n            performance is rated as deficient on the basis of inadequate\n            ownership, preparation time, project appraisal, and\n            engagement with consultants. The Borrower's performance\n            is rated as satisfactory. In terms of sustainability, those\n            components which were implemented during the project will be\n            sustainably serviced. The key lessons learned are as\n            follows. A lack of ownership of a project by government and\n            beneficiaries can lead to delays and difficulties. The Bank\n            had decided to finance this project as a means of\n            encouraging a quasi-monopoly to invest, but this approach\n            cannot succeed unless that quasi-monopoly is fully committed\n            to the project objectives. Convoluted on-lending\n            arrangements should not be attempted unless: both government\n            and borrower are highly committed; there are no simpler\n            alternatives; and the Bank is prepared to accept the risk of\n            delay or failure. If the borrower is unwilling to implement\n            technical assistance that the Bank deems necessary, this\n            should be deemed a cause to drop the project. Project\n            preparation documentation and reporting systems should\n            contain sufficient material for effective project monitoring\n            and supervision. Finally, Bank lending to private companies\n            should presume: that the company has no other alternative;\n            that the company is fully committed to the project's\n            objectives and investments; and that the project provides\n            very substantial economic and social benefits."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
