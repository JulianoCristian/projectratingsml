               Resettlement Policy Framework (OP4.12)                           RP313

A. Resettlement Policy Framework
Introduction

Since Iran geographically lies in a semi-dry region, water shortage always has been a major problem.
Rapid population growth at least until 1996 coupled with massive urban population growth and expansion
have exaggerated the problem. An irrational pattern of water consumption complicates the situation.
Thus projects to promote water conservation and reuse are important. Most Iranian cities lack a sewerage
system. Untreated waste water usually ends up in agricultural land outside cities, causing health risks and
environmental hazard to natural habitats, such as Anzali lagoons. The Water and Wastewater program,
which has covered Tehran, Ahwaz and Shiraz is now extended to cover four major cities of the southern
Caspian provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran: Anzali, Rasht, Babol and Sari.

Project Description

The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) prepared for Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation
Project explicitly took into account the “repeater project” that would include the four northern cities. The
proposed WW project intends to enhance environmental and health conditions in the above mentioned
cities. Moreover the project development objectives also include: 1) To improve the quality of life and
alleviate poverty in the proposed four cities in Iran, 2) Increasing coverage of sanitation services, 3)
Implementing a pilot program of hygiene and sanitation practices to improve health conditions of targeted
population.

The RPF already presented to the Board for the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project,
therefore, explicitly applied to the four cities of this project, and is reproduced here with minor edits to
ensure consistency with this second project. However individual city land acquisition plans are prepared
1
  The Iran Northern Cities Water Supply and Sanitation project is the second in a program of
repeater Water and Sanitation projects that will involve land expropriation for works (treatment
plants, pumping stations and sewerage lines). This Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was
presented to the Board as an annex to the first project, for Ahwaz and Shiraz, on August 15,
2004. The RPF is the instrument used because the exact expropriation requirements for future
sites are not known. This annex is identical to that for the first project mutatis mutandis for the
four northern cities, because the pattern of project design and land requirements are very similar
to that of Ahwaz and Shiraz. Pre-feasibility studies indicate that land acquisition generally
entails no physical resettlement or impact on residences or economic activities and that only the
asset value of undeveloped land is concerned. Therefore, for ease of communication with the
client and the public, the resettlement instruments have been entitled respectively Land
Acquisition and Compensation Policy Framework and Land Acquisition and Compensation
Plan for each city concerned. This makes the purpose of the instruments clear to the client. The
only exception is the city of Rasht, where the necessary expropriation of one house occupied by
a family of four requires a Resettlement Action Plan. Irrespective of the title The instruments
respond fully to the Bank’s OP 4.12 policy requirements in the context of this project
and presented to the Bank as individual “Land acquisition Plans”, or “Resettlement Action Plans” under
the present policy framework.

PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES GOVERNING RESETTLEMENT

Rationale for expropriation of land. Land acquisition is necessary in this project in order to provide for
1) water treatment plants 2) pumping stations and 3) channels and pipes to carry the outfall to its
destination. These requirements are determined by the engineering designs in each particular case, and
result from a) the size of the population to be served and the volume of water to be treated; and b) the
topography of the land, which normally requires wastewater treatment plants to be situated in the lowest-
lying convenient area in order for maximum use of gravity. None of the public Water and Wastewater
Companies (WWCs) owns sufficient land appropriately located that would allow the project to be
undertaken without some additional expropriation.

Minimization of expropriation of land. The expropriation of private land is minimized in accordance
with Iranian law2, which requires public utility projects of any nature to make maximum use of public
land, and only to resort to expropriation when there is no alternative. Minimal expropriation of private
land also serves the interest of the public water and waste water companies which are obliged to pay
compensation awarded by independent assessment as explained below. Preference is always given to
transfer of government or public land from other agencies where this is available, but even in this case
compensation is payable.

Legal process is obligatory. All expropriations must be carried out according to the provisions of
Iranian law3. The law of expropriation defines the procedures to be followed and protects the rights of all
parties involved. Wrongs committed during expropriation may be redressed by the courts with provision
for payment of damages and punishment of offenders. The law under which WWCs are established gives
the WWC the power to expropriate land (Article 14) The company must also obtain from the Article 5
Commission4 agreement to any necessary changes in land use in accordance with the city master plan.

Compensation and eligibility principles. Whenever expropriation of private land is unavoidable,
Iranian law clearly indicates that land should be expropriated through full compensation at market value,
independently determined, with advance public notice, negotiation and right of appeal. Rights to
compensation extend to owners, tenants, workers, or any person who can demonstrate any interest lost as
a result of expropriation.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE FOR PREPARING                  AND APPROVING       LAND   ACQUISITION PLANS
(RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLANS PER OP 4.12)

The expropriating authority is the relevant WWC serving the city concerned. The following
steps apply in this project whereby a WWC prepares a Land Acquisition Plan.

      1. The Third Development Plan established the principle that cities of a certain size should
         have WWW treatment facilities in the public interest. The WWC is responsible for



2
  The law is entitled The Law Governing the Expropriation of Land for Public Projects, Military Usage &
Infrastructure Improvements, dated Feb. 6 1980.
3
  An English translation of this law has been transmitted to the Bank.
4
    . See Appendix 1 for membership of the Article 5 Commission, which regulates urban land use.
          establishing the public necessity of constructing the facilities, and drawing up terms of
          reference for the consultant engineers.
      2. Consulting engineers prepare a number of design scenarios for decision by the WWW
         companies. One of the criteria for the best scenario is least expropriation impact on
         private land and least disturbance of any nature. At this stage land expropriation
         requirements are known in broad outline.
      3. Under Article 14 of the expropriation law, the WWC applies to Minister of Energy for
         permission to expropriate. The company justifies the specific need for land acquisition
         and its urgency. They annex to the letter the full rationale together with sketch maps. No
         further actions may be taken without the express consent of the Minister.
      4. On review of the evidence, and on finding the application justified, the Minister gives
         permission to the company to expropriate with the consent of the owner and to pay
         agreed compensation.
      5. The details of planned expropriation, together with details of any expropriations for the
         project that have already been undertaken, are consolidated in a Land Acquisition Plan.
         The WWWC ensures that the LAP conforms to the requirements of Bank policy. The
         document is transmitted to the Bank which determines whether the plan conforms to
         Bank requirements for financing.

ESTIMATED POPULATION DISPLACEMENT

The present project necessitates the physical displacement of one family in Rasht and is the subject of a
separate, individual Resettlement Action Plan. Some displacement of agricultural activities occurred in
Sari between 1996 and 2000 in the course of the company’s expropriation for future treatment plant and
network expansion. These cases were investigated in the field with due diligence, were found to conform
fully to Bank social safeguard standards of resettlement, no residual grievances were found and are
documented in the respective Land Acquisition Plans. Besides these exceptions, all expropriation
concerns the asset value of property only, and no other physical displacement of persons, residences, or
economic enterprises has been found. There are no informal settlements of any kind nor illegal
occupants. Typically only a few persons are affected by the acquisition of land.5

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR DEFINING CATEGORIES OF DISPLACED PERSONS.

1. Private land in Iran is classified as

              a. Barren land
              b. Land with defined specific land use as defined by Ministry of Housing and Urban
                 Development for urban land; and by the Ministry of Jihad of Agriculture for
                 agricultural land including pasture, forest, farmland etc.

2. Entitlements to compensation vary according to the type of land classification.



5
    . All such cases are explained in cities LAP/RAP which follows this framework.
3. In barren land only the owner is compensated.


4. In land with defined use, the law explicitly recognizes for the purposes of entitlement to

compensation all holders of any rights. The following main categories of rights are entitled for

to compensation where loss established.


   i.   Owners
  ii.   Tenants with and without occupancy rights
 iii.   Usufructiers
 iv.    Owners of trees or other permanent improvements
  v.    People who use the land for commercial purposes
 vi.    People who have made or maintained improvements of any nature, including caretakers,
        guardians, etc.

Iranian law conforms in all major respects to bank guidelines, and provides for minimization of
disturbance, advance notification to owners, compensation of all right holders at full value
independently assessed, and right of negotiation and appeal.

METHODS OF EVALUATING ASSETS

Notification of intent to expropriate and identification of owners. The WWC identifies the
owners of the parcels affected from the Land Registry. If the registry has no information on the
owner, the company conducts a field survey to identify the owner from local knowledge.
Notification is made through the local or national press. Thus anyone other than the owner/s can
present their claims.

                                                   Through repeated visits to the plots, the WWC
identifies the owners and all right holders. They obtain an expert evaluation of the plot and all the
rights, including the price of the land, and they make an offer to every person concerned. If the
offer is accepted they sign a preliminary agreement contract and fix a date to go to the land
registry for legal transfer of title. Some WWCs have decided to create an expropriation
committee. The main reason is to avoid individual decision making. The committee is not a
judicial body and its creation is not mandatory.
Independent assessment. If the offer is not accepted, an independent evaluation is made by three
assessors. Assessors are trained, certified and registered with the Ministry of Justice. But they do not
have any judicial status and their assessments may be rejected by the owners. One is appointed by WWC,
one by the owner, and the third by consensus between both parties. Each assessor independently visits
the plot concerned and makes a professional evaluation based on local market price at that time. Each
assessor prepares a written evaluation. These evaluations are opened in the presence of the owner. These
three assessments form the basis of negotiation for a final price agreed by the owner.
If the independent evaluations are widely different, or if the owner is not willing to accept the offer, the
WWWC legal office or land expropriations committee prepares a report to the managing director
explaining the situation and reporting the owner’s demand. The company may settle with the owner for
the owner’s proposed price or may confirm the original offer in which case the owner has right of appeal
(see below).
If the owner cannot be found, or if the owner fails to appear, all other parties sign an affidavit which states
that the owner was duly notified and invited to appear and failed to do so. This document is filed as
evidence of due process. The local Prosecutor (district attorney) is informed and obtains from the local
court an order for the owner to appear, which is served by the police. The police report the outcome and if
the owner still fails to appear the court acts on the owner’s behalf.

ORGANIZATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR DELIVERY OF ENTITLEMENTS
When agreement is reached between WWWC and the owner, a letter of agreement is signed. This letter
sets a date to appear in the Land Registry for transfer of title. The Company writes to the Land Registry
authorizing its official to sign on the company’s behalf. The Land Registry transfers the title on
certification by the owner that he has received full compensation.
Compensation of other right holders. Other affected persons may be compensated directly by the
WWWC. In this case they sign a letter to the WWC stating that they have been paid full compensation
for their rights, which the WWWC provides to the Land Registry prior to transfer of title.
Alternatively, the owner may agree during negotiations to compensate all right holders, in which case the
owner provides the same evidence to the WWWC as a condition of payment of compensation which
includes reimbursement of the owner’s payments to right-holders.
Procedure when owner cannot be traced. If the owner has not appeared, the court opens and
administers an account in the owner’s name and administers the transfer of title.

IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

As above, section I.
GRIEVANCE REDRESS

Agreement is reached in the great majority of cases without recourse to appeals for redress of grievance.
Grievances and appeals may arise in the following cases:

Owner not willing to part with land. Since the public interest has been determined, the court acts in
place of the owner.

All other cases. Any affected person may appeal to the court for redress. The court has the power to
hear submissions, review the process, and make such provisions as it deems fit. These include ordering
compensation to be paid, halting works, fining the owners.

In most cases, the owner benefits from such appeals. However, in the case of any delay, owners
lose since no provision is made for inflation.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR FUNDING COMPENSATION

Compensation is always paid by the WWC. Transfer of land may not take place prior to
payment. There are two ways that this is funded.

    a) Through budgetary provision in the recurrent budget, where the WWC earns revenue.
       This is not normally the case in this project.

    b) Where the need for expropriation has been foreseen in the five-year development plan.
        This is the case with most expropriations in this project. Expropriation takes place under
        Article IX of the law of expropriation of Land in the public interest. A translation of this
        article already has been submitted to the WB.

MECHANISMS FOR CONSULTATIONS WITH AND PARTICIPATION OF AFFECTED PERSONS IN
PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING

As explained above, (sections H and K), owners and right holders are actively involved in the negotiation
process.
MONITORING OF IMPLEMENTATION

In each case, when any type of land acquisition and compensation is involved, the WWWC reports on the
following timetable. This timetable serves as a monitoring device showing all actions involved, the
responsible agency, expected completion date, the reason(s) for any delay and new expected completion
date:

                                             Timetable

                                                             date         completion date
B. Land Acquisition Plan for Anzali, Rasht, Babol and Sari
(In conformity with World Bank Safeguard Policy OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement)

Background.        This Land Acquisition Plan has been prepared by the Northern Cities Water and
Wastewater Project (NCWWP) in conformity with the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). In May
2004 the RPF was prepared and publicly disclosed in Washington and Iran 2004 under the Ahwaz and
Shiraz Water and Wastewater project. The legislation, procedures and instruments of land expropriation
in Iran not having changed since that time, and the overall project design being identical, the RPF has
been applied unchanged to this NCWWP. The RPF in English and Farsi will be publicly disclosed in the
four northern cities of Anzali and Rasht (Gilan Province) and Babol and Sari (Mazandaran Province) at
the offices of the respective WWW companies and the four city public libraries, together with this LAP
on March 20, 2005. Appropriate notice being placed in the main daily newspapers of each city.

Applicability and terminology. The Bank’s Operational Policy OP 4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement is triggered by this project: expropriation of privately owned land or fixed assets in
the public interest is de facto involuntary by Bank definition, since the property owners have no
choice whether or not to part with their property. Locally, however, this expropriation process is
generally referred to as “voluntary”, both by the Iranian administration and the property owners.
This is because the transfer is referred to as “purchase” and the owners willingly accept, out of
court, the “purchase price” (compensation) awarded by independent assessment, and sign over
title to the property thus acquired. If the owner contests the award, then a judicial process of
“involuntary” expropriation is triggered, whereby the court hears the case and awards judgment,
compelling the owner to surrender title. Since assessment awards are usually generous and may
be negotiated, such contestation and compulsion is a very rare event, and has not occurred in this
project. Nor has there been any physical resettlement of persons or economic activities.
Therefore, to avoid the possibility of misunderstandings arising between Bank and Client, the
present instruments are each referred to as a “Land Acquisition Plan”. The Bank understands
that the LAP is the full functional equivalent of the restricted Resettlement Action Plan that the
policy framework requires.

Expropriation requirements and Bank due diligence. The expropriation requirements are
modest, being a few hectares in all, mostly for pump stations and lift stations. The full table of
expropriations is provided below. In most cases this expropriation has already taken place, and
compensation has been awarded. The lines to be laid are almost entirely in public rights of way
already belonging to the municipality. A Bank mission in July 2004 was provided with detailed
maps for each city, visited all the expropriation sites and the main network routes, and verified in
general that the information provided is accurate; that expropriation requirements have been
appropriately minimized; and that there is no adverse impact on livelihoods and economic
activities. It was also verified that there were no cultural sites, public amenities such as parks or
recreation areas, or community rights in land affected. A subsequent pre-appraisal mission
obtained full information on the expropriation status on three sites (Anzali, Babol and Sari) and
was fully satisfied that in these three sites, expropriation had been duly conducted and
documented according to Bank standards. However, for Rasht the information provided for
phase 2 of the treatment plant and the pumping stations was insufficiently clear and detailed. In
particular, the technical necessity for expropriation of a residential house, which earlier been
questioned, had still not been justified. The Bank investigated this expropriation issue,
interviewed the owner of the house, and is satisfied with the process so far and with the expected
outcome, that full compensation according to Bank standards is expected that will enable the
owner and his family willingly to agree to relocate to a better property of their choice. (An
abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared for this single case and the outcome will
be monitored as conforming with Bank requirements). With this provision, the Mission
considers that the social safeguard policies are adequately complied with.

The total expropriations so far are summarized in table 1 below, with compensation converted in
dollars at the approximate rate at time of payment. As indicated in the land expropriation tables
for the four cities this process is already far advanced and is expected to be completed by the end
of 2005.

C. Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan
Description of resettlement. The construction of the water and wastewater network in the city
of Rasht, Guilan province, requires the expropriation of one inhabited residence for the
construction of a pumping station. There is no technically feasible alternative, the available land
being limited on one side by a main road, and on the other by a river. This is the solution that
involves least expropriation, since moving the road would affect a very large number of
structures on the other side.

There are no other displacements of persons or families in this project. All other land acquisition
at prices already negotiated or in negotiation has been reported separately under a Land
Acquisition Plan.

Displaced persons. 4 Persons: the owner-occupier of the lot and house, together with his
family. There are no other-right holders.

Description of compensation and other assistance. The owner has negotiated monetary
compensation which he is confident is sufficient to allow him to purchase and move to a better
house of his choice. He is fully satisfied with the outcome. The amount was privately negotiated
and as is customary, has not been made public.

Consultations. The owner was consulted well in advance and was entirely comfortable with the
arrangements and with the process and outcome of negotiations. This was confirmed
independently on interview with a social scientist.

Institutional responsibility. Guilan Water and Wastewater Company reporting to the Ministry
of Energy. Written permission from the Minister himself is required by law to initiate land
acquisition.

Arrangements for monitoring and implementation, grievance redress. The owner having
accepted the amount, the only possible grievance would be non-payment, which being a legal
obligation enforced by court order, is unheard of. In such a case, title would not be transferred
and the owner would remain in possession.

A report will be made to the next Bank supervision mission on the outcome of the action.

Budget timetable. The Guilan WWWC has adequate funds to pay the compensation awarded,
and compensation is expected to be completed by the end of 2005.
