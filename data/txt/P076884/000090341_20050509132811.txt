Thepotential negative environmentalimpacts o fthe proposed project were definedindetail
through the EA. The findings o fthe EA were the basis for the development o f an Environmental
Management Plan. The EMP defines appropriate prevention and mitigation measures as well as
monitoring activities. Institutional strengtheninghas been also included inthe EMP; inaddition
to the environment and safety officer at the project TSU, the project will provide necessary
laboratory equipmentto conduct requiredanalyses. The implementation o f the EMP will be an
integralpart o f the project supervision process, and a Bank environmental specialist will
participate at the supervisionmissions to monitor the implementationactivities. The preparation
o f the environmental assessmentincludedpublic consultation and the produced documents have
been disclosed at the InfoShop and inIran (inthe WWCs andthe NWWEC).

Projects on Intemational Waters (OP 7.50): OP 7.50 i s applicable; giventhat the project consists
of wastewater collection and treatment, with effluent discharges inwater bodies reaching the
Caspian Sea, the Intenational Waterways policy has beentriggered. With letters dated March 20,
2005, the Bank, on behalf o fthe Borrower, has notified the riparians o fthe project details.

Cultural Property (OPN 11.03): There are no knownhistorical sites inthe four project cities.
However, the final design o f the project components will be sent to Cultural Heritage
Organization (CHO), which has legal authority to ensure protection o f archeological sites. There
i s always the possibility o f chance-finding o f objects and sites o fhistorical and cultural value
duringthe constructionphase. Duringimplementation, the TSUwill ensure that both contractors
and the supervising engineers are made aware o ftheir responsibilities ofreporting such findings
to the relevant authority.

Involuntary Resettlement OPIBP 4.12: The implementation o fthe project includes the
expropriation o f land for the constructiono f treatment plants, pumping stations and sewerage
lines. Given the common characteristics o fthis project in each city, a Resettlement Policy
Framework has beenprepared together with abbreviated resettlement action plans for the first
two cities. Iranian law conforms inall major respects to Bank guidelines, andprovides for
minimization o f disturbance, advance notification to owners, compensation o f all right holders at
full value independentlyassessed, andright o fnegotiation and appeal. Inno case are residences
or current economic activities or livelihoods affected. Fulldocumentation i s available to support
the plants, and a Bank social development specialist has visitedthe sites and confirmedthe
findings o fthe local social scientist. The project therefore complies with the requirements o f OP
4.12.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsector issues

Country Context

In the last decade, following almost one decade of war, which depreciated the capital stock and disrupted
economic and institutional development, Iran embarked on a far-reaching political, economic andsocial reform
program.

A broad spectrum o f Iran's political actors and society in general has embraced the overall principles and
processes o f the third Five Year Development Plan (FYDP) 1999-2004. Achievements duringthis period have
been overall impressive. Iran has practically no extemal debt, high foreign reserves, no major balance o f
payments pressures and a moderate fiscal deficit, which now reflects increasingly explicit subsidies, including
indirect subsidies (largely in the energy sector). Growth has been robust with real Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) growing on a 6 percent average during 2000/01 - 2002/03, reaching 7.4 percent over the past year.
Continuing in the direction o f the third FYDP, a fourth FYDP was adopted this past year based on four main
objectives:


             0    Achieving fast, sustainable growth, relying on the transition to a market economy.
             0    Sharing the fruits o f growth, addressing the needs o f the poor and disadvantaged.
             0    Enhancing natural resource management and the environment.
             0    Buildingan efficient, accountable andtransparent public sector.

Regarding the water sector, there is broad agreement among different groups in Iran on the direction the
reform agenda should take, but much less consensus on the paths to be taken. Through various consultation
processes, working documents outlining the essence o f the long-term strategies have been drafted (i.e., Long-
Term Water Development policy Guidelines), calling the executive branch to a program for implementation.
As it is the case with other economic sectors, Iran is at an important juncture in which it can accelerate its
reform process inorder to improve the performance o f the water sector, or proceed at a slow pace and continue
to lag interms o f service delivery, particularly inthe area o f sanitation.

The Bank's assistance strategy can play a critical role in helping the Government o f Iran to improve the
efficiency o f the water sector through two types o f complementary actions, the development and financing o f
needed infrastructure, the provision o f technical advice and institutional capacity building.

Sector Issues

About 98 percent o f the urban population in Iran is connected to public water supplies, but n o more than 23
percent have access to public sanitary sewerage, and only a very small share o f collected sewage is treated
before disposal. The bulk o f sewage is discharged untreated and constitutes a major source o f pollution to
groundwater and surface water and a risk to public health. In a number o f cities without sanitary sewerage,
households discharge their sewage to open rainwater drains. Water supply and sewerage services (mainly
distribution o f water and collection o f sewage) are provided by 34 water and wastewater companies across the
country except in Tehran where these services are provided by two independent utilities. These companies -
established in the early 90s  - have a certain degree o f administrative and financial autonomy and, to a large
extent, have been able to cover their operational costs through tariffs. The major water infrastructure works
(reservoirs, major water transmission lines and water treatment plants) are under the purview o f the Regional
Water Boards responsible for water resource aspects.

The main issues affecting the water sector in Iran have been identified through various assessments, and
include:

    Large needs for rehabilitation and development o f hydraulic infrastructure for sustainable service
    provision.
    Problems o f pollution caused by the discharge o f untreated wastewater into public waterways and aquifers.
    Weak institutions involved inthe sector and limited coordination among stakeholders.
    L o w water use efficiency inurban and rural uses.
    Limited participation by water and wastewater companies in development planning and water resources
    management.


2. Rationale for Bank involvement

This project is a follow-up operation o ftwo reviousprojects: the Tehran Sewerage Project andthe Ahwaz and
Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project!          Inparallel, the Bank-financedAlborz Integrated Landand Water
Management (AILWM) Project is also under preparation and aims to demonstrate the benefits o f integrated
water resources management on a basin scale in the Mazandaran Province, and a Country Water Resources
Strategy, prepared jointly by the Government o f Iran and the Bank, aims at improving overall land and water
use efficiency inurban and rural uses.

In addition, the Bank has prepared and disseminated a Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Note in 2002,
which focused on reviewing the sector's structure and providing strategic recommendations o n key
institutional reforms to be undertaken. The Note was endorsed by the Govemment in September 2003, inthe
context o f discussions on water-related issues within the Country Assistance Strategy and o f specific dialogue
on the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector.

In these discussions, it was agreed that the Bank will continue lending in water supply and sanitation to
support the implementation o f an agreed sector strategy with monitorable indicators, and that future investment
projects are expected to be prepared within the context o f further progress on the strategy implementation.
Specifically, the Govemment o f Iran agreed to adopt the main conclusions o f the Water Supply and Sanitation
Note which emphasized institutional reforms, i.e., clarification and demarcation o f responsibilities o f the
institutions involved; streamlining o f financial policies; implementation o f a tariff scheme consistent with cost
recovery objectives; optimization o f investments; selection o f appropriate least-cost technologies; addressing
environmental and health concems; and adopting and implementing integrated water resource management
concepts. This will be largely achieved with the support o f the technical assistance component under the on-
going Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project (IBRD Loan4738 - IRN).

Moreover, the Bank and the Government agreed to work on the agreed-upon strategy in the following three
phases:

Phase I: Implementation o f the water and sanitation investment projects for the two cities o f Ahwaz and
 Shiraz (2004-2009) and preparation and initiation o f sector reforms. This includes the preparation o f studies
 and technical assistance (TA) programs covering the following areas: demand management, customer
 education, institutional reforms, the regulatory framework, tariffs and cost recovery, technology and
 investment priorities, sanitation strategy and integrated water conservation. WBI has assisted the government
 inpreparingworkshops relatedto institutions andsanitation strategy.

 Phase 11: Implementation o f the water and sanitation investment projects for the Northem cities, i.e., Rasht,
 Anzali, Sari and Babol (2005-2010). Phase I1will complete investments identified and agreed upon during

 'The original scope o f the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project was to include the four Northern cities.
 However, due to delays in the finalization o f the feasibility and environmental studies for these four cities, it was decided
that they would be covered under a separate operation.


                                                               10

Phase I.The reform agenda for the sector - already initiated in Phase I- will continue to be implemented
under both phases.
Phase 111: This phase will start only after the implementation o f reforms identified in Phases Iand 11.
Investmentprojects will then be prepared for additional cities under an adaptable program loan (APL), giving
priority to the Water and Wastewater Companies (WWCs) that have adopted the reform programs launched in
the first two phases.


3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

Past involvement o f the World Bank in Iran's water sector was limited and fragmented due to various factors,
and as a result, a significant knowledge gap emerged. Opportunities to reverse this trend have been sought in
the context o f the April 2001 InterimAssistance Strategy (2001-2004) dialogue, leading to the identification o f
promising Bank-financed infrastructure projects inwater supply, sanitation and irrigation. The emphasis inthe
dialogue is changing from a narrowly focused provision o f financing to a potential strategic partnership in
development, as Iran is embarking on a reform agenda aimed at promoting growth in a socially and
environmentally sustainable way and focusing on competitiveness and integration into the global economy.
The objectives o f the fourth FYDP and the needs for implementation o f the reform agenda open new
opportunities for partnership in terms of technical assistance and a lending portfolio aimed at well targeted
interventions focusing on integrating institutions and resources, while combining infrastructure with
knowledge for the water sector. The Bank will use the large infrastructure needs in the sector to promote
capacity buildingand institutional development. The assistance strategy for Iran needs to be centered o n the
following interventions:


     0    Pricing policy reforms aiming at cost recovery in order to improve service delivery on a sustainable
          basis.


     0    Design of subsidy schemes to help poor communities retainlimprove their livelihoods and access to
          basic services in lieu o f the current broad interventions and ill-conceived cross subsidy system (water
          supply and sanitation).

          Capacitybuildingof sector institutions, such as the Regional Water Boards, the Regional Water and
          Wastewater Companies, the National Water and Wastewater Engineering Company, etc. The capacity
          building effort will include technical, operational, financial management, planning, budgeting and
          other activities related to improving the efficiency o f water service delivery.


     0    Management and planningof land and water resources' ina well coordinated and integrated way
          allowing allocation o f resources between sectors and regions in an efficient and socially and
          environmentally sustainable manner.

The Bank's assistance over the next 10 years puts water supply, sanitation and hygiene, irrigation and
drainage, as well as water resource management ina strategic framework guided by the following elements:


     0    Recognizing that investment without reform will be ineffective in reaching the goals o f
          environmentally and socially sustainable development.

     0    People and institutions should be at the center o f sustainable water resource development.

     0    Delivering water and other related services requires substantial expenditures that should be paid for.

     0     Safeguarding water resources is a shared responsibility and involves tradeoffs.


 A parallel (proposed)Bank-financed"Alborz IntegratedWater and LandManagementProject" (AIWLM) will pilot this
approach inthe Mazandaranprovince. Close coordinationwill be soughtbetweenthis project and the AIWLMproject.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The project will use a Specific Investment Loan instrument, and its performance indicators will be used as
means to develop and scale-up the proposed reforms. I t is essentially a follow-up operation to the previously
approved Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation and Tehran Sewerage Projects. The lessons learned
from these two operations and the implementation o f reform measures are expected to pave the way for a
sustained partnership with the Bank through future programmatic lending (Phase I11mentioned above).

2. Project development objective and key indicators

The mainproject development objectives are to:
a) Enhance the quality o f life inthe four northern cities o f Rasht, Anzali, Sari and Babol by:

4. Lessons learned and reflectedin the project design

The lessons leamed from the Tehran Sewerage Project have been incorporated in the design o f this project.
The experience to date highlights the need to: (i)      establish strong project management capacity through the
Technical Support Unit (TSU within the WWCs rather than outside); (ii)        familiarize the Borrower's staff with
Bank requirements, including those relatedto procurement, financial management and safeguards; (iii) an   have
appropriate tariff scheme to ensure the financial viability o f the WWCs.
Most water and sewerage projects in the Bank portfolio fulfill their physical objectives but fail in many
instances with the institutional ones. Regional experience indicates that water supply and sanitation projects
are subject to longer than anticipated implementation periods and suffer from frequent changes in
management. Moreover, lessons leamed indicate that the physical and institutional objectives should be
linked, and the project scope and design should remain clear and as simple possible.



5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Along with Ahwaz and Shiraz, the four cities in this project had been selected from a list o f prioritized urban
areas included in the Government's five-year development plan. This selection is based o n the criteria o f



                                                          14

existing environmental conditions, including important externalities reaching beyond the city's geographical
boundaries, poor sanitary conditions and threats to health, existing social conditions, and progress in project
preparation. The degree o f pollution or pollution threat was one o f the main selection criteria. Inthe Guilan
province, the Anzali Lagoon i s an internationally recognized wetland which is being polluted, among other
sources, by domestic waste from the two major cities (Anzali and Rasht). The cities o f Babol and Sari are in
an area that attracts highnumbers o f tourists and are subject to poor drainage and groundwater pollution from
the manypoorly operating cesspits.

Besides the selection of the cities, a number o f altematives (of strategic and technical nature) were discussed
and analyzed:

(i)      Strategic: Public utilities versus private sector approach: Currently, neither the local legal and
         institutional environment nor the international conditions are favorable for a jump-start into advanced
         forms o f private sector involvement, such as build-operate-transfer (BOTS) or concessions. Deep
         reforms have yet to be implemented in many areas: procurement procedures, foreign exchange
         regulations, banking reform (there are currently only public banks), foreign participation, labor
         regulations, etc.   Lifting the existing constraints and creating an enabling environment for the
         development of the private sector i s an important objective for Iran in general, regardless o f what
         takes place in the water sector.     The fulfillment o f this objective takes a macroeconomic and
         institutional dimension that goes beyond the water sector. Some o f these reforms may be fostered
         through this project, but most of them require important structural horizontal actions rather than
         sector-specific actions.    Discussions about other arrangements, such as service or management
         contracts are also premature before a proper enabling environment i s put inplace.

(ii)     Technical: Inthe course o f the preparation o f the development program, different alternatives were
         evaluated with respect to the number and location of treatment works, on-site sanitation, and
         alignments for the trunk main systems, method o f pipe-laying, pipe materials, and phasing for
         program implementation.

         (a)      The option o f on-site sanitation was considered and found not feasible in Guilan and
                  Mazandaran due to high water tables. The Borrower expressed the concern o f polluting the
                  water tables incase o f improper construction o f on-site sanitation.

         (b)      For the wastewater treatment works alternative treatment processes such as activated sludge,
                  oxidation ditches, oxidation ponds and aerated lagoons, and site locations were evaluated with
                  the activated sludge method proving to be the least-cost solution. The comparison between
                  the different   alternatives took into account investment and long-term operation and
                  maintenance costs.

         (c)      Various options have also been analyzed on the handling o f sludge, which will be treated to
                  the level o f ensuringproper disposal.

2. Institutionalandimplementation arrangements

ProjectManagement
Each W W C will be responsible for the management and implementation o f its project and for the subsequent
operation and maintenance o f the facilities that will be built. A Technical Support Unit (TSU) will be
established within each WWC. Responsibilities o f the TSUs in WWCs will include planning, coordination,
monitoring and reporting. The TSU will be composed o f a technical core team (Engineer, Financial
Management Specialist, Procurement and Environmental Specialist) led by a Manager. All technical experts
can be outsourced except the Manager o f TSU who should be from within the WWC. The Manager role is
critical; he/she leads the TSU team and establishes the link with the W W C staff and Management. TSU will
have to draw from the W W C resources to be able to adequately assist in the implementation o f the project.
Selection o f the T S U team is being carried out on a competitive basis and according to Bank procedures. The
existing TSU inN W W E C will provide technical support and oversight and will be in charge o f consolidating
periodic reports for all implementing agencies (as it is done for the reports from the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water
Supply and Sanitation Project). The N W W E C will also assist the WWCs in preparing International
Competitive Bidding (ICBs) and large value consultancies. The TSUs will report directly to the management
o f their respective WWCs.

ProjectImplementationand Schedule
The WWCs/TSUs will use local consultants for engineering design and construction supervision for routine
works, but would need foreign expertise for complex works, such as wastewater treatment works. First year
procurement packages o f the project are at a final design stage and are expected to be completed by the third
quarter o f 2005. The Ministryo f Energy (MOE) and WWCs have agreed to hire consultants to prepare tender
documents to be ready for execution by loan effectiveness. A satisfactory implementation o f the Project
requires that: (i)WWCs be supported by competent TSUs; and (ii)the Management and Planning
Organization (MPO) and WWCs provide counterpart finds on a timely basis.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomedresults

The fulfillment o f the key performance indicators will be monitored along with the execution o f the project,
and the TSUs are expected to play a major role in both monitoring and supervising the project. Close Bank
supervision will be needed, and will require significant resources, particularly in the first two years o f
implementation. On average, two supervision missions per year (with three for the first year) will be needed
with approximately 25 staff weeks for each year, ie., 130 staff weeks for the whole project implementation
period.

4. Sustainability

As inthe Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project - through which a number o f sector reforms
are being initiated that would ultimately apply to all WWCs in Iran- the sustainability o f the proposed project
would be ensured through: (i)    implementation o f agreed upon reforms that cover areas such tariff setting that
takes into account cost recovery o f services delivered, institutional and regulatory framework, demand
management and (ii)    strengthening the capacity o f the WWCs, to operate on a commercial basis etc. Both the
Guilan and Mazandaran WWCs have demonstrated inthe past better than average performance and have good
technical and managerial capacity. The operation o f the wastewater treatment plants may present difficulties,
as there is no prior experience in the WWCs.          This shortcoming will be addressed by including in the
construction contract (of the new treatment plants) a one or two-year operation contract so that adequate o n the
job training is provided to the staff inthe WWCs.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economic and financial analyses

Economic Analvsis

The population concerned by the Project exceeds 1.1million inhabitants with Rasht accounting for about half
o f the total population of the four cities. Water coverage is relatively high inall four cities while, incontrast,
the sewerage system is still very underdeveloped, with wastewater currently discharged to ditches andrivers,
resulting inhighwater pollution and unhealthy environment. The Project is expected to remedy this situation
through the progressive expansion o f modem sewerage networks and the treatment o f wastewater. Under the
Project, the rate o f connection will reach about a third o f the population inBabol and Sari, over 40% inRasht
and more than two thirds o f the population inAnzali.

The water sub-projects will provide safe and affordable drinkable water to the expanding population in the
four cities. The resulting benefits would be equal, at least, to the cost o f the alternative means that would be
used to meet water needs without the Project. In this hypothetical situation, households and other users
would rely essentially on the purchase o f water from water vendors at high prices and on investment in
storage capacity. The avoidance o f such cost is the main benefit o f the Project. In addition, given the
superior convenience o f house connections over buyingand storing water and the huge difference incost, the
Project will allow households to consume a larger volume o f water than under the alternative, which will
increase their welfare (their consumer surplus). Finally, WWCs provide water in much better hygienic
conditions than water vendors, which reduces health hazards. All these benefits will rise in the future as
population increases.

The benefits expected under the project from the provision o f modem sewerage systems are not only the
avoidance o f altemative means of discharge o f wastewater, but also better health for the targeted population,
protection o f the water resources, provision o f an alternative source o f water for irrigation and reduction in
the cost o f environmental degradation. The niain health effect would be a significant reduction in water-
borne diseases, mainly indiarrhea and dysentery. These diseases result invarious economic costs - workdays
missed for adults and schooldays missed for youngsters during the sickness period, the cost o f medication
and eventually o f hospitalization. Inaddition, there will be a significant improvement inthe living conditions
o f the targeted population.

Following the cost-benefit approach, all financial cost components are broken down directly or indirectly in
the following factors: skilled labor, unskilled labor, capital and foreign exchange if they involve the use o f
tradable inputs. This decomposition i s then used to re-estimate cost at economic prices. Tables (1) to (8) in
Annex 9 show the details o f the projections o f the benefits and costs for each city for both the water and
wastewater components, covering the Project's period, 2005-2009, as well as later planningperiods up to the
year 2029.

Estimates o f NPV and IRRare summarized inthe table below (Table-I). Since water coverage is almost total
inthe four cities, planned investment is requiredto meet the needs o f future additional population, as well as
to rehabilitate parts o f existing networks. Even if benefits are limited to the first component only, Le., to the
cost o f water in the absence o f the project, the water sub-projects are largelyjustified, yielding IRRs varying
between 15% for Babol and 46% for Anzali (Table-1, Base scenario). Sensitivity analysis shows that IRRs
remain high, varying between 11% and 32%, even if benefits are reduced by as much as 10% and cost rose
simultaneously in the same proportion as compared to the base scenario. Taking into account other types o f
benefits, such as larger volumes o f water and safer and more hygienic supply, the project would yield even
higher returns.

For the wastewater components o f the Project the economic appraisal is based on the following benefits: (i)
avoidance o f the cost o f alternative methods o f sewage discharge if the project is not undertaken; (ii) health
                                                                                                          the
benefits previously described; and (iii)   the increase in agncultural value-added that would result from the use



                                                         18

of treated wastewater in irrigation. An additional benefit for Anzali i s the increase in the value-added o f
tourism for this summer resort area. I t tums out that the avoidance o f the cost o f absorption wells as an
altemative to discharge wastewater accounts for the largest share o f these benefits, exceeding 80% on the
average (Tables 5 to 8 inAnnex 9). Estimates for IRRtum out to be low, varying inthe base scenario between
2% for Sari and 11%for Anzali with a retum o f 6-7% for Babol and Rasht. Health benefits are underestimated
inthe base scenario, since they are basedonly on the illness casesreportedto public health services. There are
many other cases that are not reported to these services, those that are handledby private hospitals or clinics or
by refemng to pharmacies. Adjusting for this underreporting by doubling the number o f cases -which is a
reasonable assumption- raises the IRR for Sari to 5%, for Babol to 7%, for Rasht to 8% and for Anzali to 13%
(Table 1). In contrast, ifthe cost o f these sub-projects increases by      lo%,   which corresponds roughly to the
physical contingencies, assumed in the feasibility studies, the IRR drops to 0% for Sari and to 8% for Anzali.
These retums are low, which is expected given that the four cities start almost from scratch in wastewater
services, that initial investments are large and that the coverage o f the population will be only gradual because
o f technical and managerial constraints. Still, apart from Sari, the retums are acceptable for the other cities,
especially if it i s recalled that that the Project will generate other benefits that are difficult to measure and not
taken into account, the main one being the significant improvement in the environment and in the quality o f
life, starting with immediate surroundings.

Tariff Policy:

The Government is clearly aware that current tariffs are inadequate to provide quality water and wastewater
services. The Fourth FYDP (2006-2010) sets ambitious objectives for this sector while stressing the need for
full cost recovery. Tariff adjustment has been put on hold temporarily for extra-economic reasons, but the
resumption o f this adjustment is necessary for the financial viability o f WWCs and for service sustainability.

Like in other provinces, the WWCs o f Mazandaran and Guilan do not have any independent power to set fees
or tariffs for connection to the water or wastewater networks or for water consumption. This power lies with
the National Economic Council which sets pricing policy and the price adjustment scheme for the whole
country. Under the current system WWCs collect connection rights,monthly subscription fees and volumetric
charges inaddition to the house connection fees that have to be paidby customers upfront.

Connection rights are supposed to cover the cost o f the distribution network, including reservoirs. They are
based on the size o f the dwelling and a city adjustment coefficient that depends on several factors, the two
main factors being the cost o f water supply and population density. The formulas for calculating connection
fees are very similar across the WWCs. The average connection fees for water are about US$300 for the
whole country. For Mazandaran and Guilan the average fees are lower than for the whole country while the
minimumfee is estimated at US$150. For wastewater, the connection fee is the same as that for water with a
few exceptions, among them the four cities concemed by the Project. In Mazandaran and Guilan connection
rights are equal respectively to 70% and 90% o f the fees for water connections. These fees were regularly
raised between 1999 and 2004, at a rate equal to at least 10%. In addition to connection fees, the WWCs
charge the customer the full cost for house connection, which averages about US$80 inthe two provinces.

Regarding water consumption, the current system is based on a fixed fee, which depends only on the size o f
the connection pipe andthe type o f customer (household or other types), and on a volumetric charge based on
increasing block-tariffs.   The fixed fee, or the subscription fee, i s about 2000 h a l s (25 US$) for most
domestic customers.     It amounts to about 2.0 US#/m3 in Guilan, 2.6 US$/m3 in Mazandaran against an
average for all o f Iran equal to 1.8 US#/m3(Annex 9). For volumetric charges the current tariff structure is
based on complex formulas, which are very similar for all WWCs, and there is n o volumetric charge if
consumption falls below 5 m3per month. Above this minimum, prices increase with the level o f consumption
and generally vary across companies. The average volumetric tariff for the country is estimated at about 7.3
US$in2004. Itvanes from 2.4 US$ for monthly consumptionbelow 20 m3,to about 5.5 US$ and 14.2 US$
respectively for 20-40 and for more than 40 m3o f monthly consumption. Average prices are lower in Guilan
and Mazandaran, reaching 6.0 and 5.8 US$ respectively in 2004. According to estimates o f cost provided by
NEWWC, the volumetric charges covered in2004 less than half o f total cost o f water supply inGuilan, 60%
inMazandaran and 67% inthe whole country.

N e w tariff measures were enacted 2001, which aimed at two objectives: raising the revenues o f the companies
and reducing excessive water consumption. They have given rise, however, to conflicting signals as to the
direction the tariff structure is taking. On the one hand tariffs have been raised in greater proportions for
higher than for lower consumptionbrackets. Inaddition to the regular increases, the Council introduced since
2001 a penalty or surcharge for consumption exceeding a certain volume varying across cities inthe range of
18 to 25 m3per month. This penalty was set for the year 2002 at 100% o f the tariff given by the formula for
consumption above the cut-off volume. It was raised to 150% in 2003 and again to 200% in 2004. These
changes widen the tariff gap between low and high consumption brackets. On the other hand the Council
decided in2002 to set lower and upper bounds for tariffs, defined with reference to average cost. In2003 the
lower bound was set at one third and the upper bound at three times the average cost. This adjustment
explains the significant increase in the average tariff for the l o w consumption category o f 0 to 20 m' per
month between the years 2001 and 2003.         These changes reduce tariff differences across consumption
brackets and therefore work inthe opposite direction than the first measures o f tariff increases. Moreover, and
inspite ofthese increases, revenues from water sales, and from wastewater when applicable, still do not cover
operation and maintenance cost inmost cases.

 The rate structure is needlessly complex for both volumetric rates and connection fees. Volumetric tariffs are
 based on complex formulas that differ across consumption brackets and WWCs. Because o f this complexity
 the tariff structure lacks transparency, which reduces the incentive information content in the eyes o f
 consumers. Moreover, the structure is such that rates increase by more than threefold when consumption
 rises from 20 m3or less to slightly higher volumes. This abrupt change may not be an issue under the




                                                      20

 existing system in which tariffs are generally low, but deserves to be reviewed under a new framework in
which tariffs would be based on costs and rebalanced between consumption brackets.

 Regarding sewage bills, they are currently levied and collected only in city neighborhoods where a network
 exists and are based on water bills, being set equal to (70%) o f the latter. Since these services have beenvery
 limited so far, or practically non-existent, the need has not yet been felt by the WWCs to properly assess the
 costs involved. As these services develop costs should be assessed separately from water so as to evaluate
 the appropriateness o f the existing tariff structure. Charging for wastewater services with a view to recover
part o f capital cost and all o f the operating and maintenance cost is a significant and commendable step inthe
 rightdirection, but WWCs are still away from this objective, even for water.

 All these shortcomings point to the need for a consistent and comprehensive tariff reform. Aware o f this
 need, the Government appointed in 2004 a working group to that effect. However, any reform seems to be
 put on hold since the Economic Council decided to freeze all tariffs and other fees for the year 2005 (1384).
 The Council also decided to cancel the lower and upper tariff regulation (1/3 and three times o f average cost)
 late in 2004. Although the Government is offering subsidies to WWCs in compensation for the foregone
 income resulting from these two decisions, this policy is not sustainable inthe long-run.

Since most urban households are already connected to the water network and only a few are connected to a
sewerage network that is yet to be constructed inmost cases, the issues o f willingness to pay and affordability
o f connection rights may arise. Inorder to ease the burden the government has facilitated household access to
bank credit for this purpose, including for required works inside homes. For water consumption, a guiding
objective i s to gradually narrow the block rate spread, which is too wide under the existing system, to move
ultimately to a unique cost-based tariff system and to provide income subsidies to the poor. Inthe meantime, it
is important to increase tariffs and other water and wastewater charges at least at the same rate as inflation so
as to enable WWCs to cover their operating costs and to secure appropriate maintenance. The principles stated
inthe Fourth FYDP are sound and point inthe right direction of an efficiency-based tariff policy. Guidedby
these principles, a comprehensive and consistent reform should replace the inconsistent piecemeal approach of
recent years.

Financia1Analvsis

The project will generate financial benefits to the Guilan and Mazandaran WWCs from several sources,
including: increasedwater sales and disposal o f wastewater made possible through the investments undertaken
under the project; income from connection fees made possible from the new water and wastewater connections
due to the project and the increased tariff that will be implemented in order to meet financial performance
targets agreed to between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank. The analysis has been conducted in
current terms based on net cash flows generated by the project over a 25-year period, and it shows that the
financial rate o f return (FRR) for Mazandaran would be 23% and 12% for Guilan, both o f which are above the
10% assumed cost o f capital. Guilan's FRR is lower mainly due to the higher investment needs in the
sewerage sector, which generates less revenue. The detailed analysis i s presented inAnnex 9.

Financial Assessment of the Water and Wastewater Companies (WWCs):

A detailed analysis has been carried out for the Mazandaran and Guilan WWCs dealing with the past, current
and future financial performance o f the WWCs. The detailed analysis is presented in Annex 9 whereas the
section below summarizes the financial situation o f the WWCs and the implications o f the proposed project on
their likely future financial performance.

Past and current performance of the WWCs: Based on audited accounts both the Mazandaran and Guilan
WWCs have been incurring net losses in the past, which are projected to continue inthe year ending March
20, 2005. While Mazandaran has achieved a working ratio (operating expenses excluding depreciation and
interedoperating revenues) below 1 in the past, insufficient past spending on maintenance resulted in
underestimation o f the working ratios achieved. Maintenance spending as a percentage o f gross fixed assets
was around 1.15% in2003/04 (the industry standard calls for 2.5%-3%).      InGuilan, although working ratios
are above 1, spending on maintenance seems to be at appropriate levels, reaching about 2.62% o f gross fixed
assets in2003104.

The financial performance o f the companies is hrther aggravated by high water losses resulting in a much
larger need for water to pass through the system than i s billed for. Water losses have deteriorated to 30.8% in
2003/04 from a level o f about 21.7% in 1999/00 in Mazandaran, and have averaged about 35% in the past in
Guilan. The collection performance o f both companies has been good over the past years, standing at about
97% for Mazandaran and 105% in Guilan in 2003/04, indicating, particularly in the case o f Guilan, that the
company's campaigns on collections and enforcements by special agents is starting to pay-off in terms o f
collecting arrears. This past collection performance has resulted in relatively good management accounts
receivables, which stood at 3.6 and 6.1 months respectively for Mazandaranand Guilan at the endo f 2003/04.

Future Financial Performance o f the WWCs: Projections to assess the future financial position and
performance o f the WWCs have been carried out for the period 2005/6-2014/15. The project financial analysis
presented below was estimated over the project's 25 year expected lifetime. The key assumptions for the
projections are presentedinAnnex 9. Detailed assumptions are recorded inthe project files.

The projections for the future financial performance have been anchored by the financial targets agreed
between the Government of Iran and the World Bank during their sector strategy discussions in September
2003. These main targets comprise the following:




                                                       22

           0      Working ratio o f 0.75 by the financial year 2009/10 (operating expenses excluding
                  depreciation and interesvoperating revenue).

                  Labor productivity reaching 3 by project completion (expressed as number o f staff per 1,000
                  water connections).

           0      Accounts receivables reduced to 4 months by 2009110.             It is worth noting that the
                  MazandaranW W C is already below this target at 3.6 months o f accounts receivable.

           0      Unaccounted for water to reach 27% by 2009110.

The targets aim to gradually improve the financial and operational performance o f the WWCs by achieving
cost recovery o f O&M, and part o f capital investment. Meeting these targets will require increases inthe water
and sanitation tariff, but will also depend on simultaneous improvements in collection performance and
reductions inwater losses. The main targets will feature as covenants inthe loan agreements, particularly the
working ratio, collection ratio and UFW. The Government is assumed to cover in the cost o f all wastewater
components, water component that deal in general with production, rehabilitation and large infrastructure
facilities. W W C will cover the distribution aspects and the customers pay for the connections.

Likely Future Financial Performance o f Mazandaran: As illustrated inAnnex 9, meetingthe targets under the
agreed financing arrangements will require a significant tariff increase o f 123% in 2006107, since the
government decided to impose a freeze on utility tariffs for the year 2005106. After then the required increase
would fall to about 23% for the rest o f the project implementationperiod. The average tariff increase between
2005106 and 2009110 would be about 33%. However, a net deficit would be incurred to the W W C because
what remains from the revenues once operating expenses are covered is still insufficient to cover for
depreciation and financial charges. As a second scenario, the tariff increase required to achieve full cost
recovery, has also been analyzed, which shows that the tariff increase would initially (in 2006107) need to be
much larger at 169%, but the average tariff increase during the project implementation period would
practically be the same, 33.9%.        A key pre-requisite for both scenarios, however, is that collections
performance i s maintained and accounts receivables that are deemed unlikely to be collected are written off.
Similar effort should be made on reducing water losses.

Likelv Future Financial Performance o f Guilan WWC: As illustrated inAnnex 9, the tariff increases required
differ significantly in the base and second scenario. In the base scenario - which targets the tariff increase
required to meet the working ratio target o f 0.75 by 2009110 - the tariff increase is significant in the year
2006107, about 100% and would be greatly reduced the year thereafter to around 29%. The average tariff
increase between 2005106 and 2009110 would be about 34%. Over the years a net deficit would be incurred
due to what remains from the revenues once operating expenses are covered is still insufficient to cover for
depreciation and financial charges. As in the case o f Mazandaran, the impact o n the required tariff increase
differs significantly when seeking full cost recovery. Inthis case, the required tariff increase in2006107 would
be 187% and the average increase would be 42%. However, an important issue is that in the base scenario,
Guilan would have to work hard to improve its performance beyond meeting the financial targets agreed to in
order to avoid negative cash flow in the years 2005-2010. The cash flow issues above-mentioned can also be
positively affected by improving efficiently o f operations and by reducing UFW to less than agreed upon target
o f 27% by end o f project.

2. Technical

The project is technically sound as investments under the project were selected based on a comprehensive
water supply and wastewater development plans for all 4 cities.         During the preparation o f these plans,
different technical altematives were analyzed and the most feasible one was selected. The feasibility criteria
took into account technical, economical, environmental, health, and social factors o f each altemative. In all
four cities, phasing of works is planned ina way to optimize the operation o f the water system by dividingthe
project area into pressure zones, to improve the operation o f the network and reduce pumping costs. For
wastewater, surveys o f wastewater characteristics were carried out and most suitable treatment process
(activated sludge) was selected for the cities. To achieve the project objectives however, the implementation
capacity o f the WWCs should be raised.        The rate o f connections and implementation o f the secondary
network are key to ensure proper operation of the treatment plants (proposed and the ones under construction).

3. Fiduciary

Procurement. Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004; and "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions
stipulated inthe Legal Agreement.

Lessons learned from past and ongoing Bank-financed projects in Iran show difficulties when applying
fiduciary requirements for these projects. The major issues that face Bank financed projects is the unfamiliarity
o f implementing government entities with the Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, and insome cases
not accepting to allow their precedence incases o f conflict with the procurement regulations o f the Country.

A Memorandum of Understanding on Fiduciary issues (MOU) was reached between the GO1and the Bank in
October 2004. The MOU identifies a series o f provisions applicable to ICB, N C B and selection o f consultants.
It also includes an explicit statement confirming that the procurement provisions o f the Project Agreements
and o f the Guidelines will prevail upon the national Law incase o f contradiction between those provisions and
the Law. This MOU should facilitate conducting procurement inaccordance with the Bank Guidelines.

Since the bulk o f the procurement under the project involves work to be conducted underN C B procedures, it is
important to reach an agreement on a standard bidding document for works in Farsi. The Bank and the GO1
have been working to produce such a document. A draft has been submitted to the Government for their
comments after which it will be translated to Farsi for projects' use. In case this agreement is not reached by
loan effectiveness, the draft document will be used under this project.

Procurement activities will be carried out by (i) provincial W W C for Guilanresponsible for the two project
                                                 the
cities o f Rasht and Anzali, and (ii)the provincial W W C for Mazandaran, responsible for the two project cities
o f Sari and Babol. Both of these companies will be supported by the N W W E C inTehran. The capacity o f the
contracting departments in the two companies will be strengthened to enable them to handle the procurement
activities under the proposed project. This will be achieved by adopting the following measures:

    i.Recruitingaprocurementofficer ineachoftheTSUsthatwillbeestablishedinthetwoWWCs.
   ii.ProvidingtrainingonBankprocurementprocedurestoTSUandWWCprocurementandtechnicalstaff

  111. Recruiting
  ...  byproject launch.
                    a long term individual expert with international experience in procurement and
        implementation o f projects for an 18-month period to assist the TSUs and WWCs inall the stages o f the
       procurement process while providing regular training to staff.

Financial Management: The IBRD loan will be made available to the Islamic Republic o f Iran who will
channel its proceeds, in the form of government contribution, to the Guilan and MazandaranWater and Waste
Water Companies (WWCs) to finance the activities under the project. While Counterpart fundingwill be made


                                                       24

available through budget transfers from the Ministry o f Economic Affairs and Finance (MEAF) to both
WWCs.      Each WWC, supported by a TSU, will be in charge o f planning, coordinating, monitoring and
reporting as well as following on the financial management and procurement aspects o f all project's activities
taking place initsjurisdiction.

The Guilan and Mazandaran WWCs are private sector entities indirectly owned by the GO1 and follow the
principles and procedures o f the trading law o f The Islamic Republic o f Iran. Both WWCs have inplace hlly
staffed financial departments, documented financial procedures and a system designed to follow on their
operations and to generate year end financial statements that are audited by independent extemal auditors. The
WWC's expenditures that are financed from the govemment budget are subject to the approval o f a Financial
controller from MEAF and are subject to post audit by the Court o f Accounts (DiwanMouhassabat). While all
other expenditures, financed through the WWCs own generated resources, are approved by the financial
manager and are subject to the WWC's controls.

To simplify the flow o f funds arrangement under this project, each W W C will open two U S dollar Special
Accounts (SA) at a Commercial Bank for the purpose o f channeling the loan proceeds to the WWCs. The first
account will deposit the amounts made available in the form o f govemment contribution towards the project
while the second will deposit the contributions that will be relend to the WWC.

A financial officer with relevant experience should be hiredineach TSU inorder to follow up on the project's
financial management arrangements, generate the project financial reports and coordinate the project financial
activities between the TSUs and the WWCs financial departments. Due to the importance o f the financial
officer's fiduciary role within the TSU the hiringo f this staff should be done prior to project effectiveness.

Despite the fact that each W W C uses accounting software to follow on their activities and to generate financial
statements, the software needs enhancements to be able to follow on the project's activities and to generate the
Bank required FMRs. For this purpose, parallel arrangements will be implemented whereby each W W C will
install a simple accounting system that would enable it to record all project related transactions and generate
project reports. This system will be monthly reconciled with the main W W C accounting software to ensure
completeness and accuracy o f information. Such a system was developed for previous bank projects and i s
available on market. The purchase and installation of the accounting system has been agreed upon during
negotiations.

Each W W C will be responsible for generating the FMRs relating to its part o f the project and submitting them
to the Bank as part o f the project progress report or separately. These reports should be remitted to the Bank
within 45 days from the end o fthe quarter.

In addition to the entity audit reports prepared presently by each o f the WWCs, each WWC will remit to the
Bank audited financial statements covering their part o f the project within 6 months following the closing of
the fiscal year beingaudited. The audit will be performedby an extemal independent auditor, acceptable to the
Bank, in accordance with intemationally accepted auditing standards. The audit Terms o f Reference (TOR)
will be prepared and submitted for the Bank'sno objection, no later than nine months prior to the end o f each
fiscal year.

4. Social

Inthe four cities ofAnzali, Rasht (Guilan province) Sari andBabol(Mazandaran province) a social assessment
was conducted using questionnaire survey, focus group discussion and key informant interviews.                 This
information was supplemented by on the spot observations o f Bank missions. The four most important key
social issues relevant to the project objectives are: (i) the deplorable and unacceptable environmental health
situation o f the poorer communities where residential streets in poor neighborhoods are frequently
characterized by foul stagnant drains and pools of raw sewage or wastewater. Absorption wells and discharge
of raw sewage into drains, waterways and lagoons creates a public health risk and general environmental



                                                        25

hazard, and therefore the very significant public benefit that this project will bring, particularly to the poorer
sections o f the community; (ii) the urgent public demand that something be done to correct these conditions;
(iii) highdegreeofintrinsicmistrustofpublicinstitutionsandpopularskepticismthatbenefitswillactually
    the
be delivered, which may adversely impact willingness to pay; (iv) the absence o f local economic dynamic,
meaning that any sharp increase inpayments or large one-off payment for connection might bring hardship to
the poorer sections o f the population; leading to (v) the need to integrate a public education and awareness
campaign into this project, and to find financial mechanisms to smooth the impact o f cost sharing.

The social development outcomes o f the project will be measurable in improved conditions o f environmental
sanitation in public streets and thoroughfares, particularly in the poorer residential areas; reduced incidental
expenditures (working days lost, costs o f caring for the sick) as well as less tangible or measurable benefits,
such as public awareness o f improved environmental conditions and enhanced property values in the areas
most affected. This project is a repeater o f the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project and
raises no additional or new issues.

This project attempts to introduce a more participatory approach to the WWCs, hitherto characterized by
technical and managerial decision-making. The new approach is necessary given the shift from government
subsidy to public cost-sharing, because without a significant effort to gain public understanding and support
for the project, cost sharing initiatives might encounter popular resistance. The social assessment indicated
skepticism among the public o f the ability o f the companies to deliver stated benefits, unwillingness to be
drawn on specific questions o f willingness to pay, and a desire that the companies develop information that is
easily understood and assimilated by the public. One o f the key recommendations o f the social assessment
was that the companies develop a community liaison capability. The project makes provision for a part time
social development project officer for the four cities to enhance and monitor the participatory process through
public willingness to monitor the quality o f services and simple indicators o f improved environmental
conditions.

The project would develop elective neighborhood water quality and sanitation monitoring committees that
would liaise with the WWCs. Neighborhood and community opinion leaders (religious leaders, community
health workers, and teachers) would be involved ineducating the public on the long-term savings to citizens o f
good environmental sanitation, and therefore the rationale for public cost sharing. Environmental NGO groups
would be involved as appropriate inthis endeavor.

The project would develop institutional community liaison and public relations capacity within the WWCs, in
order to involve the communities in monitoring o f service delivery. A baseline, mid-term and end-of-project
assessment would be conducted o f the incidence o f water-borne diseases and the cost implications to
households.

Each WWC, with the assistance o f neighborhood committees, would monitor simple indicators o f public
environmental sanitation that will be developed in a participatory fashion. The activity and attitude o f these
committees would also be monitored. A social development officer would assist in establishing baselines at
community level and measures o f improvement after network operation is inplace.

Land acquisitionand resettlement
The installation o f a city-wide wastewater collection network requires, in each city, the expropriation o f some
land a) linear, for pipelines and b) locational, for treatment plants and pump stations. Inthe great majority o f
cases, these are on public land, rights of way, thoroughfares, etc. However, for technical reasons, here and
there small additional expropriations are required to complete the network.

Such expropriations, when found to be unavoidable, are minimized and conducted in accordance with the
Resettlement Policy Framework (presented in Annex         lo),which i s identical to that already presented to the
Board for the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project approved o n May 25,2004.




                                                         26

A detailed schedule of expropriations and compensations payable, demonstrating compliance with Bank
Policy, i s prepared for each city as a Land Acquisition Plan (LAP). The unique case o f displacement o f a
family o f four through expropriation o f their residence, and the compensation arrangements that comply with
Bank policy, are detailed ina separate Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the city o f Rasht.

This policy framework and the respective LAPSRAPwere duly disclosed in Farsi and English in the four
cities on March 28 at the offices o f the respective WWC, the N W W E C and the municipality with appropriate
notice inserted inthe local newspapers.

5. Environment

The proposed project has been classified as Category "A" because o f the construction o f wastewater treatment
plants, the re-use o f sludge andtreated effluent and the potential impact on the Anzali Lagoon.
Fullenvironmental assessment(EA) studies includingenvironmental management plans (EMP) were prepared
for the four cities in compliance with the requirements o f the Islamic Republic o f Iran, as well as the World
Bank Procedures, including Operational Policy OP 4.0 1 "Environmental Assessment".             The reports covered
three major areas: (i)  project description, legal and regulatory framework, and baseline conditions; (ii) analysis
of impacts and design alternatives; and (iii)  environmental management plan (details are inAnnex 10).
The EA indicated that the execution o f the project will have positive impacts interms o f reducing pollution o f
natural resources, will generate significant economical, social and public healthbenefits.

The main environmental issues relate to the use of treated effluent for irrigation and o f treated sludge for soil
conditioning which could, incase o f any adverse diversions intreatment quality, cause a health threat to people
who come incontact. Inthe case o f Guilan, the issue o f the disposal o f sludge from the new treatment plants is
still under study (after the original incineration option has been discarded for its environmental impacts). The
WWC has agreed to provide the Bank with an environmental impact assessment report related to the
collection, disposal and treatment of the sludge from the wastewater treatment plants in Anzali and Rasht, as
well as evidence for financing the facilities for their treatment and disposal n o later than one year from the date
o f effectiveness.

Other issues are mainly related to inconvenience to be experienced during construction, such as disruption o f
traffic pattem, disrupted the access to residential andor other buildings, change in the landscape (loss o f
vegetation), noise nuisance, air pollution due to dust formation, safety hazard from construction activities and
inappropriate disposal o f excavated materials and construction debris.

Mitigation measures to ensure that potential adverse environmental impacts are minimized were identified and
include:
 e        Restricting the use o f treated effluents for irrigation in case World Health Organization (WHO)
          Guidelines cannot be met;
          Drying o f sludge for one year, before its use as soil conditioner, to ensure elimination o f nematode
          eggs;
 e        Construction activities will be coordinated with all concerned authorities prior to the start o f the
          construction works. Inaddition, good practice environmental procedures will be adopted.

The potential negative environmental impacts o f the proposed project were defined in detail through the EA.
The findings o f the EA were the basis for the development o f an Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
The EMP defines appropriate prevention and mitigation measures as well as monitoring activities. Institutional
strengthening has been also included in the EMP; in addition to the environment and safety officer at the
project TSU, the project will provide necessary laboratory equipment to conduct required analyses. The
implementation o f the EMP will be an integral part o f the project supervision process, and a Bank
environmental specialist will participate at the supervision missions to monitor the implementation activities.
The preparation o f the environmental assessment included public consultation and the produced documents
have been disclosed at the InfoShop and inIran (inthe WWCs andthe NWWEC).

Projects on International Waters (OP 7.50): OP 7.50 is applicable; given that the project consists o f
wastewater collection and treatment, with effluent discharges in water bodies reaching the Caspian Sea, the
Intenational Waterways policy has been triggered. With letters dated March 20, 2005, the Bank, on behalf o f
the Borrower, has notifiedthe riparians o f the project details.

Cultural Property (OPN 11. 03): There are no known hstorical sites inthe four project cities. However, the
final design o f the project components will be sent to Cultural Heritage Organization (CHO), which has legal
authority to ensure protection o f archeological sites. There is always the possibility o f chance-finding o f
objects and sites o f historical and cultural value during the construction phase. During implementation, the
TSU will ensure that both contractors and the supervising engineers are made aware o f their responsibilities o f
reporting such findingsto the relevant authority.


Involuntary Resettlement OPIBP 4.12: The implementation o f the project includes the expropriation o f land for
the construction o f treatment plants, pumping stations and sewerage lines. Given the common characteristics o f
this project in each city, a "Resettlement Policy Framework" has been prepared together with abbreviated
resettlement action plans for the first two cities. Iranian law conforms inall major respects to Bank guidelines,
and provides for minimization o f disturbance, advance notification to owners, compensation o f all right
holders at full value independently assessed, and right o f negotiation and appeal. Inn o case are residences or
current economic activities or livelihoods affected. Full documentation i s available to support the plants, and a
Bank social development specialist has visitedthe sites and confirmed the findingso fthe local social scientist.
The project therefore complies with the requirements o f OP 4.12.

General Context

In the last decade, following almost a decade o f war, which depreciated the capital stock and disrupted
economic and institutional development, Iranembarked on a far-reaching political, economic and social reform
program.

A very broad spectrum o f Iran's political actors and society ingeneral has embraced the overall principles and
processes of the Third Five Year Development Plan (FYDP - 1999-2004). Complex debate has centered o n
the speed, the dislocations, burden and social implications o f the reform process, in particular with respect to
the planned removal o f energy sector subsidies. Mindful o f the transition costs, the govemment has operated
with great caution to avoid social dislocation.

Achievements during the period o f the Third FYDP have been impressive. Iran has practically no extemal
debt, high foreign reserves, no major balance o f payments pressures and a moderate fiscal deficit, which now
reflects increasingly explicit subsidies, including indirect subsidies (largely inthe energy sector). Growth has
been robust with real GDP growing on a 6 percent average during 2000101 - 2002/03, reaching 7.4 percent
over the past year.     Structural reforms have advanced with gains in financial markets, trade and price
liberalization and tax policy.    Institutional reforms have included increased decentralization and greater
accountability inbudget and public expenditure process. Education and health have realized significant gains.
Inclusion o f women has improved with highfemale education enrollment at all levels. Female inclusion inthe
labor force has markedly improved (and is highby Middle East and North Africa Regional standards) but still
insufficient. Efforts to move from an economy driven by state dominance and subsidies to increased private
sector participation have had some success, though private Foreign Direct Investment and domestic investment
remains low by intemational standards. Improvements in the investment climate for the private sector have
gone forward, though slowly. Investment for the run-down economic infrastructure has picked up, but remains
constrained, more by management capacity than by finance.            Social programs targeting poverty and the
disadvantaged have undergone reform, but accountability and results remain uncertain. Finally, following a
long period o f neglect, efficient resource management and environmentally sustainable development have
become priorities.

As Iran embarks on the Fourth FYDP this year, it is at a critical junction. Continuing the direction o fthe Third
FYDP, there i s broadconsensus on four pillars o f the FourthFYDP:

                  Achieving fast, sustainable growth, relying on the transition to a market economy.
                  Sharing the fruits o f growth, addressing the needs o f the poor and disadvantaged.
                  Enhancing natural resource management and the environment.
                  Buildingan efficient, accountable andtransparent public sector.

Water Supply and Sanitation Sector

Regarding the water supply and sanitation sector, which is one o f the pillars o f the Fourth FYDR, mentioned
above, there is broad agreement among different groups in Iran o n the direction o f the reform agenda.
However, a consensus on the reform pathhas yet to emerge. As it is the case with other economic sectors, Iran
i s at an importantjuncture inwhich it can accelerate its reform process and leap forward toward modemization
ofthe water sector or at best slow down and under-achieve its potential while jeopardizing the sustainability o f
its naturalresources.

The main issues affecting the water sector in Iran have been identified through various assessments: low water
use efficiency in urban and rural uses; limited participation by stakeholders in development planning and



                                                         29

management; large needs for rehabilitation and development o f hydraulic infrastructure for sustainable water
usage; problems o f pollution caused by the discharge o f untreated wastewater into public waterways and
aquifers; and weak institutions involved inthe sector and limitedcoordination among stakeholders.

Past involvement of the World Bank in Iran water sector has been limited and fragmented due to various
factors. As a result, significant knowledge gaps have emerged. Opportunities to reverse this trend have been
sought inthe context o f the April 16,2001 InterimAssistance Strategy (2001-2004) through dialogue, leading
to the identification of promising Bank financed       infrastructure projects in water supply and sanitation, and
irrigation. The emphasis inthe dialogue i s slowly changing from a narrowly focused provision o f commercial
financing to a potential strategic partnership in development as Iran is embarking onto a reform agenda aimed
at promoting growth in a socially and environmentally sustainable way and focusing o n competitiveness and
inclusion into the global economy. The objectives o f the Fourth FYDP and the needs for implementation o f
the reform agenda open new opportunities for partnership in terms o f technical assistance and a lending
portfolio aimed at well targeted interventions focusing on integrating people, institutions and resources while
combining infrastructure with knowledge for the water sector. The Bank should use the large infrastructure
needs in the sector to promote capacity building, and institutional development. The assistance strategy for
Iran inmeeting the water sector challenges needs to be centered on the following interventions:

          Pricing policy reforms in water with improvement in service delivery, requiring a particular attention
          to cost recovery and investment financing;

          Designo f tariff schemes to help poor communities retaidimprove their livelihoods and access to basic
          services in lieu o f the current broad interventions and not well conceived cross subsidy system (Water
          Supply and Sanitation);

          Capacity building of sector institutions such as the Regional Water Boards, the Regional Water and
          Wastewater Companies, The National Water andWastewater EngineeringCompany etc.; and

          Integrated management o f land and water resources for efficient and sustainable allocation o f
          resourcesbetween uses and regions.

Through flexible and simple interventions taking into considerations Iranian planning and budgeting
institutions, The World Bank program will support the water sector while focusing on the political economy o f
change and recognizing the important implementation challenges. The Bank will not seek to intervene in all
aspects of water but would identify those opportunities where it can improve implementation, establish the
right framework for monitoring and evaluation and strengthen the national and provincial institutional capacity
to carry out reform and achieve results.

Agreed Water supply and Sanitation Strategy

The Bank strategy for assisting Iran, as described in the Interim Assistance Strategy, reviewed current
development situation in Iran, progress o f the process o f reforms, and highlighted the development challenges
and prospects faced by the country, particularly with respect to water and sanitation. It also outlined the
assistance strategy that the Bank Group will follow during the next two to three following years while
preparing a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Interim Assistance Strategy was also complemented by
an "Urban Water and Sanitation Sector Note", which was discussed at a World Bank Institute (WBI) workshop
on June 2002, and endorsed by the Government in September 2003. Government and Bank agreed on the
following: (i) strategy, (ii) implementation program for Bank assistance to be part o f the coming CAS
                the                the
(2006-2008), and (iii)  the key performance indicators for the sector.
The sector is characterized by a wide discrepancy in coverage o f water and sewerage services. About 98% of
the urban population is connected to public water supplies while only about 23% is connected to public
sanitary sewerage and only part o f the collected sewage i s treated before disposal. The bulk o f sewage is




                                                           30

discharged untreated and constitutes a major source o f pollution to groundwater and a risk to public health. Ina
number o f cities without sanitary sewerage, households discharge their sewage through open rainwater drains.

World Bank Assistance to the Sector: In addition to preparing and disseminating the Water Supply and
Wastewater Sector Note in2002 the World Bank has two active projects: the Tehran Sewerage and the Ahwaz
and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Projects.

Following the discussions that took place in September 2003, the GO1and the Bank agreed:


(1)     to adopt the main conclusions o f the sector strategy note which emphasized institutional reforms, i.e.,
        clarification and demarcation o f the responsibilities o f the institutions involved; streamlining o f
        financial policies; implementation o f a tariff scheme consistent with the cost recovery objective;
        optimization o f investment; selecting appropriate least-cost technologies; addressing environmental
        and health concems; and implementing an integrated water resource management.

(ii)    to implement the agreed upon strategy inthe following three phases:

        Phase I:implementation o f the water and sanitation investment project for the two cities o f Ahwaz
        and Shiraz (2004-2009) and preparation and initiation o f sector reforms (2004/2005). This includes
        the preparation drafting o f terms o f reference-TOR and selection o f consultants o f studies and
        technical assistance (TA) programs covering the following areas: demand management, customer
        education, institutional reforms, the regulatory framework, tariffs and cost recovery, technology and
        investment priorities, sanitation strategy and integrated water conservation. WBI has assisted the
        government inpreparing workshops related to institutions and sanitation strategy.

        Phase 11: Execution o f the water and sanitation investment projects for the four cities o f Rasht,
        Anzali, Sari and Babol (2005-2010). Phase I1will complete investments identified and agreed upon
        duringPhase I.The reform agenda for the sector - already initiated in Phase I- will continue to be
        implementedunder bothphases.

        Phase 111: Investment projects will be prepared for other new cities under an adaptable program loan
        (APL).    The cities will be selected based on criteria such as the adoption o f reform measures and
        improved results.

          IRAN: NORTHERN CITIES WATER SUPPLY & SANITATION PROJECT



The project will provide assistance to improve the water supply system and install a wastewater collection
network (with treatment facilities) in four cities in the northern part o f Iran. The four cities are: Rasht and
Anzali (Guilan Province) and Sari and Babol (Mazandaran Province). This Annex provides some background
on the conditions ineach city and the proposed project components.

A. GuilanProvince

Rasht i s the capital o f Guilan Province and is located 320 km north o f Tehran, while Anzali is the second
largest city o f Guilan Province and i s located on the Caspian Sea, some 40 kmnorthwest o f Rasht. The present
population o f Rasht is estimated at about 500,000 and is projected to reach 956,600 by year 2027; whereas the
present population o f Anzali i s 118,000 and reaches 143,000 in the summer because o f tourism. Anzali's
population i s projected to reach about 252,000, including tourists, by the year 2027. The Zarjoob and the
Goharood are the main rivers flowing through Rasht while Anzali is located around the Anzali Lagoon, a
wetland o f international ecological importance. These two rivers and Anzali Lagoon eventually flow into the
Caspian Sea.

It is estimated that around 85% of the population o f Rasht and Anzali are currently connected to the cities'
water supply system. Water quality monitoring indicates that the water supply i s o f acceptable quality and in
compliance with national and WHO standards. Chemical, physical and bacteriological analyses are conducted
on a daily basis at various points including water sources, storage reservoirs and distribution network. The
major problem raised by the Guilan Water and Wastewater Company is the highpercentage o f unaccounted for
water (UFW), particularly for Rasht due to the old age o f the system. The UFW in Rasht is estimated at 36%,
whereas at Anzali it is estimated at 26%. (Note: These figures are estimates and need to be investigated and
confirmed duringproject implementation). Rehabilitation of the water supply network has been initiated but i s
proceeding at a very slow rate due to limited financial resources.

Similar to other cities in Iran, the lack o f wastewater collection and treatment i s the main environmental
concern in Rasht and Anzali. A major problem is the discharge o f wastewater into the natural water bodies
runningthrough these cities. InRasht raw wastewater i s discharged to the Zarjoob and Goharood rivers, which
eventually reach the Anzali Lagoon, whereas inAnzali the wastewater is discharged to the Caspian Sea and to
the Anzali Lagoon where pollution levels are increasing and are seriously affecting its environmental
conditions.

Moreover, due to the high ground water level in both cities, the sewage i s leading to the contamination o f
ground water and causing infectious diseases. In view of these conditions, which are causing health hazards,
and serious repercussions on the cities' developments, the implementation o f this wastewater treatment plan
project has become a high priority. The feasibility study for Rasht and Anzali water and wastewater
management has beenprepared to meet the study area requirements up to the year 2027.

This plan envisages improvement and extension of the existing water supply system in Rasht and Anzali,
provision o f facilities for wastewater collection and its disposal as well as the construction o f treatment plants
ineach city. The planis expected to provide facilities to a population of 956,600 inRasht covering an area of
9,850 hectares and to nearly 252,000 inhabitants of Anzali with an area o f 3,095 hectares by the year 2027.
The required works for water and wastewater will be completed over four phases, with phase one from year
2005 to year 2010, phase two from year 2011 to year 2012, phase three from year 2013 to year 2018, and
phase four from year 2018 till year 2027.

Water supply

The total average water demand o f Rasht city is 123,600 m3/dayand is expected to increase to around 238,600
m3/dayinthe year 2027. The total average water demand of Anzali city is 26,840 m3iday and is expected to
increase to around 56,740 m3/day in the year 2027. The current water demand o f the two cities i s provided
from the Central & East Guilan Water Supply Scheme, which also provides water to other cities in east and
central areas o f Guilan. The Central and East Guilan Water Supply Scheme depends on the surface water o f
Sefidrood River and the groundwater o f EmamzadehHashem deep wells. The Sefidrood Rwer water is treated
at Sangar WTP and Emergency WTP using conventional treatment processes comprising o f flocculation,
sedimentation, filtration and chlorination. Sangar WTP presently provides 259,200 m3/day, which accounts for
74% o f the total supply quantity, and will provide 518,400 m3/day in year 2027. The Emergency WTP
presently provides 25,920 m3/day, and will provide 51,840 m3/dayby year 2027, whereas EmamzadehHashem
wells provide 64,800 m3/day. Guilan Regional Water Authorithy intends to develop additional wells at
Lahijan and Sangar during the last phase o f the project to increase the total ground water sources by an
additional 90,480 m3/day. As part of the proposedproject, the following water works will be implemented:

The main sub-components o f the proposed first phase extension (2005 to 2010) o f the water supply system in
Rasht include:


    0    Rehabilitation o f 440 km o fnetwork pipes

    0    Extension o f some 59 km o f distribution mains
    0    Rehabilitation o f 95 kmo f distribution piping and mains
    0    Provision o f control and instrumentation system

Wastewater:

Rasht i s divided into westem, eastem, and central drainage zones. Currently, its population i s connected (via
cesspits) to a combined wastewater and storm drainage collection network, which discharges into Zarjoub and
Goharood rivers. The rivers are severely polluted and during the summer season, when their flows are
minimal, they are transformed to sewers. The wastewater management plan in Rasht city i s to collect the
wastewater generated in the three drainage zones o f the city and convey them by gravity and pumping to a
single wastewater treatment plant located4 kmto the north-east o f the city. It i s forecasted that by end o f hase
1,45% of the populationwillbe connected to the new collection system andwill be generating 50,860 m /day.     P
These flows will be treated to secondary treatment level with additional nutrient removal for control o f
nitrogen and phosphorus levels. The treated effluent o f Rasht WWTP will be discharged to Zarjoub and
Gouharoud Rivers, ultimately discharging to Anzali lagoon, which intum discharges into the Caspian Sea.

At present wastewater collection system in Rasht is under construction, with priority given to the central
drainage area as it has the highest population density. Land for effluent outfalls, and land for collection
network pumping stations has been acquired by the Guilan WWC. The land for phase 1 o f the Rasht W W T P
works was acquired, and construction o f the phase 1facilities with capacity o f 80,000 m3/day, is currently in
progress.




                                                       38

Anzali is divided by Anzali lagoon into two drainage zones; called Anzali and Ghazian. Currently, 70% o f its
population is connected to a combined wastewater and storm drainage collection network, which discharges
into either Anzali lagoon, which i s currently classified as eutrophic in many o f its parts, or into the Caspian
Sea, through eight existing large sewer outfalls. The wastewater management plan in Anzali city is to collect
the wastewater generated in each drainage zone and convey it by gravity and pumping to a central W W T P
serving that zone. Thus, there will be two WWTPs: one inWestem Anzali and one inGhazian (East Anzali). It
i s forecasted that by end o f phase 1,65% o f the population will be connected to the collection system and will
be generating 19,710 m3/day. These flows will be treated to secondary treatment level with additional nutrient
removal for control o f nitrogen and phosphorus levels. The treated effluent o f West Anzali WWTP will be
discharged to Anzali Lagoon, which inturn discharges to the Caspian Sea. The treated effluent o f East Anzali
WWTP will be discharged to Talebabad River, a short river connecting the Anzali Lagoonto the Caspian Sea.

At present wastewater collection system in Anzali is under construction. The land for the treatment plants,
effluent outfalls, and collection network pumping stations has been acquired by the Guilan WWC. Pipelines
will be laid within the right o f way o f public streets. Phase 1o f the West Anzali WWTP works with capacity
of 18,700 m3/day, i s currently in progress. A full EA was not performed for the construction o f the WWTP.
Consequently and similar to Rasht WWTP a post review was undertaken.

As part ofthe proposedproject, the following wastewater works will be executed:

The proposed first phase extension (2005 to 2010) o f the wastewater collection and treatment system in Rasht
includes:

          Construction o f 70400 house connections
          A collection network o f 558 km
          16 lift stations
          Upgrading o f the Rasht WWTP by including Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR)
          Provision o f emergency raw wastewater storage tank with 24 hour capacity for phase 1.
          The provision o f septage management works

The proposed first phase extension (2005 to 2009) o f the wastewater collection and treatment system inAnzali
includes:

          Constructiono f 27,000 house connections
          A collection network o f253 km
          14 lift stations
          Upgrading o f the Anzali West WWTP (under construction) by includingbiologicalnutrient removal.
          Provision o f emergency raw wastewater storage tank with 24 hour capacity for phase 1.
      0   The provision o f septage management works.
          Construction o f the first module at East Anzali WWTP

The process design o f the treatment plants was developed based on influent loads that were estimated from the
long term data acquired at Esfahan and Tehran treatment plants and on guidelines issued by the Organization
of Planning and Management. The design treated effluent quality is in accordance with Iranian standards for
discharge to surface water bodies. These effluent standards include among others, concentration limits for
BOD, COD, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal coliform. It should be noted that since the
discharge o f all treatment plants i s eventually reaching the sensitive water body o f Anzali Lagoon, additional
features have been incorporated in the design o f the Rasht and Anzali WWTPs to increase their performance
and reliability. These features include: (1) the provision o f BNR for controlling nitrogen and phosphorus to
minimumlevels achieved bybiologicaltreatment systems, (2) the provisiono f24 hour emergency storage tank
for raw sewage in case o f upset inplant performance (3) the provision o f UV disinfection inlieu o f chlorine to
eliminate the possibility o fharmful chlorination by-products.

Sludge treatment for Rasht WWTP will be achieved through blending, thickening, and anaerobic digestion,
and dewatering by belt filter presses to 30% dry solids content. Sludge treatment for Anzali West and East
WWTPs will be achieved through thickening and dewatering to 30% dry solids content. The projected sludge
quantity from Rasht WWTP is 26 m3/day at year 2010, and 111 m3/day at year 2027. The projected sludge
quantities from both West and East Anzali WWTP are 28 m3/day for year 2027. The initial sludge disposal
scheme proposed was incineration, because sludge disposal by re-use in agriculture within Guilan province
was rejected due to public opposition in application to agncultural fields (predominantly cultivated by rice),
unfavorable weather conditions (high humidity and rainfall for most o f the year which prevents sludge drying
inopenbeds), and the higher cost o f land filling when compared to cost o f incineration as based on the actual
contracted price. However and as concluded by the post environmental review, the proposed incineration
system does not meet the intemational standards in terms o f emission levels and other environmental criteria.
Therefore the re-use o f sludge in agriculture outside the Guilan province or at its borders, where agricultural
and climatic conditions are more favorable, has been identified as the more appropriate methodfor this project.
The WWC o f Guilan i s in the process o f identifying the land on which the sludge receiving and storage
facilities will be built. An Environmental Assessment o f the (new) sludge disposal option will be prepared and
presented to the Bank within one year o f project effectiveness. ms facility will ultimately receive the sludge
from all three plants (the Rasht WWTP and the two from Anzali)


B.Mazandaran Province

Sari is the capital o f Mazandaran province while Babol i s its second largest city. Both cities are located in
north o f Tehran, about 20 and 25 km towards south o f the Caspian Sea, respectively. The present populations
o f Sari and Babol are 223,300 and 178,200 persons and are projected to reach 423,000 and 342,000 persons by
the year 2029, respectively. Both cities are located inone o fthe hightourism attractive province of Iran. Tajan
i s the main river flowing through Sari while Babol River i s the main river o f Babol city. These rivers
eventually discharge into the Caspian Sea. I t is estimated that 100% o f the inhabitants o f Sari and Babol are
currently connected to the city's water supply network.

In both cities, the water quality meet the national drinking water standards. The unaccounted for water is
estimated to be around 32%. (Nore work is needed to better measure this important indicator). Recent surveys
show the need to rehabilitate a parts o f the network to help reduce the unaccounted for water.

At present, there is no wastewater collection and disposal system in Sari, most o f the inhabitants rely on the
traditional percolation pits. In contrast, inBabol, work has been initiated on the construction o f the wastewater
collection network (and treatment plant). Due to the high water table and low soil permeability, the use o f
existing absorption wells in Babol and Sari has been unsatisfactory and causing groundwater and surface water
contamination. A great part o f the wastewater in Babol is discharged to Babolrood River or in open drainage
channels that runalong the roads adjacent to the residentialareas.


Water Supply

The total water demand in Sari i s 51,800 m3/dayand i s expected to reach 97,087 m3/dayby the year 2029. The
current water demands are supplied from 19 wells, which are scattered inside and around the city, mostly in
Tajan river aquifer and alluvial cone. From these wells, 1,060 l/s (91,584 m3/day) i s pumped to storage
reservoirs for further distribution into the network

The total water demand of Babol is 41,796 m3/day and is expected to reach 78,459 m3/day by the year 2029.
The current water demands are supplied from a well field 38 km away toward south west o f Babol, called
Am01 source inHaraz River basin. This wells field comprises o f 12 wells providing total water supply quantity



                                                        40

o f 1,080 l/s (93,000 m3/day). The wells field also supplies three neighboring urban centers, which include
Babolsar, Amir Kula, and Freydounkenar. There is continuous chlorination in Amol reservoir with chlorine
gas before supplying drinkingwater to the network. The results on heavy metals and other parameters on Amol
water wells show that the water quality i s incompliance with national Iranian and international standards.

As part o fthe proposed project, the following water works will be implementedinSari inthe first phase:

         Rehabilitation o f 50 kmo f the distribution network
         Extension o f the Network to new areas: 150km
         Installation o f 5,500 consumer water meters
         Unaccountedfor water reductionprogram

The proposed project will implement the following water works inBabol inthe first phase:

         Construction o f one storage reservoir with 20,000 m3capacity.
    0    Rehabilitation o f water supply network byreplacing 40 kmo f pipelines (100to 400mm diameter).
         Extension o f water supply network mains by execution o f 32.5 km o f pipeline with 125 km network
         branches (50 to 90 mm).
         Installation 4,500 consumer water meters.
         Unaccountedfor water reductionprogram

Wastewater

There are no wastewater collection, treatment and disposal system in Sari. The common practice for
wastewater disposal is through absorption wells. Normally, these wells have 1to 1.2 m diameter and 8 to 10 m
depth and normally require one time cleaning in about 1-2 years period. The wastewater is almost entirely o f
domestic origin. Only two industries are located in the project area: a dairy and a soft drink factory. Both
factories have activated sludge wastewater pre-treatment plants.       It is projected that the total wastewater
volume collected will be around 4,861 m3/day at the end o f year 2010 and 92,840 m3/day at the end o f
planning period (2029).

The future Sari WWTP will employ the activated sludge process and shall include processes for nitrogen
control and effluent disinfection by chlorination. The WWTP will be comprised o f four modules, with a
capacity o f 23,240 m3/day per module. Treated effluent will be discharged to the Tajan River, whereas the
sludge generated inthe plant will be re-used as a soil conditioner after composting.

The common practice for wastewater disposal in Babol i s also through the absorption wells. As there is no
industry in the project area o f Babol, the sewage is entirely o f domestic origin. It is projected that the total
wastewater volume collected will be around 11,768 m3/day at the end o f year 2010. At present, trunk lines and
part o f mains and laterals are being laid in the city and the first stream o f the wastewater treatment plant i s
under construction. The effluent will be discharged inthe Shazdehrood k v e r which is a seasonal river and the
use of the river water downstream o f outfall i s solely agncultural irrigation. Duringthe summer, the effluent
will be used for irrigation o f the orange orchards surrounding the course o f the river, and during the winter
season the effluent will be usedfor augmenting the river's flows.

Underthe proposedproject, the following wastewater works will be executed inSari infirst phase:
         Installation o f 16000 house connections;
         Installationo f 128 kmlaterals usingpipes o f 200 mm.

ProjectManagement


Each WWC will be responsible for the management and implementation o f its part o f the project (5
components each) and for subsequent operation and maintenance o f the facilities that will be built. A
Technical Support Unit (TSU) will be established within each W W C and the TSU already established within
the N W W E C (under the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project) will provide additional
support and oversight. Responsibilities o f the TSUs in WWCs will include planning, coordination,
monitoring and reporting while the TSU inN W W E C will be in charge o f consolidating periodic reports for
all implementing agencies (as for the reports from Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project).
N W W E C will also assist the WWCs inpreparing International Competitive Bidding(ICBs) and large value
consultancies. TSUs will report directly to the management o f the respective WWCs. The TSU in the
N W W E C will maintain oversight o f the implementation progress andparticipate inBank supervision.
During appraisal, agreement was reached on the TSUs' staffing level. Each TSU will include a project
manager, an engineer, an environment specialist, a financial management specialist and a procurement
specialist. The main responsibilities o f the TSU include:

     Organize the project launch to discuss the coordination and implementationprocedures;

     Overall programming o f the implementation o f the various subcomponents and periodic revisions and
     updates;

     Setting up work organization and management procedures for itself;

     Preparingbiddingdocuments for procurement packages and carrying out the biddingprocess;

     Preparingterms o f reference o f the technical assistance support activities (training, EMP, etc.);

     Contract management andmonitoring o f the progress o f works through upervision firms;

     Maintain all project files (reports, drawings, correspondence, invoices from contractors, etc.);

     Prepare the progress reports to the Bank and other Government agencies, as required;

     Manage the financial aspects o f the project (review the payment invoices and approving o f payments,
     managing the disbursement processes and the counterpart funds, etc.).

     Prepare Financial Management Reports for the Bank and disbursement forecasts;

     Organize external yearly audits o f project accounts, Special Accounts and SOE.


ProjectImplementation and Schedule


The WWCs/TSUs will use local consultants for engineering design and construction supervision for routine
works, but would need foreign expertise for complex works, such as wastewater treatment works and some
o f the EMP activities.

First year procurement packages o f the project are at a final design stage and are scheduled and expected to
be completed by the third quarter o f 2005. The MOE and WWCs have agreed to hire consultants to prepare
tendering documents to be ready for execution by Bank loan effectiveness. A satisfactory implementation o f

the Project requires that: (i)
                             WWCs be supported by competent TSUs; and (ii) Management and Planning
                                                                             the
Organization (MPO) and WWCs provide counterpart funds on a timely basis. The full staffing complement
will be ready for effectiveness.

Project Monitoring and Supervision
The TSU and the WWC will pay special attention to the fulfillment o f the key performance indicators
(outcome and output indicators  - Annex 3), which will be monitored along with the physical and financial
progress of the project. Bank supervision will also be needed, which will require significant resources,
particularly in the first two years o f implementation. In addition, capacity building will require a major
effort. On average, two supervision missions per year will be needed with approximately 25 staff weeks for
each year except for the first year where 3 supervision mission are required, it.,130 staff weeks for the
whole project implementation period

           IRAN: NORTHERN CITIES WATER SUPPLY & SANITATION PROJECT



Executive Summary

The IBRD loan will be made available to the Islamic Republic o f Iran who will channel its proceeds, in the
form o f government contribution, to the Guilan and Mazandaran WWCs to finance the activities under the
project. While counterpart funding will be made available through budget transfers from the Ministry o f
Economic Affairs and Finance (MEAF) to both companies. EachWWC, supported by a TSU, will be incharge
o f planning, coordinating, monitoring and reporting as well as following on the financial management and
procurement aspects o f all project activities taking place inits province.

The Guilan and Mazandaran WWCs are private sector entities indirectly owned by the GO1 and therefore
follow the principles and procedures o f the trading law o f The Islamic Republic o f Iran. Both WWCs have in
place fully staffed financial departments, documented financial procedures and a system designed to follow o n
their operations and to generate year end financial statements that are audited by independent extemal auditors.
Each WWC's financial department i s made up o f accountants and officers who follow up on payments, credits,
receivables, assets andpayroll. Duties are well segregated inthe financial department and the staff turnover i s
relatively low. All the WWCs' expenditures that are financed through transfers from the budget are issued by
a Financial controller assigned by the MEAF and are subject to post audit by the Court o f Accounts (Diwan
Mouhassaba). All other expenditures are approved by the financial manager and are subject to the WWC's
controls.

To avoid the risk that both companies not being able to follow on the project accounts and generate timely
reliable reports, it was agreed that each company will engage a qualified financial officer within it TSU and
will ring fence the project accounting operations through the installation o f a simple accounting software able
to generate timely reports includingthe FMRs.


RiskAssessment and Mitigation Summary

The overall inherent risk relating to this project is rated as high based on the lack o f Economic and Sector
Work (ESW) covering the Islamic Republic o f Iran as well as both Companies' limited experience in
implementing Bank financed projects.

The main control risks relates to: (i)  the WWCs' limitedexperience inBank guidelines and procedures, (ii)   the
risk o f the WWCs not being able to generate revenues to support their share o f counterpart funding and
repayment o f the sub-loan, (iii)the lack o f a financial officer able to follow on the project's financial
arrangements and (iv) the number o f bank accounts to be opened under the project. These risks will be
mitigated through: (I) training provided to the WWCs, (ii)close monitoring o f the WWCs' audited entity
financial   statements to ensure that revenue targets are met, (iii)hiring a financial officer with relevant
experience and language ability, and (iv) defining the flow o f project funds for each W W C in a project
financial procedure manual to be prepared by the TSU, with the help o f an external financial consultant. This
consultant has been identified. This manual will be annexed to the existing manual defining the companies
procedures andregulations.

A detailed financial management questionnaire was carried out for each W W C andis included inthe project's
files, the risks identified and the mitigatingmeasures addressing these risks are detailed inthe table below.

Accounting system: Despite that each W W C uses accounting software to follow on their activities and to
generate financial statements, the software needs enhancements to be able to follow on the project's activities
and to generate the Bank required financial monitoring reports. For this purpose, parallel arrangements will be
implemented whereby each W W C will install a simple accounting system that would enable it to record all
project related transactions and generate project reports. This systemwill be monthly reconciled with the main
W W C accounting software to ensure completeness and accuracy o f information. Such a system has been
developed under a different bank project and i s available on the market. To facilitate the reporting process, a
detailed chart o f accounts identifying funds by financiers and expenditures by component will be developed for
the project and included inthe Financial Procedure Manual. The purchase and installation o f the accounting
system has been agreed upon duringnegotiations.

Staffing and training: A financial officer with relevant experience should be hired in each TSU in order to
follow up on the project's financial management arrangements, generate the project financial reports and
coordinate the project financial activities between the TSUs and the WWCs financial departments. Once hired,
the financial officers will attend the training that will be provided to the WWCs on Bankrules, regulations and
guidelines. Due to the importance o f the financial officer fiduciary role within the TSU the hiring o f this
financial officer i s a condition for project effectiveness.

Financial Procedure Manual: Since this project i s introducing a new activity for the WWCs that i s not
included intheir current documented regulations and for the purpose o f having accurate and complete financial
information as well as for defining the flow o f funds and information between the different WWCs, MPO,
MEAF and the Bank, a Financial Procedure Manual need to be developed by the TSUs, with the help o f an
external financial consultant. This manual will be added as an annex to the regulations o f each o f the W W C
and will document:

          The Financial Officer's responsibilities within the WWCs financial departments and his relationship
          with the MEAFfinancial controller;
 (ii) Theproject'saccountingsystem;
 (iii) Thereconciliationprocedures,timingandoutputbetweenthetwosystems;
 (iv)     Process o f requesting funds from the MEAF and the replenishment o f the project SAs including the
          timeliness o f submittingwithdrawal applications to the Bank for SA replenishment;
          Process for preparing and remitting withdrawal applications;
          Chart o f accounts for the project (should reflect the WWCs classification, if applicable, for easy
          reconciliation);
 (vii)    Frequency and form o f financial reports including formats o f Financial Monitoring Reports; and
 (viii)   Flow o f funds.

A draft o f a financial procedure manual developed under a similar project in Iran have been shared with the
TSU as a starting point for this project's financial procedure manual.

Flow of funds

To ensure that funds are readily available for the project's implementation, 8 bank accounts (4 SA and 4
Project Accounts) will be used under this project and the flow o f funds process will depend on whether these
funds are channeled as government contribution or as sub-lent to the WWCs..Each water company willprepare
and follow on the project's withdrawal applications including direct payment requests relating to its activities.
Deposits into and payments out o f the SA to pay contractors/suppliers/consultants, will be made inaccordance
with the provisions o f the LoanAgreement.
                                                                                    L


Funds made available throuah Government Contribution : A special account denominated is US$will be
opened by each W W C at a commercial Bank in the Islamic Republic o f Iran and used for channeling loan
proceeds under this part of the project. Counter part funds will be made available through periodical transfers
from the MEAF to an account specifically opened for the project in a commercial bank. All payments, under

will be disbursed in accordance with the Bank's disbursements guidelines as outlined in the Disbursement
Handbook. Transaction based disbursement will be used under this project. Accordingly, requests for
payments from the loan account will be initiated through the use o f withdrawal applications (WAS)either for
Direct Payments, Reimbursements, Replenishments to the Special Account, or Issuance o f Special
Commitments. All WASwill include appropriate supporting documentation including detailed Statements o f
Expenditure (SOEs) for reimbursements andreplenishments to the Special Account.

to the borrower. The supporting documentation will be maintained at related WWC and will be made available
for review by Bank supervision missions upon request. Documentation relating to SOEs would be retained for
up to one year from the date the bank receives the audit report for the fiscal year inwhich the last withdrawal
application from the loan account was made.

Special Account: To ensure that funds are readily available for project implementation at the two companies,
two SAs in US Dollars will be opened by each W W C at a commercial bank as per the Central Bailk
instructions and will be operated by the respective WWCs. Initially, an advance equivalent to about four
months average o f expenditures to be financed through the SA will be transferred to each o f the SAs upon
effectiveness o f the Loan and receipt o f signed withdrawal applications.

Details of each SA authorized allocation and initial deposit are documented below. The full allocation may be

           IRAN: NORTHERN CITIES WATER SUPPLY & SANITATION PROJECT


A. General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:
Procurement. Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the
Legal Agreement. The various items under different expenditure categories are described in general below.
For each contract to be financed by the Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant selection
methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed
between the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional
capacity.

Country Background:

Procurement in the Islamic Republic o f Iran i s governed mainly by the "By-laws on Government
Transactions". In principle, this law governs all public sector entities including state owned enterprises. The
provisions o f these laws allow decentralization in conducting public procurement by public entities. However,
the Management and Planning Organization (MPO) carries a central role in public procurement. It regularly
issues documents o n public procurement that are followed by the public entities. These include regulations,
circulars, bidding documents, standards for technical specifications and unit prices. These last two are mainly
for civil works and consultants. More importantly is the system for qualifying contractors and consultants by
M P O which i s a pre-condition for participating in any public procurement. The M P O categorizes all
contractors and consultants according to their capacity and specialization. Public entities can invite bidders
from among the recommended lists o f these qualified contractors and consultants. These lists will be
determined according to the size and complexity o f the contract, capacity o f the contractors and consultants
and their on-going commitments. Recruitment o f international consultants is always subject to the approval o f
the MPO.

A new procurement law has been approved in February 2005. The Bank has not reviewed this new law yet.
The major issue that faces projects financed by the Bank is the unfamiliarity o f the M P O and other
implementing government entities with the Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, and consequently
not accepting to allow their precedence in cases o f conflict with those o f the Country. From its side, the Bank
i s also increasing its knowledge o f the public procurement system in Iran.

A Public Expenditure Review (PER) mission was conducted in 2003 with participation o f procurement and
financial management senior staff and consultants. This has resulted in a preliminary assessment o f the public
procurement environment in Iran. An Operational Procurement Review (OPR) is scheduled for FY06. The
PER and feedback from Bank project teams have identified some critical issues that needed to be addressed
under Bank financed projects and which were experienced during implementation. A dialogue has been
initiated between the Bank and the Iranian Government with MEAFtaking the lead from the Government side
with the objective o f reaching a framework agreement on fiduciary issues in World Bank projects in Iran. A
main outcome o f this dialogue is the signing o f a Memorandum o f Understanding on Fiduciary issues (MOU)
between the GO1and the Bank in October 2004. The MOU identifies a series o f provisions applicable to ICB,
N C B and the selection o f consultants. It also includes an explicit statement confirming that the procurement
provisions o f the Loan Agreement and o f the Guidelines will prevail upon the national Law in case o f
contradiction between those provisions and the Law. The MOU i s henceforth an integral part o f the Loan
Agreement for this project.




                                                        60

Another important outcome o f the dialogue is the agreement on a standard bidding documents for works that
will be used for NCB in all Bank financed projects. A draft o f this document has been submitted to the
Government for its comments after which it will be translated to Farsi for projects use.

Procurement of Works: Works procured under this project would include rehabilitation and expansion of
water supply networks covering construction o f new transmission lines, construction o f reservoirs, building
and equipping o f pumpingstations inaddition to the rehabilitation and expansion o f the secondary distribution
networks. Works for the wastewater networks include construction o f outfalls for the WWTPs, construction o f
main trunks, laterals and interceptors, building and equipping pumping stations, rehabilitation and expansion
o f the collection systems including installation o f house connections. Additionally, WWTPs will be
constructed and equipped inthe cities o f Anzali and Sari.

All contracts over US$5 million will be procured under ICB procedures. Some o f the contracts for trunks and
main supply lines will be carried under I C B procedures. For any contract requiring tunneling with a value
more then US$lO million a pre-qualification process will be carried. Other sections o f the water supply and
wastewater collection systems will be built up gradually and will be launched in small packages under N C B
procedures distributed over the five years o f the project. Procurement will be carriedusingthe Bank's Standard
Bidding Documents (SBD) for works for all ICBs and the standard bidding document in Farsi that will be
agreed to between the Iranian Government and the Bank as indicated above, for NCB. Procedures for N C B
under the project should be satisfactory to the Bank and inparticular the following should be observed:

     (a) invitations to bid shall be advertised inat least one national and one provincial newspaper with a wide
        circulation, at least 30 days prior to the deadline for the submission o f bids;
     (b) biddingwill be opento qualifiedbidderswho are registered inthe MPO qualification system and who
         satisfy the qualification criteria indicated inthe biddingdocuments;
     (c) foreign bidders shall not be precluded from bidding and no preference o f any kind shall be given to
        nationalbidders inthe biddingprocess;
     (d) qualification criteria shall be stated inthe biddingdocuments;
     (e) a one envelope system will be used;
     (f) except for late bids, bids shall be opened inpublic bid opening inwhich the prices o f bidders are read
         out and which will be conducted promptly after the deadline for submission o fbids; prices for all bids
         will be read out in this session and no disqualification o f any bidder except for late bids, shall be
        made at that stage;
     (8) bids shall be solicited and contracts shall be awarded on the basis o f unit prices proposed by the
         bidders and not on offering discounts (or increases) on unit rates that are published or stated in the
         biddingdocuments;
     (h) before rejectingallbidsandsolicitingnew bids,the Bank's prior concurrence shallbe obtained;
     (i)contractsshallbeawardedtothelowestevaluatedandqualifiedbidders;and
     (j)post-biddingnegotiationsshallnotbeallowedwiththelowestevaluatedoranyotherbidder

Procurement o f the Sari WWTP will be conducted under I C B procedures. The bidding documents will be
based on the SBD for the "Supply and Installation o f Equipment" modified to fit the specific requirements
underthe project.

Procurement of Goods: This project is relatively small and aims at acquiring equipment that will assist the
companies in the detection o f leaks and the maintenance o f the water distribution and wastewater collection
systems. Additionally, some laboratory equipment will be purchased as part o f the environmental management
plan. Procurement will be using I C B for all contracts estimated at a value o f more then US$250,000, N C B for
contracts estimated to be between US$250,000 and US$50,000 and shopping for values less then US$50,000.
Biddingdocuments to be used will be the Bank's SBD for all ICB and a standard biddingdocument agreed
with the Bank for NCBs. The form o fthis document should follow the principles used for the productiono fthe
works N C B document adapted to fit the procurement o f goods. Inparticular, the principles indicated above for
works should be followed except for item "g" which is not applicable, while requirements under item "b" will

be assessed on a case by case basis. Shopping methods will be in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph
3.5 of the Guidelines using simplifiedforms o f quotation acceptable to the Bank.

Selection of Consultants:       Consultant services under the project cover the following: (a) design and
supervision services for water and wastewater works to be packaged for each city separately. To expedite
implementation prior to loan effectiveness, the two WWCs will recruit the first year design and supervision
consultants from govemment funds; (b) environmental management plan, studies and technical assistance o n
leak detection measures will be programmed during the first year o f the project; (c) project management
component that is targeted to recruit individual consultants and firms to assist inthe management o f the project
at the water companies including specialized training activities and targeted technical assistance.
The methods o f procurement to be used will be the Quality and Cost based Selection Method (QCBS); Least
Cost Selection (LCS) for assignments estimated to be less then US$200,000; and selection based o n
Consultants Qualifications (CQ) for assignments estimated to be less then US$lOO,OOO. Selection o f individual
consultants will be carried in accordance with section V o f the Guidelines.


B.Assessment ofthe agency's capacity to implement procurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by (i) provincial W W C for Guilan responsible for the two project
                                                   the
cities o f Rasht and Anzali, and (ii)the provincial W W C for Mazandaran, responsible for the two project cities
of Sari and Babol. Both o f these companies will be supported by the NWWEC.

Ineacho fthese companies, procurement is organized under a department headedby amanager and assisted by
a few staff. During identification     and preparation o f the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation
Project and this project, the Bank conducted an assessment o f the procurement capacity o f the two WWCs for
Guilan and Mazandaran. The contracting departments in these companies have considerable experience in
local procurement, and inparticular procurement o f works. However, they have no exposure to international
procurement, or knowledge o f Bank procedures in relation to procurement o f large works and selection and
employment o f consultants. Weak knowledge o f English language represents also a considerable obstacle
especially when usingthe Bank SBD for ICBs and RFP for selection o f consultants.

The capacity o f the contracting departments in the two WWCs will be strengthened to enable them to handle
the procurement activities under the proposed project. This will be achieved by recruiting a procurement
officer in each o f the TSUs that will be established in each WWC. In addition, the N W W E C has already
recruited staff in the TSU under the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The TSU inthe
NWWEC,and inparticular the procurement officer, should support the TSUs inthe two companies and ensure
transfer of know-how and experience from the first project avoiding any duplication o f efforts.

I t is critical that the WWCs should select and recruit qualified procurement experts in the TSUs prior to loan
effectiveness to enable them to be trained on Bank procurement procedures at the earliest possible date.
Training can either be carried in an institution that delivers training on procurement according to the Bank
procedures, or altematively to arrange for a training workshop to be delivered in Iran prior to loan
effectiveness.

While the above arrangements may develop the capacity o f staff, it is expected that there will be slow
implementation during the first year of the project. Experience inBank-financed projects in Iran has indicated
that slow procurement and l o w disbursements progress are expected inthe early phases o f projects. One o f the
major factors is the unfamiliarity o f project staff with Bank procurement procedures and especially interms of
ICBs and selection o f consultants. Training workshops provide knowledge opportunities to project teams but
do not totally address the problem as a long term hands-on approach is required. The Bank has agreed with the
Government on recruiting a long term individual expert under the project for 18 months-period to assist the
TSUs in all the stages o f the procurement process while providing regular training to staff, This will ensure a
consistent effort at capacity buildingthat will gradually enable the TSUs to fully takeover the responsibility o f
the management o f the procurement process by the end o f this expert assignment. The TOR for this consultant


                                                         62

  have been prepared and the Government has requested the assistance o f the Bank in identifying a short list o f
  qualified consultants.
  Based on the above identified weaknesses and the proposed mitigation measures, the overall project risk for
  procurement is deemed to be substantial. This can be lowered during the first 12 months o f the project by
  implementingthe above capacity buildingarrangements.


  C. ProcurementPlan

  A procurement plan for the project implementation has been developed and providing the basis for the
  procurement methods. This plan has been updated and agreed between the Borrower and the Project Team
  duringappraisal. Itwill be made available at the offices o fthe two WWCs inthe provinces andat NWWEC.It
  will also be available inthe project's database and inthe Bank's extemal website. The Procurement Plan will
  be updated annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
  institutional capacity.

  D. Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

  Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, it is proposed to carry one
  annual supervision missions to visit the field to carry out post review o f procurement actions.

                                Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
           IRAN: NORTHERNCITIES WATER SUPPLY & SANITATION PROJECT


A. Economic Analysis

Methodology

This analysis is based on the assessment of the economic values o f the benefits and costs o f the Project, using
the cost-benefit methodology. The project comprises eight sub-projects, a water and a wastewater project for
each o f the four cities, which should be assessed separately on the basis o f their individual economic
profitability. Since the Project period is relatively short (2005-2010), the analysis extends over a longer period
(2005-2029), which parallels the planning horizon o f the country's water and wastewater development
programs. Both benefits and costs are projected for this longer period.

Water investment components:

Benefits o f water components: The targeted population will derive benefits from the Project that will be equal
at least to the cost of altemative means o f meeting its water needs. Without the Project a large number o f
households would not be connected to the water distribution system and supply capacity would fall short o f an
ever expanding population. In this hypothetical situation some households would be deprived o f pipe water
and would need to rely on altemative sources o f supply. The major benefit o f the Project i s therefore to avoid
the cost o f alternative supply, in addition to the hygiene and safety superiority o f pipe water as opposed to
water sought from other sources. The alternative to the project considered in this analysis is the purchase o f
water from vendors, the use of domestic wells is excluded because o f highwater tables inthose cities. The cost
that would be avoided thanks to the project is the cost o f water purchased from vendors to which should be
added the cost o f installing, operating and maintaining household storage tanks. These benefits are estimated
for the additional population that would be deprived from pipe water if the Project i s not implemented. It i s
important to stress that they should be considered as a minimumvalue o f the true benefits since they omit the
hygiene, quality and commodity advantages o f access to potable pipe water. An additional benefit i s that
households will generally consume much larger quantities o f water under the Project, given the grezter
accessibility and lower cost o fpipe water as opposed to vendors' water.

Cost o f the Project: The Project gives rise to two cost components, investment and O&M. These outlays are
adjusted so as to reflect economic as opposed to commercial values. Each investment component i s broken
down directly or indirectly inthe following factors: skilled labor, unskilled labor, capital and foreign exchange
if the inputs incorporated inthe component are tradable inputs. For this breakdown we relied on engineers'
judgments. Once taxes are deducted from the projected amounts o f investment, the net financial costs are
adjusted so as to reflect economic values. Accounting or shadow prices are used respectively for tradable
inputs and unskilledlabor. For tradables an exchange conversion factor i s used so as to allow for a premium on
foreign exchange over its official value. In the absence o f estimates on the shadow exchange rate for Iran, a
10%premium is assumed and a sensitivity analysis is introduced for this value in the simulations. Unskilled
labor receives wages in the public sector that are considered higher than its opportunity cost or shadow wage.
Lacking estimates for the latter, we use the reasonable assumption that the opportunity cost o f labor represents
80% o f the actual wage.

Regarding O&M cost, expenses are detailed for operating the treatment plants, broken down into maintenance,
energy, chemicals and labor. Economic prices are used instead o f prices paid by WWCs, particularly for
energy for which the real cost is much higher than the cost incurred. Iran's export price i s considered as the
economic price of energy.

 Wastewater investmentcomponents:

Benefits: The wastewater network is underdeveloped inthe Four Northern cities while both water tables, the
environment and health are threatened by the use o f absorption wells and the discharge o f wastewater in open
ditches and canals. Furthermore, as the population grows an increasing number o f households would have to
incur costs associated with digging and maintaining absorption wells. Given these pecuniary and non
pecuniary effects, the project is expected to generate for each city the following benefits: (i) avoidance o f cost
of absorption wells and their maintenance; (ii)   reduction in water-borne diseases and in their associated costs
of hospitalization, medication, loss o f workdays and school days; (iii)  reuse o f treated wastewater inirrigation
with the associated increase in agricultural value-added; (iv) increase in tourism activity in Anzali which is
considered as a highly popular summer resort; and (v) general improvements in the conditions o f immediate
neighborhoods and the environment ingeneral with the associated improvement inthe quality o f life.

The present analysis focuses on the types o fbenefits that can be quantified. This excludes benefit (v) which is
important but very difficult to quantify and takes the health benefit only partially into account because the
official information on water-borne diseases underestimates the real incidence o f he latter among the
population inthe four cities. The first type o f benefit [(i)]
                                                             i s estimated following the same methodology as for
water wells. This cost also turns out to dominant other benefit components. The health benefit is estimated o n
the basis of the number o f water-borne disease cases provided by the local health department and makes use,
alternatively o f the health results o f the socio-economic assessment. It is also based on estimates o f the
proportions o f hospitalized versus external patients, duration o f the sickness, cost o f hospitalization and
external care and o n assumptions concerning the opportunity cost o f labor (applied to the number o f work days
missed). The value o f treated wastewater reusedin imgation is assessed on the basis o f information (collected
for the Feasibility Studies) provided on water requirements, yields, crop prices and estimates o f differences in
yields between irrigated and rain-fed agriculture. Finally, for Anzali, the tourism benefit is estimated as the
additional value-added that this sector would generate following the induced increase inthe number o f summer
residents.

Cost o f the Project: The economic cost o f the wastewater sub-project o f each city i s assessed using the same
methodology o f economic prices as for water.



ESTIMATINGTHE I m SOFTHEPROJECTWATER COMPONENTSFORTHENORTHERN                                CITIES

The different steps and results obtained by applying this methodology are shown in tables (l),(3) and (4)
                                                                                                    (2),
of this annex respectively for Babol, Sari, Rasht and Anzali. Most o f the background information used i s
provided inthe feasibility studies that have been carried out for the four cities.

 Row (1): The connected population is the staring point for estimating the benefits o f the project. Babol and
 Sari have already reached a 100% connection rate and the number o f beneficiaries o f the Project will be the
same as the additional number o f inhabitants (row 2). Rasht and Anzali start with a connection rate o f over
90% and will reach full coverage duringthe Project's period.

Row (3): Annual increase inthe number o f connections. Without the Project new households (new subscribers)
would purchase storage tanks. Therefore, the new connections will equal the number o f new tanks that would
be installed each year. This number will grow with the population.

Row (4): Per capita water consumption per day. According to projections (Feasibility Studies), this quantity
will rise from about 140 in2005 to 150 1in2029, except inAnzali where starting consumption is lower than in
the other three cities.

 Rows (5) and (6): Annual cumulative increase in water consumption with and without the Project: The
 quantity in the situation without the Project represents the total quantity o f water that new households would



                                                         67

have to purchase from water vendors. This quantity will grow each period as the number o f households that
would be denied the benefits o f pipe water will increase. Obviously, per capita consumption will inthis case be
lower than if these households had access to W W C water. The present analysis makes the assumption that they
would buy only 75% o f what they would consume if they were connected.

Rows (7-a) - (7-c): Cost o f alternative source of water without the project: expenses on purchases o f water
from water vendors account for a major share of this cost while the other two components, cost o f storage
tanks and maintenance, have smaller values. Regional information collected inthe Feasibility Studies provides
estimates o f US$0.75 to 0.85 (6000 to 7000 Rials) per cum o f water purchased from vendors.

Rows (8) - (10): Adjusted costs o f the Project: Costs are estimated at constant 2004 values. Therefore, they
don't include any adjustment for inflation. As previously stated, shadow prices for foreign exchange and labor
are used so as to reflect the opportunity cost for each o f these two inputs. As tables (1) to (4) show, total cost is
dominated by capital cost ininitial years while O&M cost rises as additional water supply increases.

Estimates o f IRR: For Babol the IRR i s estimated at 15% and N P V at $US 2.4 million in a base scenario in
which the cost values are those estimated in the Feasibility Studies without physical contingencies. IRR
remains relatively high even if total cost increases by 10% over initial projections, declining to 13% while
N P V drops to US$ million 1.5. Assuming a 10% cost increase and a decline o f benefits in the same
proportions as compared to the base scenario still yields a retum o f more than 11%. For the other cities the
retums are muchhigher, varying inthe base scenario from 26% inRasht to 36% in Sari and to 46% inAnzali.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the water sub-projects remain economically profitable even if costs are
reasonably higher and benefits reasonably lower than what is assumed inthe base scenario.

EstimatingIRR for the Projectwastewater components:

Tables (5) to (8) show the steps followed in estimating IRR and N P V for wastewater, respectively for Babol,
Sari, Rasht and Anzali. The approach is similar to that usedinthe analysis o f the water components. The base
scenario i s based on official figures for the incidence for water-borne diseases. The estimated I R R s are low,
with the exceptiono f Anzali for which IRRexceeds 11%.It shouldbe reminded that Anzali is a summer resort
located on the Caspian Sea which would become more attractive if untreated wastewater i s n o longer
discharged inthe lagoon. For the other cities !RR varies from 2% for Sari to 6% for Babol and 8% for Rasht.
Under the alternative scenario in which the health benefits are raised by      loo%,  an assumption that could be
justified by widespread underreporting of water-borne diseases, IRR increases to 8% for Rasht and 5% for
Sari while it reaches 7% for Babol. The results o f more extensive sensitivity analysis are shown intable 9. IRR
values are generally low but it should be reminded that the results do not take into account the significant
improvements inliving conditions that the Project is likely to generate, which is difficult to quantify.

Tariff Policy:

Like inother provinces, the WWCs of Mazandaran and Guilan do not have any independent power to set fees
or tariffs for connection to the water or wastewater networks or for water consumption. This power lies with
the National Economic Council which sets the pricing policy and the price adjustment scheme for the whole
country. The existing pricing system comprises connection rights, subscription fees and water consumption
tariffs inaddition to the house connection fees, which are bome upfront by customers. Fees and charges are set
and revised periodically by the National Economic Council, which is chaired by the President o f the Islamic
Republic o f Iran and includes heads o f several government departments.

 Connection rights are supposed to cover the cost o f the distribution network, including reservoirs. They are
 based on dwelling size and a city adjustment coefficient that depends on several factors, mainly on the cost o f
 water supply and population density. The formulas for calculating connection fees are very similar across the
 WWCs. In 2002 the following formula was applied or water: Y = (0.0015X2          + 1000)*1.91*a*X, where Y is
 the connection fee, X is the size o f the dwelling and "a" is the city coefficient which depends on population
 density and the relative cost o f water supply.

 For water average connection fees are approximately US$300 for the whole country, less for Mazandaran and
 Guilan, and the minimum fee is equal to about US$150. For wastewater, the connection fee,is the same as
 that for water with a few exceptions such as the cities o f Rasht and Anzali in Guilan where the wastewater fee
 i s set at 90% o f that for water. For Mazandaran wastewater connection rights are only 70% o f the fees for
 water connections. These fees have been regularly raised since 1999, and up to 2004, at a rate equal to at least
 10% with the exception o f the year 2000 in which the fee was increased by 15%. Inaddition to connection
 fees, the WWCs charge the customer the full cost for house connection which averages about US$80.

 Regarding water consumption, the current system is based on a fixed fee that depends only on the size o f the
 connection pipe and on the type o f customer (household or other types), and on a volumetric charge based on
 increasing block-tariffs. The fixed fee, or the subscription fee, is about 2000 Rials (25 US#) for most
 domestic customers. It amounts to about 2.0 US#/m3 in Guilan, 2.6 US US#/m3in Mazandaran against an
 average for all o f Iran equal to 1.8 US#/m3(Table-9). For the volumetric charges the current tariff structure i s
 based on complex formulas. The formula used is the same for all WWCs and there is no volumetric charge if
 consumption falls below 5 m3per month. Above this minimum, prices increase with the level o f consumption
 and generally vary across companies. The average volumetric tariff for the country i s estirnated at about 7.3
 US# in 2004 and it vaned from 2.4 US# for month1 consumption below 20 m', to about 5.5 US# and 14.2
 US# respectively for 20-40 and for more than 40 m o f monthly consumption (Table-9). Average prices are
                                                          Y
 lower in Guilanand Mazandaran, reaching 6.0 and 5.8 US# respectively in 2004. According to estimates o f
 cost provided byNEWWC, the volumetric charges covered in2004 less than half o f total cost o f water supply
 inGuilan, 60% inMazandaran and 67% inthe whole country.

Average rates have been raised in proportions varying between 23% and 8% since 1999, the lowest increase
being recorded in2003 and 2004 (Table-10). This moderate is below the inflation rate which averaged about
16% in recent years. The Economic Council differentiates between what it considers as low consumption,
which varies from one city to another and lies inthe range o f 20 to 25 m3per month, and higher consumption.
Tariffs for the second category have been raised by at least twice as much in relative terms than for the first
category (Table-10).

However, new measures introduced in the system have given conflicting signals as to the direction the tariff
structure is taking. On the one handtariffs have been raised in greater proportions for lower than for higher
consumption brackets. In addition to the regular increases, the Council introduced since 2001 a penalty or
surcharge for consumption exceeding a certain volume varying across cities in the range o f 18 to 25 m3per
month. This penalty was set for the year 2002 at 100% of the tariff given by the formula for consumption
above the cut-off volume. It has been raised to 150% in 2003 and to 200% in 2004. These changes are thus
widening the tariff gap between low and high consumption brackets. On the other hand the Council set lower
and upper bounds for tariffs, defined with respect to average cost. In 2003 the lower bound was set at one
third and the upper bound at three times the average cost. Moreover, and inspite o f these increases, revenues
from water sales, and from wastewater when applicable, barely cover operation and maintenance cost inmost
cases.

The rate structure is needlessly complex for both volumetric rates and connection fees. Volumetric tariffs are
based on complex formulas that differ across consumption brackets and WWCs. Because o f this complexity
the tariff structure lacks transparency. Moreover, the structure is such that rates increase by more than
threefold when consumption rises from 20 m3or less to slightly higher volumes. This sharp change may not be
an issue under the existing system inwhich tariffs are generally low but deserves to be reviewed under a new
framework in which tariffs would be based on costs and rebalanced between consumption brackets. It i s
important to stress in this regard that 15 to 20 m3o f water consumed per month represents non negligible
quantities whichshould not be associated with low income households under a cost-based tariff system. As the
distribution o f households across consumption brackets shows (Table-1 l), 44% o f all customers belong to the
water consumption bracket o f less than 20 m3per month while the poverty headcount i s less than one half o f
this proportion. The system is even more complex and less transparent for connection rights. Given these
complexities and inappropriate targeting, reform is needed in order to address the main objectives o f cost
recovery, efficiency, transparency and equity.

 Regarding sewage bills they are currently levied and collected only in city neighborhoods where a network
 exists based on the water bills (70% o f the latter). Since these services have been very limited, or practically
 non-existent, the need has not yet been felt by the WWCs to assess the costs involved. As these services
 develop costs should be assessed separately from water so as to evaluate the appropriateness o f the existing
 tariff structure.

 All these shortcomings point to the need for a consistent and comprehensive tariff reform. Aware of this
 need, the Government appointed a working group to that effect. However, a decision has been made by the
 Economic Council to freeze all tariffs and other fees in 2005. Inaddition, the minimumand maximum tariffs
 rule (113 o f the average cost for the minimum and three times for the maximum) has been cancelled. The
 government is offering to compensate for the foregone income for the WWCs resultingfrom these decisions.
 Nevertheless, this policy is not sustainable inthe long-run.

Since most urban households are already connected to the water network and only a few are connected to a
sewerage network that is yet to be constructed inmost cases, the issues o f willingness to pay and affordability
o f connection rights may arise. Inorder to ease the burden the government has facilitated household access to
bank credit for this purpose. For water consumption, a guidingobjective i s to gradually narrow the block rate
spread, which i s too wide under the existing system, to move ultimately to a unique cost-based tariff system
and to provide income subsidies to the poor. This implies that the tariff reform, along with significant
improvements inproductivity and inthe management o f these companies, should aim at reducing the working
ratio towards the 75% target. The principles stated inthe FourthFYDP are sound and go inthe right direction
o f an efficiency based tariff policy. Guided by these principles, a comprehensive and consistent reform should
replace the inconsistent piecemeal approach o f recent years.

E.FinancialSituation and Sustainability


I. ProjectFinancialCost-BenefitAnalysis
The financial analysis compares the project costs with the project benefits.          All costs and benefits are
expressed in current terms and are incremental in nature, valued as the difference between the costshenefits
"with the project" and "without the project".     The analysis was camed out over the period o f the average
expected life o f the investments o f 25 years. The detailed financial analysis o f each WWCs in this Annex
presents the present values (PVs) o f the financial flows and the NPVs and FRR for Guilan and Mazandaran,
respectively.
For the financial benefits, the WWCs will have the increased sales revenue due to the ability to meet increased
demand at a higher tariff implemented to meet the financial targets agreed to and the cost savings due to
reductions inwater losses. On the cost side, the WWCs will have the outlays for the project's capital cost and
capital investments beyond the project period estimated in the feasibility studies, the increased salary and
utility costs due to the project and the increasedmaintenance spending as estimated inthe financial forecast.

11.      FinancialAssessment of the Water andWastewater Companies (WWCs)
This Annex presents a detailed assessment o f the two WWCs, including the impact on the tariff based on
different scenarios for the financing o f the investment costs and level o f cost recovery achieved. The analysis
below covers the past, current and future financial performance o f the WWCs. The financial year for the
WWCs ends on March 20.


Past andCurrent PerformanceofMazandaranWWC
Based on audited accounts for the past four years, the Mazandaran W W C has been incurring net losses which
are projected to continue inthe year ending March 20,2005. Operating income before depreciation and interest
has beenpositive resulting ina working ratio (operating expenses excluding depreciation and interedoperating
revenue) below 1. However, spending on maintenance has been insufficient in the past (on average 1.1% o f
gross fixed assets, whereby industry standard is around 2.5-3%), which makes the achieved working ratio o f
0.75 in 20021'03 and 0.97 in 2003104 underestimated. Depreciation represents a significant expense to the
WWC, reaching 33% o f total revenue in2003/04.

The financial performance o f the company is further aggravated by highwater losses resulting ina much larger
need for water to pass through the system than is billedfor. Water losses have deteriorated over the years from
were 21.7% in 1999100 and to about 30.8% in 2003/04. The company's collection performance has been
relatively good over the past years, and has increased over the past years from 92% in 2000/01 to 97% in
2003/04. As a result the company's accounts receivable are also relatively low and equaled 3.6 months o f
billings in2003104.

FutureFinancialPerformanceof MazandaranWWC
Projections to assess Mazandaran's fbture financial position and performance have been carried out for the
period 2005/6-2014115. The projections have been prepared based on assumptions summarized inthis Annex.
Detailed assumptions are recorded inthe Project Files.

The projections for the future financial performance have been anchored by the financial targets agreed
between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank during their sector strategy discussions in September
2003. The main financial targets comprise the following:


     m.
     .   Working ratio o f 0.75 by the financial year 2009/10 (operating expenses excluding depreciation and
         interestioperating revenue).
         Labor productivity reaching 3 by project completion (expressed as number o f staff per 1,300 water
         connections).


                                                        81

     .
     1   Accounts receivables reduced to 4 months by 2009/10.
         Unaccounted for water to reach 27% by 20091'10.

The targets aim to gradually improve the financial and operational performance o f the W W C by achieving cost
recovery o f O&M, and part o f capital investment. Meeting these targets will require increases in the water
tariff, but will also depend on simultaneous improvements in collection performance and a significant
reduction inwater losses.

The analysis considers a base scenario whereby the financial targets agreed are achieved under the following
financing arrangement: Part o f water supply investment is financed by a loan, while the rest o f water supply
and all wastewater investment are financed by connection fees and the Government. The analysis shows that,
through 54,000 new water connections and 32,300 new wastewater connections, Mazandaran would be able to
contribute 183 billion k a l s (US20.8 million) to the financing o f the project from new connections. This is
based o n a water charge (connection and installation fee) o f 1.9 million Rials and a wastewater charge o f 2.3
million Rials.

A second scenario which analyzes the impact on the tariff if full cost recovery is to be achieved has also been
included. As illustrated in Table 1below, the base and the reference scenarios have different impact on the
performance o f the Mazandaran WWC.            Accounting for the freeze in tariff increase imposed by the
government for the financial year o f 2005/06, the tariff increase in year 2006107 would be significant and
would reach 123% for the base scenario. After this year it would fall to around 23% for the rest o f the project
implementation period. However, a net deficit would be incurred to the company because what remains from
the revenues once operating expenses are covered is still insufficient to cover depreciation and financial
charges  .

                             Table 1: Mazandaran Tariff Increase Requirements

                                       2005106 2006107     2007108       2008109     2009110        Total
Working ratio                           0.95       0.90      0.85          0.80       0.75
Increase intariff required (%)
to meet agreed targets                   0%     123.1%      25.4%        24.0%       20.5%      Average: 33%

Increase intariff required (%)
for full cost-recovery                   0%     169.3%      21.2%         17.3%      12.4%     Average: 33.9%


An important issue is that in both cases Mazandaran would generate a positive cash flow position. This is
achieved in part by maintaining the overall collection performance o f about 95% by the end o f the project
implementation period (2009/10) while simultaneously making provisions for doubtful revenue of its billings
andwriting off arrears that are unlikely to be collected.

Assumptions for projections of financial performance of Mazandaran WWC
The analysis is based on actual audited results for the years 1999/00-2003/04 and company estimates for
2004/05. The projections cover the years 2005/06-2014/15. The project implementation period is 2005/06-
2009/10.

Key Assumptions for financial statements
Water demand                    i s assumed to be increasing at the average rate o f 2% per year as o f 2005/06
                                (Source: company).

Water connections               are assumed to be increasing at the rate o f 3% per year as o f 2005/06 (source:
                                company), adding 54,000 new water connections between 2005106 and 2009/10.




                                                        82

Sewerage connections   the very low number o f sewerage connections in Mazandaran are assumed to be
                       increasing at an average rate o f 92% per year as o f 2005106 (source: feasibility
                       study), adding 32,300 new connections between 2005106 and 2009110.

Water tariff           Base scenario: is assumed to be increasing as required to meet the financial
                       targets agreed to between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank (by
                       2009110 a working ratio of 0.75, accounts receivables reducedto 4 months, labor
                       productivity o f 3 staff per 1,000 connections and unaccounted for water reduced
                       to 27%). The water supply components are assumed to be provided partly as a
                       loan to the company. The Government i s assumed to cover the cost o f water
                       components not covered by the Bank loan or connections fees as well as the cost
                       o f the sanitation components excluding connection fees.

Sewerage charge        the charge for disposal o f wastewater is calculated as a coefficient o f the water
                       sales and varies with consumer category. In Mazandaran, consumers with a
                       connection pay for this service regardless ifthere is a waste water treatment plant
                       inoperation or not (Source: company, auditedaccounts)

Water losses           include technical and non-technical losses and were 30.8% in 2003104 (source:
                       company). Losses are estimated to have been reduced to 29% in 2004105 and
                       are estimated to reduce gradually towards 27% by 2009110 as agreed between
                       the Government o f Iran and the World Bank (Source: strategy discussions)

Water resources        91% are assumed to come from wells and 9% from springs.

Water Production       comprises water requirements to meet demand plus losses; production i s reduced
                       over lifetime o f project, as losses are reduced faster than demand grows.

Water cost             Mazandaran pays a water right to the Regional Water Board for the wells. The
                       cost was 22.6 Rialslm3 in 2003104 and is assumed to increase at the rate o f
                       inflation (Source: NWWEC)

Financial Statement
Domestic inflation     i s assumed to be 16%per year as o f 2004105

Revenues               there are 4 sources o f revenues for the company: water sales, water fixed
                       subscription fee, disposal o f sewerage and sewerage fixed subscription fee

Subscription fees      60,500 Rialslsubscriber for water and sewerage (source: feasibility study). The
                       fee is assumed to increase by 0% in 2005106 and 10% per year thereafter
                       (source: Government law freezing utility tariff increases for the year 2005106 and
                       limitingutility tariff increases to 10%).

One time Government    subsidygiven by the government in 2005106 to offset the one time tariff
Subsidy                freeze imposedby law for that year.

Salaries               are assumed to increase with the rate o f inflation, 16% per year

Project salaries       project is assumed to require an additional workforce o f 486 people at a cost o f
                       12,285 million Rials. (Source: feasibility study). It is assumed that they are
                       hired gradually over 2005106 (50%) and 2006107 (100%).           The salary cost is
                       assumed to increase with the rate o f inflation

Electricity              assumed to vary according to production volume and the tariff, 40 RialskWh in
                         2004105, i s assumed to increase by 10% per year (Source: Government law
                         limiting utility tariff increases to lo%), except for the first year where utility
                         tariffs have been frozen by the Government.

Project electricity      additional electricity requirements due to project are estimated at 30,555,300
                         kWhper year in Sari and Babol. The additional electricity needs are expected to
                         mature gradually reaching 100% in 2009/10. (Source: feasibility study). Tariff
                         o f 40 RialskWh in 2005/06 is assumed to increase by 10% per year (Source:

Chemicals                assumed to vary according to production volume and increase by the rate o f
                         inflation.

Project chemicals        additional chemicals due to the project are estimated at a value o f 1,491 million
                         Rials per year (Source: feasibility study) and are expected to reach 100% by
                         2009/10. The cost increases by the rate o f inflation thereafter.

Maintenance              assumed as a percentage o f gross fixed assets (GFA) and assumed to increase
                         gradually towards 2.5% o f GFA by 2009/10 (Source: industry practice)

Subcontracting           this is for meter reading and assumed to increase with the rate o f inflation
                         (Source: NWWEC).

Other                    costs include rental o f buildings, utility services for administration, vehicles, etc.

                          depreciate over 25 years on average.

Financial charge          comprises interest payments on borrowings.           The only debt assumed to be
                          serviced is the World Bank loan to the Government o f Iran, which has been
                         passed onto the W W C at the cost o f borrowing. An average interest rate o f
                          5.35% has been assumed in the projections based on a 10-year forecast o f
                          LIBOR and the World Bank spread. A commitment fee of 0.75% less a 0.5%

Pastand Current Performanceof GuilanWWC
Based on audited accounts for the past five years, Guilan W W C has been incurring significant net losses which
are projected to continue inthe year ending March 20,2005. Operating income before depreciation and interest
has been negative resulting in a working ratio (operating expenses excluding depreciation and
interest/operating revenue) above 1. Inaddition, spending on maintenance has been insufficient inthe past (on
average 2% o f gross fixed assets, whereby industry standard is around 2.5-3%), making the current high
working ratio o f 1.15 underestimated. Depreciation represents a significant expense to the WWC, reaching
39% o f total revenue in2003/04.

The financial performance o fthe company is further aggravated byhighwater losses resulting ina muchlarger
need for water to pass through the system than is billed for. Water losses were estimated at about 34.8% in
2003/04.    The company's collection performance i s relatively good, at the end o f 2003/2004 accounts
receivable stood at the equivalent o f about 6 months o f billing. In 2003104 the company's collection ratio
stood at about 105%, indicating that the company has been able to collect some o f its past due amounts.

FutureFinancialPerformanceof GuilanWWC

Projections to assess Guilan's future financial position and performance have been carried out for the period
200516-2014115.     The projections have been prepared based on assumptions summarized in this Annex.
Detailed assumptions are recorded inthe Project Files.

These projections take into account the recent government decision to freeze utility tariffs to the end user for
the financial year o f 2005/06 while providing a subsidy to offset the lack o f tariff increase inthis period.

The projections for the future financial performance have been anchored by the financial targets agreed
between the Government of Iran and the World Bank during their sector strategy discussions in September
2003. These main financial targets comprise the following:

     1   Working ratio o f 0.75 by the financial year 2009110 (operating expenses excluding depreciation and
         interestloperating revenue).

     1   Labor productivity reaching 3 by project completion (expressed as number o f staff per 1,000 water
         connections).
     .
     1   Accounts receivables reduced to 4 months by 2009110.
         Unaccounted for water to reach 27% by 2009110.


The targets aim to gradually improve the financial and operational performance o f the W W C by achieving cost
recovery o f O&M, and part of capital investment. Meeting these targets will require increases in the water




                                                         86

tariff, but will also depend on simultaneous maintenance o f high level of collection performance and a
significant reduction inwater losses.

The analysis considers a base scenario whereby the financial targets agreed are achieved under the following
financing arrangement: part o f water supply investment is financed by a loan, while the rest o f water supply
and all wastewater investment are financed by connection fees and the Government. The analysis show that
through 41,780 new water connections and 97,000 new wastewater connections, Guilan would be able to
contribute about 352 billion Rials (US$40 million) to the financing o f the project from new connections. This
i s based on a water charge (connection and installation fee) o f 2.3 million Rials, and a wastewater charge o f
2.86 million Rials.

A second scenario, which analyzes the impact on the tariff if full cost recovery is to be achieved, has also been
included. As illustrated in Table 2 below, the base and the reference scenarios have different impact on the
performance o f the Guilan WWC. Accounting for the freeze intariff increase imposed by the govemment for
the financial year of 2005106, the base scenario requires a significant tariff increase in year 2006107 o f about
100%.      After this year the required increase would fall to about 29% during the rest o f the project
implementation period, subsequently falling further to around 10%. However, a net deficit would be incurred
to the company because o f what remains from the revenues once operating expenses are covered i s still
insufficient to cover depreciation and financial charges.

InGuilan, the collectionperformance has beenrelatively good inthe past with overall collectionrates reaching
as highas 105% in 2003/04 and 93% the year before, indicating that the company's campaigns on collections
a d enforcement by special agents is starting to pay-off in terms o f collecting arrears. To meet the financicl
targets agreed upon, the company will have to maintain this high collection rate, while making provisions for
doubtful revenues. It has been agreed that an action planwill be prepared to increase the collection o f arrears,
and, where appropriate, write-off customer debts that are unlikely to be collected. It i s important to note that
under both scenarios analyzed, Guilan will have to make extra efforts to manage its working capital inorder to
 avoid negative cash flow incertain years.

Assumptionsfor proiectionsof financialperformanceof GuilanWWC
The analysis is based on actual audited results for the years 1999/00-2003/04 and company estimates for
2004/05. The projections cover the years 2005/06-2014/15. The project implementation period i s 2005106-
2009/10.

 Key Assumptionsfor financialstatements
 Water demand                  is assumed to be increasing at the average rate o f 2% per year as o f 2005106
                               (Source :company).

 Water connections             are assumed to be increasing at the rate o f 3% per year as o f 2005/06 (source:
                               company), adding 41,780 new water connections between 2005106 and 2009110.

Sewerage connections   are assumed to be increasing at an average rate o f 9.4% per year as o f 2005106
                       (source: feasibility study), adding 97,000 new connections between 2005106 and
                       2009/10.

Water tariff           Base scenario: is assumed to be increasing as required to meet the financial
                       targets agreed to between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank (by
                       2009/10 a working ratio o f 0.75, accounts receivables reducedto 4 months, labor
                       productivity o f 3 staff per 1,000 connections and unaccounted for water reduced
                       to 27%). The water supply components are assumed to be provided partly as a
                       loan to the company. The Government is assumed to cover the cost o f water
                       components not covered by the Bank loan or connections fees as well as the cost
                       o f the sanitation components excluding connection fees.

Sewerage charge        the charge for disposal o f wastewater is calculated as a coefficient o f the water
                       sales and varies with consumer category.            In Guilan, consumers with a
                       connection pay for this service regardless ifthere is a waste water treatment plant
                       inoperation or not (Source: company, audited accounts)

Water losses           include technical and non-technical losses and were 34.8% in 2003/04 (source:
                       WWC). Losses are estimated to be have been reduced to 34.1% in 2004/05 and
                       are estimated to reduce gradually towards 27% by 2009/10 as agreed between
                       the Government o f Iran and the World Bank (Source:           Water and Sanitation
                       Strategy)

Water resources        46% are assumed to come from wells and 45% are from the Sephidrood river
                       and 9% from springs.

Water Production       comprises water requirements to meet demand plus losses.              Production is
                       reduced over lifetime o f project, as losses are reduced faster than demand grows.

Water cost              Guilan pays a water right to the Regional Water Board for abstraction from both
                       the Sephirood river and groundwater. The cost was 66.8 Rials/m3 in 2003/04
                       and is assumed to increase at the rate o f inflation (Source: NWWEC)

                       passed onto the WWC at the cost o f borrowing. An average interest rate o f
                        5.35% has been assumed in the projections based on a 10-year forecast o f

PART A. EnvironmentalImpact Assessment

Two environmental impacts assessment reports were prepared during project preparation: one covering the
Guilan province investments and the other for the Mazandaran province. These reports have been disclosed at
the World Bank InfoShop on March 11, 2005. This Annex summarizes the findings and recommendations o f
both reports.

Background

'The environmental baseline conditions were investigated within this study area and for adjacent areas that
could potentially be affected by the project. Baseline information has been quantified - to the extent possible-
within three main topic areas: physical, biological and socio-economic.

The major source o f water inRasht and Anzali i s surface water. There %retwo rivers flowing inRasht; Zarjoob
(Siahrood) River and Goharood River, which join to form a main river called Syghlanroodbar (Pirbazar),
which discharges into Anzali Lagoon and eventually into the Caspian Sea. The two rivers are mostly used for
irrigation purpose. Based on 25 years o f records the annual average flow at the Guilan Regional Water
Authority bridge in Zarjoob river is 5.73 m3/second. As for Goharood the annual average of the flows
measured at Lakan i s 1.08 m3/sec based on 10 years o f measurements. Both rivers are highlypolluted as they
receive considerable wastewater discharges and pollutants from other sources such as solid wastes, or
agricultural runoff. The available data on the water quality o f these rivers confirm the deteriorating quality of
the rivers where the BOD5 levels inboth rivers measured up to 30 mg/l when the normal level for clean rivers
should be less than 1 mg/l and DO levels measured as low as 1.8 mg/l when DO saturation concentration i s
around 10mg/l.

The other important river is Sephidrood, the main source o f drinking water for Rasht and Anzali city. This
river however only crosses through part o f the project area and runs to the north east. Sephidrood river quality
at Sangar WTP intake is typically turbid with high TSS and TDS, however generally i t is compliant with
Iranian drinking water quality standards. As for the groundwater in the area o f influence o f the project, it
comprises a smaller part o f the water supply system. Generally each well has 20 to 30 l/sec capacity. The water
supply wells o f Emamzadeh Hashem, and Sangar are locatedto the south east o f the Rasht city and generally
have good water quality.

Anzali i s characterized by numerous short rivers (rogas), which eventually discharge to Anzali Lagoon; among
which i s Pirbazar Roga, which originates from the two rivers o f Rasht city. Some o f these rivers convey
domestic sewage originated by the communities discharging into them. The sum total of the surface water that
enters Anzali Lagoonis 2,400 millionm3/year.

-4nzali Lagoon, the most prominent environmental feature in the project area, is listed as a `wetland o f
international importance' under the 1971 Ramsar Convention due to its importance as a natural wetland
characteristic o f the southern Caspian lowlands, and as such, supports an extremely diverse wetland flora and
fauna. This Lagoon is located on the South West o f the Caspian Sea and is connected to the sea through a
channel called Ghazian. The current total area o f the wet land, covering both lagoon and the marshland is 193
km2.The lagoon itself is around 80 km2with average of depth ranges o f 1to 3 m. The wetlands include two
wild life refuge areas, two protected areas, and four no hunting areas. The site has been placed on the Ramsar
Montreux Record o f priority sites for conservation action since December 1993, due to environmental

degradation: the diminishingareas o f the wetland and the lagoon, the excessive growth o f reed beds, decreased
production o f fish quantities, and the eutrophication which is causing excessive water fem growth. According
to a recent major study by Japanes Intemational Cooperation Agency (JICA) on the integrated management o f
the lagoon's ecosystem, the lake is eutrophic at several locations as confirmed by measurements o f chemical
oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) in five locations o f the lagoon. According to this study, the
major adverse effects on the wetland are arising from the watershed, while other adverse effects were
attnbuted to activities within the wetland. Adverse effects from the watershed to the wetland are as follows:
(1) inflow o fpollutedwater; (2) inflow and dumping o f garbage; (3) inflow o f sediment; and (4) changes o fthe
water level o f the Caspian Sea. Of these factors, the inflow o f polluted water is seen as a significant factor due
to the discharge o f organic loads, which cause oxygen depletion, and the discharge o f nutrients (nitrogen and
phosphorus) which cause excessive algal growth and thus eutrophic conditions. The main contribution o f
polluted water comes from urban domestic wastewater, o f which the discharge o f Rasht and Anzali cities
represent 83% o f the total. The long term level changes in the Caspian Sea are the main cause for salinity
changes inthe Anzali lagoon, which has adverse impacts on its aquatic ecosystem.

There is one industrial city 25 km south o f Rasht and two large industrial complexes 10 km away from Anzali
City. These industrial cities will include a number o f industry types and will produce different wastewater
qualities. However, these industries will not be connected to the proposed sewerage system, but will have their
own central treatment facility, which will be monitored by the Department of Environment (Guilan office).
Nevertheless, there are scattered small size industries in both cities. These industries include soft dnnks,
canning, chemicals, dairy, and slaughterhouse. In Rasht there are 17 industries producing 355 m3/day o f
wastewater, with only 7 generating more than 10 m3/day, whereas in Anzali there are only four industries.
According to current policy that limits the operation o f industries to rural surroundings o f a city, no further
industrial development within the urban areas o f the cities is expected. Furthermore, existing legislation
provides for the control o f industrial discharges which are monitored by the Department o f Environment

Agricultural areas are dispersed around Rasht and Anzali, with the majority located outside the urban areas.
Rice cultivation is the predominant agricultural activity in the region, using over 90% o f the cultivated areas.
Other crops include cereals, fruits and tea plantations. Present irrigation sources include natural rainfall,
supplemented occasionally by river water.

Although both Rasht and Anzali cities are among the oldest cities innorth Iran, yet there are n o structures or
remains o f any archeological or historical significance according to the Cultural and Heritage Department,
Guilan.

Impactsof the ProposedInvestment in Guilan

The environmental assessment indicated that the execution of the project will have long term positive
environmental impacts in terms of reducing pollution of natural resources, generation o f significant
economical, social and public health benefits,         and will enable the government to enforce existing
environmental regulations and standards.

'The investment plan (through the 2027 horizon) and specifically the first phase (2005-2010) components (the
Project) will extend and rehabilitate water networks to ensure 100% water supply coverage, provide good
quality water on a continuous basis, caters for population growth and to reduce unaccounted for water.
Besides, it will improve health conditions o f the population by providing them with adequate water quantity
and quality from sustainable sources.

The provision o f wastewater collection and treatment facilities will have a strong long term positive effect on
the overall environment and onpublic health conditions. There will be improvement inthe water quality inthe
streams and rivers that flow throughout Rasht city. A major benefit o f the project is the protection of
groundwater resources from contamination by untreated sewage, and the elimination o f direct sewage
discharge to the Caspian Sea from Anzali City. Furthermore, by eliminating the direct discharge o f raw sewage
from Rasht and Anzali cities, the project will substantially reduce the current organic and nutrient loads that


                                                        137

are originating from urban centers on Anzali Lagoon, and will thus address one o f the major environmental
problems affecting Anzali Lagoontoday.

The investment plan will not cause any threat to the natural habitats o f the project area. By implementing the
all the components of the plan the ecological conditions o f the surface water bodies in the project area will
improve. Therefore, the plan will assist inthe restoration o f the degraded water quality o f Anzali wetlands and
hence contribute positively to the conservation o f natural habitats. As a result o f the project, economic benefits
will occur interms of increased water volume o f good quality, increased tourism activities, and lower medical
costs associated with treating water-borne diseases. Finally, the wastewater treatment facilities will also
provide an opportunity to better control industrial discharges through enforcing pretreatment and connection to
the collection system as stipulated inthe Iranian law.

PotentialAdverse Impactsof the Project

Drinking Water Quantity and Quality: treated water quantity and quality should meet water demand as well as
allowable drinking water standards set by the Iranian Government and WHO. Among the parameters o f
concern are the bacteriological contamination of the water, the concentration level o f nitrate, the presence o f
nitrite and the concentration o f heavy metals. In order to safeguard public health, it is imperative that regular
monitoring o f raw and treated water at the treatment plants, storage reservoirs and inthe distribution network
be implementedto ensure that drinkingwater limits are not exceeded.

TreatedEffluent Quality: the treated effluent should be o f acceptable quality so that it can be safely discharged
into water bodies. This means that the effluent quality should meet the standards for discharge into water
bodies. One major concern is the concentration level o f nutrients such as ammonia, nitrate and phosphate
which could result inalgal growth inthe receiving water bodies. Regular monitoring o f these variables will be
requiredto ensure strict adherence to the prevailing standards.

Sludge Quality: Inthe case of driedsludge re-use by farmers as soil conditioner or fertilizer, the sludge quality
will have to comply with the WHO guidelines for the use o f sludge in agriculture including the limit o f less
than one intestinal nematode egg per 100 gm o f dry solids and the limits on the concentration o f heavy metals.
The adopted treatment processes, the one year storage period, and the control o f industrial discharges to the
sewage system would have to ensure +hatthe WHO nematode standard and the EU and FA0 guidelines o n the
level o ftoxic substances would not be exceeded for the use o f sludge inagriculture.

Other Impacts: Adverse environmental impacts during the construction phase might be significant, however
they are only temporary. Typical impacts are those o f dust, noise, traffic congestion, and disturbance to the
residents o f the area. Good construction practices would mitigate most o f these temporary impacts to
acceptable levels. Moreover, the project will have a positive impact on employment resulting from the
increased construction activities.

The project will have no significant long term negative impact on air quality, climate, biological environment,
socio-economic conditions, or other development projects.

Insummary, once operational, most of the impactsofthe Projectwillbepositive.


EnvironmentalManagement Plan(EMP)

The EMP identifies feasible cost effective measures to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that might
occur during the construction and operation o f the project. The EMF covers mitigation measures, monitoring
and institutional strengthening.

Mitigation of Adverse Environmental Impacts

Mitigation measures have been identified to ensure that the defined objectives o f the project are achieved
whilst preventing and reducing any adverse environmental impacts.          The mitigation measures are to be
executed by the construction contractor (construction phase) and the treatment plant operators (operation
phase) with supervision by the GuilanWWC.

Water Quantity: Geological and hydrogeological studies and data acquired between 1953 to 1989 o f the
Sephidrood river and its basin, the main source of water supply for Rasht and Anzali, confirm that on average
the annual flow o f this river is 149 m3/sec at Roudabar upstream o f Sangar WTP. This flow and the 1,700
million m3capacity of Sefidrood dam, as well as the other groundwater sources and the water o f Shar Bijar
River are sufficient to meet the year 2027 maximum demand o f 8.3 m3/sec o f Central and East Guilan area,
which encompass the project area. The water balance for the study area during the first phase was prepared on
the basis o f the population figures (650,200 for the year 2004 and 746,700 for the year 2009), the maximum
water demand (188,051 m3/dand 211,249 m3/dfor the years 2004 and 2009 respectively) and the yield o f
wells and the treatment plant capacity at Sangar dam (see Table 3). The water balance indicates that the total
water resources will by far exceed the water demand of the project area during the first phase.

Water Quality: The Project i s expected to improve quality o f water in the rivers, Anzali Lagoon and the
Caspian Sea. The provision of a wastewater network for collecting and diverting the generated wastewater to
treatment plants will minimize potential bacteriological contamination o f ground water.       Furthermore, the
proposed project will finance    the regular monitoring o f water quality.   During project implementation, a
continuous monitoring program would be implemented to ensure that treated water would always meet the
required standards. The monitoring program will cover biological and physical parameters as well as heavy
metals and pesticides residues.

Effluent Quality: The proposed secondary treatment level is based on activated sludge process with provision
for nutrient control by the BNR system, which would ensure a treated effluent o f acceptable quality for
discharge in receiving water bodies. This process will result in the reduction o f BOD5,total nitrogen, total
phosphorus and fecal coliforms, to levels that are in accordance with prevailing standards. Emergency storage
o f raw wastewater for 24 hour is also provided to provide further mitigation measure for the protection o f
Anzali Lagoon from any upset in the treatment process. As soon as the wastewater treatment plants start
operating, monitoring of BODS,suspended solids, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and fecal coliforms, in the
influent and effluent will be conducted by the Guilan W W C to ensure adherence to the required standard. In
view o f the treated effluent quality, which will be in compliance with the prevailing standards for discharge to
water bodies, and the dilution effects of the rainy season, no adverse impacts are envisaged o n the rivers o f
Zarjoob and Goharood in Rasht and on Anzali lagoon and Rogas inAnzali. Infact, the environmental state o f
the rivers is expected to improve in comparison to the base condition due to improved water quality o f the
discharging rivers.

Sludge Quality:     The sludge treatment processes o f the two treatment plants include: sludge blending,
thickening, anaerobic digestion, and sludge dewatering. These processes will ensure the elimination o f toxics
and pollutants in the sludge. For the use of dried sludge in agriculture as soil conditioner or fertilizer, the
project will ensure compliance with applicable guidelines by monitoring the quality o f treated sludge and
ensuring a drying period of one year. During preparation, it was agreed that the treated sludge from the new
WWTPs will not be incinerated as originally planned but will be disposed over land after one year storage.
During the first year of implementation, it is expected that the Guilan WWC will present to the Bank a
environmental assessment o f the new sludge disposal option.

Industrial Discharges: The discharge of untreated industrial effluents can affect the performance o f the
wastewater treatment plants, resulting in a lower quality treated effluent. The project will only provide
connections to those industries that do not discharge toxics that affect the performance o f the wastewater
treatment plants. The discharge of industrial effluents will be subject to the approval o f both the Director o f
the treatment plant and the director of the Department of Environment (DOE). For those industries for which


                                                        139

their industrial effluents will not be pre-treated, andor will not be connected to the network, the DOE will
require that each polluting industrial establishment will prepare a compliance action plan (CAP), which will
address the pollutants o f concern, the type o f pre-treatment required and the investments and monitoring costs
o f the pre-treatment facility. Operational permits for these industries will be subject to the implementation o f
the CAP as yearly monitored by the Guilan W W C and enforced by the DOE.

Moreover, under the World Bank fimded sewage project for Tehran, standards for industrial effluent
discharged into sewage systems are beingdeveloped inclose coordination with DOE and other concerned line
ministries. These standards include the following industrial sectors: food, textiles, tanneries, pulp and paper,
metal, pharmaceutical and electronic industries as well as general standards for the remaining industrial sector.
Also, the DOE has promulgated standards for industrial discharges to surface waters. The project will ensure
compliance with all these standards, where applicable and the promulgation o f a national law for the discharge
o f industrial effluents to sewage networks.

Septage Handling: The project will include septage handling facilities at Rasht and West Anzali WWTP for
receiving the septage from on-site disposal facilities. The septage will be co-treated with the wastewater that i s
discharged to the plant from the collection network.

Other Issues: The general disruption during construction will be mitigated by coordinated planning o f
construction activities. This will include coordination with all concerned authorities prior to the start o f the
construction activities.    Other adverse impacts due to construction activities will be mitigated through the
adoption o f Good Environmental Practice Procedures. For instance noisy construction activities can be limited
to normal working hours andprovidingmuffler to minimize noise nuisance. Dust emissions can be avoided by
using dust suppression measures such as periodically sprinklingwater in certain areas, providing appropriate
covers and removal o f excess material from the site. Dangerous activities inpublic areas will be controlled to
reduce risk to the public, traffic and warning signs will be placed at construction sites, trenches will be
provided by fences, or railings. The construction contract document will incorporate all requirements to
minimize disturbance from construction activities, which will be monitored by the Supervision Engineer and
the Environment Officer o f the Guilan W W C to ensure compliance and implementation o f the required
provisions by the Contractor.

The final design process will detail and finalize construction drawings and tender documents o f the project
components. This process has incorporated final review o f the designs by environmental specialists to ensure
that all required environmental issues are properly addressed and tender documents include specific provisions
concerning environment, health, safety as well as the use o f archeological chance find procedures inthe event
that unknownarcheological andor historical sites are encountered inthe course o f construction.

Furthermore, pre-tender conferences will be held to brief pre-qualified contractors ox the effective
implementation o f mitigation measures. All pre-qualified contractors will be called to a pre-tender conference
at which environmental, health and safety issues will be outlined. Cultural heritage issues inRasht and Anzali
will be also addressed. The contractors will be briefed on: (i) findprocedures, (ii)
                                                                 chance                       special procedures to
be adopted in the vicinity o f sites defined as requiringprotection, (iii)penalties for non-compliance, and (iv)
coordination with concerned authorities.

Liaisonarrangements will be established between the public, contractors, and the Project Management Unit. A
procedure will be established to allow the general public to lodge complaints at the Project Management Unit
about excessive disturbance.

The contractors will provide suitable and reliable equipment for construction, with a formal maintenance
program to ensure efficient operations.      The Guilan W W C will develop and establish appropriate safety
procedures for the operation and maintenance o f the water and wastewater treatment plants. All employees o f
the contractors and the Guilan W W C will get suitable training in occupational health, safety, and emergency
preparedness procedures for earthquakes. Safety equipment will also be provided.



                                                         140

Odors emissions from the wastewater treatment plants will be minimized by the provision o f odor removal
equipment at Rasht WWTP, and            by careful planning and implementation o f the plant operation and
maintenance procedures at all treatment plants. Regular Odor emissions monitoring from the wastewater
treatment plants will be implemented to mitigate any non-compliance by taking appropriate operating
measures.

The G W W C will develop and implement monitoring programs for raw water, treated water, surface water, raw
wastewater, treated effluent and sludge and industrial discharges to the sewage.        The company will also
provide advisory services to industries.

The DOE will establish formal programs for monitoring discharges to the environment from the wastewater
treatment plants and industries, treated sludge, surface water, and soil including actions to be taken in case o f
non-compliance. It will use existing, update or will develop a system o f controls on discharges to Zarjoob and
Goharood rivers and Anzali Lagoon. DOEwill also develop a system for the enforcement o f standards related
to industrial discharges.

The Ministryo f Health and Medical Education will establish a program for monitoring drinking water quality
and the occurrence o f water-borne diseases. A public hygiene education campaign will be also conducted by
the Ministryincludingvideotapes, TV programs and distribution o f leaflets.

For sludge re-use programs, the Ministry o f Agnculture Jihad will establish and implement formal programs
for monitoring the quality of soil at the location o f application including actions to be taken in case o f
deterioration inquality.

Cost Estimate

The cost o f the Environmental Management Plan during construction (mitigation measures including
additional treatment and monitoring) will be borne mostly by the c,ontractor (construction phase) and the
Supervision Engineer who will make the necessary provision as part o f their contracts for this project. A total
amount o f 1,800,000 dollars has been allocated for the implementation o f the environmental management plan
and included inthe project cost.

Public Consultations

Numerous governmental and non-governmental organizations were consulted at various stages o f project
preparation. A t the initiation o f the project, technical, financial, environmental and social issues associated
with the project were discussed in meetings attended by the design Consultants, representative o f the City
councils, Rasht and Anzali municipalities, Guilan Regional Water Board and various other stakeholders.
Terms o f Reference for the EA studies were developed and shared with the key stakehclders in scoping
meetings, which were held as o f December 2002.

'The preparation process for the environmental assessment included public consultations which were carried
out at various stages. The consultations involved line ministries, city authorities, provincial departments o f
environment, operating water and wastewater companies, local communities, NGOs and the public.

Upon the completion o f the draft EA report, the executive summary was translated to Farsi and a public
hearing was held on the 12th and 13th o f January 2005. The meeting was attended by more than 250
participants from various organizations including representatives o f the Guilan WWC, local health authorities,
local law enforcement authorities, Guilan Regional Water Board, NGOs, Rasht municipality, Anzali
municipality, DOE o f Guilan, members o f the press, experts and professionals from the community o f Rasht
and Anzali. Invitation letters were prepared inFarsi and were accompanied with the draft Executive Summary.
Announcements about the meeting were also made through the local newspapers and public bulletin boards.
The meeting was covered by the local newspapers, television and radio. The meeting consisted o f an opening
session, a presentation o f the project financial arrangements and the current cooperation between the World


                                                        141

Bank and the Guilan WWC. This presentation was followed by a short documentary film which showed the
current status o f the water and wastewater services in the two cities and the ongoing works o f these facilities.
The film was followed by a presentation o f the project's major components and the environmental aspect o f
each component. The common view held was that the project should be implementedas soon as possible as it
would result in improved health and welfare benefits not only to Rasht and Anzali cities but for the whole
region.

The main concerns expressed by some o f the stakeholders were the environmental impacts o f the project,
particularly the effluent and sludge from the wastewater treatment plants. A university professor requested
clarification o n h o w the project will impact environmental state o f the local rivers and Anzali Lagoon, as well
as the Caspian Sea. I t was clarified that adequate design provisions have been incorporated to include
biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems within the wastewater treatment plants. This, together with the
proper collection and treatment o f wastewater inthe two cities, will improve the quality o f the local rivers, and
the lagoon, and will have a positive impact on the environment. A concern was raised regarding the proposed
disposal o f the sludge from the wastewater treatment plants and the reuse o f treated sludge in agnculture
considering the constraints and the health quality limits required by various standards. I t was clarified that the
design took into account sludge application rates, sludge and soil monitoring to address all the requirements o f
the national and international standards.

Mazandaran Province

Background

Both surface and ground water resources are used as source o f water for potable, industrial, and agncultural in
Sari and Babol regions. Presently, the major source o f potable water supplying in Sari and Babol is
groundwater.

One o f the important problems in Sari and Babol is the threat to public health caused by improper disposal o f
untreated wastewater and sludge. These conditions have caused the spread o f many water-borne infectious
diseases such as diarrhea. In addition, Sari and Babol are located in i!high tourist attractive province of Iran
and more than 10 millionvisitors travel annually to Mazandaranprovince.

Agncultural areas are dispersed outside and around Sari and Babol. The major amculture products inSari and
Babol are rice and citrus fruits. There are more than 100,000 ha and 80,000 ha agricultural lands in Sari and
Babol regions, respectively. Present irrigation sources include river water, wells and, springs. Chemical
fertilizers are widely usedinthe region.

There is a fault inthe region, which extends from Lahijan to Gorgan ina geological zone called Gorgan-Rasht
zone covering both Mazandaran and Guilan Province. Ths zone i s located inthe Northern part of a larger and
famous fault called Alborz fault. Another fault inthe project area is called Khazar fault, which is located inthe
South o f Sari and Babol.

Tajan and Espiroud are two rivers, which originate from Niz-Abad Mountain. They pass through Sari city, and
flow to the north to discharge in the Caspian Sea. The annual average flow in Tajan River measured at
Soleyman (upstream) and Kordkheyl (downstream) stations are 6.55 m3/secand 13.56 m3/sec respectively. The
water from the Tajan River i s used to irrigate farms and orchards.

During the past few years the water quality o f the Tajan and Espiroud rivers has deteriorated because o f
industrial discharges, agnculture drainage, and untreated wastewater discharges. The levels o f several water
quality parameters such as coliforms exceed the limits set for agnculture water use. Measurements taken for
five months for BOD5 and other quality parameters for the upstream and down stream stretches o f the Tajan
River demonstrate the pollution effect inthe river quality.




                                                        142

A number of industrial facilities are located in Sari, however only one dairy and one soft drink industry are
located within the project area. The volume o f wastewater produced by these industrial facilities is about 800
m3/dand bothhave pre-treatment wastewater facilities. According to current policy o f the Iranian Government
which limits the industries to rural areas, no hrther industrial development is expected within the City.
Furthermore, existing legislation control and limit industrial discharges to set standards. The monitoring o f
compliance with these standards is the responsibility o f the Department o f Environment responsibility.

There are two wildlife refuges: one is Semskzndeh located about 5 km towards south east o f Sari having area
o f 937 ha, 40 to 160 meters above sea level and the other one is Dasht-e-Naz locatedabout 42 kmnorth east o f
Sari with an area o f 55 hectare.

The proposed wastewater treatment plant is located in the northern part o f Sari city at distance o f 1 km from
the city. The nearest residential area is Oja village, which is located around 500 m away from the plant site.
The surroundings o f the plant are mainly agncultural areas with rice and citrus orchards that are irrigated from
the localrivers.

InBabol, Babolrood is the main river, which originates from Savadkoh Mountains, passing along Babol city
and flowing to north to discharge to the Caspian Sea. The annual average flow o fBabolroodRiver based on 47
years o f measurement i s 16.2 m3/sec. The river's water is used mainly for irrigation. The levels o f several
water quality parameters such as coliforms exceed the limits set for agnculture water use. Measurements taken
for [insert number] months for BOD5 and other quality parameters for the upstream and down stream stretches
o f Babol River, demonstrate the pollution, effect in the river quality. The use o f polluted water from the rivers
has had a number o f negative impacts on agnculture, soil, and health conditions.

Another river inBabol is Shazdehrood River, which i s a seasonal river. It flows inthe north o f Babol and close
to Babolsar city. Babol treated effluent will discharge to this river after disinfection. Presently, Shazdehrood
receive a considerable amount o f raw wastewater and agriculture drainage as well as solid wastes.

Two industrial towns are located around Babol city in the south and south west o f the city at a distance o f 26
and 23 kmdistance, respectively. However, there are no industrial institutions inthe project area.

Babol wastewater treatment plant, which is under construb:.tion, is located inthe North o f Babol city at o f 5 km
from the boundary o f Babol city. The nearest residential area is Amir- Kola, located at 500 mdistance from the
treatment plant. The surroundings of the plant are mainly agricultural areas with rice fields and citrus orchards,
which are irrigated mainly by the river's water.

Impactsof the ProjectInvestmentsinMazandaran

Similarly to the Guilan case, the environmental assessment indicated that the execution o f the project will have
long term positive environmental impacts in terms o f reducing pollution o f natural resources, generation of
significant economical, social and public health benefits, and will enable the government to enforce existing
environmental regulations and standards.

The long-term goal is to extend and rehabilitate water networks to ensure 100% water supply coverage, to
provide good quality water on a continuous basis, to cater for population growth and to reduce unaccounted for
water. Thus, the project (first phase of the long term plan) will improve the water supply to the households and
will reduce overdraft o f the water resources.

The provision of wastewater collection and treatment facilities will have a strong long-term positive effect on
the overall environment and on public health conditions. There will be improvement inthe water quality inthe
streams and rivers that flow throughout the project area. A major benefit o f the project is the protection of
groundwater resources from contamination by untreated sewage. As a result, economic benefits will occur in
terms o f increased water volume of good quality, increased tourism activities, and lower medical costs
associated with treating water-borne diseases.


                                                        143

It is worth noting that the design o f the treatment plants has taken into consideration the use of their by-
products (treated effluent and generated sludge) with the aim o f protecting the environment and the scarce
water resources. This will generate significant economic, social and health benefits and will enable the
Government to enforce the laws that prohibits discharging raw wastewater inthe environment.

Major PotentialAdverseImpacts of the Project

Drinking Water Quantitv and Oualitv: treated water quantity and quality should meet water demand as well as
allowable drinking water standards set by the Iranian Government. Among the parameters o f concern are the
bacteriological contamination of the water, the concentration level o f nitrate, and the concentration o f heavy
metals. Inorder to safeguard public health, it i s imperative that regular monitoring o f raw and treated water at
the treatment plants, storage reservoirs and inthe distribution network be implemented to ensure that drinking
water standards limits are not exceeded.

Treated Efnuent Quality:      the treated effluent should be o f acceptable quality so that it can be safely
discharged into surface water bodies. This means that the effluent quality should meet the standards for
discharge into surface water bodies. The other major concern is the concentration level o f nutrients such as
ammonia, nitrate, and phosphate, which could result inalgae growth inthe receiving water bodies. The level of
heavy metals is also of concern and could have adverse impacts on water bodies. Regular monitoring o f these
variables will be required to ensure strict adherence to the prevailing standards.

Sludge Uuality: in case of sludge used for soil conditioning or as a fertilizer, the sludge quality should comply
with the WHO guidelines. The adopted treatment processes, sludge composting process include proper curing
period followed by storage up to one year, andthe control o f industrial discharges to the sewage system would
ensure that the guidelines would be adhered to.

Other Impacts: Adverse environmental impacts during the construction phase might be significant, however
they are only temporary. Typical impacts are those of dust, noise, traffic congestion, and disturbance to the
residents o f the area. Good construction practices would mitigate most o f these temporary impacts to
acceptable levels. Moreover, the project will have a positive impact on employment resulting from the
increased construction activities.

The project will have no significant long term negative impact on air quality, climate, the biological
environment, the socio-economic conditions, or other development projects. Furthermore, the construction o f
the project will not lead to resettlement of people. In summary, once operational, most o f the impacts o f the
Project will be positive.

EnvironmentalManagement Plan(EMP)

The EMP identifies feasible cost effective measures to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that might
occur during the construction and operation of the project. The E M P covers mitigation measures, monitoring
andinstitutional strengthening.

Mitigation of AdverseEnvironmentalImpacts

Mitigation measures have been identified      to ensure that the defined objectives o f the project are achieved
whilst preventing and reducing any adverse environmental impacts. The mitigation measures are to be
executed by the construction contractor (construction phase) and the treatment plant operators (operation
phase) with supervision by the MazandaranWWC.

 Water Qualip: InSari, the analysis indicates that the quality o f the water inthe existing wells comply with the
national standards. In addition, the quality of the proposed water supply sources o f Tajan Dam, is chemically
acceptable and all parameters are below the national maximum allowable standards. In Babol, the analysis


                                                        144

indicates that all quality parameters are below the national and intemational maximum allowable standards in
existing wells. Bacteriological analyses o f Sari and Babol water indicates the absence o f bacteriological
contamination and confirm the efficiency o f the chlorination system.

The provision o f a wastewater network for collecting and transmitting the generated wastewater to a treatment
plant will certainly minimize potential bacteriological contamination o f ground water. Furthermore, the
proposed project will finance the regular monitoring o f water quality. During project implementation, a
continuous monitoring program would be implemented to ensure that treated water will always meet the
required standards. The monitoring program will cover biological and physical parameters as well as heavy
metals and pesticides residues.

Effluent Oualitv: The proposed treatment level is based on the activated sludge process and chlorination would
ensure a treated effluent of acceptable quality for discharge inreceiving surface water bodies. The wastewater
treatment processes, include nitrification and denitrification processes in Sari WWTP. In Babol the current
process design includes for nitrification    only, however as a result o f the post environmental review, it i s
proposed to upgrade the process by including denitrification to protect ground water sources. These processes
will result inthe removalof organic materials and nutrients downto standardlevels. As soon as the wastewater
treatment plants start operating, monitoring of wastewater quality inthe influent and effluent will be conducted
to ensure adherence to the required standard.

In view of the treated effluent quality of Sari WWTP, which will be in compliance with the prevailing
standards for discharge to surface water resources, the impacts on the Tajan River is insignificant and will be
localized to the discharge point. Infact, the environmental state o f the river i s expected to improve appreciably
in comparison to the base condition due to elimination of direct wastewater discharge to the river once the
WWTP will be put inoperation. Considering the treated effluent quality o f Babol WWTP, and considering that
Shazdehrood is mostly used as a source for irrigation water, no adverse impacts are envisaged o n the river. In
fact, the environmental state o f the river is expected to improve in comparison to the base conditions due to the
substantial decrease inraw wastewater discharging after the Babol WWTP go inoperation.

In the summer season the effluent will be used in agriculture. The treatment process at Babol WWTP will
result inthe removal of nematodes to less than one percent o f the concentration inthe raw wastewater entering
the treatment plant. Therefore the presence of nematodes inthe treated effluent will be directly related to their
concentration inthe raw wastewater. As soon as the wastewater treatment plants start operating, monitoring o f
nematodes inthe influent and effluent will be conducted to ensure adherence to the required standard.

Sludge Oualitv: The sludge treatment processes of Sari and Babol treatment plants include sludge blending,
thickening, aerobic digestion for Sari and anaerobic digestion for Babol, sludge dewatering, and composting.
These processes will ensure the elimination of toxics and pollutants in the sludge. For the use o f composted
sludge in agriculture as soil conditioner or fertilizer, the project will ensure compliance with WHO applicable
guidelines including the limit o f less than one intestinal nematode egg per 100 gm o f dry solids by monitoring
the quality o f treated sludge and ensuringsufficient compost curing and storage period o f one year.

.&strial    Discharges: The discharge of untreated industrial effluents can affect the performance o f the
wastewater treatment plants, resulting in a lower quality treated effluent. The project will only provide
connections to those industries that do not discharge toxics that affect the performance of the wastewater
treatment plants. The discharge of industrial effluents will be subject to the approval o f both the Director o f the
treatment plant and the director o f the DOE. For those industries for which their industrial effluents will not be
pre-treated, andor will not be connected to the network, the DOE will require that each polluting industrial
establishment will prepare a compliance action plan (CAP), which will address the pollutants o f concern, the
type o f pre-treatment required and the investments and monitoring costs o f the pre-treatment facility.

 Other Issues: As discussed above under the Guilan section, the general disruption daring construction will be
mitigated by coordinated planningo f construction activities. This will include coordination with all concerned



                                                         145

authorities prior to the start o f the construction activities. Other adverse impacts due to construction activities
will be mitigated through the adoption o f Good EnvironmentalPractice Procedures.

Impacts arising from the potential occurrence o f earthquake will be mitigated through (i)     following the Iranian
and International seismic design requirements as well as (ii)developing and implementing emergency
preparedness plans which would cover activities to be implemented before, during and after earthquake
occurrence.

Liaison arrangements will be established between the public, contractors, and the Project Management Unit. A
procedure will be established to allow the general public to lodge complaints at the Project Management Unit
about excessive disturbance.

Cost Estimate

The cost o f the Environmental Management Plan during construction (mitigation measures including
additional treatment and monitoring) will be include the contractors price (construction phase) and the
Supervision Engineer who will make the necessary provision as part o f their contracts for this project. A total
amouiit o f about I.2 million dollars will be allocated for the implementationo f the environmental management
plan and will be included inthe project cost for Sari and Babolprojects, respectively



Public Consultations

Numerous governmental and non-governmental organizations were consulted at various stages o f project
preparation. At the initiation o f the project, technical, financial, environmental and social issues associated
with the project were discussed in meetings attended by the design Consultants, representative of the City
councils, Sari and Babol municipalities, Mazandaran and Golestan Regional Water Board and various other
stakeholders. Terms o f Reference for the E1studies were developed and shared with the key stakeholders in
scoping meetings, which were held as o f August 2002.

The preparation process for the environmental assessment included public consultations which were carried
out at various stages. The consultations involved line ministries, city authorities, provincial departments o f
environment, operating water and wastewater companies, local communities, NGOs andthe public

Upon the completion o f the draft EA report, the executive summary was translated to Farsi and a public
hearing was held on the 4'h o f January 2005. The meeting was attended by more than 120 participants from
various organizations including representatives o f the Mazandaran WWC, local health authorities, local law
enforcement authorities, Mazandaran and Golestan Regional Water Board, NGOs, Sari municipality, Babol
municipality, DOE o f Mazandaran, members o f the press, experts and professionals from the community o f
Sari and Babol. Invitation letters were prepared in Farsi and were accompanied with the draft Executive
Summary. Announcements about the meeting were also made through the local newspapers and public bulletin
boards. The meeting was covered by the local newspapers, television and radio. The meeting consisted o f an
opening session, a presentation o f the project financial arrangements and the current cooperation between the
World Bank and the Mazandaran WWC. This presentation was followed by a short documentary film which
showed the current status o f the water and wastewater services inthe two cities and the ongoing works o f these
facilities. The film was followed by a presentation o f the project's major components and the environmental
aspect o f each component. The common view held was that the project should be implemented as soon as
possible as it would result in improved health and welfare benefits not only to Sari and Babol cities but for the
whole region.

The main concern was expressed by the NGOs and MOErepresentatives concerning the impact o fnoise, dust,
traffic congestion, and disturbance o f utility services during construction stage o f the project. Also the potential
impacts o f odor emissions during the operation stage. The consultants clarified that odor emissions will be
minimized by proper design and operation o f the works. The environmental monitoring program will include


                                                          146

odor monitoring to ensure compliance with standards. As for the short term impacts caused during the
construction stage, mitigationmeasures and monitoring will be included to minimize their effect. Clarifications
were requested on how the project will address the reuse o f treated sludge in agriculture considering the
constraints and the health quality limits required by various standards. It was clarified that adequate design
provisions have been incorporated in the sludge treatment process, sludge application, sludge and soil
monitoring to address all the requirements o f national and international standards.




PART B. Social Analysis

The project situation.

Rasht and Sari are provincial administrative capitals, while Anzali is a Caspian port recovering from a
temporary economic decline, and Babol i s a populous and bustlingagncultural and commercial service center
and transport nexus. The region's economy has always had an important sector o f high-end tourism and
vacation homes but inother sectors the emphasis is gradually changing from fishing, mixed low-input farming
and lower value crops (e.g. paddy rice), toward light manufacturing, transportation, and modem farming
systems with higher value crops under irrigation and aquaculture.

Table 1 above shows the key characteristics o f the cities, which, despite local specificities, display broad
similarities. The four cities are quite well covered with potable water supply but sewerage coverage is very
low for current populations: in Rasht, where there is sewerage coverage, the system is antiquated and
insufficient. Given the projected rates o f growth, there i s a future crisis. All cities lack functioning water
treatment and wastewater collection facilities. All four cities are developing city water supply and sanitation
network coverage and sustainable management, an essential precondition for the basic welfare o f the
population and for future growth, as well as an essential component insound water resources management and
the environmental health o f the sensitive ecosystems of the southern Caspian littoral.

Future demographic growth is likely to be accompanied by some vertical expansion (construction o f apartment
blocks), thus increasing the population density and also the proportion of rental properties. This fact alone
bringsurgency inthe provisiono f a new sanitation system to replace absorption wells, a system that suits only
individual households and lower population densities.

K e y sociaYpoverty alleviation benefit.




                                                                        147

With low natural gradients, rapid urban growth, and a predominant system o f sewage disposal through
domestic absorption wells, sewage infiltration into the water table and seepage into surface water and standing
pools is common. This untreated effluent eventually finds its way into the southern Caspian, where Iran has
probably the best record of the littoral states in sturgeon sustainable use and ecosystem protection and
awareness3.     This situation causes significant environmental health risks and quality o f life problems,
particularly for the extensive neighborhoods o f the four cities where the poorer sections o f the population
generally inhabit lower-lying and less well drained lands. Conditions inthese areas, particularly inhot weather
or during heavy rains, can be flagrantly unsanitary and unhealthy. For example, along the Anzali waterfront,
shops and residences typically discharge untreated effluent visibly and directly into the lagoon.            InBabol,
sewage sometimes flows freely in streets where children play and pedestrians pass, causing severe health
hazard. This project therefore will bring a direct, tangible, inclusionary and sustainable benefit for all, but
particularly for the poor by improving dramatically the unacceptable conditions o f environmental health and
safety.

Social development issues for appraisal.

The project i s identical inoverall design to the water supply and sanitation project already approved for Ahwaz
and Shiraz, and no new generic issues arise. Inappraising this project, therefore, the Bank needs to ascertain
inrespect of the specific socio-economic conditions of the four cities, that: a) that the project is so designed
that its benefits will actually reach the poor, that it will address their objective and felt needs, and that the
outcomes are appropriately measured, evaluated and communicated; b) that any necessary additional measures
will be taken in order to ensure effective community awareness and participation to secure these benefits;
c) that there are no serious stakeholder or institutional risks that could impede project execution; d) that
appropriate account is taken of any social risks, such as unwillingness or inability to pay, which might inhibit
the benefit stream or adversely affect project sustainability; and e) that any expropriation o f property required
for the project i s done so as fully to conform with Bank social safeguards policy.

Social assessment.

Duringproject identification, a social assessment in each o f the four cities was commissioned by the National
Water & Wastewater Engineering Company of Iran on terms o f reference and using consultants4 approved by
the Bank. The social assessment in the four cities analyzed the social asyects o f water and wastewater
problems in the target cities using a consistent reporting format and methods o f investigation: review o f the
secondary data, questionnaire social survey o f representative households, and interviews with key informants,
and focus group discussions with the residents and stakeholders, officials o f the Regional and Local Water &
Wastewater Companies and other private sector operators for sludge disposal. The studies analyzed the
existing water and wastewater disposal strategies that the residents adopt with regard to water collection,
wastewater disposal and sanitation. It also assessedthe capacity o f the WWCs to deliver improved services.

The key focus o f the investigation was on the attitudes o f the residents to the project and their willingness and
ability to pay their share o f the costs, both the capital cost o f the investment (through a connection fee) as well
as the Operation and Maintenance costs (through tariff increases).

The Bank preparation and appraisal missions visited these four sites, spoke with residents and with company
officials, and confirmed the needs and the key findings     o f the social assessment.

Local Conditions and Impacts.




   Nearby Ramsar, on the Mazandaran coastline, was site o fthe famcus intemational conference and convention on
wetlands conservation.
"  The work was ajoint venture between an national and an international firm of environmental and social consultants
Pars Ab Tadbir o f Iran and NESPAK o f Pakistan.


                                                          148

The factors affecting the quality of water in Anzali are absorption wells, septic ranks and the disposal o f
wastewater both by individuals into open drains and ditches as well as and by W W C directly into the Anzali
lagoons and the Caspian Sea. The gradual decline in the quality o f potable water as well as the heavily
contaminated surface water in the Anzali lagoons has increased the incidence o f waterborne diseases,
particularly diarrheal diseases and parasites. For treatment, most households depend on public facilities, the
nearest quality private health facility beingsome 40 kmdistant, inRasht.

InBabol, the presentpotable water supply meets about 80% ofthe current demand. Wastewater disposal is by
absorption wells. Health problems include a high prevalence o f intestinal parasites and diarrheal diseases
induced by poor potable water quality. Uncontrolled disposal o f raw, untreated sludge from absorption wells
causes environmental hazards via agriculture, surface water pollution, free flowing sewage, etc. particularly
here, very high level of community awareness owing to urgency o f case, and indignity suffered by poor
inhabitants.

Rasht, upstream from Anzali, also contributes heavily to the pollution o f the lagoon water.         Municipal
wastewater system is poorly maintained, and plans for thorough overhaul. and there i s a high incidence o f
reported diarrheal diseases and typhoid especially in summer months. The 73,000 connections in Rasht meet
only 85 percent o f current demand. A significant number o f residents dispose o f their wastewater in streets,
open drains and ditches.

In Sari, absorption wells also predominate, again with a high incidence of diarrheal diseases including
intestinal parasites.

In all four cities, the absence o f a proper water and wastewater system imposes substantial hidden costs on
poor households which are hard to quantify using classic survey methods. Overall, public awareness is l o w of
the environmental health costs o f poor sanitation.

Bank missions confirmed in all four cities the dire physical state o f sanitation, particularly in the summer
months and particularly in low-lying poor residential areas, where standing pools o f sewage create an
imminent public health hazard. There is no doubt that the poorest sections o f the population, being hardest hit
by the absence o f this service, will benefit most from the improvements and are the most oppressed by the
cmditions, the most anxious--even vociferous--for radical improvement and thus the most motivated to pay for
them.

Beneficiary attitudes to project.

 Inall four cities, attitudes toward the project were broadly congruent. InAnzali, the poor majority believe
that the project will bring a positive benefit. However, the higher income groups are more skeptical about the
level o f improvements likely to accrue from the Project. Inall cities, it was recognized that the project would
bringbenefits. However, there was expressed &cross all cities the same skepticism and doubts as to whether
the existingW W C management has the institutional capacity to deliver improvements or the means to interact
effectively with the beneficiaries. The public was, therefore, broadly skeptical that the companies would
actually deliver the promised benefit, and this skepticism adversely affected willingness to pay.           T h i s
skepticism was reflected in the high non response rate to the questionnaire survey on willingness to pay, and
reluctance to disclose information on private family matters such as incomes, their self-perceived class
ranking.

Institutional issues.

In all four cities, respondents expressed considerable skepticism about the management capacity o f the
companies, and in particular their ability to work effectively with beneficiaries. There was a distinct feeling
that community participation in monitoring o f service delivery, through lane and neighborhood committees
with ability to make representation to the WWW companies, shouldbe complemented by a capacity developed
in the companies to enable them to present essential information cm water and sanitation issues in a user


                                                       149

friendly way that the community can relate to. The companies should each have a community liaison function.
This inturn would require training and technical assistance.

Willingness and abilityto pay.

At present, households pay broadly from 16% to 22% o f their incomes on all public services aggregated:
water, solid waste, education health and transport, on clearly modest incomes for the poorer groups o f $1 -
$1.50 per person per day.5 Water charges are estimated to comprise about 1-2 percent o f incomes, which is
low by global standards. Modeling scenarios suggested that a doubling o f connection fees and usage tariffs
might increase this combined utility component o fhousehold budgets by around 5%, which would certainly be
felt significantly, particularly by the poorer sections o f the population.

The Bank missions were inno doubt that there is a highlevel o f public mistrust and incomprehension o f public
utility companies. The willingness to pay component o f the social assessment therefore raised certain key
issues. Firstly, willingness to pay i s an attitude that, surveyed at a point intime and as a hypothetical question,
does not necessarily translate into real willingness to part with money several years down the line.
Revealingly, the questions on specific increased amounts that people would be willing to pay (as per classic
WTP surveys), as well as on incomes and social status, resulted ina highnon-response rate on these questions,
but not on more general questions. The obvious conclusions were that a) the poor are most willing to pay,
because they suffer the most deplorable environmental health conditions; and b) people were unwilling to
commit to a specific amount, yet reluctant to show unwillingness lest their refusal might prejudice their
opportunity to gain a needed service. The operational consequences o f this conclusion are spelt out in the
recommendations for communication andpublic education.

The willingness to pay and affordability section also indicated clearly that considerable attention must be paid
to smoothing the cost increases, particularly for the poor, where conditions are sometimes degrading and
unacceptable. The one-off installation/ connection fees, if they are doubled, would be affordable if they were
spread out over 24-36 months and added as a component to the water utility charges, preferably after visible,
tangible work has started. Demanding the fee in advance o f work, and as a single payment, is likely to meet
resistance. Therefore, a carefully constructed campaign o f public information is indicated. Indications were
that the future overall cost o f water should not be allowed to exceed about 7% o f the householdbudget.

Recommendations

a. Implications for project design and sequencing. Inview o f the fact that the poor areas will show more
marked benefits from the project, that the residents are aware o f it, while the better o f f areas tend to be more
skeptical o f the benefits, where technically possible measurable benefits, and therefore the sequencing o f
connections should begin in the poorer areas, and where financially possible and recovery o f the connection
fee and the application of the new tariff structure should only begin after connection, or at the earliest after
visible physical works have commenced.

b. Communications, awareness and education (timing o f measurable benefits). There is need to use
appropriate channels and education; need for consumer relations and education. There i s a relatively high
degree o f literacy, but public information travels through trusted channels. Therefore there is need for user-
hendly information systems, and training o f W W C officials. The key informants recommended the project
should adopt a Community-WWC participation approach by which the residents should be able to monitor the
implementation and service delivery. The lane/neighborhood water and wastewater committees (NWCs) under
?hisapproach should look after the local issues and their elected representatives participate in the decision-
making process. The Community Development Unit at the W W C should act as the liaison between the WWC
and the NWCs. However, to avoid mistrust o f officialdom, appropriate use should be made o f trusted local
channels and opinion leaders.


   Surveys, however, usually underreport incomes, because respondents typically report only formal incomes and omit
many other sources. The survey showed a marked reluctance to respond to this type o f question.


                                                          150

c. Beneficiary participation. The project should make explicit provision for the informed participation o f
beneficiaries that will help to develop a culture o f civic responsibility in relation to water use, wastewater
disposal, monitoring o f delivery and service standards, and reduce the "free rider" problem. Such a partnership
could be implemented through lanelneighborhood water and wastewater committees with elected
representatives, liaising with the Community Development Unit at the WWC.

d. Tariff and connection fees for the poor. Connection fees (both the cost and the connection right) should
be smoothed out by a mechanism such as spreading it over the regular monthly payments; cross subsidy may
be needed, and intervention o f charitable institutions for the most indigent.

The stakeholders suggested i)training and support to the WWC in efficiency in organizational management
and O&M o f the systems, ii)develop effective mechanism for beneficiary participation (what does this
mean?), (monitoring service quality, information systems that are sensitive to client needs so they understand.

e. Outcome indicators and Monitoring & Evaluation. The social assessment did not address how social
development outcome indicators could be derived and measured. Local knowledge indicates that it i s feasible
and desirable to develop inconsultation with local communities one or more very simple but reliable indicators
that respond to their vividly desired outcomes, and that could be used for participatorybaseline and evaluation.
Such pragmatic indicators for discussion and piloting at project inception could include: length o f streets and
alleys in residential areas subject to regular standing sewage problems; percentage o f school going children
who have to pass through polluted streets to get to school; number o f households within 100meters o f stagnant
polluted ponds; annual cost to households o f cleanindpumping septic tanks and absorption wells.

Measuring and reporting on such indicators in a participatory way, would demonstrate to the communities the
value o f the project and greatly increase willingness to pay for improvements, and should form part o f a
community education and awareness campaign.

f. Social safeguards. The social safeguards policy framework approved for the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water
Supply and Sanitation Project applies to this project. Specifically, the Bank mission reviewed all the land
expropriation needs and found them to comply with Bank policy, being situated in public rights o f way or
along the margins of cultivated land, without disturbance to residences and with adequate compensation
mechanisms in place. There is a single exception in Rasht o f the resettlement o f a family o f four that i s
separately documented in an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan. The Policy framework and detailed Land
Acquisition Policies for each city, and abbreviated RAP are attached.

g. Recruitment of part-time project social development specialist. Inorder to ensure the above community
actions and facilitate liaison between the communities and the company, the project will employ a half-time
2roject social development specialist to cover the four cities.

            ISLAMICREPUBLIC OF IRAN:IR-WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION

A. Introduction

Since Iran geographically lies in a semi-dry region, water shortage always has been a major problem. Rapid
population growth at least until 1996 coupled with massive urban population growth and expansion have
exaggerated the problem. An irrational pattem of water consumption complicates the situation, thus projects to
promote water conservation and reuse are important. Most Iranian cities lack a sewerage system. Untreated
waste water usually ends up in agncultural land outside cities, causing health risks and environmental hazard
to natural habitats, such as Anzali lagoons. The Water and Wastewater program, which has covered Tehran,
Ahwaz and Shiraz is now extended to cover four major cities o f the southem Caspian provinces o f Guilan and
Mazandaran: Anzali, Rasht, Babol and Sari.

B.ProjectDescription

The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) prepared for Ahwaz and Shiraz explicitly took into account the
"repeater project" that would include the four northern cities. The proposed WW project intends to enhance
environmental and health conditions in the above mentioned cities. Moreover the project development
objectives also include: 1)to improve the quality o f life and alleviate poverty inthe proposed six cities inIran,
2) increasing coverage o f sanitation services, 3) implementing a pilot program o f hygiene and sanitation
practices to improve health conditions o f targeted population, 4) promoting reuse of treated effluent.

The RPFalready presentedto the Board for Ahwaz and Shiraz, therefore, explicitly applied to the four cities o f
this project, and i s reproduced here with minor edits to ensure consistency with this second project. However
individual city land acquisition plans are prepared and presented to the Eank as individual "Land acquisition
Plans", or "Resettlement Action Plans" under the present policy framework.

C. Principlesand ObjectivesGoverningResettlement

Rationalefor expropriation of land. Land acquisition is necessary inthis project inorder to provide for 1)
water treatment plants 2) pumping stations and 3) channels and pipes to carry the outfall to its destination.
These requirements are determined by the engineering designs in each particular case, and result from a) the
size of the population to be served and the volume o f water to be treated; and b) the topography o f the land,
which normally requires wastewater treatment plants to be situated inthe lowest-lying convenient area inorder
for maximum use o f gravity. None of the public Water and Wastewater Companies (WWCs) owns sufficient
land appropriately located that would allow the project to be undertaken without some additional
expropriation.



  The Iran Northem Cities Water Supply and Sanitationproject i s the second ina program o f repeater Water and Sanitation
projects that will involve land expropriation for works (treatment plants, pumping stations and sewerage lines).         This
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was presented to the Board as an annex to the first project, for Ahwaz and Shiraz,
on [August 15, 20041. The RPF is the instrument used because the exact expropriation requirements for future sites are
.not known. This annex is identical to that for the first project mutatis mutandis for the four northem cities, because the
pattem o f project design and land requirements is very similar to that o f Ahwaz and Shiraz. Pre-feasibility studies indicate
that land acquisition generally entails n o physical resettlement or impact on residences or economic activities and that only
the asset value o f undeveloped land is concemed. Therefore, for ease o f commmication with the client and the public, the
resettlement instruments have been entitled respectively Land Acquisition and Compensation Policy Framework and
Land Acquisition and CompensationPlan for each city concemed. This makes the purpose o f the instruments clear to
the client. The only exception is the city o f Rasht, where the necessary expropriation o f one house occupied by a family of
four requires a Resettlement Action Plan. Irrespective o f the title The instruments respond fully to the Bank's OP 4.12
policy requirements in the context o f this project


                                                              152

Minimization of expropriation of land. The expropriation o f private land is minimized in accordance with
Iranian law', which requires public utility projects G f any nature to make maximum use o f public land, and
only to resort to expropriation when there is no alternative. Minimal expropriation o f private land also serves
the interest o f the public water and waste water companies which are obliged to pay compensation awarded by
independent assessment as explained below. Preference is always given to transfer o f government or public
land from other agencies where this is available, but even inthis case compensation is payable.

Engineers in public water and wastewater projects take great care to avoid disturbing existing structures,
especially residences, urban facilities, areas o f cultural, religious or cultural heritage value, parks or other areas
o f public value.

Legal process is obligatory. All expropriations must be carried out accord.ing to the provisions o f Iranian
law8. The law o f expropriation defines the procedures to be followed and protects the rights o f all parties
involved. Wrongs committed during expropriation may be redressedby the courts with provision for payment
of damages and punishment o f offenders. The law under which WWCs are established gives the WWC the
power to expropriate land (Article 14). The company must also obtain from the Article 5 Commissiong
agreement to any necessary changes inland use inaccordance with the city master plan.

Compensation and eligibilityprinciples. Whenever expropriation o fprivate land is unavoidable, Iranianlaw
clearly indicates that land should be expropriated through full compensation at market value, independently
determined, with advance public notice, negotiation and right o f appeal. Rights to compensation extend to
owners, tenants, workers, or any person who can demonstrate any interest lost as a result o f expropriation.

D.DescriptionofProcedurefor PreparingandApproving LandAcquisition Plans (ResettlementAction
Plansper OP 4.12)

The expropriating authority is the relevant W W C serving the city concerned. The following steps apply inthis
project whereby a W W C prepares a Land Acquisition Plan.

     1. The Third Development Plan established the principle that cities o f a certain size should have water
         and wastewater treatment facilities inthe public interest. The W W C i s responsible for establishing the
         public necessity o f constructing the facilities, and drawing up terms o f reference for the 6-onsultant
         engineers.
     2. Consulting engineers prepare a number o f design scenarios for decision by the WWCs. One of the
         criteria for the best scenario is least expropriation impact o n private land and least disturbance of any
         nature. At this stage land expropriationrequirements are known inbroad outline.
     3. Under Article 14 o f the expropriation law, the W W C applies to Minister o f Energy for permission to
          expropriate. The company justifies the specific need for land acquisition and its urgency. They annex
         to the letter the full rationale together with sketch maps. No further actions may be taken without the
          express consent o f the Minister.
     4. On review o f the evidence, and on finding the application justified, the Minister gives permission to
         the company to expropriate with the consent of the owner and to pay agreed compensation.
     5. The details o f planned expropriation, together with details o f any expropriations for the project that
         have already been undertaken, are consolidated in a Land Acquisition Plan. The W W C ensures that
         the L A P conforms to the requirements o f Bank policy. The document is transmitted to the Bank
         which determines whether the plan conforms to Bank requirements for financing.

E. Estimated PopulationDisplacement

The present project necessitates the physical displacement o f one family in Rasht and is the subject o f a
separate, individual Resettlement Action Plan. Some displacement o f agricultural activities occurred in Sari
between 1996 and 2000 in the course of the company's expropriation for future treatment plant and network
expansion. These cases were investigated inthe field with due diligence, were found to conform fully to Bank
social safeguard standards o f resettlement, no residual gnevances were found and are documented in the
respective Land Acquisition Plans. Besides these exceptions, all expropriation concerns the asset value o f
property only, and no other physical displacement o f persons, residences, or economic enterprises has been
found. There are n o informal settlements of any kindnor illegal occupants. Typically only a few persons are
affected by the acquisition o f land."

F. Eligibility Criteria for Defining Categories ofDisplaced Persons.

1.Private landinIranis classified as

              a.  Barrenland
             b. Land with defined specific land use as defined by Ministry of Housing and Urban
                  Development for urban land; and by the Ministryof Jihad o f Agriculture for agncultural land
                  including pasture, forest, farmland etc.

2. Entitlements to compensation vary according to the type o f land classification.

3. Inbarren land only the owner is compensated.

4. Inland with defined use, the law explicitly recognizes for the purposes o f entitlement to compensation all
holders of any rights. The following main categories o f rights are entitled for to compensation where loss
established.
   i. Owners
  ii. Tenantswithandwithoutoccupancyrights
 iii. Usufructiers
  iv.    Owners o f trees or other permanent improvements
   v.    People who use the land for commercial purposes
  vi.    People who have made or maintained improvements o f any nature, including caretakers, guardians,
         etc.

H.Methods ofEvaluating Assets

Notification of intent to expropriate and identification of owners. The W W C identifies the owners o f the
parcels affected from the Land Registry. If the registry has no information on the owner, the company
conducts a field survey to identifythe owner from local knowledge. Notification i s made through the local or
national press. Thus anyone other than the ownerh can present their claims.

Evaluation, negotiations and acceptance of offer. Through repeated visits to the plots, the WWC identifies
the owners and all right holders. They obtain an expert evaluation o f the plot and all the rights, includingthe
price o f the land, and thejr make an offer to every person concemed. If the offer is accepted they sign a
preliminary agreement contract and fix a date to go to the land registry for legal transfer o f title. Some WWCs
have decided to create an expropriation committee. The main reason i s to avoid individual decision making.
The committee i s not ajudicial body and its creation i s not mandatory.
Independent assessment. If the offer is not accepted, an independent evaluation is made by three assessors.
Assessors are trained, certified and registered with the Ministry o f Justice. But they do not have any judicial
status and their assessments may be rejected by the owners. One is appointed by WWC, one by the owner, and
the third by consensus betweenboth parties. Each assessor independently visits the plot concemed and makes
a professional evaluation based on local market price at that time. Each assessor prepares a written evaluation.
These evaluations are opened in the presence o f the owner.        These three assessments form the basis o f
negotiation for a final price agreed by the owner.
If independentevaluationsarewidelydifferent,oriftheownerisnotwillingtoaccepttheoffer,theWWC
   the
legal office or land expropriations committee prepares a report to the managing director explaining the
situation andreporting the owner's demand. The company may settle with the owner for the owner's proposed
price or may confirm the original offer in which case the owner has right o f appeal (see below).
If ownercannotbefound,3riftheownerfailstoappear,allotherpartiessignanaffidavitwhichstatesthat
   the
the owner was duly notified and invited to appear and failed to do so. This document is filed as evidence o f
due process. The local Prosecutor (district attomey) is informed and obtains from the local court an order for
the owner to appear, which i s served by the police. The police report the outcome and if the owner still fails to
appear the court acts o n the owner's behalf.

I.OrganizationalProceduresforDeliveryofEntitlements

When agreement is reached between W W C and the owner, a letter o f agreement i s signed. This letter sets a
date to appear inthe Land Registry for transfer o f title. The Company writes to the Land Registry authorizing
its official to sign on the company's behalf. The Land Registry transfers the title on certification by the owner
that he has received full compensation.
Compensation of other right holders. Other affected persons may be compensated directly by the WWC. In
this case they sign a letter to the W W C stating that they have been paid full compensation for their rights,
which the W W C provides to the Land Registry prior to transfer o f title.

Alternatively, the owner may agree during negotiations to compensate all right holders, in which case the
owner provides the same evidence to the W W C as a condition o f payment o f compensation which includes
reimbursement of the owner's payments to right-holders.
Procedure when owner cannot be traced. Ifthe owner has not appeared, the court opens and administers an
account inthe owner's name and administers the transfer o f title.

K. GrievanceRedress

Agreement is reached in the great majority o f cases without recourse to appeals for redress o f gnevance.
Grievances and appeals may arise inthe following cases:

Owner not willingto part with land. Since the public interest has beendetermined, the court acts inplace o f
the owner.

All other cases. Any affected person may appeal to the court for redress. The court has the power to hear
submissions, review the process, and make such provisions as it deems fit. These include ordering
compensation to be paid, halting works, fining the owners.

Inmost cases, the owner benefits from suchappeals. However, inthe caseofany delay, owners lose since no
provision is made for inflation.

L. Arrangements for FundingCompensation

Compensation is always paid by the WWC. Transfer o f land may not take place prior to payment. There are
two ways that this is funded.

    a)  Through budgetary provision in the recurrent budget, where the W W C eams revenue.              This i s not
        normally the case inthis project.

    b) Where the need for expropriation has been foreseen inthe five-year development plan. This is the
        case with most expropriations inthis project. Expropriation takes place under Article IX o f the law o f
        expropriation o f Land inthe public interest. A translation o f this article already has been submitted to
        the WB.

As explained above, (sections H and K), owners and right holders are actively involved in the negotiation
process.

N. MONITORING      OF IMPLEMENTATION


In each case, when any type of land acquisition and compensation is involved, the WWC reports on the
following timetable. This timetable serves as a monitoring device showing all actions involved, the responsible
agency, expected completion date, the reason(s) for any delay and new expected completion date:

                 Appendix 2. LandAcquisitionPlanfor Anzali, Rasht,Baboland Sari
          (Inconformity with World Bank SafeguardPolicy OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement)


Background.

This Land Acquisition Plan has been prepared by the Northem Cities Water and Wastewater Project
(NCWWP) in conformity with the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). InM a y 2004 the RPFwas prepared
and publicly disclosed in Washington and Iran 2004 under the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water and Wastewater
project. The legislation, procedures and instruments o f land expropriation in Iran not having changed since
that time, and the overall project design being identical, the RPF has been applied unchanged to this NCWWP.
The RPF in English and Farsi has been publicly disclosed in the four northem cities o f Anzali and Rasht
(Guilan Province) and Babol and Sari (Mazandaran Province) at the offices o f the respective WWCs and the
four city public libraries, together with this L A P on March 20, 2005. Appropriate notice being placed in the
main daily newspapers o f each city.

Applicabilityand terminology.

The Bank's Operational Policy OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement is triggered by this project: expropriation
o f privately owned land or fixed assets in the public interest is de facto involuntary by Bank definition, since
the property owners have no choice whether or not to part with their property.            Locally, however, this
expropriation process is generally referred to as "voluntary", both by the Iranian administration and the
property owners. This i s because the transfer is referred to as "purchase" and the owners willingly accept, out
o f court, the "purchase price" (compensation) awarded by independent assessment, and sign over title to the
property thus acquired. Ifthe owner contests the award, then ajudicial process o f "involuntary" expropriation
i s triggered, whereby the court hears the case and awards judgment, compelling the owner to surrender title.
Since assessment awards are usually generous and may be negotiated, such contestation and compu!sion is a
very rare event, and has not occurred inthis project. Nor has there been any physical resettlement o f persons
or economic activities. Therefore, to avoid the possibility o f misunderstandings arising between Bank and
Client, the present instruments are each referred to as a "Land Acquisition Plan". The Bank understands that
the L A P is the full functional equivalent o f the restricted Resettlement Action Plan that the policy framework
requires.

ExpropriationrequirementsandBankdue diligence.

The expropriation requirements are modest, being a few hectares in all, mostly for pump stations and lift
stations. The full table o f expropriations i s provided below. Inmost cases this expropriation has already taken
place, and compensation has been awarded. The lines to be laid are almost entirely in public rights o f way
already belonging to the municipality. A Bank mission inJuly 2004 was providedwith detailed maps for each
city, visited all the expropriation sites and the main network routes, and verified ingeneral that the information
provided is accurate; that expropriation requirements have been appropriately minimized; and that there is n o
adverse impact on livelihoods and economic activities. It was also verified that there were n o cultural sites,
public amenities such as parks or recreation areas, or community rights in land affected. A subsequent pre-
appraisal mission obtained full information o n the expropriation status on three sites (Anzali, Babol and Sari)
and was fully satisfied that in these three sites, expropriation had been duly conducted and documented
according to Bank standards. However, for Rasht the information provided for phase 2 o f the treatment plant
and the pumping stations was insufficiently clear and detailed.         In particular, the technical necessity for
expropriation o f a residential house, which earlier been questioned, had still not been justified. The Bank
investigated this expropriation issue, interviewed the owner o f the house, and i s satisfied with the process so
far and with the expected outcome, that full compensation according to Bank standards is expected that will
enable the owner and his family willingly to agree to relocate to a better property o f their choice.         (An
abbreviated Resettlement Action Planhas beenprepared for this single case and the outcome will be monitored
as conforming to Bank requirements).        With this provision, the Mission considers that the social safeguard
policies are adequately complied with.
