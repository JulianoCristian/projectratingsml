The project seeks\n            to enhance environmental and health conditions, and its\n            development objectives further include improvement in the\n            quality of life, and poverty alleviation; increased coverage\n            of sanitation services, and, implementation of a pilot\n            program to include hygiene and sanitation practices towards\n            improving the health conditions of the targeted population.\n            In view of the project's infrastructure development\n            works, land acquisition, and the resulting resettlement\n            issues will take place; therefore, this resettlement policy\n            framework looks at the estimated population to be displaced,\n            reviews the country's legislation and the Bank's\n            operational directive on involuntary resettlement, and\n            provides resettlement guidance and the compensation measures\n            to be followed. There are two ways to fund compensation:\n            through budgetary provision in the recurrent budget, where\n            the water authority (WWC) earns revenue (this is not\n            normally the case in this project); or, where the need for\n            expropriation has been foreseen in the five-year development\n            plan (this is the case with most expropriations in this\n            project). Expropriation takes place under Article IX of the\n            law of expropriation of Land in the public interest. Based\n            on public consultations, and in agreement with project\n            affected persons, compensation will be paid in cash at\n            market values for loss of land, crops, or physical\n            structures, as well as other assets lost. Monitoring\n            criteria will be in place to ensure compliance with this\n            RAP, as will grievance mechanisms should conflict occur."}, "docdt": "2005-04-01T16:10:02Z"}
