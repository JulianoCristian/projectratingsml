Northern Cities Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for Iran were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            realism in project design should be reflected by the\n            project's complete assessment of all the local\n            realities on the ground during project preparation. In the\n            case of the current project, this should have translated\n            into evidence of adequate completion of preparation work for\n            land acquisition and detailed estimates of engineering\n            designs; preparation of bidding documents for the first year\n            prepared by the borrower. The construction of wastewater\n            treatment facilities cannot be fully implemented in five\n            years. Institutional strengthening has focused on capacity\n            building and training which was very important for the\n            project. However, although sector coordination was\n            recognized as a possible problem area at the time of project\n            preparation/appraisal, it was not given due consideration.\n            Coordination among the various stakeholders should be seen\n            as an aspect of institutional development and an important\n            determinant for project results. There is also a need to\n            identify indicators that can monitor variables that can be\n            directly attributed to the project. The working ratio is not\n            always the most appropriate indicator for financial\n            sustainability as there are many external factors that\n            affect it such as cost of materials (steel, cement and\n            others) and energy. A utility could be improving certain\n            efficiencies but strong increases in market prices will\n            affect the expenses considerably."}, "docdt": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
