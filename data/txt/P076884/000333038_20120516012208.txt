1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

Main Sector Issues Identified at Appraisal

The Bank‘s engagement with the water and sanitation sector in Iran started with the Tehran
Drainage Project in the early 1990s. At appraisal (2005), 98% of the urban population had
access to water, but the system suffered from inefficient water use and high water losses.
Unaccounted-for water (UFW) averaged 35% nationally. Rapid urbanization (2.8% per year)
and low tariff rates resulted in a consumption that was 70% higher than international standards.
In contrast, most Iranian cities lacked sewerage systems. Antiquated urban household practices
of sewage disposal and untreated waste water dumping into waterways impacted agricultural
land and lagoons, causing major public health risks and environmental hazards.

Sector Issues in Guilan Province

The two cities in Guilan Province, Rasht and Anzali, both located about 320 km to the north of
Tehran, have been grown rapidly. At appraisal, 85% of households in Rasht and Anzali were
connected to the water distribution network. Rasht‘s aggregate demand at 124,000 m3 per day
was expected to double in about 25 years due to increased urbanization. Anzali‘s aggregate
demand at 27,000 m3 per day was also expected to more than double in 25 years. UFW in Guilan
province was estimated at 35%. Chemical, physical and bacteriological analyses, conducted at
various points showed that drinking water supply quality complied with national and WHO
standards.

One of the sector concerns was the lack of wastewater collection and treatment networks in the
face of a growing population with a resulting increasing discharge of wastewater into the natural
water bodies. Where groundwater level was high, the risk of groundwater contamination and
waterborne infectious diseases was significant. In Rasht, discharge of raw wastewater had been
severely polluting the Zarjoob and Goharood rivers which flow into the Anzali lagoon. Pollution
was highest during low summer flows when the rivers were transformed into sewers with
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) levels in both rivers up to 30 mg/l. Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
levels measured were as low as 10 mg/l. The Government had devised a wastewater management
plan for Rasht such that the wastewater generated in the three drainage zones of the city
(western, eastern, and central) would be collected and conveyed by gravity to a single
wastewater treatment plant located 4 km to the north-east of the city. At appraisal, the
wastewater collection system in Rasht was under construction, with priority given to the central
drainage area which had the highest population density. In Anzali 70% of the population was
connected to one waste water collection system. The combined wastewater and storm drainage
collection network discharged into both the Anzali lagoon and into the Caspian Sea, through
large sewer outfalls. There was a need to install separate wastewater treatment plants for each

                                               1
drainage zone in Anzali whereby the effluent loads would be given secondary treatment since the
discharge of all treatment plants would eventually reach the sensitive water body of the Anzali
lagoon. The lagoon was (and is) the most prominent environmental feature in the project area
and is listed as a ‗wetland of international importance‘ under the 1971 Ramsar Convention due to
its importance as a natural wetland characteristic of the southern Caspian lowlands. It supports
an extremely diverse wetland flora and fauna.

Sector Issues in Mazandaran Province

Sari, the capital city of the Mazandaran Province, and Babol, the second largest city, are both
located to the north of Tehran and attract some 10 million tourists annually. In Sari, the average
water demand at 52,000 m3 per day was expected to rise to 97,000 m3 per day by 2029 while that
of Babol would rise to more than 78,000 m3 per day from 42,000 m3 per day. Groundwater has
always been the major drinking water source and both cities had complete water coverage. The
quality of water supplied meets the national water quality standards.

The average losses in the systems at appraisal stood at around 32%. The inadequate drainage
system in both Sari and Babol had been impacting the living conditions of the people who used
percolation pits as a way to dispose of household waste. These pits have generally a 1 to 1.2 m
diameter and a depth of 8 to 10 m require frequent cleaning. In Sari, total wastewater volume
collected was projected to be 4,861 m3/day at the end of 2010 rising to 92,840 m3/day by the end
of 2029. Due to the high water table and low soil permeability, the use of existing pits for
wastewater and sludge was unsatisfactory, creating a high risk of groundwater contamination and
promoting the incidence of waterborne infectious diseases. Water quality of the rivers had also
deteriorated in the previous years because of industrial discharges and agriculture drainage. The
waters of the Tajan river passing through Babol had been used for agriculture. Water quality
measurements overall several months reported unsafe levels of coliform bacteria and BOD5. The
Babolrood river received a great part of the wastewater of Babol city from open drainage
channels that ran along the roads adjacent to the residential areas.

Although the four cities had complete water coverage, the distribution network needed
rehabilitation to improve efficiency. The network also needed to be extended because of the
population increase. The degradation in environmental conditions needed to be arrested with
improved sanitation. Lack of adequate wastewater collection systems coupled with rapid growth
of population had prompted the Government to designate water supply and sanitation projects as
high priority projects.

Development Plan (1999-2004) and Fourth Five Year Development Plan (2005-2010). Previous
Bank assistance to the Iranian water and sanitation sector was fragmented and limited. The April
2001 Interim Strategy (2001-2004) facilitated the dialogue for a renewed and strategic
                                                 2
partnership between the Bank and Iran with a view to following a reform agenda for promoting
environmentally and socially sustainable development. In 2002, the Bank prepared and
disseminated a water and sanitation sector note providing recommendations for: (a) key
institutional reforms such as clarification and demarcation of responsibilities of the institutions
involved; (b) streamlining of financial policies and implementation of a tariff scheme consistent
with cost recovery objectives; (c) optimization of investments and selection of appropriate least-
cost technologies; (d) addressing environmental and health concerns; and (e) adopting and
implementing integrated water resource management concepts.

In 2003, the Government endorsed the note in the context of sector discussions within the
Country Assistance Strategy. The Government approached the Bank to bridge the huge financing
gap to address the infrastructure deficit and management of the water and sanitation sector.

The Bank‘s assistance for water supply, sanitation and hygiene, irrigation and drainage, and
water resource management was to be supported by the following four pillars: (i) recognizing
that investment without reform is ineffective in reaching the goals of environmentally and
socially sustainable development; (ii) people and institutions should be at the center of
sustainable water resource development; (iii) delivering of water and other related services
should be based on cost recovery principles; and (iv) safeguarding of water resources is a shared
responsibility that involves tradeoffs. In view of these principles, investment in the water and
sanitation sector was envisaged for six cities in Iran. The Government sought the Bank‘s
assistance for both the Ahwaz and Shiraz Project (2004-2009) and for this Northern Cities Water
and Sanitation Project (NCWSP), with further investment considered under an adaptable
programme loan (APL).

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The main project development objectives (PDO) were to:

       1) Enhance the quality of life in the four northern cities of Rasht, Anzali, Sari and Babol
          by: (a) improving the reliability of the water supply systems through rehabilitation and
          extension of the water supply networks; (b) improving the health and urban
          environmental conditions by providing wastewater collection services and treatment
          facilities; and (c) contributing to the environmental protection of the natural resources of
          the provinces (especially the Anzali Lagoon, an internationally recognized wetland); and
       2) Improve the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of the Water and
          Wastewater Companies (WWCs) in Guilan and Mazandaran.

To measure project performance, four outcome indicators were chosen:

      1. Availability of water in distribution network in each project city
      2. Incidence of waterborne diseases in each project city
      3. Quality of receiving bodies
                                                   3
      4. Improved operational efficiency and financial sustainability:
             a. Unaccounted for water (UFW)
             b. Working ratio (WR)
             c. Collection ratio (CR)

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

With adequate water resources available in the country, the project would ensure quality and
reliability of water supplies to the existing 1.1 million inhabitants and the growing population of
the four northern cities Rasht and Anzali in Guilan and Sari and Babol in Mazandaran, Rasht
accounting for half of the total population. By providing access to all, the project would
particularly benefit poor communities which, otherwise, would have to bear the inconvenience
and high cost of water purchases from vendors. Safe public supplies of water would reduce the
threat of health hazards for the urban population.

Furthermore, by establishing wastewater collection and treatment systems, the project expected
to improve the living conditions of 40% of the residents in Rasht, 65% in Anzali, 30% in Sari,
and 25% in Babol. The benefits of the improved waste disposal would be pecuniary and non-
pecuniary. At the same time all residents would benefit from the overall improvement in
environmental conditions brought about by the project collection, treatment and disposal of
wastewater and sludge, which would reduce the incidence waterborne disease such as low-lying
poor residential areas, where standing pools of sewage created an imminent public health hazard,
especially during the summer months. This project therefore was expected to bring direct,
tangible, inclusive and sustainable benefits for all, but particularly for the poor by improving
dramatically the unacceptable conditions of environmental health and safety.

Among other direct beneficiaries would be the tourists to the Anzali lagoon and the Mazandaran
province where the ecological conditions were expected to improve with the completion of the
project. Farmers would benefit from the availability of treated wastewater for irrigation on their
farms.

1.5      Original Components

Long-term development plans had been prepared for the extension of the water supply and
wastewater collection and treatment systems in Rasht and Anzali (Guilan province), Sari and
Babol (Mazandaran province) for the period 2004-2029. These plans were formulated to serve a
population of about 1.0, 0.25, 0.4 and 0.3 million, respectively. They were to be implemented in
four phases. The current project covered works proposed under Phase 1. The total project current
cost was US$343 million. The Bank‘s share of financing was US$224 million. This included
support to Guilan and Mazandaran water and wastewater companies.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project prepared an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Assessment by
consultations with line ministries, city authorities, provincial departments of the environment,
operating water and wastewater companies, local communities, NGOs and the public. The EIA
determined the various sources of pollution and estimated the influence of the project on the
effluent quality from the project area wastewater systems, discharging into rivers and the Anzali
lagoon. The project was expected to have significant economical, social and public health
benefits with long-term positive environmental impacts due to reduced pollution of natural
resources. Positive environmental impacts would be assured by the enforcement of existing
governmental regulations and standards along with continuous monitoring of the treated waters.
Various stakeholders (design consultants, representatives of the city councils, municipalities,
regional water boards and others) were consulted for financial, environmental and social issues
associated with the project. Public meetings were held in Guilan and Mazandaran and the
participants were made aware of the current state of water and wastewater services, project
components, financial arrangements, and participation of the Bank and water and wastewater
companies. During preparation, feasibility studies were conducted to determine the most suitable
options with respect to technical, economical, environmental, health, and social factors. The
project provided adequate design provisions for secondary treatment (through an activated
sludge process) with installation of a Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) system on each
treatment plant to ensure treated effluent of acceptable quality for discharge in receiving water
bodies and for agriculture. The proposed project was classified as Category ―A‖ because of the
construction of wastewater treatment plants, the re-use of sludge and treated effluent and the
potential impact on the Anzali lagoon. In the case of Guilan, the issue of the disposal of sludge
from the new treatment plants had been under study. The water and wastewater company agreed
to provide the Bank with an environmental impact assessment of the option eventually chosen,
no later than one year from effectiveness date. The Social Safeguards Policy Framework
approved for the Ahwaz and Shiraz project was considered applicable also to this project. The
Bank mission reviewed all land expropriation needs to assess compliance with the Bank
safeguard policy.

On strategic grounds, the project design focused on improving the operational and financial
capacities of existing water and wastewater companies so that they could function as
autonomous entities. Improving their capacities in terms of understanding Bank procurement
policies and working in strict compliance with Bank procedures was a major implementation
challenge faced by the project. The project addressed this challenge by incorporating important
lessons from the five year implementation of the Tehran Sewerage Project: (i) establishing a
Technical Support Unit (TSU) to improve project management capacity; (ii) providing training
on the Bank‘s procurement, financial management, and safeguard issues to address project
delays; and (iii) encouraging the establishment of a tariff scheme that would ensure financial
viability of the water and wastewater companies. Each TSU would be equipped with an engineer,
                                               7
a financial management specialist, procurement and environment, and safety specialist. The
Manager of the TSU, chosen from the staff of the company, would provide a critical link with
staff. His or her functioning would be monitored by the national-level TSU in the National
Water and Wastewater Engineering Company. Procurement and financial management training
would build the TSUs‘ management capacities for smooth implementation of the Bank-financed
project. At the time of appraisal, the project‘s first year procurement packages were at a final
design stage and were expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2005.

Project design was appropriate. However, more attention should have been paid to potential
land acquisition, which became a major issue during project implementation.

Government commitment has been strong throughout the project preparation, appraisal,
implementation and operation.

Risks were assessed and addressed at the time of appraisal assuming that satisfactory
implementation of the project would require: (i) a competent TSU in each company; and (ii)
timely provision of counterpart funds provided by the Management and Planning Organization
(MPO) and the water companies. The PAD identified potential risks and mitigation measures
deemed necessary at that time. Table 1 presents the ICR assessment of the risks and the ICR
team concurs with the overall risk assessment of the project to be Substantial.

2.2      Implementation

The project was approved in May 2005 became effective five months after the Board approval.

The project closed with an overall disbursement of about 87.8% of the total loan amount of
US$224 million. An amount of US$27.315 million was cancelled from the loan. The
Mazandaran water and wastewater company took local loans to pay its contractors when
difficulties were experienced in the flow of funds in order to accelerate the implementation of
works during the remaining few months up to the project closing date. Some of the key
components such as, wastewater treatment plants and pumping stations would only be finished
more than two years after project closing date.

External Factors

The main external factors responsible for slow project implementation were:

     Imposition of UN sanctions on Iran in 2007 caused delays in disbursements and
      implementation, because Project Special Accounts (PSA) denominated in US dollars had to
      be converted to Euros. Delays were also incurred in the transfers of funds. These delays and
      uncertainties impacted the pace of implementation of the works as contractors were hesitant
      to accelerate their activities under such uncertain conditions.
     In connection with the UN sanctions the selection of equipment to be purchased by the
      project contributed to delays from the very beginning. Specifications had to be reviewed
      against the list of prohibited items and entities identified by the relevant UN Resolutions.
     Travel restrictions. There were no Bank supervision missions between January 2009 and
      May 2010.
     The Government expected that the Bank would agree to extend the closing date of the
      project. However the Bank did not grant the extension of the closing date. The task team
      encouraged the Government to carry out a revision of the procurement plans for each city
      reflecting prioritizing of sub-projects to be completed with existing Bank funds and/or else
      seek counterpart funds from the Government.
     Because of cost-overruns due to increased construction and material costs, and
      underestimation of project costs at appraisal, the project faced a significant shortfall in
      project financing. In order to fulfill the minimum objectives stated at appraisal, more funding
      was required from the government to finance the project.

Factors Subject to Government and Implementing Agencies Control Internal

Implementation delays were caused by municipality and traffic police permit requirements, and
delays in receiving counterpart funding. Some issues arose on account of land acquisition
resulting in delays in the construction of critical components such as the construction of pumping
stations and wastewater treatment plants.


                                                  10
An important aspect of the project design was the establishment of a TSU responsible for the
planning, design and execution of the project while ensuring compliance with Bank‘s
procedures. In the first two years of implementation, staffing of TSUs and staff turnover
especially in the case of Guilan caused a lot of concern and consequential delays to the project.
At the beginning, the procurement process was mostly driven by consultants in charge of the
design and preparation of bidding documents. There was a long delay in appointing an engineer
for Guilan TSU. A fully staffed and competent TSU, with full support of the top management,
was in place only two or three years after the start of the project. The Mazandaran TSU
performed better by replacing the external staff with company staff. The Bank assessed
improvements in the overall aspects of procurement and contract management and advised the
TSU in Guilan to work closely with the technical department of the company.

Mid-term review (MTR)

The MTR report (December 2008) indicated that the observed cost overruns were not only due
to increases in market rates of construction materials, but also due to increases in service areas/
population numbers over and above what had been estimated at the time of appraisal. Severe cost
overruns in the engineering designs of the components in Mazandaran were due to significant
discrepancies in planned, revised and actual costs. The MTR assessed that project objectives
were relevant and did not require any revision, albeit their fulfillment would require timely
availability of more funds from the Government. Despite procurement picking up, the MTR
assessed that major construction works for wastewater treatment plants and pumping stations
especially those in Anzali and Sari, would require more time to complete i.e. beyond the project
closing date.

Following the MTR discussions, the TSUs prioritized packages that were essential to achieving
project objectives and which fitted within the loan and government allocations already made.
Procurement and financial plans were constantly revised to ensure that project objectives would
still be achieved. While more counterpart funds were required to complete priority contracts,
the less critical activities could be funded by the water and wastewater companies under their
own implementation plans.

Regarding financial health of water and wastewater companies

Reforms anticipated at the beginning of the project did not materialize during the implementation
period causing slipping of the project objectives. The higher working ratio than the baseline
values established at the beginning of the project had been a clear reflection of this issue. It was
only in late 2010 that the Government announced the lifting of subsidies in many sectors,
including water and sanitation. At project closing the impact on the water tariff of the new policy
was not yet clear in the cases of Mazandaran and Guilan.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

The project‘s four intermediate indicators reflected the physical outputs of the project and could
be easily measured and targeted: (i) number of wastewater connections (%) of population
coverage, and (ii) % of wastewater treated. Indicators measuring progress in water components
were (iii) increase in the number of water connections; and (iv) the length of water pipes
rehabilitated.

One of the outcome indicators, availability of water in the distribution system was not monitored
during the implementation period for lack of data being reported by the utility. Social and
environmental benefits of the project were supposed to be reflected by the indicators (3) reduced
incidence of waterborne diseases and (4) improvement in water quality of receiving bodies. WR
and UFW indicators were specified with baselines at the start of the project and target values
were specified. The project provided for the UFW study for each water and wastewater company
for better assessments and measurements. During the implementation of the project, several
studies were financed to establish baseline data for project outcome indicators (3) and (4).

M&E Implementation

The supervision of the project, including the management of the Environmental Monitoring Plan
(EMP), was entrusted to the TSU to ensure that physical implementation resulted in satisfactory
outcomes of the project‘s intermediate indicators and hence would lead to achievement of the
PDOs. Measures identified by the EMP were expected to be executed by the construction
contractor (during the construction phase) and by the treatment plant operators (operation phase);
both to be overseen by the Environment and Safety Officer (ESO) of the TSUs.

However, on account of difficult country conditions and an initial period of non-familiarity with
the Bank‘s procedures and guidelines, much time was spent in handling issues related to
procurement and financial management.

M&E utilization

Data on the progress of selected indicators was maintained by the TSUs. TSUs maintained data
on procurement and contract management and monitored the progress of project components. To
address funding shortfall, based on these data some activities were recommended to be financed
by the government only. Reliable outcomes and impacts could only realistically determined
some years after commissioning of wastewater treatment plants and would not be easily
determined during project implementation.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards: The findings of the EIA in the two provinces formed the basis of the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) with mitigation measures to allow achievement of the PDOs. The
Environment and Safety Officer (ESO) within each TSU was assigned to oversee the
implementation of the EMP in conformity with the Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01) and
the Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12).
       The ESO monitored the work of contractors during the construction stage. Construction
safety remained a high priority for the two implementing agencies.
       Land acquisition was necessary in order to provide for 1) WWTPs 2) pumping stations
and 3) drainage outfall channels. Lack of timely counterpart funding to purchase land caused
some project delays. Two reports on the progress of land acquisition and resettlement covering
Rasht and Anzali were prepared in November 2007 and July 2008 respectively.
       To ensure safety of sludge for re-use by farmers as soil conditioner or fertilizer, the
adopted treatment processes, the one year storage period, and the control of industrial discharges
to the sewage system had to comply with the WHO nematode standard and EU and FAO
guidelines. It was expected that an ―activated‖ sludge process with nutrient control by the
Biological Nutrient Removal system would be an option for the three WWTPs. The Anzali
lagoon would thus be protected.
       Mazandaran (Sari and Babol) and Guilan (Rasht and Anzali) Septage Management
Studies which addressed the wastes from households not connected to the wastewater network
were considered useful by the water companies.
       The Emergency Operation Plan for the Sari and Babol was completed and approved,
while for Rasht and Anzali the final draft is available in Farsi. In addition public awareness and
safety workshops were conducted.


Fiduciary

The financial management arrangements in both Guilan and Mazandaran have been satisfactory
during the implementation period. Initial delays in issuing FMRs were addressed by installing
the Bank accounting software that was customized and configured for the project. An accountant
provided hands-on training to the TSU Financial Officer (FO) on system functionality. The TSU
FO in each company posted data on commitments, disbursements, projections and overall
financial status and generated quarterly reports for project management reviews and decision
making.

The Bank‘s advice on strengthening the financial management was followed. After installation
of the new software and training, the financial management aspects continued to meet the
requirements of the project in a satisfactory manner. The quarterly FMRs were generated through
the system and remitted on a timely basis to the Bank. The project budgets and disbursement
projections have been updated periodically. The project SAs were reconciled periodically with
the banks‘ statements and the Bank‘s client connection and withdrawal applications were issued
                                               13
on a timely basis with minor deductions being applied to them by the Bank. All payments were
backed by signed contract or purchase orders. The Financial Officer in each TSU followed due
diligence procedures and maintained good relations with the Financial Controller in the
Management and Planning Organization.

Both implementing agencies submitted audit reports and audited financial statements in
accordance with the legal agreement. Audits included project and entity audits that were received
by the Bank and the audit findings which in general were all acceptable to the Bank with minor
qualifications that were addressed by the TSUs.

Procurement

Based on the Bank‘s ex-post procurement review, the procurement process followed by the
Government was satisfactory, albeit initially quite slow, and the procurement risk for the project
was rated as moderate. Filing was available and well kept; time allowed for submission of bids
was generally sufficient and bids were being opened in public at stipulated time right after bid
submission. Minutes of bid opening and records of bid security were maintained.

In connection with the UN sanctions technical specifications had to be reviewed against the list
of prohibited items identified by the relevant the U.N. Security Council Resolutions. All the
requirements were in compliance.

The Bank addressed issues of procurement by emphasizing the need to establish competent
technical staff in TSUs. It arranged extensive training and hired a consultant expert on Bank
procurement procedures for 18 months to assist in the preparation of bidding documents. The
MWWC hired a procurement consultant to prepare bidding documents as the Bank suggested
that a suitable contract management arrangement should be made since several packages
especially under Sari and Babol water works experienced severe cost overruns.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

      Completion of ongoing works through Government funding by 2013 i. All the obligations
       related to signed contracts as well as the required funds to complete unfinished civil
       works contracts and installation of the BNRs units in Anzali will be financed by the
       Government. Cost estimates are summarized in the following table:

                             Wastewater



      Operation phase: the two utilities have prepared their O&M plans and the objective is to
       privatize the operation and maintenance services of the infrastructure including the
       treatment plants and the network.
      Tariffs: the government subsidies are being removed; therefore the tariff structure is
       being changed to cover the full O&M cost. This will lead to a reduction in the working
       ratio. Worldwide experience points to the fact that a full cost recovery in the provision of
       wastewater treatment services is not a feasible goal and that investments are highly
       subsidized given the public good nature of this service.
      The water quality will be monitored through established stations and laboratories. The
       project should follow the recommendations made by the EMP. A study was done to
       establish waterborne diseases incidence for all four cities and this study should be
       repeated after the project completion. The sludge study in Guilan shows that co-
       composting and land application are the optimum options. It is assumed that the existing
       composting factory in the city of Rasht can receive the sludge from wastewater treatment
       plants. It should be noted that for this option, organizational participation between
       GWWC and the Rasht municipality is necessary.

In the Guilan province the coverage of the wastewater collection system was planned to be 40%
during the first implementation phase covered by this project. It will probably take another ten
years before the wastewater collection system reaches an acceptable level of population
coverage. The estimated funds required for completion of water and wastewater works amount to
US$500 million and this has been budgeted for in the Government‘s sector investment plans.

In the Mazandaran province the estimated coverage of the wastewater collection system was
planned to be 30% during the first implementation phase (covered by this project). It will
probably take another ten years before the wastewater collection system reaches an acceptable
level of population coverage. The estimated funds required for completion of water and
wastewater works amount to US$400 million, and this has also been budgeted for in the
Government‘s sector investment plans.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Establishing modern wastewater and sanitation infrastructure along with efficient water supply
systems to meet the growing demand for services in the Northern cities were relevant objectives
designed in line with the Government‘s aim to improve the quality of life for its citizens.
Moreover the project‘s PDOs of improving services, and generating health and environmental
benefits and improving the efficiency, sustainability and financial autonomy of the WWCs
remain still highly relevant for Iran‘s continued economic and social development, particularly
the improvement in living standards of the poorest section of the urban population. Project
design was generally appropriate for the achievement of the PDOs, although the scope of the
activities to be achieved within the five year implementation period would have been optimistic
even under normal conditions. With the disruption during implementation as a result of
application of sanctions it became impossible for the project to be completed within the original
timeframe.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

                               PDO 1: Enhance the quality of life

  (a) By improving the reliability of water supply systems through rehabilitation and extension

Rasht & Anzali water supply systems in Guilan: In Rasht, the target was achieved. In Anzali
the target was also achieved and more: 30% above target for rehabilitation and 66% above target
for extension. The progress in household connections was only 52% of the target. In Anzali, the
Ghazian reservoir (30,000 m3) and pumping stations have been completed. In Rasht, the Lankan
reservoir (30,000 m3) and two small reservoirs (2*40,000m3) were delayed by 18 months. The
bidding for UFW analysis and equipment occurred five months prior to project closing.

Sari & Babol water supply systems in Mazandaran: The most important achievement has
been that all targets for household connections were met, whereas the works for rehabilitation of
distribution piping and the extension of the distribution network advanced by 84% and 94%,
respectively. A reservoir (20,000 m3 capacity) was completed in Babol and five existing wells
were connected to the distribution network. For both Sari and Babol, the UFW analysis was 50%
complete.

The most important achievement of the project has been the rehabilitation of distribution piping
and the laying of extension pipes in the four cities in Guilan and Mazandaran. Sari and Anzali
cities have almost completed the water distribution systems. In the city of Anzali, the distribution
works have been overachieved.
                                                16
The UFW rates for Rasht and Anzali are 27% and 21% respectively. In Sari and Babol the UFW
is estimated at 28%. It is expected that once all the works are completed the UFW rate will be
lower.

(b) By improving health and urban environmental conditions by providing wastewater collection
                                   and treatment facilities

Rasht & Anzali Wastewater: Construction of trunk mains, laterals, interceptors was about 50%
achieved. The wastewater treatment plant in Anzali has been completed and is operational. The
construction of the Ghazian wastewater treatment plant was 30% complete and is expected to be
completed using Government funds over next two to three years. The 24 hour emergency
reservoir for Rasht will also be covered by the Government funds. The intermediate outcome
indicators could not be fully met at the time of project closing.

Sari & Babol Wastewater: The wastewater treatment plant in Babol has been completed. The
wastewater treatment plant in Sari was 97% completed by project closing date. The quality of
construction is highly satisfactory (see pictures in Annex 2). In Sari two pumping stations have
been completed and in Babol three pumping stations are under construction. The completion of
house connections had progressed together with the construction of collection network, pumping
stations and wastewater treatment plants. The septage management study has been completed.



(c) By contributing to environmental protection of natural resources (especially the Anzali
lagoon)

Because the wastewater treatment plants are not yet fully operational and the sewerage networks
are not yet fully connected, the water quality of the receiving water bodies, such as the Anzali
lagoon, has improved only slightly so far. A study was done to establish the baseline for
waterborne diseases for all four cities and should be repeated after project completion. Current
water quality parameters are listed in Annex 2.

Sludge management and discharge by the treatment plants in Anzali and Rasht has been an
overriding concern since both cities are responsible for 83% of urban waste discharged into the
Anzali lagoon. Design provisions were made for the installation of a BNR unit on each
wastewater treatment plant to ensure effluent of acceptable quality for discharge into receiving
water bodies. As agreed with the Government (at the time of the MTR in 2008) these packages
will be taken up by the water and wastewater company using their own resources. The
emergency reservoir in Rasht, expected to provide a further mitigation measure for the Anzali
lagoon in case of malfunction of the treatment process, will also be financed by the water and
wastewater company. Active sludge management will also ensure improvement in the quality of
water bodies.


                                              17
PDO: (2) Improvement in the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of WWCs

   Financial sustainability: The working ratio for Guilan was 1.98 and for Mazandaran 1.6
    reflecting deterioration of the financial performance of both companies over the
    implementation period. Considering the recent changes in tariffs it is assumed that the
    working ratio will improve in the coming years.
   Operational efficiency: During implementation, measures to promote operational efficiencies
    were also undertaken by the water and wastewater companies, such as improve collection
    efficiency and reduce expenses. The Government is promoting private sector participation in
    performance-based operation and maintenance contracts for the wastewater and water supply
    schemes
   Improvements in technical and environment capacities: The technical and managerial
    capacities of both the Guilan and Mazandaran water and wastewater companies have
    improved.

3.3 Efficiency

See Annex 3. No economic or financial analysis of the project has been attempted since the
physical works were not completed. It was not feasible to do an economic and financial analysis
and compare the target values with the actual values at the end of the project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

At the time of project closing the water supply components of the four cities were satisfactory.
However, the implementation of household connections under all four wastewater treatment
components was not fully completed. As such the protection of the Anzali lagoon remains a high
priority, and this is recognized by the Government who is committed to completing the
household connections and installing BNR units over the next two to three years using
Government funds.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

During the construction phase of the project, a significant number of temporary jobs had been
created. In addition, several permanent jobs have also been created for the facilities‘ operation
and maintenance, and more jobs will be created after project completion. Bank missions
confirmed the dire physical state of sanitation and its impacts especially in the low-lying poor
residential areas. The poorest sections of the population in the project areas are hardest hit by the
absence of water supply and sanitation services and will benefit most once the works are fully
completed as planned.
                                                 18
The social and gender impact of the project is particularly important for women, since they have
traditional roles in water procurement, child care and caring for sick family members.

(b) Institutional Change/ Strengthening

The staff of the National Water and Wastewater Company (NWWC), including the Guilan and
Mazandaran water and wastewater companies including other provincial WWCs benefited from
the project‘s institutional strengthening aspects, transfer of technical know-how and high-level
capacity building through the various consultancies that have been contracted. The capacity of
national and local consulting engineers and contractors has also been strengthened because of the
experience gained from the project. Workshops conducted on asset management, use of a
condominial approach as a low-cost technical solution, sewerage systems and other relevant
topics have succeeded in creating awareness on the possibilities of improving operational
efficiency of WWCs through non-conventional low-cost approaches.

In the public education context, a public awareness program was implemented through mass
media, distribution of brochures and similar methods. Twelve training workshops were
organized in the province of Guilan for contractors, consultants and the experts of the Guilan
water and wastewater company on safety and environment. In addition the World Bank Institute
has assisted the government in preparing several workshops related to institutional strengthening
and sanitation strategy. The workshops were held at the national level. To assist all local water
and wastewater companies, the National Water and Wastewater Company (NWWC) has
documented the results and achievements of the health and environmental studies undertaken
under the project. Training materials are available on the NWWC‘s website.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The Bank introduced a new way of doing business in the water and sanitation sector in Iran.
Issues raised during project implementation with respect to short-term environmental safety
aspects and land acquisition have taught water and wastewater companies that in order to
maximize gains from investment, it is important to align sector objectives with the will and
support of the intended beneficiaries. Responsiveness to social issues will gain communities‘
confidence and promote their wastewater treatment services, benefiting long term financial
sustainability of companies. This approach represents a sharp contrast to past project
interventions where the government focused almost entirely on ‗hardware‘ components and
beneficiary participation was seen as less important. The transition to more participatory
approaches will necessarily be a longer term undertaking, but the project is an important step in
this direction.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

(a) The risk level depends on the government‘s priorities for allocating resources to timely
    completion of the project works. See Government ICR letter in Annex 7.
(b) Interviews indicated that despite the general perception of the population (86%) that the
    sewerage system is useful, 40% of the population surveyed indicated that the price was too
    high compared to the service provided and 38% believed that paying for a sewerage system
    was an imposed cost.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The preparation of the current project started in parallel with the Ahwaz and Shiraz project. It
took a year longer to complete the appraisal in order to ensure adequate technical, financial,
economic and institutional aspects. It was a project highly relevant for the country and in
coherence with the major concerns expressed by the Government and public. The project
intended to find solutions to the deteriorating state of the environment caused by lack of
sanitation and wastewater treatment plants. Physical infrastructure was well defined with clear
outputs and outcomes. Adequacy, reliability and safety of water supplies to the growing urban
population and ensuring 100% coverage of the growing population in the four northern cities was
another important social dimension supported by the project. The Bank considered ‗delays in
implementation capacity‘ as one of the major risks and addressed it by providing extensive
training. Other reasons were delays in municipality and police permits. During preparation, the
project recognized that a lack of coordination among sector entities was an important risk factor.
Delays in project implementation and funding shortfalls led to postponement or cancellation of
some elements of project components.

The project design was based on the expectation of full cost recovery by WWCs. The PDO
rested on an expectation of a 20% tariff increase without considering the short project
implementation period.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The Bank planned two supervision missions a year during the first half of project
implementation. Due to travel restriction between January 2009 and May 2010 missions were not
carried out for 14 months. Accumulated delays and cost overruns added pressures to
                                               20
procurement and contract management issues. Nonetheless, the Bank missions provided expert
advice regarding procurement and financial management matters, thereby enhancing the
financial management skills of TSUs, and also on safeguard issues connected with land
acquisition and construction safety, such that the overall compliance of safeguard policy 4.1 was
promoted. The Bank financial management exercises provided projections for the budget
shortfalls and facilitated the prioritization of procurement packages with the government.

The Bank encouraged tariff increases to reduce GWWC and MWWC‘s financial uncertainty and
improve their long term financial sustainability. The Bank drew attention to the fact that tariff
increases would also help alleviate the burden of budgetary support that would otherwise need to
be provided by the government in case of funding shortfalls. The government approved a
―targeted subsidies law‖ towards the end of the project, and this should support the eventual
achievement of this aspect of the PDO.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Delays in the transfer of funds (both from the Bank and from Government) and associated
uncertainties impacted the pace of implementation of the works as contractors were hesitant to
accelerate their activities under such uncertain conditions. As such, it was not feasible for the
project objectives to be fully completed within the original time frame, yet no project extension
was provided.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During project preparation, the Borrower‘s commitment and ownership were reflected through:
(i) the government giving high priority to the sector, particularly to WW in its long-term
planning and its request to the Bank for continued support to the sector; (ii) MOE financing from
its own budget the background studies and its WTP for detailed engineering and preparation of
tenders for the project; (iii) WWCs taking initiatives to respond quickly to the Bank's
requirements and formally agreeing on the proposed strategy in the sector and future
collaboration with the Bank; and (iv) willingness of the government to fund urgent operations
(construction of network, wastewater treatment plants, etc.) in many cities prior to the project
implementation.

The Government had established a strong National Water & Wastewater Company (NWWEC)
within the MOE, reporting directly to the Vice Minister for Water. NWWEC through its own
TSU staffed with a competent manager and national consultants was very committed and
supportive of the project and extended full cooperation to the task team during implementation.
It was instrumental in keeping the project moving forward.
                                               21
However, the government‘s commitment fluctuated during project implementation. Not only
were tariff reforms allowed to lag way behind the inflationary pressures experienced by the water
and wastewater companies, the government also delayed the timely availability of counterpart
funds needed for project execution. The Government committed funds to continue with the
implementation of ongoing packages for the execution of the project after project closing.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The performance of the Guilan water and wastewater company (GWWC) responsible for the
execution of projects in Rasht and Anzali was moderately satisfactory. The performance of the
Mazandaran water and wastewater company (MWWC) responsible for the execution of projects
in Sari and Babol was moderately satisfactory. With the satisfactory performance of NWWEC
TSU providing oversight and technical advice to the companies TSUs, the overall performance
of the implementing agencies has been rated moderately satisfactory.

Project management: The project closed with delays in the implementation of wastewater
treatment components. Procurement and project management had been more of an issue in the
case of GWWC than MWWC. Much time was lost in addition to the delays on account of fund
transfer issues. Due to the large size and complexity of the wastewater treatment components,
GWWC could not complete the critical elements like wastewater treatment plant and pumping
stations. In Mazandaran, the key elements of the sewerage system (including wastewater
treatment plants and pumping stations in Sari and Babol) have been largely completed,
underscoring the fact the project in Guilan being twice the size of that in Mazandaran made it
difficult for GWWC to manage all challenges within a given period of time.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In view of challenges and issues that could have been avoided the overall Borrower performance
has been rated moderately satisfactory. Although tariff reforms were not implemented during the
physical execution of the project, understanding the issue of subsidized tariffs at the high
political level brings hope for the future financial autonomy of GWWC and MWWC. The issue
of financial performance of water and wastewater companies is expected to be resolved once the
Government starts implementing its policy of removing all price subsidies from water tariffs.
The recent campaigns for the project are a reflection of understanding that reaching out to
communities is a way to promote sustainability of the project.




                                               22
6. Lessons Learned

1- Realism in project design is improved and risk to project development outcomes reduced
   when project preparation is adequate.

Realism in project design should be reflected by the project‘s complete assessment of all the
local realities on the ground during project preparation. In the case of the current project, this
should have translated into evidence of adequate completion of preparation work for land
acquisition and detailed estimates of engineering designs; preparation of bidding documents for
the first year prepared by the borrower. The construction of wastewater treatment facilities
cannot be fully implemented in five years.

2- Improved coordination should be an important aspect of institutional strengthening

 Institutional strengthening has focused on capacity building and training which was very
important for the project. However, although sector coordination was recognized as a possible
problem area at the time of project preparation/appraisal, it was not given due consideration.
Coordination among the various stakeholders should be seen as an aspect of institutional
development and an important determinant for project results.

3- Despite individual and team efforts to implement a project in a professional manner, there
   are factors outside government and bank control that can have a major impact

The UN sanctions constituted an impediment to the smooth implementation of the project since
they impacted the transfer of funds for project activities. In addition, the inability of the Bank
team to travel to Iran for a period of eighteen months created a strained relationship. Without
proper and continuous supervision and the financial resources required for this task, it is evident
that implementation gets delayed and capacities diminish.

4- Avoid unrealistic expectations in terms of tariff adjustment. Projects should be designed
   within the realm of realistic estimates and assumptions.

There is also a need to identify indicators that can monitor variables that can be directly
attributed to the project. The working ratio is not always the most appropriate indicator for
financial sustainability as there are many external factors that affect it such as cost of materials
(steel, cement and others) and energy. A utility could be improving certain efficiencies but strong
increases in market prices will affect the expenses considerably.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Detailed economic and cost-benefit analysis of the project was conducted at appraisal. The net
benefits were derived for the period 2005 to 2009 in parallel with Iran‘s WS and WW
development programs. The main benefit of the water supply component would be realized by
the additional population who receive connections. The benefit was determined by estimating
the cost of alternative means of meeting water demand if piped water was not provided. This
would be the cost of water purchased from vendors estimated to be US$0.75-US$0.85 per m3.
Added to this cost was the households‘ cost of installation and O&M of storage tanks. Higher
access and availability of clean water would result in higher demand from households. This was
estimated as another benefit of the project. These benefits represented the minimum value of the
true benefits since benefits derived from hygiene, quality and commodity advantages of access to
potable pipe water were not accounted for. The water sub-projects were largely justified based
on the estimated rates of EIRR between 15% for Babol and 46% for Anzali. Sensitivity analysis
was conducted by reducing benefits and increasing costs by 10%. The results indicated that
IRRs remained higher than the cost of capital assumed at 10%.

In case of the water supply components, the project was expected to generate pecuniary and non
pecuniary benefits for each city. The main cost avoided and dominant benefit of the project was
the: (i) avoidance of the cost of absorption wells and their maintenance. Other expected benefits
were:- (ii) reduction in water-borne diseases and associated costs of hospitalization, medication,
loss of workdays and school days; (iii) reuse of treated WW in irrigation with associated increase
in agricultural value-added; (iv) increase in tourism activity in a highly popular summer resort in
Anzali; and (v) general improvements in the conditions of immediate neighborhoods and the
environment in general with the associated improvement in the quality of life. Most information
for benefits (ii), (iii) and (iv) was taken from estimates presented by feasibility studies, social
assessments and local health departments. The benefit reflected by (v) was not accounted for on
account of difficulties in estimations. The base case scenario yielded EIRR between 2% for Sari
and 11% for Anzali with a return of 6-7% for Babol and Rasht. The returns were low as expected
given that the four cities had started almost from scratch in WW services whereby initial
investments were large while population coverage would be gradual due to technical and
managerial constraints. Realization of qualitative benefits, such as improvements in
environmental conditions and quality of life justified the investments in wastewater components.

Detailed Financial analysis for each water and wastewater was conducted at appraisal by
considering benefits of increased (i) water sales and wastewater disposal services, (ii) increased
revenue from subscription fees, (iii) increased income from connection fees, and (iv) savings
from reduced UFW. The FIRR for MWWC was at 22.4% and GWWC at 11.8%. An important
assumption behind FIRR calculations was the high tariff increases that would fully cover O&M
expenses. In reality, tariffs moved up marginally (5% for some categories) against the
expectation of tariff reforms. Although financial analysis has not been conducted for this review,

                                                32
it is evident that the PDO target of attaining financial sustainability would remain at a
substantial risk as long as tariffs do not go up to cost recovery levels. Also, the companies would
have to focus on implementing connections especially in case of wastewater components. By
comparing working ratios, MWWC reflects better financial performance than GWWC.

Future financial situation of GWWC and MWWC rests on the following: (a) with the completion
of investments supported by the current loan, they have to incur additional financial burden of
the repayment of debt; (b) the loan obligation for GWWC is twice that of MWWC, and (c) new
investments have to be operated and maintained even while household connections are not
materialized. In December 2010 the Government announced a policy of eliminating subsidies to
the various utilities and replaces them with targeted subsidies to low-income beneficiaries. This
would imply that average tariffs would rise from 8 cents/m3 to 28 cents/m3. The implementation
of such reforms would ease cost recovery for WWCs and promote financial sustainability.
Nevertheless, the tariff structure is needlessly complex and there is a need for comprehensive
reforms. Historically, sewage charges were based on 70% of the water bills. With the
development of wastewater facilities, costs of sanitation services should be assessed separately
from water so as to evaluate the appropriateness of the existing tariff structure. Since most urban
households were already connected to the water network and only a few were connected to a
sewerage network that was yet to be constructed in most cases, the issues of willingness to pay
and affordability of connection rights was expected to arise in the future although the
Government decided to provide bank credit to facilitate connections including the required works
inside homes.

WB's performance

The experience of close cooperation with the WB team on the northern cities water and
sanitation project since the stages of project preparation and the feasibility studies can be divided
into the following two periods:

1- The feasibility studies and implementation: At the beginning of this period, the WB's team
underwent changes in structure of its technical staff, while the TTL was changed on three
occasions during the implementation phase up to loan closing date. Fortunately, these changes
enhanced the capacities and qualifications of the task team to the extent that at final stages of the
implementation and before the closing date, the project benefitted form the presence of a very
qualified TTL and his team of experts. Under the supervision of this team, in addition to
appropriate guidance for enhancing the quality of executive works and proposing practical ideas
to Iranian experts in their project implementation tasks, many training and capacity building
workshops and courses were also organized. Therefore, if the task team's performance during
this period is to be evaluated according to WB standards, it would definitely be rated as
satisfactory.

2- The project's closing stages and problems related to the transfer of funds: Given the lessons
learned from previous loans, the GWWC and MWWC's performance as far as disbursement is
concerned showed an improvement both in quality and the speed of action. However, at different
sections a number of problems were imposed on the project by the Bank. Delays of up to six
months in payment of invoices caused by the non-replenishment of Special Accounts, increased
bureaucracy in the Financial procedures and the imposition of greater than necessary
documentation as a pre-requisite for PAR Code to ensure the proper expenditure of funds in the
targeted projects as well as other problems during the loan period had a negative impact and
undermined the speed of loan disbursement.

Throughout the loan period, GWWC and MWWC fully complied with the WB guidelines and
regulations and tried to improve the processes according to schedules mentioned in PAD and the
recommendations of the WB task and monitoring teams. The different Aide Memoires bear
witness to the successful performance of the companies in this regard. It was expected that the
World Bank would agree with a request for loan extension to ensure the completion of ongoing
and critical packages, but unfortunately, this request was rejected. In the meantime, to ensure the
project's continuity during the default of payment by the WB, the companies paid the contractors
on account basis from their own internal resources.

Project Management

As mentioned in the Institutional and Implementation arrangement of the PAD, the project
management has a significant role in the progress and ensuring the quality and quantity of the
project. According to PAD, the project management was to be carried out by the water and
wastewater companies with the assistance and support of the TSUs. However, the issue at stake
in this regard relates to the performances of the said TSUs, as, for all practical purposes, the role
                                                 37
of these units in the project implementation was much greater that the one traced out in the PAD.
This is proven in the ICR prepared for the cities of Ahwaz and Shiraz, which states that the
projects were implemented mainly by the TSUs.

The experiences of TSUs in Guilan and Mazandaran can be described as follows:

1- Guilan TSU: GWWC established this unit from the beginning and according to PAD
recommendation by assigning a project manager from the Company. The unit's condition for the
initial two years of the project can be described as follows:

   -   The manager selected for TSU lacked the capacity and expertise necessary for the task.

   -   The expert consultants, who were to form the core of the Unit, were selected by the
       mentioned manager alone and for this reason the selected individuals also lacked the
       necessary potentials, expertise and qualification to carry out the assignment.

   -   The Company's management showed no inclination towards employment of qualified
       consultants at adequate fees. Therefore experienced specialists were not interested in
       collaboration.
   -   In Guilan, the Environment Safeguard Officer (ESO) was initially an expert from outside
       the company's body. Despite a high academic background (University Professor on
       environmental engineering) and a full time cooperation contract, his actual involvement
       was unfortunately on part time basis and kept to a minimum, which created a number of
       difficulties for the environmental studies and other relevant functions, with some
       consequences such as the use of inexperienced consultants and delays in the start and
       completion of the projects continuing on until the closing date of the project. After about
       three years and the follow ups by the NWWEC's Technical Support Unit, he was finally
       replaced by one independent consultant and an expert from within the Company. This led
       to considerable improvement and progress of the environmental and safety studies of the
       projects. The second consultant's cooperation lasted for a year, after which the
       Company's expert took over, showing satisfactory performance.

After about two years and observing the poor performance of the projects in Guilan, on the
insistence of the NWWEC TSU, which had an oversight and coordination role in the projects,
and the agreement of the NWWEC management, the GWWC TSU underwent changes to benefit
a suitable management and better qualified staff and was subsequently able to better assist the
projects by steering it on the right path.

It can safely be claimed that, had the initial selection of TSU management and staff been
undertaken with greater care, the GWWC's performance would have been much better than today
and this project could have even been considered as among the successful endeavors of the Bank.

2- Like in Guilan, the Mazandaran Water and Wastewater Company selected a TSU Manager
from its staff and engaged individual consultants for the different expertise requirements.
However, due to their poor performance, all the said consultants were replaced after one year
with experts from within the Company's body. The main reason for the poor performance of the
selected experts can be related to the limited vision of the MWWC management in paying
appropriate fees to engage experienced specialist.


                                               38
In Mazandaran an environmental expert from within the MWWC was assigned for the task on
full time basis. Nearly all the environmental projects of the Mazandaran Province were
completed on time and at an appropriate quality. The performance of the Mazandaran ESO is
therefore rated as satisfactory.

3- In summary, it can be concluded that:

   -   The initial selection of a competent TSU manager is of great importance.

   -   The Unit's team of experts must be competent too, and in particular they should have a
       good working command of the English language, without which their expertise might
       prove to be futile.

   -   Limiting fees and salaries must not be the prime criteria in selection of qualified and
       experienced specialists.

   -   Experts chosen from the Company's staff must have the necessary qualifications for the
       task and the incentives for greater activity must be created through higher scale of
       salaries and wages.

   -   Although the idea of establishing a TSU instead of PMU for optimal use of the technical
       capacities of the water and wastewater companies is quite constructive, but the
       experiences of northern cities TSUs and before them the Shiraz and Ahwaz TSUs have
       shown them to be interested in affairs beyond their defined assignments and their
       interference in and interactions with executive departments in the Company undermine
       the trend of project implementation.

   -   The comparison between the experiences gained in the Provinces of Guilan and
       Mazandaran underlines the need to revise the structure of these companies' Technical
       Support Units. On this basis, it is recommended to separate the safety and environmental
       sections and these functions be referred to either relevant units or to experienced experts
       in the companies. For instance, in recent years work safety bureaus have been established
       in the companies. Given their mandates and subject to necessary trainings, they could
       easily take over the ESO on safety issues.
   -   Different actions such as organizing training workshops throughout the country (in the
       fame of the WB loan to the cities of Ahwaz an Shiraz) as well as periodical forums of
       ESOs from project in different cities and provision of scientific and technical support by
       NWWEC TSU were taken to build capacity on environment and safety issues. Despite
       this, these actions are evaluated as inadequate as far as the number of individuals trained
       and the number of environmental and safety subjects taught. It is recommended that there
       would be a greater number of persons from the loan recipient companies participating in
       the training sessions, and the subject matters and the training procedures would be
       arranged in such a manner as to ensure that all the experts have passed the necessary
       trainings before the start of the projects. In most cases, this procedure would ensure the
       necessary capacity building in the companies and would eliminate the need to engage
       independent environmental and safety consultant from the province.

   -   Although the Bank's experts have provided scientific and technical guidance and
       recommendations upon request, it was expected that the World Bank would have
       organized specialized training workshops on environmental and social issues to transfer
                                             39
    the global experiences on the subject, as it has done for other issues related to the
    projects.

-   The experience shows that a great amount of time has been spent on preparing the TOR
    and obtaining the relevant No Objection from the Bank. Whereas if these TORs would
    have been prepared at the beginning of the projects with the assistance of WB experts and
    standardized for all provinces, they would have made a significant impact on timely start
    and completion of the environmental studies.

-   Moreover, the availability of guidelines and forms for the studies, particularly in the
    environmental and health monitoring section, in such a manner as to meet the ICR
    requirements, would have assisted in the execution of these studies. It should be
    mentioned that the Ministry of Energy has in recent years prepared guidelines for
    monitoring the quality of surface and ground water resources, but there still is a need for
    similar guidelines for health and other environmental studies, report generation and
    documentation.

-   The experiences of EOP and Septage studies in Guilan have shown that the selection of
    inappropriate consultant can lead to undesirable consequences for projects (at least in the
    form of elongation of the projects' duration). Although a part of the problems is related to
    the performance of the initial ESO in the Province, but a revision of processes (for
    instance NWWEC involvement in the consultant selection process) can be instrumental.
-   A part of the problems undermining the environmental projects, especially the
    procurement of lab equipment for GWWC is related to the delays in obtaining the WB no
    objection and subsequently the problems of the transfer of funds.

-   To build capacity and to apply the experiences gained from the environmental and safety
    aspects of the WB financed projects, NWWEC in collaboration with the experts involved
    in these projects has documented and published the results and the lessons learnt. So far
    in this context, the Guidelines on Safety for Execution of Water and Wastewater Projects
    and the Standards for Auditing the Safety Status of the Companies have been prepared
    and have been notified to all the water and wastewater companies by the NWWEC
    Managing Director. Moreover a book titled Septage Management – Lessons Learned
    from the Experience of WB Projects is under compilation and will be published shortly.
    Plans have also been prepared for other books on environmental studies.
-   Given the plans to ensure funds from domestic and international financial institutions,
    particularly the Islamic Development Bank, and the latter's insistence on undertaking
    environmental studies based on WB model; the experiences gained from WB financed
    projects have had a positive impact on the time and quality of the requested
    environmental studies.

-   Given completion of the ongoing project in near future, the quality of life and
    environment in the covered area is expected to improve significantly. To assess this
    impact, it would be necessary to continue the EMP and to repeat the health studies.

-   The safety conditions of the projects show that despite efforts made by TSU –ESO of the
    provinces, there is a considerable gap with the ideal situation. Given the recent initiatives
    taken by NWWEC on the basis of the WB projects' experiences, the safety conditions of
    the projects are expected to improve considerably in near future.

loan.

The proposed Bank loan of US$148.6 million financed about 66.3 percent of the project cost.
The rest of the cost (US$75.5 million) was to be financed by the borrower.

3. The project components:

The project will include the following components:

3.1 Civil work

3.1.1. Rasht Wastewater

Wastewater Collection Network

The proposed first phase extension (2005 to 2010) of the wastewater collection system includes:
   -   Construction of 70400 house connections
   -   A collection network 558 km

This component comprised of executing 558 km GRP and poly ethylene pipes. In detail design
total length of all packages was estimated to amount to 280 kilometers, out of which 169 km
have been completed. The remaining works are ongoing.

Wastewater treatment

   -   The Rasht wastewater treatment plant had been under construction before the WB loan.
       The addition of a biological nutrient removal unit was foreseen in this project.
   -   The reservoir tank to store wastewater for 24 in the treatment plant was added in this
       project.

In the midterm review both the above projects were removed from the implementation plan.
According to agreement these will be completed through local budget.

Trunk mains

This component involved two contracts for construction of Wastewater collection Main Trunk of
about 13691 meters in length, consisting of 5597 meter using pipes of 600 mm in diameter, 1500
meter with diameter 800 mm, 1500 meter with diameter 1000 mm and a further 5094 meter
using pipes of 1400 mm in diameter made out of polycrete material. These packages are under
implementation.


                                               43
Pump and lift stations

This component involved the construction of 16 pump and lift stations, out of which four are
under construction.

3.1.2. Rasht Water Supply System

This component aims at improving the service provision in Rasht through regulating the pressure
and availability of water in the distribution network, as well as reduction in losses due to leakage.
This will be achieved by rehabilitation and extension of some 701 km of piping, out of which
641 km were completed, and ground storage tanks. One storage tank of 30,000 m(3) (with a
physical progress rate of 56 percent) and two 40,000 m(3) (with a physical progress of about 90
percent).

There will also be a program to improve operational efficiency and to reduce unaccounted for
water (including some instrumentation for automation, operation and maintenance equipment
which were not realized due to transfer problem in the World Bank).

Saravan- Lakan transmission main line (1,250 mm) which was removed from the World Bank
project and is now under construction through local budget.

3.1.3. Anzali Wastewater

Wastewater Collection system

   -   Construction of 27000 house connections
   -   A collection network of 253 km

This component comprised of executing 253 km GRP and poly ethylene pipes. In the detail
design the total length of all packages was estimated to amount to 160 kilometer, out of which
130 km have been completed. The remaining works are under construction and they will be
completed shortly.

This component also included provision of 27,400 new house connections.

Wastewater Treatment

   -   This component comprised of Civil detail design, construction, operation and
       maintenance of ANZALI Wastewater Treatment Plant-Eastern Zone (Based on available
       Treatment Process Design) with nominal capacity of 12000 m(3) / day, which will greatly
       improve the quality of the existing water bodies. In addition, a better water quality will be
       provided for the agricultural use or for direct flow to the Caspian Sea.
   -   Upgrading of treatment plant to BNR and emergency basin.
   -   Completion of ongoing collection system works.

In the midterm review upgrading of exist wastewater treatment plant to BNR and its emergency
basins had been removed from WB loan implementation program.



                                                 44
Pump and lift Stations

14 lift and pump stations are planned in this project.

3.1.4. Anzali Water Supply Systems

This component will rehabilitate and extend Anzali‘s water distribution network with 155 km of
primary and secondary distribution network. However, during the detail design, the total length
of all estimated packages was increased to 211 kilometers. This component is completed.

3.2. Laboratory and operation equipment

After receiving the World Bank‘s no objection on bidding documents for four packages on lab
equipment the NCB procedure were followed:

   -   RG9: Procurement of video camera for well inspection.

   -   RG10: procurement of wastewater and laboratories equipment (HLPC and TIC analyzer).

   -   RG11: procurement of wastewater and laboratories equipment(Microscope and Camera)

   -   RG12: procurement of wastewater and laboratories equipment (General and
       Spectrometer).

   -   RG13: Computer Hardware and UPS.

The evaluation reports for these packages were submitted to the World Bank and approved.
However, due to problems related to transfer of funds, these packages are still pending.

3.3. Supports to the Guilan Water and Wastewater Company

Under this component the project will provide technical assistance, training and consultant
services for Institutional development and environmental management plan, Technical Support
Unit (TSU), engineering design and construction supervision.

3.3.1. Services

To enhance the capacity of GWWC, the staffs for TSU were chosen from private sectors. They
included:

   -   TSU Manager (one full time GWWC staff)

   -   TSU Procurement Officer (one full time Individual Consultant)

   -   TSU Water and Wastewater Engineer (one full time Individual Consultant until year 4 of
       the project the after replaced by one full time GWWC staff)

   -   TSU Environmental Officer (one full time Individual Consultant until year 4 of the
       project, thereafter replaced by one full time GWWC staff)

   -   TSU Financial Officer (one full time Individual Consultant until year 4 of the project,
       thereafter replaced by one full time GWWC staff).
                                              45
   -   Procurement experts (one full time GWWC staff and one part time Individual Consultant

   -   For capacity building and transfer of experience of individual consultant to staffs of
       GWWC employed to same above position staffs from GWWC.

Feasibility study and detailed design

To undertake the feasibility studies and to prepare the detailed design for the extension and
rehabilitation of water distribution as well as the wastewater works including the collection
system, the wastewater treatment plant and the pumping stations, qualified consultants were
selected through local procedure for Rasht and Anzali.

Construction Supervision for water and waste water work in Rasht

For supervision of construction contracts for execution of the water supply and distribution
system, and reservoir, as well as the wastewater collection system and relevant pump stations in
Rasht and Anzali; qualified consultants were selected through World Bank ICB procedure.

Environmental Studies
   -   Furthermore, the environmental studies such as EMP and the Water Borne Diseases
       (Health) studies, which indicate the level of PSO achievement, were new experiences for
       the Company. It is interested to continue the trend and to assess the impacts of the water
       and sanitation projects on the quality of life and environment.
   -   The ongoing CAP studies are expected to address and resolve the important issue of
       industrial discharges to the sewage system.
   -   Despite being addressed by the design consultant, the issue of sludge management, as
       raised in the PAD, became a major challenge and concern for GWWC, especially from its
       environmental and social aspects. The studies have been able to remove a number of
       ambiguities and provide answers to some questions. Although there remains many works
       to be done before reaching a viable solution, but through GWWC's pursuance and the
       application of the consultant's recommendations, one of the proposed solutions will be
       finalized and the relevant executive operations will be launched in a very near future.
   -   The septage management project addressed an outstanding issue of wastewater and
       environment particularly in the northern provinces. There is a little experience in the
       country in this field and therefore finding a competent consultant was very difficult.
       Despite the efforts and some noticeable results, the selected consultant has unfortunately
       not been up to the task, although after the numerous meetings and instructions given
       these studies are expected to be completed soon. Since the problem of septage is common
       to other cities in the province, the Company looks forward to apply the outcomes of the
       studies to help in finding suitable solutions in other cities as well.
   -   The studies for Emergency Operation Plan (EOP) were also a new experience for the
       Company. In recent years the Province of Guilan and particularly the city of Rasht have
       experienced crises such as earthquakes and heavy snowfalls and the extraordinary water
       and wastewater problems related to these disasters. Following the events, a number of
       studies were undertaken to increase the safety of installations and to enhance the passive
       defense procedures. Nevertheless, there were no specific and comprehensive studies
       related to Emergency Operation Plan. The unfamiliarity of the subject for the consultant
       and the lack of experience in the field led to the lengthening of the studies, which are
       expected to conclude shortly, thereby enabling the Company to apply the outcomes to

                                              46
         prepare practical procedures during emergencies. In this context, it will be necessary for
         the Company to undertake the necessary planning and capacity building on the basis of
         the consultant's recommendations.

3.4. Conclusions

Rasht
   -     678 km water supply and distribution pipes have been executed.
   -     2 water storage tanks at a total volume of 80,000 m(3) (RW13 with 91.64 % physical
         progress and RW14 with 83.38 percent) and one water storage tank at a volume of 40000
         m(3) (with 61.72 percent physical progress) have been constructed.
   -     170 km wastewater collection pipes have been executed.
   -     4 main wastewater pumping stations have are under construction.

Anzali

   -     211 km water supply and distribution pipes have been completed.
   -     130 km wastewater collection pipe have been executed.

   -     4 main wastewater pumping stations and 7 lift stations are under construction.

   -     Ghazian wastewater treatment plant is under construction with a physical progress rate of
         40.21 percent.


3.5.Performance indicator

   -     The baseline for the working ratio at the beginning of the project was 1.15, while the
         PAD had set a target of 0.75. However, due to a halt in tariffs increase during the project,
         this ratio was equal to 1.98 at closing date. Nevertheless, given the government's new
         plan for targeted subsidies, these tariffs are expected to increase rapidly in the coming
         years, thereby reducing the working ratio to an acceptable level. In the meantime the
         company has started a drive to optimize operations and to reduce costs.

   -     Unaccounted for water was targeted to reach to 27 percent by 2009/10. This indicator
         was measured as 22.7% by the end of Mar 2011.

   -     The target period for bill collections by GWWC according to PAD was four months by
         2009/10. This has reached to 137 days.


Lessons Learned

   -     Given the problems experienced in the transfer of funds, we believe the World Bank
         should find a safe and infallible way to transfer funds to the projects.

   -     The borrower should foresee emergency funds for critical situations such as those
         experienced over the last 10 months.

                                                 47
-   To ensure the best progress rate in the project, the borrower should prepare the bidding
    documents for selection of consultants and contractors before the effectiveness of the
    loan.

-   Establishment of a local WB office in the borrower country can be of great help in the
    project procurement process.

-   Discrepancies between WB guidelines and local laws have given rise to many questions
    asked by supervision offices from GWWC.

-   PAR Code was a limitation for timely payment of contractors/consultants invoices,
    especially when the Iranian holidays do not coincide with those in other parts of the
    world.

-   The application of international bidding documents especially FIDIC documents proved
    to be beneficial and a good experience for GWWC's staff.
-   The experience of handling issues related to safety and environment in an independent
    manner was quite new in GWWC. It should however be noted that in recent years, the
    Company had launched its Bureau for Work Safety and Protection to follow up on safety
    issues in all the Company's projects and departments.
-   A main concern in the execution of the projects is related to the safety of the labor force
    and the citizens. A number of challenges such as the reluctance of workers to use
    individual safety equipment, the negligence of safety issues by some contractors,
    inefficient supervision among others led to accidents particularly at the beginning of the
    projects. The insistence of NWWEC, GWWC management and the WB on safety issues
    coupled with the numerous meetings with supervision consultants, contractors and other
    stakeholders, provision of necessary trainings, and constant inspections and controls of
    the construction sites had a positive impact on improving the conditions. Nevertheless,
    the achievement of ideal situation requires planning and full cooperation among the
    different actors in future. Following a notification by NWWEC, the Bureau for Work
    Safety and Protection has been established in GWWC, and on the strength of experiences
    gained through WB projects, the safety conditions of the Company's different aspects and
    projects are expected to improve.
-   Before the project, GWWC and its Public Relations had limited experience on public
    awareness programs. The extend of executive works in the frame of WB loan and the
    Bank's insistence on information dissemination, especially on increasing public
    awareness of the advantages and the disadvantages of the projects and the need for
    collaboration with the executives, required greater activity and closer contact with the
    public. The use of mass media such as local papers and radio and TV, the distribution of
    brochures and pamphlets, the use of tracts and display boards coupled with direct
    dialogues and meetings with people living within the limits of the project sites were
    among procedures used for the purpose. The Company has evaluated the actions as
    beneficial and deems it necessary to continue the trend, particularly after the launch of
    operations of the wastewater system with the aim of informing the public on the proper
    use of facilities and encouraging the subscribers to pay the relevant fees.

-   Despite the problems, which were mainly due to the novelty of the experience, GWWC
    considers the WB projects, particularly the environmental studies as beneficial
    experiences, and plans to apply the outcomes in future projects.

                 construction will be improved through the construction of 4 km Outfall main plus
                 the provision of facilities to store wastewater in case of emergencies

Babol-Improvement of the water supply network

This component includes:

       I) The construction of 20000m3 ground reservoir and pumping station

       II) The replacement of 40 km of existing pipes mains

       III) Extension of the network with an additional 32km of mains and

       IV) Some 125km of lateral pipe and 4500 water meters there will also be an investment
       program land associated studies to improve operational efficiency and reduce
       Unaccounted for Water (including operation and maintenance equipment).

2. Project costs and financing plan

Total project cost (phase 1) was estimated at about US $105.24 million with US$75.4 million in
foreign exchange and the civil works portion amounting to about 95.4% the cost.

The proposed bank loan of US $75.4 million financed about 71.64 percent of the project cost and
would meet nearly all the foreign exchange component. The rest of the cost (29.84 million) was
being financed by the borrower.

4.1. Consulting services

Technical Support Unit (TSU)

To strengthen the capacity of (MWWC), the TSU staff was chosen from among the Company's
personnel for the following posts:

          1) TSU Manager

          2) Procurement officer

          3) Engineering officer (2 persons)

          4) Environmental officer

          5) Financial officer (2 persons)

          6) Administrative officer

Supervision of water and wastewater project

To ensure that contracts are executed according to specifications and to keep the MWWC
informed on progress made and on issues encountered, two consultants were selected for
supervision of water and wastewater projects.
                                               53
Non Revenue Water

One consultant was selected for the non revenue water study (Rahdane Sama consultant)

Environmental Studies
   1- Studies related to health, Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) and the Public Awareness
      studies were defined on the basis of the project's EIA and a consultant was selected for
      the purpose. All the three studies were undertaken for the first time in Mazandaran, and
      their outcomes were both considerable and beneficial for MWWC.

       a- The results of the water borne disease (health) show the impacts of the water and
          sanitation projects on the quality of life and underline their importance. They can
          constitute a valid indicator for evaluating the project's efficiency and the achievement
          of PDO. The Company is pursuing the studies with interest and intends to repeat the
          process after the completion of the works to assess their impact.
       b- The public awareness studies were the first experience of its kind for MWWC and
          even the entire water and wastewater companies in the country. They resulted in
          compilation of strategy for information dissemination and public participation for
          MWWC. The results were distributed among the company's Public Relation and
          management. Despite the numerous programs such as distribution of hand outs and
          brochures and interviews with local radio and TV to attract public participation in the
          projects and to encouraging the public to purchase subscriptions, use the services and
          pay for the fees, etc, the Company is expected to enhance the quality and
          effectiveness of the public training and awareness campaigns through application of
          the results and expansion of cooperation with other stakeholders such as the
          Department of Environment and the Province's Health Organization.
       c- Although the cities of Sari and Babol have not met with an emergency situation in
          recent years, their geographical location from the point of view of earthquake and
          flooding is such that makes the availability of an EOP a necessity. This experience
          was quite new for the Company and can supplement other studies related to safety of
          installations and passive defense. The lack of similar studies in the country and the
          unfamiliarity of the subject for the consultants resulted in the lengthening of the
          studies. Nevertheless, the final report was of good quality and its results were both
          significant and beneficial. The Company must prepare its plans and capacity building
          programs according to the results of the study and the consultant's recommendations.

   2- Septage management project is among the important environmental studies on a critical
      problem of the Mazandaran Province, implemented in the frame of the WB loan. Before
      this, there was a limited experience in the field of septage treatment in the Jooybar
      WWTP in Mazandaran, which was unfortunately a failure. The selected consultant has
      fortunately undertaken extensive quality study in this field. The results have shed a light
      on may obscure and ambiguous issues related to septage in the cities of Sari and Babol.
      Given the geographic situation, the climatic conditions and the touristic nature of
      Mazandaran, the problem is prevalent in all regions of the Province and MWWC plans to
      compile a suitable strategy based on the study's results and to find a solution for septage
      management in other cities as well.

Strengthening of MWWC

The project has contributed to the following Strengthening and Capacity Building.

Establishing the TSU to support the project technically and to undertake the procurement and
financial activities according to the World Bank procedures.

This group consisting of eight persons, is now well trained and experienced in managing similar
projects benefiting from the World Bank loan and is considered as a valuable capacity for the
country.

Training a number of the company's staff to enhance their capacity in managing big scale
projects efficiently

Strengthening national and local consulting engineers and contractors (four consultants and 24
contractors), especially the trained and skilled local contractors who are a great wealth for the
province.

5. Project management report (PMR)

Based on the World Bank regulation the Mazandaran Water & Wastewater Company agreed to
follow the loan administrative change initiative (LACI) of the Bank.

B- Performance Indicators

According to PAD the total household connections in wastewater, which were to be established
for Sari and Babol were 16000 and 16300 respectively.

But up to now the total number of connections in Sari and Babol in order stands at 13000 and
12000. Based on our plan by end of year 2011, the total number of household connections which
will be established in Sari will be 9,000 and in Babol 10,000. These will be implemented through
local budget, and in terms of population coverage it would mean that 105000 persons in Sari and
100000 persons in Babol will benefit from this wastewater disposal services.

The Mazandaran Water & Wastewater Company reduced the Unaccounted for Water from 33%
to 28% through its water network rehabilitation. After the completion of Unaccounted for Water
studies, this will be further reduced to less than 27% by the end of 2011.

Meanwhile the Company will implement the remaining works until the end of 2011 through
local funding.

With rehabilitation & extension 184 km of water network in Sari and 195 km in Babol and
10,000 consumers in Sari and 8,000 in Babol benefitted from better quality of portable water
services.

The commissioning period for Sari & Babol wastewater project is 8 months, after which the
operation and maintenance of the facilities will be outsourced to selected contractors.

The halt in the transfer of funds from July 26th, 2010 to date caused great difficulties for ongoing
packages.

Another problem in the project concerns its closing date (31 Dec 2010). However, the
supervising consultants must continue their task of revising and approving all the final
statements during the grace period, at a time when the WB will no longer pay their fees.

Another problem experienced in the project was that on first year the borrower had to prepare the
bidding documents and select contractors to start the work. These processes took at least six
months, which should be added to the closing date.


                                                56
   -   The Mazandaran Water and Wastewater Company assigned a staff expert as the ESO of
       the Technical Support Unit. This had the positive result of better coordination with other
       departments in the Company. Beyond this, the environmental and safety studies were a
       new experience for MWWC.

   -   The projects initially experienced many safety related difficulties at the work sites. The
       insistence of NWWEC and WB on safety issues and the constant inspections and controls
       of the construction sites, coupled with mandating the contractors to comply with safety
       measures had a great impact on improving the conditions. However, there is still work to
       be done to achieve the ideal situation. Following a notification by NWWEC, the Bureau
       for Work Safety and Protection has been established in MWWC, and on the strength of
       experiences gained through WB projects, the safety conditions of the Company's
       different aspects and projects are expected to improve.

   -   The plan for monitoring the quality of surface and ground waters was prepared by the
       ESO of the TSU with the assistance of WB and NWWEC experts and implemented by
       MWWC. This plan, which assesses the impact of raw wastewater discharge to the
       environment and provides a baseline data, was a new experience for the Company.
       Although the Department of Environment (DOE) did not cooperate as expected, the
       Company is still interested to continue the work and to assess the impact of the water and
       sanitation project on the quality of life and environment.

7- Next steps

The completion of water and sanitary works in the cities of Sari and Babol can be addressed as
two following steps:

1) Completion of the remaining works defined for this implementation phase and benefiting
   from WB loan by the end of 2011. According to the PAD total household connections in
   wastewater to be established for Sari and Babol were 16000 and 16300 respectively.
   However to date the total number of connections realized in Sari is 13000 and in Babol
   12000. Based on our plan, by the end of 2011, the total number of household connections
   which will be established in Sari and Babol will be 9,000 and 10,000 respectively, i.e.,
   105,000 persons in Sari and 100,000 persons in Babol will benefit by this wastewater
   disposal services. To achieve this, MWWC requires the amounts mentioned in the following
   table (USD 18 million)

The government has allocated the amount of USD18M as shown in table below:

                 Item                 Description               Cost in USD million
                   1               Mazandaran-Water                       3
                   2             Mazandaran Wastewater                   15
                                Total                                    18

2) Operation phase: MWWC has prepared its O&M plans and the future plan is to privatize the
   operation of the infrastructure including the treatment plants and the network.

3) Tariffs: The government subsidies are being removed; therefore the tariff structure is being
   changed to cover the cost leading to a reduction in the working ratio.

                                               57
4) Next phase: The estimated coverage of the wastewater collection system was planned to be
   30% during the first implementation phase. This will be achieved following the completion
   of remaining works mentioned above. An acceptable level of population coverage by
   wastewater collection in Sari and Babol requires a minimum of 10 years of construction
   period. The estimated funds required for completion of water and wastewater works amounts
   to USD 400 million. However, given the trend of allocations by the local government, this
   might take a longer period. Therefore, ensuring funds from sources other than the
   Government from such institutions as WB, IDB, etc would accelerate the achievement of the
   goals.

                            Annex 10. Summary of Health Studies

Guilan:

In Rasht, the average annual incidence of acute diarrhea in children under five years old was
10.4% (9% in the intervention group and 11% in the control group). Considering the
arrangement by season, in May the average incidence of acute diarrhea was 10% (9% in the
intervention group and 12% in the control group), in August 12.5% (11.5% in the intervention
group and 13.4% in the control group), in November 9.3% (8.1% in the intervention group and
10.5% in the control group), and in February 9% (8.5% in the intervention group and 9.8% in the
control group).

In Anzali, the average annual incidence of acute diarrhea in children under five years old was
12% (11% in the intervention group and 13% in the control group). Considering the arrangement
by season, in May the average of incidence of acute diarrhea was 13% (11.8% in the
intervention group and 13.5% in the control group), in August 13.3 (12% in the intervention
group and 14% in the control group), in November 11% (10% in the intervention group and
13.1% in the control group), and February 10 % (9% in the intervention group and 11 % in the
control group). The highest incidence of acute Diarrhea in both cities was seen in children from 2
to 5 years of age.

In brief, the incidence of Diarrhea in the Anzali was higher than in the Rasht and in the both
cities is moderate. It is expected to decrease with the initiation of the sewerage system program.

Mazandaran:

Overall 9% of the children in Sari (8% in the intervention and 10 % in the control group) had
experienced an episode of acute diarrhea. In Babol, this figure was 10.4% (10% in the
intervention and 10%.6 in the control group). In other words, on average, each child aged
between 6 to 60 months living in Sari is inflicted with acute diarrhea, 2.4 times a year, and in
Babol, 2.7 times a year. The incidence of acute diarrhea in children between 6 months to 2 years
was twice as high as those over 2 years of age.

In brief, the incidence of diarrhea in both Sari and Babol is intermediate. It is expected that the
wastewater management program will reduce the incidence of diarrhea.

                             Annex 11. Summary of Sludge Study

The sludge study shows that all disposal options will have many positive impacts on
environment in comparison with the lack of sanitary disposal and also in comparison with each
other, there are many advantages and disadvantages. Different options have different impacts on
environmental components, for example, composting has the least negative effect on physical-
chemical component and therefore composting is the best option from physical-chemical
component point of view.

Incineration is the optimum option from biological component point of view and from social and
economical points of view co-composting and land application are the optimum options
respectively. Therefore, the opinion of Guilan Water & Wastewater Company regarding the
priority of component will be very important for selection of options, but generally analysis of
matrix shows that co-composting is the optimum selection.

It must be noted that in this study it is assumed that available composting factory in the city of
Rasht can receive sludge from wastewater treatment plants and extra-organizational participation
which is in good condition. It should be noted that for conduction of this option, the extra
organizational participation is necessary and independent management of sludge by GWWC will
not be possible.

Land application in undesired grass lands of Guilan province as the second priority will increase
the costs of sludge transportation. This option has positive effects on physical-chemical
components but it should be considered that social and organizational resistance against this
option will be a limiting factor. It should be noted that for conduction of this option, the extra
organizational participation is necessary and independent management of sludge by GWWC will
not be possible same as co-composting option.

Considering the level of ground water in Guilan province, the probability of ground water
pollution or costs of ground water pollution control in landfill option will increase. It is
recommended by international guidelines that the distance between landfill and wastewater
treatment plant should be more than 2 km, and out of residential areas, therefore sludge
transportation costs will increase in this option too.

Landfill has the third priority and the sludge composting is the fourth priority. The main causes
of that are social impacts, specially the lack of public acceptance for the use of produced
compost due to high fixed and current costs of this option. With regard to assessment matrix,
incineration of sludge is the last priority and the main reason for that is economical component.

Cost analysis shows that incineration is the most expensive option. Incineration has the most
positive impacts on environmental components and without considering the economical
components, it will be the second priority. With regard to technical potential of GWWC, if there
was a proper management system for air pollution control, sludge incineration could be a proper
option. In the other hand if the incineration is selected as final disposal option, a stable and
independent management of sludge will be possible.
