                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has picked significant pace after initial delays. The project closed on 31 December 2010. Eight months grace period was granted in order to facilitate payment
                         of invoices for work completed before project closing. The key components in Mazandaran (e.g. the treatment plant in Sari) will likely be completed in six months. In Guilan, progress
                         is notable in all components but some key contracts (e.g. treatment plant in Anzali and pumping stations) will require an additional year for completion. All remaining works is
                         expected to be financed by the Government. The utilities in both Mazandaran and Guilan are now shifting their attention to the house connections - to coincide with the completion of
                         the treatment plants.
