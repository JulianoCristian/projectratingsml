Mali were to: (a) strengthen the Ministry of\n            National Education (MEN) in the areas of education planning\n            and financing and administration of technical education and\n            vocational training; (b) improve the quality of basic\n            education by experimenting with and implementing new\n            programs for teachers and students; (c) increase access to\n            basic education for children and adults (particularly women\n            and young farmers) by training new teachers, and by revising\n            the training program through the existing non-formal adult\n            education programs; and (d) improve the skills of\n            agricultural extension workers and livestock technicians.\n            The only major delays in hardware components were\n            construction of the two Primary Teacher training Colleges\n            (IPEGs) under the Basic Education component, financed by the\n            African Development Bank (AfDB), and correction of a water\n            supply problem encountered under the Livestock and\n            Agricultural Training component, which took four years to\n            resolve. Software components in the Basic Education quality\n            improvement proceeded much more slowly however, and\n            difficulties arose in the implementation of the component."}, "docdt": "1992-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
