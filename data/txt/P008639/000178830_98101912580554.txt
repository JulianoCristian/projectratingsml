APPRAISAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENERGY CONSERVATION AND
DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Portugal (the Government) has requested a Bank
Loan of US$30 million for an Industrial Energy Conservation and Diversifi-
cation Project (the Project) consisting of an integrated package of invest-
ments, studies and institution building measures directed towards the
conservation and diversification of industrial energy. The Project is
aimed at meeting one of the major objectives of the draft National Energy
Plan, namely to reduce energy consumption in industry, which accounts for
about 50% of total energy consumption and offers the major short-term
opportunity for reducing the oil import bill. At the same time, it will
help improve the competitiveness of the Portuguese industry in preparation
for European Economic Community (EEC) entry.
1.02      The Project consists of four main components:  (i) energy
conservation and diversification studies and investments within public and
private sector companies operating in the major energy-intensive
industries--oil refining, chemicals and fertilizers, cement, and pulp and
paper--designed to produce immediate savings in energy costs (the Energy-
Intensive Industries Component); (ii) an energy survey covering ten other
major energy-consuming industries involving primarily small- and medium-
scale private enterprises, along with technical assistance in setting up an
Energy Management, Audit and Training Center (the Technical Assistance
Component); (iii) a leasing facility earmarked for energy conservation
investments in predominantly private sector enterprises, to improve the
access of small- and medium-scale enterprises to the financing of
energy-conserving equipment (the Leasing Component); and (iv) studies,
pilot/demonstration projects and technical assistance to accelerate the
development of Portugal's renewable energy resources (the Renewable Energy
Component). Project implementation will start in July 1982 and be
completed by end 1985; however, the leasing facility will be structured as
a revolving fund and will be used repeatedly over the life of the Bank
loan. Total financing requirements of the Project, including physical and
price contingencies, are estimated at about US$54 million, including
US$36 million in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$30 million
will cover 55% of total financing requirements.l/
1.03      This would be the Bank's first integrated industrial energy
conservation and diversification project. Its structure and design
includes a number of specific features aimed to provide the basis for a
concerted effort by the Government and the industry to reduce the cost and
unit consumption of energy in Portugal's industrial sector. Essentially,
1/ The overall configuration of the Project and the cost, implementation
schedule and sponsorship arrangements for the four components are
summarized in a table in para. 6.03.



-2-
the Project has two distinctive parts. The Technical Assistance and
Renewable Energy Components will strengthen Portugal's institutional
capability to promote and select energy saving measures and to accelerate
the development of the country's renewable energy sources. The Project's
Energy-Intensive Industries and Leasing Components will finance physical
investments to save and diversify energy inputs in both a limited number of
large-scale industrial companies and in a larger number of smaller and
medium-scale enterprises.
1.04      The Technical Assistance, Leasing and Renewable Energy Components
are fully defined and appraised, as in any other lending operation. In the
case of the Energy-Intensive Industries Component, on the other hand, the
Bank has appraised the overall energy conservation and diversification
programs in the four energy-intensive industries concerned, as well as the
key components of the programs of the large enterprises of particular
significance. These appraisals have confirmed that the foreign exchange
requirements of many of the larger project components included in these
economically attractive programs could be financed through available
bilateral and suppliers' credits. To maximize the use of these sources,
and to provide flexibility in the financing of a dynamic industry-wide pro-
gram of this type (where the state! of readiness of individual investments
varies from company to company), it is proposed that: (i) only selected
investments amounting to about 20% of the cost of the US$200 million
1982-84 time-slice of these programs be financed under the Bank-financed
component; and (ii) that in addition to subprojects already appraised,
additional not yet fully appraised subprojects not suitable for full
financing through other sources, bie eligible for financing under the Bank
loan. These subprojects will be appraised by Bank staff according to
agreed criteria. This flexibili'ty in the utilization of Bank financing is
an essential feature of the Project.
1.05      The Project was preappraised in April 1981 and appraised in
August 1981 by Messrs. J-F. Rischard (chief), D. Caplin, R. Heath, A. Sood
and Ms. J. Press of the Industry Department. A follow-up mission finalized
the arrangements for certain Project components in October 1981.
Mr. R. Dosik (Energy Department) appraised the Renewable Energy Component
and Mr. R. Graffam, of the IFC Capital Markets Department, participated in
the appraisal of the leasing facility.   Mr. W. Pryke, (consultant, energy
conservation) also assisted in the appraisal of the Project.
II. ENERGY SECTOR AND POLICY
2.01      With few domestic energy resources of its own and as yet no
commercially exploitable oil or natural gas deposits, Portugal is heavily
dependent (70%) on imported oil for its energy supply. The oil import
bill, which was just over US$100 million in 1973, climbed to about
US$2 billion in 1980; oil imports, as a share of export earnings, are



- 3 -
estimated to have increased from some 5% to about 45% in the same period.
The high cost of imported energy is one of the most important problems
affecting Portugal's current economic stabilization efforts and would
continue to constrain progress on key development objectives. Portugal's
energy strategy for the 1980s will focus on increased conservation and
diversification efforts, as well as the development of its domestic energy
resource base, including more intensified exploration for petroleum and
renewable energy development.
A. Energy Consumption
2.02        Primary energy consumption in Portugal, totalling 11.8 million
tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in 1979, grew at an average rate of about
6.4% per annum during 1965-79.   Per capita energy consumption increased by
more than 50% during the 1970s; nevertheless,  it remains relatively low (at
1.2 tons of oil equivalent (TOE) per capita2/) compared with other Western
European countries (3 TOE on average in 1976), but considerably above the
middle-income developing country average (0.6 TOE in 1976). Portugal's
energy system was developed, as in the case of many countries, at a time
when it had abundant access to cheap oil; its electricity generation system
as well as the energy-intensive industries launched in the late 1960s
reflect this. Energy consumption, which grew at an average annual rate of
8.3% during 1975-79, is forecast to grow at an average annual rate of
nearly 6% in the 1980s, in line with expected economic growth and
industrial development. Actual and projected energy balances by source for
1965-1990 are shown in the following table.

B. Domestic Energy Resources
2.03      Hydropower and small amounts of coal and wood, Portugal's only
domestic energy resources, accounted for only 28% of total primary energy
requirements in 1979. Hydropower, the major domestic energy source, has
contributed about 20% of the nat'on's primary energy supply over recent
years; its share is expected to decline in the 1980s to 13-16% as new
thermal stations are brought on stream.  Of an overall potential of
22 terawatt-hours (TWhO of hydropower, equivalent to 5 MTOE per year,
nearly 60% has been developed, is under construction, or is firmly planned,
and another 10% might be added through expansion and modification of exist-
ing sites. The public power authority expects that the remaining hydro-
power potential, although technically more difficult to harness, will in
most part be exploited by the end of the century given the expected costs
and availability of other sources of energy. Therefore, over the long-
term, hydroelectricity is unlikely to supply more than 15-20% of total
energy requirements.
2.04      Proven recoverable coal reserves are about 5 million tons of poor
quality coal (2 MTOE), with currFent production of 70,000 TOE per year just
meeting the requirements of a small thermal station and supplying less than
1% of the nation's energy. Recoverable lignite reserves of a little over
30 million tons (4-5 MTOE) are not presently exploited, although a
lignite-fired power station is under consideration by the power authority.
The only significant mineral resource for power generation discovered to
date in Portugal is uranium. Reserves, estimated at over 8,000 tons, are
enough to fuel three 1,000 megawatt: (MW) reactors for 25 years; develop-
ment, beyond mining for export and stockpiling, is awaiting a firm decision
on whether to proceed with a first Portuguese nuclear power station.
2.05      Portugal has good potential with regard to renewable resources
such as biomass, particularly wood, and solar and wind energy. At present,
however, only wood serves as a significant source of energy, accounting for
about 5% of total energy consumption, or 0.6 MTOE per year. Fuelwood is
produced mainly as a by-product of pulp and paper and timber operations;
it serves as an important fuel for these forest industries, for the baking,
ceramics and certain other industries and as a domestic fuel in rural
areas.  Production and consumption of fuelwood could be significantly
increased, considering Portugal's existing and potential forestry re-
sources. In the short term, better use could be made of forest residues
and forest industry waste.  In the longer run, increased amounts of wood
residues could be made available as a by-product of large-scale afforesta-
tion programs, and there may also be potential for establishing "energy
plantations" expressly for the production of fuelwood. The Bank is
assisting in the development of the country's forestry resources (Loan
No.1853-PO (1980)) and a wood energy study is included in the Project
(para. 6.40).
C. Imported Energy
2.06      Approximately 72% of Portugal's primary energy was imported in
1979, primarily in the form of crude oil and petroleum products, except for



-5-
modest coal imports. This represents a significant increase from 1965,
when petroleum imports supplied 50% of primary energy requirements. As
mentioned, these imports currently represent about 45% of Portugal's export
earnings, up from some 5% in 1973. However, Portugal has begun, in recent
years, to curb the trend toward even further dependence on petroleum:
demand for petroleum products grew at an estimated average annual rate
approaching 9.5% over the period 1965-75, then at just over 7.5% per year
for 1975-79, and is forecast to grow in line with or slightly slower than
overall energy demand in the 1980s (6%). Fuel oil and diesel together
account for nearly 70% (45% and 24%, respectively, in 1979) of petroleum
products consumed in Portugal.
D.  Energy Consumption Pattern
2.07      Consumption of different forms of energy by aggregated end-use
sectors in 1980 is shown below. Industry (excluding refineries) accounts
for nearly 45% of total energy consumption, while transportation and all
other sectors each account for around 28% of the total. In particular,
industry consumes some 39% of petroleum products (74% of fuel oil), and 57%
of electricity. Residential, commercial and public service energy
consumption accounts for 20% of total. Residential energy by itself
accounts for only 13% of total energy consumption due to the mild climate
in the southern portion of the country and existing home heating
practices. The main scope for energy conservation and diversification is
-thus within industry, particularly in regard to fuel oil and electricity
consumption, and in energy-intensive industries such as refining, chemical
and fertilizers, cement, and pulp and paper (Chapter III).

E. Energy Plan and Policies
2.08      In response to the impact of rising petroleum prices and
petroleum product imports on the balance of payments, the Government is
formulating a comprehensive energy policy for the country. A detailed
model of the energy sector, constructed by a joint team of Portuguese
specialists and staff of the U.S. Department of Energy and being refined by
the Directorate General of Energy (DGE), has provided two basic energy
supply and demand scenarios as a basis for the National Energy Plan
currently under preparation. The major goals and priorities of the
proposed National Energy Plan will be to:
(i)    develop domestic energy resources to the maximum possible,
economical extent. This includes intensified petroleum
exploration activity and increased exploitation of the
country's renewable energy resource potential. With
regard to the former, a Bank loan (Loan No. 2024-PO
(1981)) is assisting Portugal in its domestic petroleum
exploration efforts. The Government will also foster the
use of renewable energy, where economically viable.
Priority is being given to increasing the use of wood fuel
and other biomass resources; in addition, the potential of
solar energy and windpower is being explored. The Project
includes a renewable energy component which will support
the Government's planning, research and development
efforts in this respect. The longer term possibility of
gasifying low quality domestic coal and lignite is also
being examined;
(ii)   diversify the sources of primary energy, particularly by
replacing petroleum by other less expensive energy
supplies. An increase in coal imports for use in industry
and in power generation is planned. The economic and
technical viability of importing natural gas is also being
studied, as is the development of nuclear power based on
indigenous uranium. The Project will support energy
diversification investments and will assess the potential
for interfuel substitution, including coal, solar and wood
energy in a number of industries;
(iii) promote energy conservation measures throughout the
economy. There is potential for saving 15-20% of overall
national energy consumption through appropriate conser-
vation measures, with industry offering the most signifi-
cant and quick-yielding possibilities, as discussed below
in Chapter III. This overall target assumes 10-15% energy
savings across the board in the economy by 1990. Most of
the Project components are concerned with energy conser-
vation; and



(iv)   price energy products at or above their opportunity value,
to promote more efficient use of energy and domestic
resource development, in line with the policies and goals
of the National Energy Plan.
F. Energy Pricing
2.09      The Government sets both retail and ex-refinery prices for major
petroleum products. Ex-refinery prices are based on an import parity
system to encourage efficient domestic refinery operations. Retail prices
of individual products have a two-tiered structure as is the pattern in
many other middle-income developing countries: petroleum products for
private use such as gasoline have been taxed heavily, while petroleum
products used in key economic sectors such as industry and power, as well
as in public transportation, have been taxed less or, in some cases,
subsidized. Another objective of the Government's pricing policy has
further been geared to generate substantial tax revenues from petroleum
products which have been channeled through the Fundo de Abastecimento
(Supply Fund) to subsidize key agricultural and other commodities. In
1981, four products (gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, and fuel oil)
accounted for 90% of petroleum product consumption with another 11
products, such as butane, paraffin and solvents, accounting for the
remaining 10%. After the price increases introduced by Government in
July 1981, the weighted average retail price of the above four products
(US$362/ton) was 24% higher than the corresponding border price
(US$292/ton), and 7% higher than the total domestic cost (including
refining, distribution, and related profit margins). Retail prices of
gasoline have historically been among the highest in Europe, and their
contribution to sector revenues substantial.
2.10      However, the overall high average of petroleum product prices
concealed, until recently, a relative imbalance in the price structure
between different products posing economic and financial distortions; in
particular, the price of fuel oil was relatively low and did not provide
sufficient incentives for energy conservation and diversification in
industry (para. 3.05). The Bank has been discussing with the Government
its pricing policies for petroleum products, including during the
preparation of this project and earlier under the Petroleum Exploration
Project (Loan No. 2024-PO (1981)). As of January 1, 1982, the Government
has significantly raised the prices of fuel oil and diesel oil, as shown
below;

2.11      Electricity tariffs charged to various consumers by Electricidade
de Portugal (EDP, the power authority) are set by EDP, while tariffs
charged to customers serviced from municipal undertakings are set by the
municipalities. In all cases tariffs are implemented after Government
approval. Currently, only EDP's tariffs are uniformly applied throughout
the country. These tariffs are set on the basis of the average cost of
hydroelectric power generation and distribution. Tariffs charged by
municipalities vary considerab'ly because some have resisted passing on
tariff increases to their final consumers. EDP's current tariff structure,
which is based on the principle of marginal costs, evolved as a result of
Bank participation in the sector (Loan No. 1301-PO (1976)) and was first
introduced in 1977. Since 1978, EDP's tariffs have increased at least once
a year by an average of about 35% per year to more than keep up with
inflation. In addition, EDP was allowed in 1977 to levy a fuel adjustment
charge. Although each increase contributed to bringing the level of
tariffs closer to their marginal cost of supply, the average tariff, after
the last increase (January 1, 1982), is still only about 76% of the
marginal cost; this percentage is expected to increase as tariffs continue
to increase in real terms in the future. The Bank is actively discussing
with the Government its power tariff policies and satisfactory assurances
in this regard will be sought through the proposed next operation in the
sector.
G. Energy Sector Organization
2.12      The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Exports (MIEE) has official
jurisdiction over most energy-related matters in Portugal and acts through
its Secretary of State for Energy. The concerned public sector companies,
Petroleos de Portugal (PETROGAL), the national oil company (para. 6.06) and
EDP, report to this Ministry.  The Directorate General of Energy (OGE) in
MIEE, staffed by about one hundred professionals, is responsible for
establishing energy policies, projecting energy requirements, recommending
energy prices, and establishing energy conservation policies and measures.
Both DGE and the National Laboratory for Industrial Engineering and
Technology (LNETI) are involved in renewable energy development. DGE and
LNETI are described further in Chapter IV. The overall organizational
arrangements for the sector are considered satisfactory.
H. Bank Lending Strategy and Role in the Sector
2.13      The Bank's lending in the energy sector in Portugal to date has
comprised seven loans in power supp'ly and petroleum development. The power
projects include: two hydropower projects (Loan Nos. 362-PO (1963) 452-PO
(1966), three thermal power stations (Loan Nos. 363-PO (1963), 412-PO
(1965), and 453-PO (1966), and a tirne-slice of the power sector investment
plan (Loan No. 1301-PO (1976). All of these projects have been implemented
successfully. The Bank has assisted petroleum exploration through Loan
No. 2024-PO (1981). The Bank is also assisting in modernizing the
hydropower equipment industry (Loan 1875-PO (1980). Apart from past
lending operations, the Bank has assisted Portugal in reviewing



-9-
energy sector investment priorities (Report No. 2883-PO (1980) and intends
to support energy diversification and conservation efforts. In addition,
it is now considering further support to hydropower development through the
earlier mentioned, seventh power project now under preparation.
2.14     The Project is designed to assist Portugal's energy conservation
and diversification efforts in the industrial sector. The Bank has played
an active role in the conceptualization and preparation of this integrated
Project, which would be the first of its kind to be considered by the
Bank. Based on the energy audits and institutional strengthening which the
Project will bring about, follow-up industrial energy conservation projects
are expected. There is also a need to widen, through a follow-up project,
the institutional arrangements to promote energy conservation at large,
particularly in the transportation and residential sectors.
III. ENERGY CONSERVATION POTENTIAL AND POLICIES IN INDUSTRY
A.  Main Energy-Consuming Industries and Potential for Energy Conservation
3.01.     As noted, industry (excluding refineries) accounts for nearly
45% of total energy consumption. Including the internal fuel requirements
of the refineries, industry accounts for about 50% of total energy consump-
tion. The recent consumption pattern by major industries, including refin-
eries is shown below. Refineries account for 18% of industrial consumption
of fuel oil (16% of total national consumption of fuel oil), and the petro-
chemical and chemical industries for 8%. Refineries and the chemical and
petrochemical industries together account for 76% of producer and refinery
gas, 95% of naphtha and other non-energy products, and 19% of electricity
consumed by industry. Energy conservation and diversification in these in-
dustries, as well as in-the cement and pulp and paper industries mentioned
below, is one of the major objectives of the Project and is covered by its
Energy-Intensive Industries Component (paras. 6.04 to 6.20).

3.02.          A more detailed breakdown of energy consumption in "other
industries" is given in the table below. The cement industry is a large
consumer of energy, accounting for 32% of fuel oil and 12% of purchased
electricity consumption within these other industries, followed by the pulp
and paper industry with corresponding shares of 16% and 4%, respectively.
Other significant consumers of energy include ceramics (48% of wood, 7% of
fuel oil, and 34% of LPG usage); food processing (24% of wood, 10% of fuel
oil and 10% of electricity consumption); and textiles (12% of fuel oil and
19% of electricity). Identification and promotion of energy conservation
and diversification measures in these industries (except for cement and
pulp and paper, included in the Energy-Intensive Industries Component) and
the glass, dairy, sugar refining, breweries and fishing industries, will be
covered under the Project's Technical Assistance Component (paras. 6.21 to
6.32).

3.03      Indicative estimates of the potential for energy savings in major
industries are given in the next table. The potential ranges from 5-10% to
20-30% depending on the industry, with the potential savings for industry
as a whole estimated at 15-20%. These estimates were derived from U.S. and
U.K. data primarily, and adjusted for different types and age profiles of
plants in Portugal. Considering the overall energy consumption levels for
each industry and the estimates in this table, refineries, chemicals and
fertilizers, cement, pulp and paper, and iron and steel, are among the
*             sectors with the most significant potential for energy savings in the
immediate future.

B. Industrial Energy Conservation and Diversification Efforts
3.04.     Experience from other countries shows that there are three major
aspects whose combined--rather than individual--effects determine the suc-
cess of a national industrial energy conservation and diversification
program. First, industrial enterprises must receive correct pricing
signals for fuel and power usage. Second, financial assistance should be
made available at terms attractive enough for energy-saving investments to
take priority within the enterprises' investment programs.  Third, enter-
prises need to undertake systematic energy audits of their facilities to
identify opportunities for economic energy conservation and diversification
investments and for energy-saving changes or improvements in operating
practices. The status of Portugal's efforts in these areas is discussed
below.
1. Pricing
3.05      Domestic petroleum prices in Portugal are high and now provide
adequate incentives for conservation (paras. 2.09 and 2.10) . As men-
tioned, until recently the price levels of fuel oil did not, however,



- 12 -
adequately encourage energy conservation in industry. In late 1981, the
domestic price of fuel oil (which accounts for 58% of industrial energy
consumption) was about 80% of the average European price, but was signifi-
cantly increased as of January 1, 1982, to levels above international
prices (para. 2.10). This increase occurred within the context of a
Government undertaking, in connection with the petroleum exploration loan
to PETROGAL (Loan No. 2024-PO (1981), to adopt a medium-term pricing policy
that will, among other things, encourage energy conservation in industry.
With respect to electricity tariffs, one of the assurances to be sought
under the proposed seventh power project now being prepared is that the
level and structure of tariffs be set so as to generate sufficient funds to
finance up to 30% of the investments in power facilities; this would
increase tariffs significantly over the coming years. Considering the
importance of the pricing policy arrangements made or to be made in ,
connection with these Bank projects for the success of the present Project,
continued compliance with these arrangements would also be monitored under
the Project.
2. Financial Assistance
3.06      In 1976/77, the Government initiated a financial incentive scheme
designed to encourage medium- and small-scale establishments to undertake
energy conservation and diversification investments, through cash grants
paid out by the Supply Fund (para 2.09). The first two tranches under this
scheme provided for a grant of up to 100%, subsequently reduced to 50%
under the 1980-81 tranche. Following discussions with Bank staff during
the preparation of this Project, the grant was reduced to a maximum of 30%
for the 1981-82 tranche, which will expire in September 1982. Assurances
have been obtained from the Government that it will further review such
schemes with a view to reducing the maximum grant percentage to the lowest
level consistent with effective promotion of energy conservation, and that
the Bank will be consulted on the findings.
3.07   The existing incentive scheme covered about 175 projects up to 1981,
with corresponding energy savings estimated at about 2-2.5% of industrial
energy consumption or about 1% of Itotal energy consumption. It is thus of
significant value, and now that the maximum grant level is lower and slated
for further reductions, merits continued support. However, the scheme is
not likely to realize on its own much more than a small part of the total
industrial energy saving potential, which as mentioned above is estimated
at about 15-20% overall. First, the scheme is not meant, nor does it have
the resources, to cover energy conservation and diversification programs of
the size relevant to larger, energy-intensive plants. Second, the
investment orientation of the scheme precludes assistance in identifying
and implementing changes or improvements in operating practices likely to
lead to energy savings without significant investments. Most important,
the scheme has so far not been supported by systematic energy audits,
technical assistance, and promotional efforts.

3. Energy Audits, Technical Assistance and Promotion
3.08      Whilst a number of large, particularly public sector, enterprises
in energy-intensive industries have recently undertaken, or are in the
process of undertaking, global energy audits of their plant facilities
(paras. 6.06 to 6.19), there is an urgent need for a systematic program of
energy auditing, technical assistance and promotion in the remaining
segments of the industrial sector.  This is particularly so in the private
sector and in small- or medium-scale industrial enterprises. Based on
experience from other countries, two principle methods of motivating a
large number of enterprises to undertake, and follow-up on, energy audits
are: (i) to provide them with incentives and technical assistance,
supported by promotional efforts; and (ii) to make periodical energy audits
mandatory, at least for major energy-consuming enterprises. A new Decree
on Energy Management described below combined with new institutional
capabilities to be developed as part of the Project, will enable the
Government to combine both approaches in an effective way.
C. Legislation on Industrial Energy Management
3.09      The Government, recognizing the need for a more systematic energy
auditing effort within the industrial sector, has enacted in January 1982
an Energy Management Decree under which about 1,000 enterprises with yearly
energy consumption levels in excess of 1,000 tons of fuel oil equivalent
(FOE) will have to engage the services of independent energy auditors to:
Mi) undertake a comprehensive energy audit of each enterprise; and
(ii) prepare for each a five-year energy conservation plan. Through this
plan, each enterprise will seek to achieve pre-determined subsector energy
consumption targets linked to the performance of the most energy-efficient
enterprise(s) in the subsector (para. 6.25). Each of the concerned
enterprises will appoint one of its staff as the energy manager in charge
of implementing, and reporting to the Government on, the investments and
cthanges in operating practices foreseen under the enterprise's five-year
energy conservation plan. The implementation of this important legislation
requires substantial preparation and training, which are included in the
Technical Assistance Component of the Project (paras. 6.21 to 6.32).
3.10      The Government's new Energy Management Decree, along with the
recent realignment in the prices of petroleum products (particularly fuel
oil) to encourage industrial energy conservation and diversification, have
placed Portugal in the forefront among the developing countries with
action-oriented energy demand management programs. With the initial
emphasis on industry, quick-yielding results can be expected from this
program, provided that it is accompanied by adequate technical and
financial assistance, and promotional efforts to help individual
enterprises effectively identify and implement energy conservation and
diversification measures and investments. The Project's various components
are aimed to strengthen these aspects (para. 6.02).

IV. GOVERNMENT ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THE
PROJECT AND PLANS FCIR INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
4.01      The Government's decision to actively promote energy conservation
and diversification by industry requires, on the institutional side, a
strengthening of the entities involved in energy conservation and renewable
energy development. During the preparation of the Project, an analysis of
the available institutional resources was conducted and on the basis of the
findings, the Government will implement a number of institutional changes
described below.
A. Directorate General of Energy (DGE)
4.02      The Directorate General of Energy (DGE) is one of the two major
directorates organized under the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Exports
(MIEE), the other being the Directorate General of Industry. DGE was
formed in 1978, reporting to the Secretary of State for Energy, by bringing
together three departments which lFormerly were concerned with nuclear
energy, electricity, and petroleum. Three more departments were
subsequently added to DGE, namely planning, energy conservation, and
renewable energy.
1. Energy Conservation Functions and Activities
4.03      DGE's Energy Conservation Department comprises a director and
about 20 staff, including 14 engineers and technicians. About half of the
staff are reponsible for functions inherited from the petroleum department
relating to periodical safety checking of boilers.   DGE's current energy
conservation activities proper are limited to: (i) the administration of
the energy conservation incentive scheme mentioned in para. 3.06;
(ii) occasional energy conservation promotion activities; and (iii) policy
advice and drafting legislation on energy conservation, e.g., the recently
approved Energy Management Decree (para. 3.09).
4.04      The administration of th,e energy conservation incentive scheme
involves primarily: (i) the review of applications for the energy
conservation grants under the incentive scheme and the determination of
their respective amounts in each case; (ii) field supervision to check on
actual implementation of the investments for which a grant has been
extended; and (iii) the determination, for each yearly tranche of the
scheme, of the maximum grant percentage in relation to project costs. The
applications of the beneficiary enterprises are reviewed by DGE to confirm
that the following criteria are met by beneficiary enterprises, namely:
(i) the payback period for the investment, based on its imported energy
savings valued at international enetrgy prices, should be less 6 years
depending on the type of equipment involved_/; (ii) a satisfactory
3/ Under the 1981-82 tranche of the scheme, renewable energy projects are
eligible with a maximum payback period of 20 years.



- 15 -
techno-economic study must have been prepared and submitted; (iii) public
bidding procedures must have been followed in selecting the suppliers/
contractors; and (iv) a bank guarantee must have been obtained by the
enterprise showing that the remainder of the financing is assured. While
the maximum percentage of the grant is fixed for a given year, the actual
amount of the grant cannot exceed the value of the energy consumed in the
12 preceding months by the equipment whose modification or replacement is
the subject of the application.
4.05      Under the Energy Management Decree (para. 3.09), a number of new
responsibilities will be added to the Energy Conservation Department's
existing energy conservation activities, including: (i) certification of
independent energy auditors and enterprises' energy managers; (ii) review
and approval of five-year energy savings plans submitted by enterprises
covered by the Decree; and (iii) issuance of energy consumption standards
by industry branch, process and products. An expansion of its manpower
resources has therefore recently been undertaken (para. 4.10).
2. Renewable Energy Functions and Activities
4.06      The recently created Renewable Energy Department of DGE is
responsible for: (i) overall planning of renewable energy development,
including the identification of priority programs and projects;
(ii) keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and assessing
their implications for the Portuguese program; (iii) promoting the
utilization of renewable energy by undertaking market studies, by financing
pilot and demonstration projects on a commercial scale and by serving as a
source of technical and economic information for business and the public;
and (iv) coordinating renewable energy activities within the Government and
serving as a focal point for international contacts. In addition, the
department is now responsible for assisting in the review of renewable
energy projects for which grants have been requested under the energy
conservation incentive scheme (para. 4.04). The department's staff
presently comprises only five professionals. It will need to be
strengthened and provided with specialized training and expert assistance
(para. 6.45).
B. National Laboratory for Industrial Engineering and Technology (LNETI).
4.07      The National Laboratory for Industrial Engineering and Technology
(LNETI) was created at the end of 1977 under MIEE to regroup a number of
laboratories which previously existed either under the Ministry's Institute
for Industrial Research, or independently with Government support, such as
the Physics and Nuclear Energy Laboratory (LFEN). The organizational
structure of LNETI is still evolving and the linkage between industrial
needs and scientific and technological research and development, infor-
mation and technical assistance services is not yet fully established. Two
major institutes predominate within LNETI, the Energy Institute and the
National Industrial Technology Institute (INTI). Starting from the first
quarter of 1982, both institutes function from separate, better equipped
campuses, and this has led to some consolidation both in terms of physical
facilities and organization.



- 16 -
1. Energy Conservation Functions and Activities
4.08      LNETI's activities with respect to energy conservation have been
limited and are handled by the Conventional Energy Department of the Energy
Institute. These activities have consisted mostly of single facility or
individual equipment audits. The Department has about 15 professionals.
With the Conventional Energy Department's activities being phased down,
there is room for the establishment of an Energy Management, Audit and
Training Center (EMATC) within the Energy Institute, as described below in
para. 4.12.                                                                               *
2. Renewable Energy Functions; and Activities
4.09      LNETI's Renewable Energy Department is responsible for research
in all areas except biomass; it is working mainly in solar energy where, in
addition to its research projects, it is conducting a program for the test-
ing and certification of locally manufactured flat plate collectors. Bio-
mass research is the responsibility of the Conventional Energy Department,
which has conducted a number of projects in biogas, alcohol production and
other conversion technologies. LNETI's well-qualified professional staff
can play a crucial role in the development of renewable energy provided its
research is focussed on carefully chosen, high priority projects and it is
given specialized training, technical assistance and additional laboratory
equipment. This will be done under the Project (para.6.45).
C. Proposed Institutional Setup for Industrial Energy Conservation
1. Allocation of Responsibilities
4.10      Based on a detailed analysis of the functions and tasks required
for a systematic industrial energy conservation promotion and assistance
program, a clear distribution of responsibilities emerges between DGE,
LNETI, IAPMEI (Institute for Assistance to Small and Medium Enter-
prises),4/ and the independent energy auditors and energy managers
foreseen in the new Energy Management Decree (para. 3.09). This allocation
of responsibilities is summarized in the table on the following page and
detailed in the Project File, Reference A. Policy, coordination and
planning functions, as we] ITas the monitoring of the existing energy
conservation incentive scheme and of the new Energy Management Decree
(para. 3.09) will constitute DGE's main responsibilities. The necessary
additional staff positions have been assigned and budgeted for 1982 and
assurances have been obtained from the Government that they will thereafter
be maintained in view of DGE's expanded role under the new Energy
Management Decree (para. 4.05).
4.11      IAPMEI will be responsible for field level promotion and
assistance functions with regard to energy conservation and diversification
in the small- and medium-scale enterprise sector and will also have
training responsibilities in cooperation with the Energy Management, Audit
and Training Center (EMATC) to be established under LNETI (para. 4.12).
4/ IAPMEI is one of the principal institutions involved in the Small-and
Medium-Scale Industry Development Project (Loan No. 1701-PO (1979).

Out of a total staff of 240, IAF'MEI has a field staff of about 100 (equally
split between engineers and financial/economic staff) who are responsible
for providing technical assistance, training, advisory services, and
financial and management assistance services to a target group of about
12,000 small- and medium-scale enterprises. To enable IAPMEI to gear up
for its increased role with respect to energy conservation, IAPMEI staff
will be trained within EMATC andl a selected number of IAPMEI field staff
will also participate as counterpart staff within the Bank-financed
multi-industry energy survey described below (paras. 6.22 to 6.31).
Satifactory assurances on these arrangements have been obtained from the
Government.
2. Proposed Energy Management, Audit and Training Center (EMATC)
4.12      As shown in the table on page 17 describing the allocation of
responsibilities, the above arrangements assign LNETI a number of key
functions in regard to energy conservation, many of which will represent an
outgrowth of the industrial energy survey covering ten industries included
in the Project. These functions include: Mi) training and promotional
seminars (some of this in collaboration with IAPMEI); (ii) providing
technical assistance and advisory services and performing selected
enterprise audits; (iii) continuing the energy survey undertaken under the
Project by extending it to industries other than the initial ten; and
(iv) assuring information, research and demonstration services. Since
LNETI is not organized at present. to handle this array of functions, the
Government has decided to set up EMATC (Centro de Conservacao de Energia or
CCE) within LNETI's Energy Institute and allocate these functions to it.
The proposed organization chart for EMATC is shown in the chart below. The
Center will require about 18-20 staff and will be set up during 1982 with
the help of specialized consultants whose services are included in the
Project (para. 6.32).   Agreement has been reached that the organizational
arrangements for EMATC will be finalized by August 1, 1982, to ensure the
timely participation of EMATC staff as counterparts in the foreign
consultant-led multi-industry energy survey to be carried out under the
Project.

D.   Proposed Institutional Set-up for Renewable Energy
4.13      The Government is aware that there has been a lack of definition
and clear guidelines with respect to the allocation of responsibilities
between DGE and LNETI in regard to renewable energy. Both organizations
are involved in research and development and both serve as sources of
information and advice on renewable energy technology. The Ministry has
recently decided on a redefinition of their respective functions, making
DGE primarily responsible for planning and programming and for promoting
commercial applications and LNETI for the actual conduct of the research
and development program; a transitional period is foreseen during which
both organizations will continue to have somewhat overlapping functions.
4.14      The proposed allocation of responsibilities provides the basis
for an effective working relationship between OGE and LNETI in the future.
Two aspects of this relationship seem particularly important to the future
of Portugal's renewable energy program. The first is the need for close
cooperation between the two agencies in the determination of research
priorities and the selection of specific projects in order to develop a
well-focussed research program that is more closely geared to national
needs. The programming study provided for under the Project (para. 6.43)
should help to foster such cooperation. The second is the development of a
relationship that will make it possible to take full advantage of LNETI's
scientific and technical expertise in policy formulation, investment
analysis and project implementation, as well as in research and
development.
4.15      The Government has agreed to provide the Bank by August 1, 1982
with a statement confirming the roles of DGE and LNETI, particularly
concerning: (i) the relative responsibilities of DGE and LNETI in the
formulation of the research program; (ii) the participation of universities
and other research institutions in the program and their relationship to
DGE and LNETI; and (iii) the time-table for the transition. Assurances
have also been obtained that MIEE will establish a suitable implementation
mechanism under which LNETI would prepare annual updates of the research
program, including proposals for new projects.
4                                V.  LOCAPOR - THE LEASING FACILITY SPONSOR
5.01      Companhia Portuguesa de Locacao Financeira Mobiliaria (LOCAPOR)
a leasing company whose primary shareholder is Caixa Geral de Depositos
(CGD), will be responsible for the Project's Leasing Component. For this
purpose, LOCAPOR will establish a facility for leasing energy-conserving
equipment on a full pay-out basis to small- and medium-scale enterprises
(paras. 6.33 to 6.38).

A. Ownership, Management and Capital.
5.02      LOCAPOR is a leasing comnpany formed with CGD as the main
shareholder (51%), along with Locabail of France (25%) and a number of
other shareholders including a number of private Portuguese equipment
manufacturers and vendors. CGO is Portugal's major savings institution and
bank, with total assets of lTST6 billion as of end 1980, total deposits of
US$ 4.95 billion and a capital base of US$450 million. Its main activities
are in the fields of industrial and export credit, as well as building and
housing credit. CGD is well known to the Bank. It has been the channel
for more than 50% of the commitments made under the US$33 million line of
credit for small- and medium-enterprises provided by the Bank under the
Small- and Medium-Scale Industry Development Project (Loan No. 1701-PO
(1979)). Locabail is one of the first and major European leasing
companies, with extensive experience in leasing of equipment to small and
medium enterprises. It was formed in 1963 and had assets totalling
US$750 million at the end of 1980. Locabail will provide its expertise to
LOCAPOR in formulating its operating practices and procedures and training
its staff. LOCAPOR started commercial operations in May 1982.
5.03      LOCAPOR's authorized share capital of US$3 million has been fully
paid-in, and no further equity injections will be required during the first
five years of operations. During that period, the company will complement
its equity base through long-term borrowings in such a way as to reach a
conservative maximum long term debt/equity ratio of 83/17 (para. 5.10).
5.04      The company is managed by a three-member Board, with an initial
staff of twelve. The staff will gradually be increased as warranted by the
volume of operations. Representatives from Locabail will be seconded to
LOCAPOR during the first six months of operations and Locabail will also
assure other forms of technical support on an ongoing basis. Satisfactory
assurances have been obtained from LOCAPOR that it has appointed its
initial staff of qualified professionals and that during the first three
years of its operations, it will review annually its organizational and
staffing plans with the Bank.
B. Objectives and Operational Policies
5.05      LOCAPOR, which is one of the first equipment leasing companies to
be incorporated in Portugal, intends to assist in the development of
productive enterprise through the provision of lease financing across as
many industries and regions as possible. As mentioned below, leasing is an
important medium-term financial instrument whose development is particu-
larly urgent in Portugal, where medium-term financing has not adequately
developed and where leasing has a definite role to play in encouraging
capital formation in small- and medium-scale enterprises (para. 6.34). In



- 21 -
this context, LOCAPOR is committed to service small- and medium-sized firms
with medium- to long-term leases and to contribute to the development of
the domestic capital goods industry. The proposed leasing facility for
energy-saving equipment included in the Project, which will constitute a
part of LOCAPOR's overall equipment leasing operations, will also emphasize
small- and medium-scale enterprises.
5.06      LOCAPOR has submitted a policy statement, satisfactory to the
Bank detailing the leasing policies and terms, and appraisal and processing
procedures which the company will follow.  Appraisal standards will focus
on the technical and economic merits of the proposed investments, on the
prospective lessees' overall creditworthiness, on their ability to service
the lease, and on the quality of management. LOCAPOR intends to keep the
processing steps simple so as not to counteract the general objectives of
flexibility and simplicity of leasing as a financing instrument. Moreover,
LOCAPOR intends to emphasize the leasing of equipment with existing or
potential second hand markets in case of repossession subsequent to
default. This risk-reducing approach will also be emphazised within the
leasing facility for energy-saving equipment included in the Project.
C. Pre-Operating and Operating Plan
5.07      All the preparatory steps required for the start of commercial
operations in May 1982 have been taken in a timely fashion, following a
detailed schedule agreed with the Bank (Project File, Reference B). This
included the acquisition of office space, equipment and furniture,
preparation of manuals, establishment of accounting and control systems,
the preparation of model contracts, and the preparation of a marketing and
advertising campaign. It is important that improvements to the existing
commercial leasing company and contract legislation, which are under
preparation with Bank Group assistance, as well as a well-defined tax
regime for financial leasing, be enacted. A draft tax law for financial
leasing has been prepared and is planned to be enacted shortly. The
enactment of this tax legislation by the Council of Ministers will be a
condition of disbursement under the Leasing Component. Some of the
improvements sought for the existing commercial leasing company and
contract legislation are planned to be effected through a simple decree by
the Minister of Finance, and some, through a decree of the Council of
Ministers. Assurances have been obtained from the Government that by
December 31, 1982, appropriate proposals will have been made in order to
improve the relevant legislation in such a way as to enable financial
leasing to develop effectively as a financing instrument.
5.08      LOCAPOR's operating plan is based on overall demand estimates for
equipment leasing in Portugal, starting from US$30 million in 1982 and
increasing to about US$135 million in 1986. As shown in Annex 5, these.
projections assume that the market for equipment leasing will increase from
1.75% of projected total domestic investment in equipment in 1982 to about
5% in 1986. This progression is in line with experience in such countries
-as Ireland, where the corresponding ratio had reached about 7% in 1979,



-22 -
after a rapid build-up period. LOCAPOR's operating plan is based on the
further assumption that the company will be able to secure a one-third market
share within the overall market thus projected for equipment leasing in
Portugal. On this basis, LOCAPOR projects that its yearly operations will
grow from US$10 million in 1982 to about US$45 million in 1986.
5.09      Even if the overall equipment leasing market build-up in Portugal
were to turn out to be slower than assumed above, the competitive marketing
position of LOCAPOR with its CGD backing and access to CGD's marketing network
is expected to enable the company to secure a greater market share than the
one-third share assumed.

5.11      The projected financial ratios for LOCAPOR are generally in
line with typical ratios for leasing companies elsewhere and show a
comfortable profitability and liquidity situation which should ensure
that the company will remain financially sound even under a number of
foreseeable unfavorable developments, e.g., with respect to the spread
added to the cost of borrowed LOCAPOR funds in calculating the lease
payments (which is 5%, i.e., in line with leasing industry practices in
many developing countries). The average lease period assumed is four
years, which also adequately reflects normal average equipment leasing
terms. To ensure that the company will remain financially sound,
agreement has been reached that LOCAPOR will: (i) follow prudent
financial practices; (ii) not exceed a long-term debt/equity ratio of
90/10; (iii) maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.8; and
(iv) maintain its current liabilities other than the current portion of
long-term debt at less than 10% of total liabilities. With the various
assurances obtained above, LOCAPOR is considered creditworthy and
capable of carrying out the Leasing Component included in the Project.
VI. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Overall Project Objectives and Scope
6.01      The basic objective of the Project is to assist the country in
meeting one of the major goals of the draft National Energy Plan, namely to
reduce energy consumption in industry, which accounts for about 45% of
total energy consumption (50% including refineries) and offers the major
short-term opportunity for reducing the oil import bill (Chapter III). The
draft National Energy Plan has targeted 10-15% energy savings in the
economy by 1990, most of which will be achieved in the industrial sector.
In line with this objective, the Government has prepared, in close
consultation with the Bank,- an integrated package of policy and institution
building measures as well as investments, studies and energy audits. The
Project scope includes priority areas of this package, in which the
Government considers Bank technical and financial assistance important.
6.02      As described in earlier Chapters, the Government's industrial
energy conservation and diversification efforts include measures which are
expected to yield major savings in the energy bill of key energy-intensive
industries, while also offering technical assistance and financing for
promoting energy conservation in all segments of the industrial sector over
the medium-and longer-term. In addition, the Government plans to emphasize
development of renewable energy sources to increase domestic energy
supplies in the longer run. The Project includes four complementary
components designed to support all these priority areas:
(M) Energy-Intensive Industries Component: The Project's
largest component will provide support to large, public and
private, energy-users in the refinery, chemical and fertil-
izers, cement, and pulp and paper industries in implementing
energy conservation and diversification programs, through
the financing-of energy audits, feasibility studies,
engineering services and investments;



- 24 -
(ii)  Technical Assistance Component:   This component will provide
the technical assistance, training, and organization setup
required to effectively implement the new Energy Management
Decree (para. 3.09) and to promote energy conservation and
diversification throughout the industrial sector. It will
include: (a) a comprehensive energy survey of ten other
industries, 5/ through specialized consultancy services, to
help in the identification of energy-saving measures and
energy conservation/diversification investments in those,
predominantly private and smaller, industrial companies
which have limited or no in-house capabilities to achieve
this; and (b) consultancy services to help set up an
Energy Management, Audit and Training Center under MIEE
(para. 4.12);
(iii)  Leasing Component:   This component will provide financial
assistance for the establishment of a special leasing
facility for energy-conserving equipment, to be made
available to small and medium enterprises by LOCAPOR
(Chapter V); and
(iv)  Renewable Energy Comporient:  This component will include:
(a) a comprehensive study of the potential for increasing
the use of wood energy and other renewable energy studies
(b) strengthening of renewable energy research and develop-
ment, including the financing of agreed pilot/demonstration
projects; and (c) technical assistance to enhance the
capabilities of the institutions responsible for planning
and guiding Portugal's renewable energy program.
6.03       A summary of the overall Project configuration is shown in the

B. Energy-Intensive Industries Component
1. Description, Objectives and Scope
6.04      As indicated in Chapter III, four major energy-intensive
industries--oil refinery, chemicals and fertilizers, cement, and pulp and
paper--account for a substantial share of total industrial energy
consumption; they consume about two thirds of fuel oil, one third of elec-
tricity, and virtually all of the gas and naphtha consumed in industry.
Most of the production, and therefore energy consumption, in these indust-
ries is concentrated in a small number of large enterprises. As noted
earlier, with the recent increases in energy and feedstock prices, and as a
result of Government prodding for energy conservation efforts, most large
enterprises in these energy-intensive industries have already initiated
energy audits of their plant facilities. These efforts picked up momentum
particularly after the identification of the Project in mid-1980. As a
result of these audits, energy conservation and diversification programs
have been developed in the refinery, chemical and fertilizer, cement, and
pulp and paper industries. These programs, which will have very high
economic returns and will lead to a substantial reduction in Portugal's
energy import bill over the next 4-5 years, are described below and form
the basis of the Energy-Intensive Industries Component. This component
will finance energy audits, studies and equipment within an initial
1982-84 time-slice of the energy conservation and diversification programs
in these industries, in parallel with co-financing from bilateral and
commercial sources. As described below, the known energy conservation and
diversification programs for these industries, to be implemented between
1982-86, are estimated to cost about US$335 million, of which the
identified programs of five major companies--PETROGAL, PGP, QUIMIGAL,
CIMPOR and PORTUCEL--alone would amount to about US$230 million. By their
very nature, such programs must proceed in phases, as individual components
become ready and are implemented at different times. While the basic
objectives and overall scope of these programs are clear and well justified
and their key components already firmly identified, the implementation
schedules, and the exact scope of the components whose implementation would
start beyond 1982-84 are still subject to refinements.
6.05      The scope of the Energy-Intensive Industries Component included
in the Project, is therefore, limited, to helping meet part of the foreign
exchange financing requirements of the 1982-84 time-slice of the energy
conservation and diversification programs in the energy-intensive
industries concerned. The total cost of this time-slice is estimated at
about 60% of the overall 1982-86 programs, or US$200 million, with a
foreign exchange content of about US$130 million. The actual financing
arrangements for the foreign exchange requirements will depend on the
availability to each individual company involved of supplier credits and
other foreign currency loans. The main objective of this Project component
is to provide flexibility in the financing of the programs in the key
industries concerned by financing selected investments within these
programs whose foreign exchange requirements are not suitable for entire
financing through these sources. Such items, including equipment and
services, are estimated to amount to at least 20% of the US$200 million



- 26 -
time-slice, or US$40 million. The Bank loan allocation of US$20 million
would finance part of the tota'l foreign exchange requirements of these
items, estimated at US$26.0 mi'llion, with other cofinancing sources meeting
the balance. In addition to meeti'ng near-term needs and providing
flexibility in the financing of the programs of the industries concerned,
an important objective is to identify, particularly through the financing
of energy audits and studies in enterprises other than the major public
sector ones, energy conservation pirograms requiring substantial financing
and cofinancing assistance under f'ollow-up energy conservation projects.
Based on appraisal criteria described in Chapter VII, eligible subprojects
included in the energy conservation and diversification programs of the
major energy-intensive industries would be selected for financing by the
Bank under the Energy-Intensive Industries Component. A description of the
energy conservation and diversification programs in these industries is
given below; the main elements, estimated cost and economic parameters of
these programs are summarized in the table on the following page.
2. Refinery Industry
6.06      As in other countries, the energy requirement of Portugal's
refining industry for the processing of crude oil accounts for a
significant part of total industrial energy consumption, including 18% of
total industrial fuel oil consumption in 1979. Petroleos de Portugal
(PETROGAL),O/ the state oil company which owns all of Portugal's three
refineries at Sines, Lisbon and Porto, is implementing an integrated energy
conservation program in the Sines refinery (crude throughput capacity:
10.0 million tpy) and in the Porto refinery and aromatics complex
(6.9 million tpy).7/ This program consists of: (i) energy-saving
equipment additions and modifications at the Sines refinery and to the two
fuel lines, lube oil plant, and the! utilities section of the Porto
refinery; (ii) optimization of the product mix and refinery capacity
utilization level at Sines and Porto so as to minimize product costs under
the prevailing international crude and petroleum product market
situation8!; and (iii) energy conservation through improved refinery
operating and monitoring practices at all of PETROGAL's facilities.
6.07      The detailed technical description and economic analysis of the
program, developed by PETROGAL staff in consultation with the Bank, is
given in the Project File, Reference C.  The Sines co,nponent began
6/  PETROGAL is currently implement,ng the earlier mentioned petroleum
exploration project with Bank assistance (Loan i'o. 2024-PO).
7/  The Lisbon refinery was temporarily shut down in i979 to convert the
facilities for thermal cracking of fuel cil (1 million tpy) supplied by
the Sines refinery.
8/ As a result of this optimization program, petroleum product exports are
at a low level and the aggregate refinery operating rate has been kept
at about 50-55% of total capacity in 1981. Gradually higher levels of
capacity utilization are expected over the coming years.

implementation in the spring of 1982. This large investment is likely to
be suitable for suppliers' credit financing and PETROGAL is considering it
for a bilateral credit line provided by France; in case this component is
ultimately financed economically under this bilateral credit, as is
anticipated now, it will not be eligible for financing under the Bank
loan. The other three components, involving the Porto refinery and
aromatics complex, are slated for implementation during 1982-85. These
components are individually smalleir in size and are less suitable for full
financing entirely through bilateral credits.  They will be eligible for
financing under the Project.
6.08      Based on the completed energy audit and prefeasibility studies
for Sines about 6% of the current fuel requirements of the refinery, or
about 17,000 tpy fuel oil equivalent (FOE), is expected to be saved by
improved operating practices alone. Extrapolating this estimate to the
Porto refinery, and considering also the energy savings due to the planned
equipment modifications, total energy savings of 110-120,000 tpy FOE or
about US$22 million per year are expected from the overall refinery
industry program, whose total cost is US$42.3 million. The overall program
is expected to yield an economic return of about 41%. This estimate is
conservatively based on the low 1981 refinery capacity utilization level of
50-55%.
3. Chemical and Fertilizer Industry
6.09      Portugal's chemical and fertilizer subsector is dominated by a
few large companies. In particular, two public sector companies, Quimica
de Portugal (QUIMIGAL) and Petroquimica e Gas de Portugal (PGP) account for
about two thirds of the country's production of chemicals and fertilizers,
while PGP also supplies Lisbon's total towngas needs. These two companies
are also at an advanced stage of preparing energy conservation and
diversification programs, as a result of preparation work initiated in
1980-81.
6.10      QUIMIGAL, a Bank borrower (Loan No. 1649-PO, (1979)), is the
major producer of fertilizers and pesticides, inorganic chemicals and
metals, plastics and fibers, edible oils, and animal feed. While it has
production facilities at eight locations, the two major complexes are at
Estarreja and Barreiro, the latter being the site for the company's major
project under implementation, a fertilizer project financed by the Bank.
Due to the complexity of QUIMIGAL's operations, the company decided to
concentrate its energy conservation efforts initially on the Estarreja
complex. Consultants were hired in early 1981 to carry out a comprehensive
energy audit of the complex and to make recommendations for an improved
energy management system, improved operating practices and equipment
additions and modifications. The study, which is now complete, is being
followed by a similar study at the Barreiro complex. The latter study is
scheduled for completion by mid-1982.



- 29 -
6.11      The program identified for Estarreja comprises equipment for the
rehabilitation during 1982-85 of major energy-consuming plant units
(particularly electrolysers), waste heat recovery, energy-saving
modifications in the acid production process, and a switchover from naphtha
to less costly fuel oil for partial oxidation. An energy management system
will also be implemented, including organizational changes. The expected
capital cost of the equipment changes at Estarreja is about US$15 million.
Total energy savings of between 15-20,000 tpy FOE are forecast, with an
expected economic return of 20-25%. The ongoing audit of the Barreiro
complex would involve energy-savings measures and investments particularly
in the pyrites-based acid plants and the iron ore preparation plant; these
investments are expected to total US$6 million and have economic returns
similar to or higher than the Estarreja component. Details on the QUIMIGAL
energy conservation program are available in the Project File, Reference C.
6.12      PGP operates three ammonia/towngas plants near Lisbon and has
hitherto used naphtha as the raw material. Besides implementing an energy
conservation program, the company is considering a switchover to imported
Algerian ethane/propane/butane gas which would mark Portugal's first major
step towards increased diversification to sources of imported energy other
than petroleum (para. 2.08). The engineering firm which originally
designed the PGP plant has completed the necessary process engineering for
the plant modifications required for this feedstock changeover and for the
required handling and storage facilities. The US$18 million project has an
implementation period of three years. Negotiations on the quantity and
price formula for the imported gas are underway with Algeria. The economic
return for the project, at prevailing international gas prices, exceeds 30%
reflecting: (i) the lower unit energy costs compared with more expensive
naphtha; and (ii) the benefits from continued economical ammonia production
(whilst naphtha-based ammonia production is uneconomical and would have to
be discontinued). The initiation of project implementation will start upon
satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations with Algeria on the gas supply
contract; agreement is expected before June 1982. Details on the PGP
energy diversification project and Bank staff analysis of it are available
in Project File, Reference C. Subject to satisfactory conclusion of the
gas supply contract, this project will be eligible for financing under the
Bank loan.
6.13      While the QUIMIGAL and PGP energy conservation and
diversification programs are the most important and representative ones in
the chemical and fertilizer industry, smaller public and private companies
have also recently shown substantial interest in energy conservation
investments. Some have initiated energy audits of their major facilities
and have approached the Government for financial assistance, particularly
after the last two domestic energy price increases in July 1981 and January
1982. Energy conservation projects in these enterprises, provided they are
technically and economically well conceived, will also be eligible for
financing under the Project.



- 30 -
4. Cement Industry
6.14      With a total capacity of about 6 million tpy of cement and a
production in excess of 5 million tpy, the cement industry is a large
consumer of energy in Portugal, accounting for more than one fourth of
total industrial fuel oil consumption and a significant share of power
consumption. The industry is dominated by Cimentos de Portugal (CIMPOR), a
public sector company, whose six plants account for 70% of total cement
production.  Its major competitor, Companhia de Cal e Cimento, (SECIL),
accounts for virtually all of the remaining 30%. About 30% of the
industry's production capacity is still based on the wet process, which
consumes 60-70% more energy per ton of cement than the more efficient dry
process. Both companies are actively considering energy conservation and
diversification investments.
6.15      CIMPOR has developed an energy efficiency improvement program
designed to reduce the energy requirements of its main production
facilities and shift from fuel oil to more economic imported coal. Bank
staff have reviewed the first time-slice of the program, which is described
below, and consider it justified. Details on CIMPOR's energy conservation
and diversification program are in the Project File, Reference C. The
major element in the first phase of CIMPOR's energy efficiency improvement
program is the conversion to the dry process of a large wet process kiln at
the company's major plant at Alhandlra. The US$70 million project, which
would also result in a 25% increase! in kiln capacity, is now at the
supplier selection stage. The project would be implemented between
mid-1982 and mid-1985 as a turnkey package with substantial suppliers'
credit financing. On the basis of annual energy savings of 33,000 tpy FOE,
the expected economic return of the project is about 20%.
6.16      Regarding its plans to convert over the medium- to long-term all
of its plants to imported coal rather than more costly fuel oil, CIMPOR has
commissioned a feasibility study for conversion, in a first phase, of the
Alhandra plant, whose waterfront location would enable it to receive coal
through own pier facilities. The project, which would start to be
implemented in the second half of 1982 and completed in mid-1985, will
replace 175,000 tpy FOE by about 340,000 tpy of coal, and will thus
initiate Portugal's intended diversification efforts towards coal (para.
2.08).  Based on the resulting energy cost savings, an economic return of
15-25% (depending on the coal prices assumed) is estimated for the US$35
million project, which is eligible for financing under the Project.
6.17      SECIL owns four out of the country's six remaining wet process
kilns; the capacity of these four kilns totals 925,000 tpy of cement. The
company is implementing a US$60 million wet to dry process conversion,
project with suppliers' credits, and is also interested in conversion to
coal. The financing of the required studies, and subsequent financing of
the equipment needs identified for the latter, US$10 million project, which
is less suitable for full financing as a single unit investment through
suppliers' credits, would be eligible under the Project.



- 31 -
5. Pulp and Paper Industry
6.18      Next to the refinery and cement industry, the pulp and paper
industry is the largest consumer of fuel oil, and a significant consumer of
power in Portugal (para. 3.02). The industry's substantial potential for
using wood residues as fuel has only been partially tapped so far. The
industry is dominated by a public sector company, Empresa de Cellulose e
Papel de Portugal (PORTUCEL), which supplies about 75% of the domestic
market for pulp and -27Tof that for timber, while also being an active
exporter. The company has initiated energy conservation and diversifica-
tion studies including preparation of: (i) a uniform energy management and
accounting system for the company; (ii) energy balances in the main plants,
and of their energy conservation potential; this study is now entering into
a second phase involving identification of detailed measures to be
implemented; and (iii) potential for switching to wood fuel instead of fuel
oil for boilers and lime kilns. These studies will lead into an overall
energy efficiency improvement plan, which should also be of interest to
other smaller companies in the subsector.
6.19      The need to make greater use of tree bark, tops and roots (an
average of more than 40% of the tree volume is not made use of under
present practices) has been identified as the main area of emphasis. Since
retrofitting existing fuel-oil boilers to the direct use of wood chips is
expensive, the installation of wood gasifiers appears to be promising.
Pilot wood gasifiers in two of PORTUCEL's four major plants are slated for
implementation in 1982-83, representing about half of the 1982-83
investment budget of US$6 million for energy-related improvements. The
next stages of the program are expected to involve about US$30 million of
investments during 1983-86. The economic returns of those investments are
expected to exceed 20-25%. Details on PORTUCEL's energy conservation and
diversification program are in the Project File, Reference C.
6. Justification
6.20      Based on the analysis of the programs already initiated in the
industries covered in the Energy-Intensive Industries Component, the energy
conservation and diversification projects or programs which the Project
will assist are expected to yield significant energy savings and economic
returns (paras. 6.08, 6.11, 6.12, 6.15, 6.16 and 6.19).  While reducing the
cost of imported energy within a short time, these programs and projects
will also help improve the competitiveness of the enterprises involved,
particularly important in view of EEC entry. At the same time, these
programs are likely to be replicated in many aspects by other companies in
these industries.
C. Technical Assistance Component
6.21      The multi-industry energy survey and the technical assistance
included in the Project, while representing only about 3% of total costs,
will have an important role to play in improving future energy conservation
efforts, particularly with respect to the institutional strengthening
described in Chapter IV. The two major elements of this component are
described below.



- 32 -
1. Multi-Industry Energy Survey
6.22       Description and Objectives.   The Energy Survey will be performed
by a specialized foreign firm in association with counterpart Portuguese
personnel designated by LNETI to staff the future Energy Management Audit
and Training Center (EMATC, para. 4.12) and with staff drawn from IAPMEI
(para. 4.11). The foreign consulting firm will be selected from a list of
firms to be invited on the basis of their proven prior experience in
similar energy surveys.
6.23        In carrying out the survey, the consultants will undertake full
audits of about 60 sample enterprises in ten industrial subsectors other
than the large, particularly energy-intensive sectors addressed in the
first Project component. These industries (para. 6.02) were selected in
consultation with the Bank on the basis of their energy consumption levels
and energy conservation potential. These audits will be prepared for
medium- and small-scale enterprisies as well as energy-efficient and less
energy-efficient enterprises, as 'follows:

6.24        In addition to the above full energy audits of sample
enterprises, the consultants will also undertake more cursory audits
through brief visits of a larger sample group of enterprises in industries
including a particularly large number of enterprises, such as textiles,
bricks and tiles; the number of these audits will be decided upon by DGE,
in consultation with the Bank, following discussions with the consultants.



- 33 -
6.25      The principle objectives of the Energy Survey are as follows:
(i)    to carry out, in association with the counterpart Portuguese
staff, audits of the sample enterprises to identify the
energy savings potential through: (a) improved energy
management; (b) energy saving investments; and (c) use of
alternative sources of energy (coal, wood and wood residues,
solar);
(ii)   to identify and describe in detail, on the basis of these
sample audits, typical measures to be taken, and energy
conservation diversification investments to be recommended,
in each of the subsectors, with (a) estimates of energy
savings potential and economics of these typical measures
and investments; (b) a detailed technical description of
equipment additions and adaptations or changes in operating
practices recommended; and (c) description of available
types and supply sources for recommended equipment;
(iii)   to illustrate and convey to, the counterpart staff (a)
the internal audit procedures and energy measurement tech-
niques required to perform energy audits in enterprises
to conform with the new Energy Management Decree para 3.09);
and (b) the tasks necessary for EMATC (para. 4.12) to
subsequently perform other industrial subsector energy
surveys (similar to the ten initial ones); and
(iv)   to provide the Government with detailed data for each sub-
sector on the energy savings potential and achievable energy
consumption targets by type of facility, or major processes
or product lines, and by categories of equipment, as
required for the implementation of the Energy Management
Decree (para. 3.09).
6.26      For each industry, the consultants will prepare detailed,
practice-oriented manuals to help independent energy auditors, energy
managers (para. 3.09) and plant operators identify specific changes in
operating practices, processes, and equipment through which energy can be
conserved. These manuals, and simplified brochures derived therefrom, will
also be used for general and industrial subsector courses to be held by
EMATC and IAPMEI, (para. 4.12) as well as for individual industry subsector
promotion seminars for plant managers and operators.
6.27      As part of the Energy Survey, the consultants will also prepare
(i) a separate report consolidating data on the possibilities of switching
to coal, solar energy, wood and wood residues in these industries (partly
to help prepare the National Coal Plan); and (ii) a separate report on the
potential for utilities rationalization through cogeneration and common
utility setups in the Estarreja industrial area (chemical and other
industries) and in Braga (textile region).



- 34 -
6.28      Implementation Schedule and Responsibility.  Draft terms of
reference for the Energy Survey have been agreed upon with DGE (Project
File, Reference A).  In regard to selection procedures and criteri_a_,the
experience and quality of the consultant staff and the approriateness of
the proposed work plan and audit methods will be the main criteria used in
the evaluation of the proposals; due to the technical complexity and
multi-sector nature of the assignment, price will not be a key factor in
the selection process.
6.29      The implementation schedule for the preparation and carrying out
of the Energy Survey, as well as for counterpart involvement, parallel
training and seminar activities, has been agreed upon with DGE (Project
File, Reference A).  The Energy Survey activities will be initiated during
the third quarter of 1982 and will be essentially completed in the second
quarter of 1983.
6.30      DGE will be the recipient of Bank financing for the Energy Survey
and carry primary responsibility for its implementation. The Project
Coordinating Body (para. 8.01) has appointed a Project Manager to oversee
the Survey and coordinate the counterpart, training and seminar
activities. The Project Manager will be assisted, as required, by the
consultants whose primary responsibility will be to help set up EMATC
(para. 6.32).9/
6.31      Justification.  The Multi-industry Energy Survey is an essential
part of an integrated effort to strengthen industrial energy conservation
efforts. It complements the recent. Decree on Energy Management
(para. 3.09), the creation of EMATC within LNETI (para. 4.12), and the
intended greater IAPMEI involvement in the promotion of energy conservation
(para. 4.11).  It will help to identify, across key industries, technically
feasible and economically attractive energy conservation and diversifi-
cation measures and investments, while also providing a prime training
ground for the development of domestic energy auditing capabilities. The
cost of the Survey is estimated at US$1.6 million. From this perspective,
energy savings of less than 1,300 tpy FOE over the next 10 years would be
sufficient to justify such an outlay. These required savings are
exceedingly small compared with the energy saving potential which the
Survey is likely to identify.
2. Technical Assistance for Organizational Aspects
6.32      The second key element within the Technical Assistance Component
is the creation of the above mentioned Energy Management, Audit and
Training Center under LNETI. The proposed objectives, functions and
organizational arrangements of EMATC are described in para. 4.12. The
Project provides for approximately 15 man-months of consultant services to:
9/ These consultants will not, therefore, be hired as part of the
consultants team to be selected and retained for the Survey, and
will be selected separately.

(i) help define the scope and organizational structure, and organize the
work program and internal procedures of FMATC; and (ii) assist, as
required, the Project Coordinating Body (para. 8.01) and the Portuguese
Project Manager for the Energy Survey (para. 6.30) in overseeing the work
of the foreign energy auditing consultants. The cost of these services is
estimated at US$200,000; the assignment would involve one or two
consultants and start in August 1982, i.e., several months prior to the
start of the Energy Survey. The Project also includes mobile energy
measurement equipment (US$150,000) and specialized training abroad for
selected EMATC and DGE staff (US$50,000).
D. Leasing Component
1. Description and Objectives
6.33      The proposed leasing facility will be a pilot operation under
which important categories of energy conservation-related equipment (such
as new and more efficient boilers, turbines, hydraulic and steam
turbo-generators; solar energy panels and collectors; equipment to make use
of alternative energy (e.g., wood chips), improved dyeing and finishing
equipment for textiles) will be financed through leasing by LOCAPOR
(Chapter V). The leasing contracts will be of the full-payout type- i.e.,
the lease payments will be calculated in such a way as to include full
repayment of the equipment cost during the rental period, at the end of
which the equinment user could, and normally would, elect to purchase the
equipment outright at a very low residual price.
6.34      Financial leasing is an important medium-term financing
instrument whose development is particularly urgent in Portugal, where
medium-term financing has not yet adequately developed and where leasing
has a definite role to play in encouraging capital formation by medium-
and small-scale enterprises.10/ The Bank Group is involved in an overall
effort to develop leasing in-Fortugal, and the present nilot operation is
part of this effort, with the specific target of energy conservation-
related equipment. Leasing will provide a particularly simple and
attractive mechanism for financing this equipment. Since ownership of the
equipment involved will remain with the leasing company during the lease
period, the financing depends more on the ability of the equipment user to
service the lease payments from his cash flow, than on the size of his
assets and canital base. In the case of energy-saving equipment, the
investment will typically have a significant impact on the cash flow. The
investment payback period will in many cases be shorter than, or equal to,
the lease period, 11/ and the energy savings will often exceed the rental
payments. The lesser need for collateral on the firm's assets, and the
10/ A report prepared by the IFC Capital Market Department on Financing
Capital Formation through Leasing (May 1981) highlights the importance
of leasing in developing countries.
11/ The lease period is estimated to average 4 years under the LOCAPOR
energy conservation operation (para. 6.36).



- 36 -
near 100% financing (except for advance lease payment limited to less than
10%) will thus make lease financing of energy-saving equipment simple, and
hence particularly attractive for small- and medium-scale private enter-
prises.
6.35       It is important, both for the success of this pilot operation as
well as for the development of leasing in general, that industrial
incentives given by the Government be able to transit through the leasing
companies. For the above pilot operation, it means that if an enterprise
has received approval for an energy conservation grant (under the existing
energy conservation incentive scheme described in para. 3.06) for a piece
of energy-saving equipment, LOCAPOR and other leasing companies should be
able to cash in the grant so as to calculate the lease payments on a
correspondingly lower equipment cost basis. As mentioned, the Government,
with Bank Group assistance, is in the process of revising the regulatory
framework for leasing (para. 5.07). It is expected that the above
mechanism will be foreseen in the revised law, as it is in the legislation
of other countries.
2. Scope and Mechanism of the Leasing Component
6.36      The proposed Leasing Component will finance the foreign exchange
cost of energy conservation and diversification equipment financed by
LOCAPOR through financial leasing. The financial leases written for energy
conservation related equipment under the proposed facility are expected to
have terms generally between 3 and 7 years depending on the type of
equipment involved, cash-flow paramieters and other factors pertaining to
the equipment in question; with an average lease period of 4 years. As
noted, the monthly or quarterly lease payments will be calculated on the
basis of full payout (para 6.33) with a very low residual purchase price at
the end of the lease period and with a LOCAPOR spread of about 5 percentage
points over its borrowing costs, a spread which is adequate (para. 5.11).
Given the short payback and thus lease periods characterizing energy
conservation-related equipment, the Bank funds would be onlent by CGD to
LOCAPOR with the same repayment schedule as the overall Bank loan for the
Project (para. 7.09), with the funcls being used by LOCAPOR on a revolving
basis.
6.37      The portion of the Bank loan proposed for the leasing facility is
US$6.0 million.  It would finance 65% of the value of eligible energy
conservation equipment leased out b,y LOCAPOR (para. 7.16), the initial
amount of such equipment financed through the facility would thus be about
US$9.2 million, to be disbursed over 1982-84.  Based on historical data
from project applications under the existing energy conservation incentive
scheme (para. 3.07), the actual potential demand for lease financing of
such equipment could easily be about double that amount over this three
year period. Including subsequent rounds of disbursements under the
revolving fund structure of the facility, it is estimated that a total of
US$18 million of energy-conservation equipment would be financed through
the leasing facility during the life of the Bank loan. The eligibility
criteria, as well as appraisal, commitment and disbursement procedures for
the Leasing Component are detailed in Chapter VII (paras. 7.14 to 7.17).



- 37 -
3. Justification
6.38      Overall the leasing facility will: (i) encourage the implemen-
tation of energy conservation investments with short payback periods and
significant economic returns for some of the most common types of equipment
involved; and (ii) help get financial leasing off to a faster start, while
at the same time giving it immediately an orientation towards medium- and
small-scale enterprises. Possible follow-up operations through the Bank
Group could be envisaged based on the results of this pilot operation with
a view to covering a wider range of leasing companies and types of
equipment.
E. Renewable Energy Component
1. Description and Objectives
6.39      As already noted (para. 2.08), the development of Portugal's
renewable energy resources is an important element in the Government's
strategy for maximizing the use of indigenous energy sources. However,
like many other countries, Portugal has only recently begun to establish a
program for this purpose. Many of the country's renewable energy
resources have not yet been adequately assessed, research and development
activities to identify the best means of utilizing these resources have
been limited in scope and effectiveness, and the public agencies working in
the renewable energy field have been inadequately staffed and organized for
this purpose. The broad objective of this component is to help prepare the
basis for an expanded and more effective renewable energy program by
providing assistance in three key areas: (i) resource assessment;
(ii) research and development, including demonstration/pilot projects; and
(iii) technical assistance to the institutions primarily responsible for
renewable energy development.
6.40      Wood and Other Renewable Energy Studies.  Wood is Portugal's most
important biomass energy resource.  At present, fuelwood is a significant
source of household energy in rural areas, and wood residues are an
important fuel for forest industries and for certain small industries
(baking, ceramics) located near forest areas (para. 2.05). However, little
is known about the extent or efficiency with which wood residues are
presently being used for energy purposes, or about the technical and
economic potential for making more widespread and effective use of this
resource. The study will provide benchmark data on the present
availability and use of forest and forest industry residues, examine the
cost and other factors bearing on the prospects for increasing the supply
(e.g., by improving collection of forest wastes) and making more effective
use (e.g., through the introduction of advanced conversion technology) of
these residues, and seek to identify new markets in which wood fuels would
be economically competitive. The study would also assess the technical and
economic feasibility of tree planting for energy purposes on part of the
estimated 2.7 million hectares of presently unutilized land considered
suitable for afforestation. The study would require about 20-25 man-months



- 38 -
of consultant services and cost an estimated US$250,000. It is proposed
that the study be in two phases, with the most important forest areas being
covered in phase I and, if the results seem sufficiently promising, the
remainder in phase II. The component also includes studies of the market
potential in Portugal for three uses of renewable energy for which the
technology is already relatively well established: (i) the use of solar
flat plate collectors for domestic, institutional and industrial water
heating; (ii) the installation of biogas digesters to provide energy on
commercial livestock raising enterprises; and (iii) small wind energy
conversion systems for water pumping and electricity generation. The
studies are estimated to cost about US$150,000.
6.41      Research and Development.  To strengthen its renewable energy
program, Portugal must not only acquire greater knowledge of its renewable
energy resources, but also greater familiarity with the techniques for
converting them into useful energy' and increase their practical
applications. A well conceived research and development program, involving
testing and demonstration activities and the construction of pilot
projects, is necessary to enable Portugal to keep abreast of rapidly
evolving renewable energy technologies, to make well informed choices among
different technologies and to develop the capacity to adapt such
technologies to local conditions. Both DGE and LNETI have recognized these
needs, the former by financially assisting universities, foundations and
others with research projects and the latter by undertaking research in its
own laboratories. While much useful work has been done in specific areas
such as biogas, photovoltaics and wind energy, the research effort as a
whole has suffered from the lack of a clear sense of priorities, as well as
from insufficient resources.
6.42      Under the Renewable Energy Component, Bank financing would be
provided for subprojects already identified as being of high priority to
the research and development effort, and for subprojects to be identified
in the future. Subprojects already identified and agreed upon in principle
involve: (i) biogas utilization on a commercial scale; (ii) the use of
solar energy to provide industrial process heat; (iii) a photovoltaic power
system to provide electricity to an isolated village; (iv) passive solar
architecture; (v) facilities for the testing and certification of solar
collectors; (vi) the testing and development of improved materials for
solar energy systems; and (vii) biomass conversion technologies (Project
File, Reference D).  The first four subprojects entail the construction of
pilot facilities to test and demonstrate the practical application in
Portugal of what are essentially commercially available technologies. The
latter three involve testing and research activities designed to assist in
the development of the solar collector industry and of improved biomass
conversion technologies. The sub-projects would be implemented during
1982-83; their estimated total cost is US$1.3 million.
6.43      The component would also provide financing for additional
subprojects to be identified through a programming study. This programming
study is a critical element in the Government's effort to establish a more
systematic research and development program in the priority areas for



- 39 -
renewable energy development. Research and development needs in priority
areas will be carefully analyzed, research objectives clearly defined and a
work program incorporating specific projects meeting these objectives
prepared. An assessment of the capabilities of the major research
institutions (LNETI, the universities, foundations and others) for work in
the different areas of renewables would be an integral part of the study.
Special efforts would be made to obtain the views of present and potential
suppliers and users of renewable energy, to assess their research needs and
to solicit project proposals from them. Agreement has been reached with
the Government that the programming study would be completed by December
31, 1982 and its findings discussed with the Bank.
6.44       Including the subprojects to be identified through the program-
ing study for implementation during 1983-84, research and development and
pilot and demonstration projects with a total cost of not more than
US$1.9 million would be selected for inclusion in this component by mutual
agreement with the Bank, in accordance with the Government's priorities.
6.45      Technical Assistance and Laboratory Equipment.  Technical
assistance in the form of training, consultant services and equipment would
be provided to strengthen DGE and LNETI, the institutions primarily
responsible, for renewable energy planning and research and development,
respectively (paras. 4.05 and 4.08). DGE needs both to train additional
staff and to be able to call on outside expertise to assist it in carrying
out planning activities such as the above-mentioned programming study and
in performing operational tasks such as the evaluation of renewable energy
investment projects for which Government financial assistance is sought.
L.ETI also needs to train its staff for renewable energy work and to draw
on consultants for technical support in areas requiring special expertise.
The Project would provide specialized staff training and about 9 man-months
of consultants services to be used in approximately equal proportions by
DGE and LNETI. LMETI also requires specialized equipment to better equip
its laboratories for work in renewable energy. An amount of US$200,000 is
provided for technical assistance and laboratory equipment.
2. Implementation Arrangements
6.46      The terms of reference for the wood energy study have been agreed
upon between the Bank and DGE, which would be responsible for its implemen-
tation. DGE is making arrangements to obtain the technical cooperation of
the Forestry Department in selecting consultants, supervising the study and
evaluating its findings. The other market studies will be carried out
under the responsibility of DGE in cooperation with other concerned
entities. The research and development programming study would be prepared
by DGE, in cooperation with LNETI, and other research institutions. DGE
will appoint a full-time study director who would be a consultant with
extensive experience in renewable energy research and development. One of
the key functions of this consultant would be to assure that research and
testing activities done elsewhere are taken fully into account in framing
the Portugese program. OGE will be responsible for sub-projects intended
primarily to demonstrate practical applications of renewable energy tech-
nology on a commercial scale; subprojects mainly involving research and
testing will be the responsibility of LNETI, to be carried out either in



- 40 -
its own laboratories, or, under its guidance, by universities other
research institutions. Agreement on these organizational arrangements has
been reached with the Government.
3. Justification
6.47           Portugal has substantial potential for developing its renewable
energy resources. But to exploilt this potential, it needs to strengthen
its technical and institutional capabilities. By assisting Portugal in
assessing its resources, in gaining greater familiarity with renewable
energy technologies and their applications, and in strengthening the
principal agencies working in thi's field, the Renewable Energy Component
will help to put into place the essential foundations for renewable energy
development. This would make it possible for Portugal to subsequently mount
a sound renewable energy investment program which could, over time,
contribute materially to meeting the nation's energy needs.
VII. PROJECT COST, FINANCING, AND BANK LOAN FEATURES
A. Project Cost Estimate
7.01           The total financing requirements for the Project, including
physical and price contingencies and capitalized front-end fee, are
estimated at US$54.1 million equivalent, of which US$36 million in foreign
exchange. Physical and price contingencies were included in the cost
estimates for the subcomponents of the Technical Assistance and Renewable
Energy Components (para. 7.03). Physical and price contingencies for
individual subprojects to be financed under the Energy-Intensive Industries
Component will be determined as part of the subproject appraisals. The
capital cost breakdown is shown below.

7.02      Based on the analysis of existing energy conservation and
diversification projects in the four industries which are the subject of
the Energy-Intensive Industries Component, the average total foreign
exchange content is estimated at 65% of total project costs. The total
estimated foreign exchange cost of the US$40 million of equipment and
services to be selected for financing under this project component is
thus calculated at US$26 million (para. 6.05). Final capital costs of
individual subprojects will be established on a case-by-case basis as the
subprojects are appraised (para. 7.10).
7.03      For the Technical Assistance and Renewable Energy Components, the
average cost of consulting services is estimated at US$13,500 per man-month
in 1982 prices for foreign consultants, including per diem, travel and
other reimbursable costs. For the purpose of computing local costs, a
man-month rate of US$5,000 was assumed.  A physical contingency of 10% was
added. Detailed assumptions on manpower, travel, subsistence and other
expenses involved in the Multi-industry Energy Survey are available in the
Project File, Reference A.
7.04      As regards the Leasing Component, the cost of the energy
conservation-related equipment to be lease-financed shown in the above
table reflec-ts the cost of the equipment covered by the first disbursement
round of financing under the revolving fund (para. 6.36). Including
subsequent disbursements from recovered funds, the total cost of equipment
to be financed through the revolving fund over the life of the Bank loan is
estimated at US$18 million.

7.06      The US$20.0 million Bank loan allocation to the Energy-Intensive
Industries Component would finance part of the total foreign exchange costs
of the selected energy conservation and diversification subprojects, with
the remainder to be financed through bilateral and suppliers' credits,
commercial loans and the enterprises' internal cash generation. The
financing plans for each program or project submitted for Bank financing
will be determined during the apprlaisal of individual subprojects (para.
7.12); the Bank will seek to facilitate co-financing on a case-by-base
basis. The Technical Assistance aind Renewable Energy Components are to be
implemented by DGE(para_.4.02)anid LNETI (para. 4.07) under the budgets



- 43 -
the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Export. The Government will draw on
the Bank loan to fund the foreign exchange expenditures required for these
two components within these budget allotments. The Government has stated
that the necessary allocations have been made in the 1982 budget.
Satisfactory assurances have been obtained from the Government that it will
ensure timely provision of supplementary funds and resources, including
through appropriate budgetary allocations, required by DGE and LNETI to
carry out these Project components. As regards the Leasing Component,
LOCAPOR's large initial equity base (para. 5.03) will enable it to fund,
through the normal borrowing program planned for the company's first
operating years, the 35% share of the energy conservation leasing facility
not financed by the Bank loan (para. 7.15). As-a financial intermediary
with CGD backing, LOCAPOR will have access to wholesale loan sources.
Assurances have been obtained from LOCAPOR that it will continue to make
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for prudent financing of its
operations (para. 5.11).
7.07      The proposed Bank loan of US$30.0 million equivalent will finance
55% of the Project's total financing requirements of US$54.1 million and
83% of its estimated forei-gn exchange needs of US$36 million. It will be
made to the Government at the standard Bank interest rate for 13 years
including 4 years of grace, with a front-end fee of 1.5% on the amount of
the loan, and a commitment charge of .75% on its undisbursed balance.
It is assumed, for the purpose of calculating the Bank loan amount, that
the Borrower will elect to have the 1.5% front end fee capitalized and
financed through the loan. The provision for limited retroactive financing
of up to US$300,000 for expenses incurred after May 1, 1982 but before loan
signing is recommended for the Technical Assistance and Renewable Energy
Components.
C. On-lending Arrangements.
7.08      The proceeds of the Bank loan will be channelled in two ways.
The loan allocations for the Technical Assistance and Renewable Energy
Components will be channelled directly to DGE and LNETI by the Government.
The loan allocations for the other two components will be onlent through
CGD acting under an agency agreement with the Government. The completion
of a suitable agency agreement between the Government and CGD will be a
condition of effectiveness.
7.09      CGD will on-lend the loan proceeds under the Energy-Intensive
Industries Component to enterprises whose energy conservation/ diversif -
cation projects have been appraised and approved by the Bank (para. 7.11).
The specific repayment terms to be stipulated in the individual on-lending
agreements between CGD and the beneficiaries will be determined during the
appraisal of the subprojects, as explained below (para. 7.13), but will not
exceed 10 years. CGD will on-lend the loan allocation for the Leasing
Component to LOCAPOR; the funds onlent to LOCAPOR will carry the same
repayment terms as the overall Bank loan (para. 6.36). As regards the
on-lending interest rate under the Energy-Intensive Industries Component,
those companies who wish to bear the foreign exchange risk would receive
the on-lent Bank funds from CGD at the Bank's standard interest rate plus
an interest equalization fee equal to 10% of the standard rate. Those



- 44 -
companies availing themselves of the exchange risk coverage system
available under the Fundo de Garantia dos Riscos Cambiais (FGRC, Exchange
Risk Guarantee Fund) would pay the standard Bank interest rate plus the
interest equalization fee as determined above to CGD as well as a premium,
payable to FGRC, for coverage of the exchange risk such that the total cost
of the onlent funds equals the floating interest rate payable on Escudo
loans with similar repayment terms.12/ LOCAPOR will avail itself of the
latter option with respect to the Leasing Component.
7.10      The execution of a satisfactory subsidiary onlending agreement
between CGD and LOCAPOR will be a condition of effectiveness, while the
execution of the other subsidiary loan agreements on terms satisfactory to
the Bank, will be conditions of disbursement for the individual
subprojects. The loan administration features and procedures for the
Energy-Intensive Industries and Leasing Components are described below.
D. Eligibility and Appraisal Criteria for Energy-Intensive Industries
Component
1. Eligibility Criteria
7.11      The Bank loan allocation for the Energy-Intensive Industries Com-
ponent will be used for financing portions of the energy conservation and
diversification programs in the private and public sector companies of the
refinery, chemicals and fertilizer, cement and paper and pulp industries,
provided that the subprojects submitted for Bank-financing are large and/or
important enough to warrant a full '3ank appraisal, and that the Government
has approved each subproject, in the case of public sector enterprises.
The subprojects to be individually appraised by the Bank are expected to
number about 6. In addition, this component would finance initial energy
audits and studies necessary for private enterprises to formulate energy
conservation programs. QUIMIGAL and PGP (paras. 6.10 to 6.12) have already
expressed their wish to obtain fina:ncial assistance for their energy
conservation and diversification projects through Bank funds; appraisal of
their subprojects is at an advanced stage. Confirmation have been obtained
that the Government, through DGE, will select, along the above lines and
for Bank appraisal, projects suitable for financing under the component.
2. Appraisal Criteria
7.12      The appraisals will follow normal Bank standards with a minimum
economic return of 15% based on expected energy savings. They will include
an appraisal of the sponsoring company's financial prospects; company des-
criptions and financial projections for PETROGAL, PGP, QUIMIGAL and CIMPOR
have already been prepared and deposited in the Project File, Reference E.
Appraisals will be carried out, to the extent possible, in combination with
12/ Current interest rates in Portugal are positive in real terms. The
prevailing interest rate for medium- and long-term loans is 23%.
The domestic inflation rate was 22% in 1981 and is projected to
decrease to 15% in 1982, 14% in 1983 and 12% in 1984.



- 45 -
ongoing Bank work in the refinery (Loan No.2024-PO), chemical and
fertilizer (Loan No. 1649-PO), cement, and pulp and paper industries.
Moreover, supervision missions for the present Project will continue to
update Bank knowledge of the energy conservation and diversification
programs in the four industries concerned.
7.13      As mentioned, the repayment terms to be reflected in the
on-lending agreements between CGD and the beneficiary enterprises will be
determined as part of the appraisals. The repayment terms will depend,
within a maximum of 10 years, on the type and composition of the
subprojects submitted for financing, with short payback periods being
expected in the case of subprojects containing only equipment additions or
modifications, and longer payback periods in the case of subprojects
containing also initial plant or multi-plant audits or feasibility studies.
E. Eligibility Criteria, Appraisal, Commitment and Disbursement Procedures
for Leasing Component
1. Eligibility Criteria
7.14      The proposed leasing facility would cover the foreign exchange
cost of energy conservation or diversification equipment to be financed by
LOCAPOR through full-payout financial leases under the following criteria:
(i)  technical and economic viability, with the economic
viability being demonstrated through simple payback period
tests used under the current energy conservation incentive
scheme, with a maximum payback period of up to 6 years
calculated on the basis of the equipment cost and annual
energy savings valued at the cif import price of petroleum.
(para. 4.04).   Since it is expected that many applications
for leasing of energy conservation equipment will benefit
from the grants provided under the scheme, the use of
similar payback criteria and methodology is considered
practical and appropriate;
(ii) equipment cost not to exceed Esc. 40 million (about
US$600,000 equivalent); and
(iii)  total staff of company implementing the project not to exceed
600.
2.  Appraisal and Commitment Procedures
7.15      The procedures for determining subproject suitability for Bank
financing would be simple in view of the standard nature, and expected high
economic returns of the equipment to be covered under lease financing.



- 46 -
LOCAPOR will prepare an appraisal report including suitable details on the
sponsoring company, project description, objectives and technical features,
the source of the equipment and its price, payment and delivery terms, the
energy savings/payback period calculated as indicated above, and the lease
terms proposed. In most cases, potential lessees would also have applied
for, and obtained, an energy conservation grant under the existing energy
conservation incentive scheme. In those cases, most of the data required
in the LOCAPOR appraisal report would already be available at DGE so that
the DGE evaluation, if acceptable to LOCAPOR, could be submitted to the
Bank in lieu of its own separate appraisal report. After the Bank has
reviewed the first 5 such reports and subject to LOCAPOR's satisfactory
appraisal performance, the Bank will review, ex post, LOCAPOR appraisal
reports during normal supervision missions.   iEfthe-basis of its appraisal,
LOCAPOR will send to CGD a statement certifying that in its judgement, the
equipment is suitable for financing under the Bank energy conservation
leasing facility. LOCAPOR will submit to the Bank summary tables prepared
periodically (e.g. monthly) providing basic data for the projects, as part
of its progress reporting requirements.
3. Disbursement and Reuse of Bank Funds
7.16      A single percentage representing the expected average import
content of the type of equipment to be financed through the leasing
facility will be applied to disburse Bank funds. The average foreign
exchange percentage is estimated at 65% based on experience under the
existing energy conservation incentive scheme; this percentage will be
applied to all leasing contracts financed under the Leasing Component. The
use of a single percentage will simplify the administration of the loan
within the new field of leasing, where simplicity and flexibility is of the
essence.13/
7.17      Under the proposed revolving fund structure, the lease payments
receipts from the initial round of equipment lease-financed with the
assistance of the Bank funds will be accounted for separately among
LOCAPOR's sources of funds. The amounts corresponding to 65% of the
principal amount of these payments, after deduction of funds required to
service the Bank loan will be restricted for financing further energy
conservation-related equipment. The auditing of these separate accounts
will be covered under the proposed audit requirements (para. 8.03).
Agreement has been reached with LOICAPOR on the above eligibility criteria,
and appraisal, commitment and disbursement procedures for the Leasing
Component.
13/ This approach was also used under the Small- and Medium-Scale Industry
Development Project (Loan No. 1701-PO).



- 47 -
F. Procurement
7.18      Equipment financed by the Bank under the Energy-Intensive
Industries Component will be procured through international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines, except for: (i) equipment
proprietary to the process design; (ii) items whose supiy is critical to
efficient project execution and standardized equipment;    and (iii) small
items estimated to cost less than US$150,000 each, which may be procured
through limited international tendering from qualified suppliers from at
least two Bank member countries, Switzerland and Taiwan. Miscellaneous
items of equipment in packages of less than US$50,000 could be procured
under local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The
aggregate amount of equipment contracts procured under other than ICB
procedures is expected not to exceed US$5.0 million equivalent. For
purposes of bid evaluation under ICB, qualified local suppliers will enjoy
a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable duty, whichever is lower.
The Bank loan will also be used to finance the services provided by foreign
and local consultant and engineering firms under the Energy-Intensive
Industries Component. Procurement of these services will be in accordance
with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants; the terms of reference,
list of bidders, letter of invitation and evaluation criteria (within which
price will not be a key factor) will be agreed with the Bank. Local
equipment and services not financed by the Bank loan will be procured
through commercial practices followed by the enterprises for their normal
business transactions.
7.19      Procurement of consultant services, laboratory equipment, and
equipment/services for pilot and demonstration projects under the Technical
Assistance and Renewable Energy Components will be effected under Bank-
guidelines.  For equipment costing less than US$150,000 the limited
international tendering procedure described above shall apply; miscell-
aneous items in packages of less than US$50,000 could be procured under a
similar procedure or under local competitive bidding procedures. The total
amount of equipment procurement under these simplified procedures is not to
exceed US$1.0 million for these Project components. Under the Leasing
Component, LOCAPOR, after being approached for the financing throughi
leasing of energy-conserving equipment selected by the user, will check the
competitveness of the price and the reputation of the equipment supplier.
This review will be facilitated by the standard nature of the energy-
conserving equipment involved.  If LOCAPOR's engineers are not satisfied
that the prices and procurement conditions are reasonable, additional
quotations will be requested, or the financing refused. These procedures
are satisfacatory.

Since the Project is the first of its kind to be financed in Portugal, the
disbursement schedule was based on the disbursement profiles of each

VIII. PROJECT COORDINATION AND REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Coordination and Monitoring
8.01      Following Project appraisal, the Government has set up a
Coordinating Body for the Project, chaired by a delegate of the Secretary
of Energy and including the Director General of Energy and the Presidents
of LNETI and IAPMEI. This Body will oversee the overall Project
implementation and coordinate the activities of DGE, LNETI and IAPMEI with
respect to energy conservation and renewable energy. An Executive Group
reporting to the Coordinating Body has also been appointed. It is chaired
by the Secretary of Energy's Advisor and includes staff from DGE, LNETI and
IAPMEI. This Executive Group was involved in the preparation and
discussion of the Technical Assistance and Renewable Energy Components and
will be monitoring the main implementation steps for these components.
Confirmation has been obtained that the Government will maintain both the
Coordinating Body and the Executive Group during the Project execution
period.



- 50 -
8.02      After the completion of the programming study for renewable
energy research and development projects (para 6.43) and of the Industrial
Energy Survey, (paras. 6.22 to 6.31) there will be a need for the Govern-
ment to prepare a medium-term organizational, training and follow-up action
program for energy conservation. Agreement has been reached that the
Coordinating Body will prepare, or cause to be prepared, before September
1983, such a follow-up action program, and subsequently submit and discuss
it with the Bank.
B. Reporting and Auditing
8.03      Assurances were obtained that, through the onlending agreements,
the companies selected for financing under the Energy-Intensive Industries
Component will be required to submit to the Bank: (i) independently audited
Tinancial reports within four montihs after the closing of each fiscal year;
(ii) unaudited quarterly financial statements within 45 days of the end of
each quarter; (iii) bi-monthly progress reports within 30 days of the end
of each two-months period; and (iv) upon completion of the Project a
comprehensive report on project implementation, results and prospects. For
the Leasing Component, assurances have been obtained from LOCAPOR for
provision of  ill independently audited financial report within four months
after the close of each fiscal year; (ii) quarterly progress reports within
30 days of the close-of each period; and (iii) completion report being due
six months after full disbursement of the Bank loan category allocated to
LOCAPOR.
8.04      The Government has agreed that the above-mentioned Executive
Group for the Project will also prepare quarterly progress reports on the
Technical Assistance and Renewable Energy Components, as well as a
completion report for the overall P`roject, for submission to, and exchange
of views with the Bank. Accounts of project expenditures under these
components would be maintained by each of the agencies involved in
implementation and would be audited by Government auditors according to
standard Government practice, which is satisfactory.
IX. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
9.01      The Project will yield substantial short-term and longer-term
benefits through its various components, which include both physical
investments aimed at immediate energy cost savings and technical
assistance, studies and institution building measures. At the same time,
the innovative and multi-component nature of the Project involves certain
risks.
A. Project Benefits
9.02      The investments and studies included in the energy conservation
and diversification programs in the refinery, chemicals and fertilizers,
cement, and pulp and paper industries which the Energy-Intensive Industries
Component will support are expected to yield significant savings in the



- 51 -
energy bill of the country.  It is estimated that the energy conservation
projects included in these programs: (a) will save at least 250,000 TOE per
year or about 5% of total industrial energy consumption, with the economic
returns for the subprojects to be financed under this component being
generally in the 25-40% range or above; and (b) will replace about 350,000
TOE per year of petroleum products (particularly fuel oil and naphtha)
through change-over to imported coal and gas, and domestic wood resources.
The economic benefits and returns for the latter types of projects are not
based on reduced consumption of energy but on lower unit energy costs.
While their expected economic returns have therefore a lower minimum range
of 15-25%, these projects would initiate the move towards greater
diversification of energy sources. While reducing the cost of imported
energy, both types of projects would help improve the competitive position
of enterprises as well.
9.03      The Leasing Component will encourage the implementation of energy
conservation and diversification projects in small- and medium-size enter-
prises, by improving their access to the financing of equipment with short
payback periods. It is expected to yield significant economic returns
generally similar to those mentioned above. This pilot facility will also
assist in the introduction in Portugal of leasing, an important form of
medium-term financing for small and medium enterprises which needs to be
developed in the country.
9.04      The Technical Assistance Component's benefits derive from the
strengthening of the institutional capabilities with respect to industrial
energy conservation. The multi-industry energy survey will assist in the
identification of energy-saving measures and economical energy-saving pro-
jects in a broad segment of the industrial sector. It will also provide an
effective training vehicle in energy auditing for Portuguese staff
participating in the survey. The new Energy Management, Audit and Training
Center will allow the results of the survey to be converted into concrete
investment proposals, and will form the institutional basis for a stepped
up, sector-wide energy conservation effort.
9.05      In assisting Portugal in assessing its renewable energy re-
sources, in gaining greater familiarity with renewable energy technologies
and their applications, and in strengthening the agencies working in this
field, the Renewable Energy Component will help put into place the founda-
tion for renewable energy development. This will make it possible for
Portugal to mount a sound renewable energy investment program which would
contribute to meeting the nation's energy needs.
B. Project Risks
9.06      The technical and financial risks of the physical investment
components are considered moderate. They concern mostly existing plants
and commercially proven technologies, and represent relatively limited
investments at the individual enterprise level. The energy conservation
projects will reduce the consumption of energy and do not involve any



- 52 -
increases in production and sales and therefore, they do not entail any
additional market, financial or environmental risks. Coal switchover
projects with a potential impact on the environment will be appraised with
due regard for minimizing such impact through installation of adequate
equipment and controls.
9.07      The introduction of leasing in Portugal carries with it the risks
of introducing a new financing mechanism in a potentially volatile
financial market. This pilot pro(ram conservatively assumes therefore that
by 1986 only about 5 percent of inivestments in equipment by productive
enterprises would be lease-financed and that LOCAPOR would secure only
one-third of this market. The association within LOCAPOR of CGD, a large
and proven financial intermediary, Locabail, a major European leasing
company, together with most leading domestic equipment manufacturers is
expected to provide the necessary financial, marketing and management
strength and experience to LOCAPOR to allow it to develop this new business
and to secure and retain a major market share in it.
9.08      The main project risks are those deriving from the integrated
nature of the package of investments, financial and technical assistance,
studies and institutional realignment included in the Project. The Project
is complex in design and ambitious in scope, involving several diverse
institutions and a number of components. A key factor for its success will
be the coordination role to be played by MIEE. In this regard, the project
coordination arrangements described above are considered satisfactory.
Still, taking into account the pilot nature of some of the components--
particularly the multi-industry energy survey included in the Technical
Assistance Component, the Leasing Component and the pilot/demonstration
projects under the Renewable Energy Component--a substantial monitoring and
supervision effort on the part of Bank staff is considered necessary and is
planned for. To the extent that tihe Bank will thus gather experience for
follow-up projects in Portugal and similar projects elsewhere, however,
this effort is justified.
9.09      From a macroeconomic standpoint, the Project entails on the other
hand more limited risks than other projects implying significant capital
outlays and expansion of productive capacity.  The types of energy
conservation and diversification programs and projects included in the
Project have, as mentioned, a significant impact on energy costs and high
economic and financial rates of return, while representing relatively
limited investment programs at the enterprise level. As such, the
Project's implementation is less prone to be affected by delays in the
recovery from the present recessionary situation in the world or by
austerity measures in Portugal.

research and development; (ii) the mode of participation of
universities and other research institutions; and (iii) the
establishment of an annual planning and review mechanism, as
outlined in para. 4.15;
(f) suitable proposals will be made by December 31, 1982, for
bringing about improvements in the existing commercial leasing
company and contract legislation, including the transit of
industrial incentives through leasing companies (para. 5.07 and
6.35);
(g) it will implement according to a schedule satisfactory to the
Bank, the preparation and carrying out of the energy survey
activities, and related activities such as training,
(para. 6.29);

(k) it will through DGE, select and propose for financing through the
Bank loan a limited number of energy conservation or diversi-
fication projects in large energy-consuming companies of the
public or private sector, as well as initial energy audits and
studies required by other enterprises (para. 7.11);
(1) the Project Coordinating Body and the Executive Group will be
maintained during the implementation period of the Project
(para. 8.01);
(m)  it will ensure completion, under the responsibility of the
Project Coordinating Body and by September 1983, of an overall
organizational, training, and follow-up action program for
energy conservation (para. 8.02); and
(n) it will ensure the preparation by the Executive Group of
quarterly progress reports on the Technical Assistance and
Renewable Energy Components, and of a completion report on the
overall Project (para. 8.04).
10.02     The following undertakings have been obtained from LOCAPOR:
(a) assurances that LOCAPOR has appointed its initial staff and that
during the first three years of its operations, it will review
annually it organizational and staffing plans with the Bank
(para. 5.04);
(b) agreement on a policy statement satisfactory to the Bank
detailing LOCAPOR's leasing policies and terms, as well as
appraisal and processing procedures (para. 5.06);



- 55 -
(c) agreement that LOCAPOR will follow prudent financial prac-
tices, will not exceed a term-debt/equity ratio of 90/10, and

liabilities (para. 5.11);
(d)  agreement on the eligibility criteria as well as appraisal,
commitment and disbursement procedures to be followed for the
energy conservation leasing facility (para. 7.17); and
(e)  agreement on financial audit and progress reporting requirements,
as described in para. 8.03.
10.03      The completion of suitable agency agreement between the
Government and CGD and of a satisfactory onlending agreement between CGD
and LOCAPOR will be conditions of effectiveness (paras. 7.8 and 7.10).
The enactment by the Council of Ministers of a well-defined tax regime for
financial leasing will be a condition of disbursement under the Leasing
Component (para. 5.07).
10.04       In light of the satisfactory assurances and agreements obtained
as above, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan for US$30 million
equivalent for 13 years, including 4 years grace, at the standard Bank
interest rate, and with a front-end fee of 1.5% of the amount of the loan
due in full not later than the date of effectiveness. Retroactive
financing of up to US$300,000 is recommended.

INDUSTRIAL ENERGY CONSERVATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS FOR LOCAPOR
AND ASSUMPTIONS  MADE
A. Basis- for Projections
1.          The  financial  projections  for LOCAPOR  include  forecast income,
balance sheets, and sources and applications of funds statements, all
t                    expressed  in current Escudos.   They  are based on  projections prepared  by
LOCAPOR, which have been reviewed and restated by Bank staff.
2.          The projected  statements  are  shown  under the  format of the
Operating Method of Accounting, as opposed to the alternative Financing
Method of Accounting. Under the Operating Method, the full lease rental
receipts are recognized as operating revenues, and depreciation on leased
equipment as an operating expense. Under the Financing Method, only the
interest portion of the lease rental receipts is recognized as operating
revenue. Both methods are legitimate and lead to the same total earnings
and income tax over a given period, although the pattern within the period
differs depending on the method.
3.          The reference years, for the purposes  of the  projections,  start
March 31, since LOCAPOR is scheduled to start operations on March 31, 1982.
B. Operations Build-up Assumed
4.          The  expected build-up  for the leasing  operations  has  been  based on
the following assumptions with respect to the potential market:

ANNEX 5
Page 2
5.       This expected build-up in the equipment leasing market should be
feasible based on experience in other European countries. It assumes that,
by 1986, about 5% of investment in equipment by productive enterprises
could be leased-financed. In 1979, the equivalent ratio was nearly 7% for
Ireland, and around 8% for France, 11% for the U.K. and 15% for the U.S.
However, in many other European and middle-income developing countries, the
ratio is below 5%. Even if the overall equipment leasing market build-up
in Portugal were to turn out to be slower than assumed above, the
competitive marketing position of LOCAPOR with its CGD backing and assess
to CGD's marketing network is expected to enable the company to secure a
greater market share than the one third share assumed, particularly with
only one competing leasing company in existence and only 1-2 major ones
under formation.
6.       The market for financial leasing of equipment depends on the
advantages of leasing as a medium-term financing instrument from the point
of view of equipment users. In Portugal, medium-term financing is
relatively undeveloped, and leasing has an important role to play in its
development, especially within the small and medium enterprise sector. The
main advantages of leasing are due to its simplicity and flexibility in the
case of equipment of a relatively standard nature (for more complex
investments involving civil works, specialized equipment, and so on,
leasing is less appropriate than regular loans). The main advantages
comprise: (i) 100% or near 100% financing through leasing; (ii) lesser
collateral needs; and (iii) faster response time by leasing companies; the
leasing company's ability to extend such advantages are largely due to its
own ability to retain collateral ownership during the lease period.
7.       It is expected that in Portugal, with a significant small and
medium enterprise sector, equipment leasing will develop into an impor-tant
medium-term financing instrument on the basis of these practical
advantages. In contrast, possible tax advantages of leasing are not
expected to play a significant role in the development of leasing in the
country. Leasing can imply an income tax advantage for equipment users
only to the extent that the lease period is shorter than the normal
depreciation period of the equipment. The current Portuguese draft tax
regime for leasing foresees an initial period where, to help financial
leasing develop as an industry, the lease period could be up to one third
shorter than the normal depreciation period. To the extent that the
equipment user has sufficient taxable income to take advantage of this, the
average reduction in the total income tax payments by the users to the
Government is, nevertheless, of only 10-15% on a net present value basis
for typical equipment; this assumes that the equipment user would have used
straight line depreciation. This advantage, if it were to be indeed
retained for an introductory period in the tax regime as it will finally be
enacted, is therefore not expected to give leasing any significant edge
over regular medium-term loans for equipment financing; the practical
advantages mentioned above are more important in that respect.

9.       The average lease period assumed is 4 years.  The residual
purchase price at the end of the lease period has been assumed at 6% of the
original equipment cost. Lease rental payments have been assumed to be
made on a quarterly basis. All of the assumptions are adequate for
purposes of financial projections.
10.      The quarterly lease payments have been calculated at 9.42% of the
original equipment cost on the basis of the above assumptions. The
implicit interest cost reflected in this percentage is 27%, made up by an
average cost of borrowed funds of 22% plus a target LOCAPOR spread of 5%.
Spreads of 4-5% are realistic based on experience in developing countries
during the period of introducing of leasing.
11.      Salaries and social benefits, and other general and administrative
expenses have been estimated on the basis of LOCAPOR's planned
staff-build-up and of industry averages. LOCAPOR staff would increase from
an initial group of 12 to 25, in line with the build-up of operations
described above.
12.      A bad debt allowance of 1.5% of the value of the equipment leased
has been assumed in the projections; this percentage is higher than that
originally assumed by LOCAPOR staff (0.5%).
13.      The financing plan assumed in the projected statements is based on
an initial, fully paid in equity injection of Esc. 200 million, i.e., about
US$3 million (under the existing Portuguese leasing legislation, a minimum
capital of about US$3 million, half of which has to be paid in, is
required). LOCAPOR would then leverage up through long-term borrowing in
such a way as to reach a peak term debt/equity ratio of 83/17 during the
period, which is conservative by leasing industry standards.

15.      Despite the conservative long-term debt/equity ratio, a
satisfactory return on average equity is projected, particularly after the
first three years of the operations build-up period. The debt service
coverage ratio is projected to exceed 2.0. Overall, the assumptions made
for these projections and the resulting ratios are in line with those of
other leasing companies appraised by the Bank Group.
