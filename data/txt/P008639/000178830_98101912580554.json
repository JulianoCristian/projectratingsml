"The project is designed to assist\n            Portugal in reducing the energy consumption of its\n            industries, in diversifying their sources of energy, and in\n            developing the basis for an expanded and more effective\n            renewable energy program. The project includes four\n            components: (i) the Energy-Intensive Industries Component\n            for financing of energy audits, feasibility studies,\n            engineering services and energy conservation and\n            diversification investments in selected industries -\n            refinery, chemical and fertilizer, cement, and pulp and\n            paper; (ii) the Technical Assistance Component to help\n            identify energy-saving and diversification measures and\n            investments in other industrial sectors and to strengthen\n            institutional capabilities for energy conservation; (iii)\n            the Leasing Component for establishing a financial leasing\n            facility for energy-conserving equipment to be made\n            available to small- and medium-scale industrial enterprises;\n            and (iv) the Renewable Energy Component for a comprehensive\n            survey of the potential for increasing the use of wood\n            energy and strengthening of research and development\n            programs, including the financing of pilot/demonstration projects."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
