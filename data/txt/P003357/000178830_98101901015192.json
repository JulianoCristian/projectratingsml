project area includes parts of three\n            townships, Monywa, Chaung U and Budalin, which are located\n            in the dry zone of central Burma. The proposed project\n            entails the construction of about 106 new deep tubewells and\n            the corresponding irrigation and drainage systems. These new\n            tubewells together with 25 existing wells would be\n            electrified by a separate distribution system to be\n            constructed under the project. The project would provide for\n            agricultural support including extension, applied research,\n            fertilizers and chemicals. The project will also make\n            provision for technical assistance and training. It would\n            also assist GOB's efforts to diversify crop production\n            while increasing the value of non-paddy cash crops."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
