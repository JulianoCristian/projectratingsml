These new\n            tubewells together with 25 existing wells would be\n            electrified by a separate distribution system to be\n            constructed under the project. The project would provide for\n            agricultural support including extension, applied research,\n            fertilizers and chemicals. The project will also make\n            provision for technical assistance and training.
