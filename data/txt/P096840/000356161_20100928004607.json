performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) in a\n            difficult global setting, it was important for the Bank to\n            show enough creativity in designing a vehicle to provide\n            continued support to the Government's reform agenda; 2)\n            the importance of maintaining a policy dialogue in support\n            of longer-term strategic goals should be highlighted; 3) the\n            importance of combining knowledge and lending operations was\n            reaffirmed; and 4) in hindsight, it would have been useful\n            to include indicators that would assess performance in the\n            short term."}, "docdt": "2010-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
