The project\n            consists of two construction components: Jatiluhur Tertiary\n            Development (186,000 ha), and Cisedane Drainage (5,000 ha)\n            and Inspection and Access Roads (230 km); and a Studies and\n            Investigations component for the preparation of future\n            drainage and tidal land development projects. Following\n            completion of construction, the project would benefit about\n            425,000 families and would increase food production by\n            425,000 tons per year.
