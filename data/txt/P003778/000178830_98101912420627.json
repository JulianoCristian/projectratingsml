proposed project would: (a) assist\n            the Government's program of further upgrading its\n            existing irrigation systems at relatively low cost in order\n            to increase food production; and (b) facilitate the movement\n            of agricultural products, inputs and services. The project\n            consists of two construction components: Jatiluhur Tertiary\n            Development (186,000 ha), and Cisedane Drainage (5,000 ha)\n            and Inspection and Access Roads (230 km); and a Studies and\n            Investigations component for the preparation of future\n            drainage and tidal land development projects. Following\n            completion of construction, the project would benefit about\n            425,000 families and would increase food production by\n            425,000 tons per year. Risks would be normal for projects of\n            this kind."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
