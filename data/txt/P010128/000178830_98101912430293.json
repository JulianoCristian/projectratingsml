constitute the first, experimental phase of a long-term\n            program to overcome the major problems of primary education:\n            inequitable access, high dropout rates, low achievement, and\n            high costs. The Primary Education Project will: (a)\n            strengthen the teacher service through an extensive training\n            program; (b) improve supervision; (c) provide instructional\n            materials as well as technical assistance to develop new\n            materials and curricula; and (d) finance the construction of\n            class-rooms and teachers' residences. Project\n            assistance will particularly be directed at provision of\n            facilities and services that reach females and rural poverty\n            groups. The selective provision of project elements will\n            establish a basis for evaluation of their relative\n            contribution to improve access, lower dropout rates, a\n            better quality of instruction, pupil achievement, and\n            reduced cost in the delivery of primary education."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
