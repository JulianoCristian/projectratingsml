The Borrower did not have the\n            manpower to provide the needed service. Therefore, the\n            involvement of the Bank Resident Mission personnel in\n            project monitoring was an effective measure and should be\n            continued and strengthened. The major issues of conflict\n            were: (i) the Government was not clear on the actual needs\n            for technical assistance and was quite concerned about its\n            quality and nature, since the contract was in such general\n            terms that no one was able to fully understand what It\n            really Implied; (ii) some consultants arrived late and had\n            not been properly briefed and therefore did not understand\n            the nature of the project. It seems clear therefore that the\n            overall performance of the project provided sufficient\n            evidence to warrant the encouragement to use a balanced team\n            of expatriate and national consultants in a follow-on\n            project, but under clearly defined conditions This would\n            entail a clear dialogue and mutual understanding between\n            both parties with the view to avoiding all constraining\n            elements as those (and any other) confronted in this project."}, "docdt": "1987-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
