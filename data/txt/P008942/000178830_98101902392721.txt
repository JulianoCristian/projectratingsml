Amount:                   US$44.1 million equivalent (including capitalized
front-end fee).
Terms:                    Seventeen years, including four years of grace
with interest at 11.6 percent per annum.
Relending Terms:          The Borrower would onlend;  (i) the equivalent of
about $34.4 million to the Industrial Development
Bank of Turkey (TSKB) which would relend the
equivalent of $6.1 million to GUBRE, $25.3 million
to AKGUBRE and $3.0 million to EGE; and (ii) the
equivalent of $7.9 million to the State Investment
Bank (DYB) for relending to KBI. Onlending would
be for twelve years including four years of
grace. The interest rate to TSKB and DYB would be
11.6% and their loans to the beneficiary companies
would be at spreads of between 3.5% and 5.5%, with
the beneficiary companies bearing the exchange
risk. The Borrower will retain about $1.8 million
equivalent for a study.
Project Description;      The project aims at increasing the productivity
and energy efficiency as well as production in
selected fertilizer facilities through
rationalization and modernization of existing
facilities, energy savings and training.
The project consists of: (a) at GUBRE's plant at
Iskenderun with rated capacity of 200,000 ton per
year (tpy) triple superphosphate (TSP), spare
parts and final engineering for investments in
rationalization/modernization, pollution control,
and conversion from TSP production to diammonium
phosphate (DAP); (b) at AKGUBRE's plant at Mersin
with rated capacity of 594,000 tpy calcium

ammonium nitrate (CAN) and 148,000 tpy of DAP,
rationalization, energy saving, pollution control
and addition of new 600 ton per day (tpd) ammonium
sulphate (AS) unit; (c) at EGE's plant at Foca
with rated capacity of 306,000 tpy of complex
fertilizer (NP) rationalization, pollution
control, and changes enabling the plant to produce
additional varieties of fertilizer; (d) at KBI's
plant at Samsun with rated capacity of 350,000 tpy
of sulfuric acid (sold to Azot Sanayii for
production of TSP), rationalization and
modernization; (e) training programs for staff of
the beneficiary companies; (f) study by the
Government of domestic fertilizer raw material
resources.
The major benefits are more cost-efficient
operations, substantially increased production
from the rationalized facilities and lower energy
costs. Following project completion, an estimated
additional 630,000 tpy nitrogen and phosphate
fertilizers, 10,000 tpy of blister copper,
240,000 tpy of sulphuric acid, 180,000 tpy of
nitric acid, and 25,000 tpy of phosphoric acid
will be produced at lower unit cost, and $80
million per year of foreign exchange saved at 1980
prices. Technical risks are moderate, as the
project deals with existing plants and
commercially proven technology. The main risks
are delays in implementation and increased costs.
These have been mitigated by providing, where
necessary, expatriate specialists to strengthen
the operational staff and by the involvement of
experienced engineering firms.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A SECOND FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$44.1 million (including
capitalized front-end fee) to help finance the foreign exchange costs of a
Second Fertilizer Rationalization and Energy Saving Project. The loan would
have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest at 11.6
percent per annum. The equivalent of about $6.1 million, $25.3 million and
$3.0 million would be onlent to Gubre Fabrikalari (Fertilizer Manufacturing
Company), Akdeniz Gubre Sanayii (Mediterranean Fertlizer Company), and Ege
Gubre Sanayii (Aegean Fertilizer Company) respectively, through the Industrial
Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and about $ 7.9 million to Karadeniz Bakir
Isletmeleri (Black Sea Copper Corporation) through the State Investment Bank
(DYB) for 12 years including 4 years of grace. The interest rate to TSKB and
DYB would be 11.6 percent and their loans to the beneficiary companies would
be at spreads of between 3.5 and 5.5 percent, with the beneficiary companies
bearing the exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       The last economic report entitled "Turkey:  Policies and Prospects
for Growth" (No. 2657a-TU) and the Postscript thereto, were distributed to the
Executive Directors in December 1979 and March 1980 respectively. Updating of
economic prospects as well as indepth economic analysis and dialogue has since
been undertaken through the continuing work on structural adjustment loans
(SALs) to Turkey, and two special economic missions. The report of the
special economic mission in November/December 1980 to evaluate the investment
program and entitled "Turkey: Public Sector Investment Review" (No. 3472-TU)
was distributed to the Executive Directors in December 1981. The report
entitled "Turkey: Industrialization and Trade Strategy" (No.3641-TU) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on February 18, 1982. Its analysis is
also reflected in this Part. Annexes I-A and I-B contain the Basic Country
Data and relevant details about recent economic developments.
Characteristics and Development Constraints
3.       Turkey is a country about as big as France and Germany combined, with
an estimated GNP per capita of $1,450 in 1980. With a population of around
45 million, the density is low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land),
although the rate of urbanization is high (about 45 percent). Educational
enrollments have expanded greatly, but the rate of adult literacy remains
relatively low (60 percent). Although population growth is not high by
middle-income country standards (2.2 percent per annum), the employment
situation has deteriorated steadily, with an unemployment rate of about
1/       Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
President's Report on the Export-Oriented Industries Project (P-3199
TU) dated January 29, 1982.



-2-
16 percent, despite rapid economic growth, substantial emigration of workers
to Western Europe in the early 1970s and the more recent flow of workers to
the Middle East. There is little or no absolute poverty, but income
distribution is still relatively skewed. Data for more recent periods is
incomplete, but indicates a worsening especially of the position of wage and
salary earners over the last few years with a sharp real decline in the
minimum wage. There are also considerable regional differences, and large
rural-urban disparities.
4.       Agriculture is the most important sector in the economy. It
contributes 23 percent of GDP (1980), employs about 55 percent of the labor
force, and provides about half of merchandise exports. Turkey is one of the
very few developing countries which is self-sufficient in food. Yet,
agriculture has been given a secondary role compared to industry in the
development strategy. The main sector objectives have been to: (a) expand
food supply for a growing population; and (b) provide exports to finance
industrial development. Turkish agriculture is dualistic; a modern irrigated
commercial sector using modern inputs in coastal areas, produces cash crops
and most exports; traditional rainfed agriculture emphasizing grains and
livestock, is practised on the Anatolian plateau where only a small part of
the irrigation potential has been developed, despite massive investments
through slowly implemented and long-gestating projects.
5.       With its natural and human resources, Turkey has considerable
potential for expanding agricultural production and exports. The major
constraints on growth and productivity are: (a) limited development of
irrigation/ drainage facilities and poor utilization of what has been
developed; (b) small and fragmented farm holdings; (c) inadequately funded and
poorly coordinated research and extension services; (d) insufficient
availability of credit; and (e) inadequate marketing arrangements, especially
for exports. Increased productivity could be realized with a somewhat larger
and more efficient allocation of investments, backed by more coherent credit
and price policies and support services.
6.       Reflecting the heavy emphasis of the development strategy on rapid
industrialization, industry has absorbed up to 30 percent of total
investment. Consequently, it today accounts for 19 percent of GDP, 48 percent
of exports (mainly textiles, processed foods and leather products), but only
14 percent of employment. The private sector is overwhelmingly dominant in
exports, and accounts for some 60 percent of value-added and an even higher
share of employment. Industrial policy has sought to achieve self-sufficiency
through import substitution, use of advanced technology and greater depth of
integration in productive processes, with consequent priority for capital
intensive investments in basic and intermediate products. Exports have
generally been given a secondary role, and accounted for only about 4 percent
of sector output in 1979. The principal policy instruments used have been
large public investments in inefficient State Economic Enterprises (SEEs),
and generous incentives combined with high levels of protection for private
investments. These policies yielded high growth rates, domestic production
of some key basic and intermediate goods based on domestic resources, adoption
of modern technology, a skilled labor force, as well as some dispersal of
industries to less developed regions. But they also resulted in the
establishment of a number of uncompetitive industries, wasteful of scarce
capital and too dependent on imported inputs, with low employment and limited
export possibilities.



-3-
7.       The major sector constraints which the Government is now attempting
to overcome, are: (a) low levels of capacity utilization; (b) limited export
capability in some subsectors; (c) inefficiency of the manufacturing SEEs;
(d) lack of sufficient long-term financing for industry; and (e) excessive
dependence on imported inputs and low productivity. Apart from import
protection, several factors have adversely affected productivity, of which a
marginal research and development effort and inadequate labor training are of
particular importance.  Export efforts have also been hampered by the
limitations of marketing facilities.
8.       Turkey has large underdeveloped energy resources (hydropower and
lignite), but little petroleum. Energy consumption has grown in line with
GDP, but remains below the per capita average for middle-income developing
countries. H*wever, imported oil accounts for over 85 percent of oil
consumption and about 45 percent of total energy consumption. As a result,
the oil bill was $3.3 billion in 1980, equivalent to 113 percent of exports,
probably the highest figure in the world.
9.       Hence, the energy situation has become a major preoccupation of the
Government, and the sector has been accorded the highest economic priority.
Prices for most products - especially petroleum products - have since 1980
been brought into line with prices in Europe and other indices of real costs
to the economy.  Investments in energy now have the largest share in the
public investment program. The principal sector constraints are: (a)
organization and management of institutions in the sector; (b) the lack of
comprehensive demand-management and conservation programs; (c) insufficient
resources for exploration; and (d) poor project implementation capacity,
especially in the power and coal/lignite sub-sectors.
Government Policies Until 1980
10.      Economic policies until the mid 1970s were responsible for the
achievement of rapid economic growth, with substantial growth in industrial
capacity.  However, both the pattern of growth and the excessive recourse to
external finance, especially in the seventies, resulted in the substantial
problems which Turkey is confronting today. At the same time, income
distribution remained relatively unequal; employment creation inadequate;
savings performance poor; and the industrial sector mostly inefficient,
despite sizeable investments, and not contributing sufficently to either
exports or employment.
11.      In the past decade, economic management suffered further due to
political instability, which thwarted effective decision-making. At the same
time, economic problems were aggravated by serious economic shocks emanating
from abroad: international inflation, leading to a sharp rise in Turkey's
import prices (including oil) and a significant deterioration in her terms of
trade; high interest rates resulting in an increased debt servicing burden;
and recession in Europe leading to reduced export prospects and emigration
possibilities. Inappropriate expansionary policies in response to these
factors delayed Turkey's adjustment to the changed international environment,
so that by 1977 the country was set on a course of rapidly growing inflation
and an inexorable foreign exchange crisis. By 1977, the inflation rate had
escalated to 25 percent against 15 percent in 1976, and was rising: the
budget deficit as a percentage of GDP increased to over 6 percent; with a
tripling of imports between 1973-77 to $5.8 billion and merchandise exports
and workers' remittances equalling only $1.8 billion and $1 billion in 1977,
the balance of payments deficit soared to $3.6 billion, or over 6 percent of
GDP. The Government's response to the crisis emerging since 1973 was to



-4-
increase external borrowing, mainly short-term. Consequently by end-1977,
total external indebtedness surged to $11 billion, of which short-term debt
alone was $6.2 billion. A crisis of confidence developed, the inflow of
external capital nearly ceased and Turkey faced a host of severe interlocking
domestic and external problems. Since January 1980, to achieve its goal of
reestablishing viable growth and increased efficiency of resource allocation,
through greater reliance on market forces and the introduction of an outward
orientation in economic policy, the Government has adopted a series of
measures in the areas of exchange rates, export promotion, protection policy,
interest rates, SEE prices, taxes, investment criteria and incentives, and
institutional reforms. A number of additional medium-term policies continue
to be initiated, and it is clear that the Government is determined to follow
through with its newly adopted development strategy.
Government's New Policy Priorities and Actions
12.      The new regime, which took over following the military intervention
on September 12, 1980, has vigorously pursued these new policies, pari passu
with efforts to restore political order following a period of rampant
terrorism, paralysis of the constitutional process, and widespread labor
unrest.  It has also emphasized, unlike previous military regimes in 1960-61
and 1971-73, that it will transfer power to civilian authorities once order is
restored and a new viable democratic system suited to Turkish circumstances
bas been constitutionally established.
13.      Especially since September 1980, there has been substantial action on
economic policies, although the severity of the economic crisis has forced the
new government to continue to focus much more on short-term than on
medium-term concerns. In view of the severity of the crisis, and the urgent
need to bring down inflation and stabilize the balance of payments as quickly
as possible, it has accepted the need for a temporary sacrifice of growth and
social objectives. However, while financial aspects of economic management,
especially availability of foreign exchange and balancing the budget, have
come to dominate policy concerns, fairly drastic structural changes have been
made or initiated in the operation of the exchange rate regime, the tax
system, interest rate policy, export strategy, the SEE sector and public
investment policy.
14.      On development issues, a welcome change is beginning to be apparent
in the scope as well as in the sectoral emphasis to favor the development of
energy, infrastructure and agriculture, at the expense of manufacturing,
especially as far as the allocation of public sector resources is concerned.
There is acceptance of the division of labor between the public and the
private sectors, with the former now expected to concentrate on the provision
of infrastructure while the latter provides the main impetus to industrial
growth and exports. The administrative arrangements in the agriculture
sector are being drastically recast to provide better service support to the
farmers. The development strategy has also changed, to give much greater
weight to exports, relative to import-substitution. Finally, and most
significantly, reliance on the market mechanism is being emphasized as against
more centralized planning, including in the inefficient SEE sector. Given the
long period of inward orientation, detailed planning and administered prices
prevalent until January 1980, the impact of these changes will take some time
to manifest. They also r-eed to be complemented by further actions, which the
Government proposes to pursue, to fully implement the new development strategy.
15.      The retrenchment following the financial crisis resulted in both
public and private investment declining in real terms since 1977. The overall



level of investment in 1980 was around that in 1975, with private investment
being barely larger than in 1974. The extreme shortage of domestic resources
resulting from the Government's restrictive policies on credit and high
interest rates aimed at bringing down inflation, has necessitated rationing of
investible funds. The high oil import bill also forced a drastic reduction in
capital goods and raw materials imports needed for public and private sector
investments. The private sector, which to some extent has also continued to
adopt a wait-and-see attitude before investing, nas been particulariy affected
by the shortfall in resources, high cost of credit, and the lack of a
developed capital market.
16.      Despite the Government's attempts to reduce the investment-savings
gap and improve on the poor savings performance of the past years, the results
in 1979-80 continued to be poor as the Government had to bear the large
financial losses of the SEEs. However, as a result of major tax reforms in
late 1980/early 1981 and improved expenditure discipline, there was a
significant improvement in public accounts in FY81. The budget deficit is
expected to be about 1 percent of GDP vis-a-vis 4 percent in FY80; the SEE
financing requirements are estimated to have been reduced to 8 percent of GDP
in 1980, compared to 11 percent in 1979.
17.      The new Government's policies to reduce the size of public
investments, stimulate the private sector to take the slack, and overall, to
further reduce the gap between savings and investments, will need to be
vigorously pursued.  In the last three to four years, the strategy has been to
meet the gap by tapping external financing on a prudent basis, which practice
is expected to continue. Turkey obtained increased support and debt
rescheduling from OECD countries and diversified its aid relationships with
OPEC countries, especially Saudi Arabia and Libya. Loan commitments, which
totalled $2.5 billion during 1972-75, increased over threefold to $8 billion
during 1976-79, and the gross public M&LT disbursements in 1980 reached about
$1.5 billion.
Effects of the 1980-81 Policy Measures
18.      These new policy directions are beginning to show results.  The
recent results are provided in Annex I-B. Briefly, the average annual rate of
inflation has been successfully brought down from 107 percent between
January-December 1980 to around 35 percent for the same period in 1981. The
flexible exchange rate policy under which the TL has been adjusted daily since
May 1981, together with the new export oriented policies, have led to an
unprecedented export growth in 1981; exports are estimated to be over t4.5
billion, or over 55 percent higher in dollar terms than the 1980 level.
Increases were concentrated in manufactured goods, which experienced a rise of
nearly 120 percent; product groups with the largest increases included
textiles, clothing, cement, iron/steel, and non-electrical equipment, with the
Middle East becomming an increasingly important market. A new and rapidly
growing source of foreign exchange is income earned from construction
contracts (with a gross value of nearly $7 billion in 1981) in the Middle East
and North African countries. These activities are also expected to add to the
normal flow of worker remittances, which remained strong throughout 1981.
Although import growth continued to be strong in 1981 (around 14 percent of
GDP), import volumes had declined sharply in 1978-79, and as a proportion of
GDP, will remain well below the 1974-77 average. Given these developments,
the current account deficit in 1981 is expected to be about $2.6 billion (4.1
percent of GNP) compared to $3.2 billion in 1980 (5.5 percent of GNP).

19.     In response to the freeing of interest rates, total deposits in July
1980-June 1981 increased by 97 percent and time deposits (including
certificates of deposit) by an astonishing 265 percent over the corresponding
period in 1979-80.  Since July 1981, private companies have been free to set
their own bond rates in competition with banks, and can use flexible rates, if
they so choose. The Capital Market Law was passed in July 1981 and steps are
being taken to establish a capital market. Following steps to improve SEE
financial performance - by freeing most SEE prices and gradually exposing SEEs
to market forces - the SEE losses are projected to be only TL 5 billion in
1981, compared to TL 72 billion in 1979. This gain was partly offset by the
increases in SEE investment expenditures which in 1981 stood at TL 534
billion, compared to TL 460 billion in 1980. The major tax reform initiated
in late 1980/early 1981, is now beginning to show effect. The overall deficit
on public account in 1981 is estimated to be about 1.5 percent of GDP,
compared to 4.5 percent in 1980.
Medium Term Prospects
20.     Making a reasonable assumption that the Government's new economic
policies will continue and be followed-up by further necessary measures, one
can tentatively project that the investment rate over the next 5 years could
average 23 percent of GDP and gross domestic savings 19 percent of GDP, with
the current account deficit remaining on average close to the 1980 level of
about $3 billion.  This could allow the economy to grow at an annual I'oerage
of between 4-5 percent during 1981-85. The gross capital inflow required to
meet the financing needs would reach $6 billion in 1985, as against slightly
over $3 billion in 1981. The past and prospective movements of macroeconomic
indicators are summarized in the Table below.

21.      The balance of payments picture in the 1980s could however be less
severe if: (a) worker remittances increase by 2-3 percent in real terms,
instead of remaining constant as assumed in the above table; (b) remittances
from overseas construction activities annually average about $300 million
during the 5-year period (instead of $15-20 million assumed earlier); and
(c) average import elasticity is between 1.0-1.1 (instead of an assumed 1.1-
1.2). The current account deficit in 1985 could then be below $2 billion,
necessitating gross capital inflow of $5 billion in 1985.
:'2.     The viability of prospects in the table are briefly discussed below.
continuation of economic and fiscal policies give room to expect that the
inflation rate can be progressively brought down further between 1982-85.
Policies, including continuation of the present exchange rate policy, and the
excellent 1981 export performance, should also make it possible for Turkey
to achieve a real growth of exports of about 19 percent per annum during
1980-85. The export growth rate appears attainable, taking into account the
low export base and market prospects, especially in the Middle East and North
African countries, and the present underutilization of industrial capacity.
However, as the economy returns to a normal growth path, non-oil imports as
well as the demand for energy should pick up significantly. Although
government policy is to substitute domestic energy resources, especially
lignite, for imported oil to the extent possible in all major consuming
sectors, Turkey will have to continue to rely heavily on imported oil. The
oil import bill is estimated to increase from $3.6 billion in 1980 to $6.6
billion in 1985; but as a percentage of exports of goods, it is likely to
decline to 73 percent in 1985 from 113 percent in 1980. The pressure of oil
imports on the balance of payments position will thus continue.
23.      A significant determinant of future prospects, in addition to
increased aid flows, will be the negotiation of substantive improvements
in trade policies towards Turkey. Revised agreements between the EEC and
Turkey in 1977 and 1980 have partly compensated for the erosion caused by
EEC restrictions on labor movement and textile exports, and offer hope for a
better future relationship. The EEC could provide a large and growing market
for Turkey's engineering products, as well as textiles and clothing - if their
quality and product composition is upgraded. Moreover, Turkey has recently
succeeded in diversifying its trade to include larger shares for the Middle
East and North African countries, from 14 percent in 1978 to 44 percent in
the first ten months of 1981. While these markets are becoming increasingly
important to Turkish firms, exports from Turkey represent only a small
proportion of the manufactured imports of these countries. Hence, while one
should cautiously interpret the recent upsurge in sales to Iran and Iraq,
Turkey has excellent possibilities to increase exports of relatively simple
engineering goods, cement, and various chemicals, in addition to processed
food, to these markets, in view of its geographical proximity and cultural
ties.
Creditworthiness
24.      At the end of 1978, Turkey faced an overwhelming debt burden of $7.5
billion in short-term debt and $6.8 billion in M&LT debt. Turkey was faced
with service payment obligations (mostly on short-term debt) of $5.1 billion
(including arrears), or nearly three times the value of merchandise exports
in 1977. Prolonged discussions with over 200 creditor banks resulted in an
agreement in July 1979 to reschedule a total of $3.0 billion in short-term
liabilities, including some $2.4 billion in convertible Turkish Lira deposits



and $400 million banker's credits (both at 1.75 percent above the London
Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR), with 7 years maturity including 3 years grace)
and $300 million in third party reimbursement credits (also at 1.75 percent
above LIBOR, but with an accelerated repayment schedule). Some $300 million
in oil loans were also rescheduled in 1979. At the end of 1980, arrears on
unguaranteed trade credits were consolidated in an amount of around $1
billion. As a result of these exercises, short-term debt outstanding at
end-1980 was reduced to $2.8 billion, the balance having been converted to
M&LT debt. Finally, in January 1981, leading commercial banks agreed in
principle to extend the terms of the 1979 commercial debt rescheduling. A
series of large-scale rescheduling operations relating to M&LT official debt
also took place. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, OECD member creditors rescheduled
$1.0, $1.1 and $2.5 billion respectively of debt service obligations and
accumulated arrears (the last exercise including some re-rescheduling). The
terms of the 1980 rescheduling were 8 to 10 years including 4 to 5 years of
grace, and provided debt relief estimated at $1.1 billion in 1980 and another
$0.8 billion in 1981, with smaller amounts thereafter. Without these
reschedulings, the debt service ratio would have been around 29 percent
instead of 12 percent at the end of 1980, on short-term debt of $2.8 billion
and M&LT debt of $14.3 billion. Nevertheless, debt service obligations are
likely to remain high over the coming years. The ratio is likely to rise to
about 33 percent in 1985, and still be around 30 percent if the favorable
assumptions spelled out in para. 21 are realized. The high ratios in the mid
to late 1980's, are partly the result of repayment, which would amount to
about $1.0 billion in 1985 alone of rescheduled debt carrying a very high
interest rate, and partly due to the need to borrow additionally in the coming
years to enable the economy to achieve a modest level of growth and revived
vitality. However, despite the rapid increase, the debt burden should remain
manageable, provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive further international
support from private and official donors.
25.      On all aspects of economic analysis, the IMF and the Bank have
coordinated closely with each other, and Turkey continues to be in good
standing with the IMF. A three-year standby arrangement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1,250 million was approved by the IMF's-Board and became
effective on June 18, 1980. Under the arrangement, Turkey has thus far made
six purchases totalling SDR 760 million, including the tranche for SDR 100
million released in January 1982.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
26.      The Bank/IDA have to date lent about $3,432 million, through 67
projects. Agriculture accounts for 20 percent of funds lent, industry and
DFCs (including structural adjustment) for 41 percent, power for 12 percent,
and urban development, transportation, education and tourism for the rest.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of September 30, 1981, with notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
27.      The implementation of private sector projects has been satisfactory.
Political instability, limited coordination amongst ministries, staffing
problems and the serious external and domestic financial crisis since 1977



- 9 -
have seriously affected project implementation in the public sector. A system
of joint project reviews between Turkey and the Bank was instituted in June
1975. This has resulted in distinct, but modest, improvements. The broad
reform of the public sector launched in January 1980, and pursued with new
measures since then, allows cautious optimism that performance can be
gradually improved further, provided it is not eroded by new factors,
including shortages of resources.
28.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting the economic policies initiated
in January 1980, especially: (a) the pursuit of an export-oriented
development strategy; and (b) domestic economic policies aimed at establishing
a macro-economic balance, increasing domestic savings, restraining public
investment and reorienting it to reflect the new Government priorities
(completion of ongoing projects, emphasis on quick-yielding new investments,
and balance of payments impact). The Bank has discussed with the Government
how its overall lending can best contribute to the latter's medium-term
objectives, and help remove past policy and institutional constraints. A
series of structural adjustment loans (SALs) are envisaged, at the
Government's request, to support its program of structural adjustments that is
being implemented. Agriculture, industry and energy will be the key sectors
for project lending. In agriculture, projects emphasize livestock, exports,
and rural development; in industry (including DFCs), the emphasis is on
promotion of exports and employment, and the gradual strengthening of the
SEEs. Energy projects underway are in power generation based on domestic
hydro and lignite resources; future projects will emphasize the oil/gas
sub-sector and coal/lignite. Projects for urban development and public
utilities may supplement these efforts. The close macroeconomic and sector
dialogue established with the Government in recent years is expected to be
pursued on key issues. The economic and sector work undertaken over the last
15 months includes special studies of the public investment program, of
industrialization and foreign trade strategy, and of the energy sector, and
completion of sector memoranda on agriculture and industry. In addition, the
progress made in fostering structural adjustment will be monitored in the
context of each future structural adjustment loan.
29.      Besides the proposed project, other projects expected to be ready for
consideration by the Executive Directors in this fiscal year are for sewage
disposal, highway rehabilitation, and the third one for structural adjustment.
Other projects being processed include: agricultural credit, irrigation
completion, development of gas reserves, rehabilitation of the paper and
cement industries, and a supplement to the Elbistan loan.
30.      The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was 8
percent in 1980, and is expected to grow to about 11 percent by 1985. Its
share of total debt service payments (excluding debt rescheduling) is
projected to increase from about 10 percent in 1980 to about 12 percent in
1985.
31.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum,
iron and steel products, motor bicycle engines, piston rings and cylinder
liners, and tourism. It has also invested in the Turkish Industrial
Development Bank (TSKB). As of September 30, 1981, gross IFC commitments
totalled about $226 million, of which $92 million were still held by IFC. New
investment opportunities are being pursued.

PART III - THE FERTILIZER SUBSECTOR AND THE BENEFICIARIES
Introduction
32.      The fertilizer industry underpins Turkey's agricultural sector, which
in turn, is a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings. The
industry includes 10 public, private, and mixed sector companies with 18
plants, 6 of them commissioned in the last five years. The installed capacity
is about five million product tons, equivalent to about one million nutrient
tons of nitrogen and 850,000 nutrient tons of phosphate fertilizers. Capacity
utilization has been poor in recent years (around 30-40 percent prior to 1980)
and domestic production does not meet demand, a cause for serious concern
since fertilizer imports are substantial (an estimated $493 million in 1980
for finished products and $221 million for inputs). Since the import cost of
inputs is about 40-60 percent of the import cost of the finished product,
increased and more efficient use of installed capacity would bring significant
foreign exchange savings. Capacity utilization in the sector increased to
about 67 percent in 1981 from about 47 percent in 1980 due largely to improved
access to imported raw materials. Since the Government underestimated
improvement in production and overestimated fertilizer consumption in 1981,
more fertilizer was imported than required, leading to temporary surpluses of
some types of fertilizer. While some triple superphosphate (TSP) was exported
in 1981 and additional exports of TSP are expected this year, this is regarded
as only a temporary phenomenon.
33.      Fertilizer is produced in Turkey from a wide variety of inputs,
ranging from impcrt-based petroleum feedstocks to domestic lignite; Turkey has
substantial lignite reserves and two of the world's limited number of lignite
based fertilizer plants. It also has large deposits of low grade pyrites
(iron disulphide) suitable for the production of sulphuric acid, a key
intermediate for phosphatic fertilizer production, much of which is still
imported. Extensive deposits of phosphate rock are known to exist but are of
low quality and in remote locations. Hence, except for lignite and pyrites,
Turkey does not possess substantial proven raw material resources for
fertilizer production. Most of the basic inputs (oil for naptha and fuel oil
feedstocks, rock phosphate, and sulphur) and some intermediate products
(ammonia, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid) are imported. Altogether,
Turkey depends on imported materials, directly or indirectly, for 80 percent
of its fertilizer needs.
34.      In the long-term, prospects are good for Turkey to maximize the use
of local materials such as lignite, pyrites and possibly natural gas for
producing fertilizer. In the medium-term, besides increasing production and
productivity, lower energy consumption per unit of production can be obtained
from existing capacity by the substitution of locally available lower cost
feedstocks such as refinery gas for high-value naptha and by the adoption of
energy conservation measures. Considerable foreign exchange can also be saved
by increased production of intermediates such as sulphuric acid based on
domestic pyrites or imported sulphur. Because of the availability of
alternative feedstocks and improvements in the technology for using lignite,
expansion plans for the next few years are focused on examining the
possibilities of developing a third lignite-based plant and a plant based on
natural gas resources in Thrace which might prove suitable for fertilizer
production.



- 11 -
35.       Estimated 1981 production reached about 639,000 nutrient tons of
nitrogen (compared to 460,000 tons in 1980) and 544,000 nutrient tons of
phosphatic fertilizers (compared to 352,000 tons in 1980). Still consumption
in 1981 exceeded domestic production by about 137,000 tons of nitrogen, while
there was a small surplus of 45,000 nutrient tons of phosphatic fertilizers.
The sharp increase in production in 1981, raising the average capacity
utilization to 67 percent in the sector, is about the limit of what can be
achieved through improved raw material supply. Further increases in capacity
utilization, which are required to meet expected increases in demand, require
rehabilitation and rationalization. Low capacity utilization in the
fertilizer industry has been due to several factors including: technical
bottlenecks arising from design deficiencies, poor maintenance, or shortage of
spare parts; poor and uneven quality and unreliable supply of local raw
materials; weak organization and management; lack of trained manpower; working
capital difficulties; inadequate foreign exchange for raw materials and spare
parts; power shortages; and inadequate water supply. Steps to correct some of
these problems have already been taken, leading to major increases in
production. The Government is giving priority in the allocation of foreign
exchange to fertilizer inputs rather than finished product imports, and a
considerable proportion of these imports of inputs is being financed out of
the structural adjustment loans. Most of the other major problems would be
addressed directly by the proposed project.
The Market and Marketing
36.      Agriculture accounts for about 60 percent of export earnings, of
particular significance in the current balance of payments crisis. While
Turkey is self-sufficient in food, there is scope for increasing the area
under cultivation and using more intensive methods, involving increased use of
fertilizer. Fertilizer consumption has increased rapidly during 1972-77 (by
15 percent per annum) and reached 780,000 nutrient tons of nitrogen and
660,000 nutrient tons of phosphate nutrients in 1979. It declined sharply in
1980 in response to substantial price increases but 1981 consumption has
rebounded to 776,000 tons of nitrogen and 499,000 tons of phosphatic
nutrients. Although the increases in use have been significant, consumption
is still relatively low, about 55 kg/ha of arable land in 1979 (as compared to
about 80 in Spain and Portugal). The Bank projects consumption to increase at
about 10 percent per annum for nitrogen and 12 percent for phosphates during
1981-87 and by 1987 to reach about 1.4 million nutrient tons of nitrogen and
1.0 million nutrient tons of phosphatic fertilizers. This assumes that retail
prices would rise gradually to world levels, but the ratio of fertilizer
prices to crop prices would continue to be favorable. Assuming reasonable
capacity utilization levels, domestic production should reach about 810,000
tpy of nitrogen and 679,000 tpy of phosphate nutrients by 1987, still below
demand.
37.      DONATIM, a public sector company responsible for supplying inputs to
farmers, is responsible for fertilizer distribution. Less than 10 percent is
distributed by the Turkish Sugar Company (SEKER). These two firms are also
the only authorized fertilizer importers. Fertilizers account for about half
of DONATIM's sales. It has done a reasonable job in the physical distribution
of fertilizers through its network of outlets throughout the country.
However, with the increased consumption of fertilizer, there is a need to
examine whether the present dealer network, warehousing system and transport
network are adequate for handling the increasing volume of fertilizer, as well
as whether, in line with the Government's market oriented policies, producers



- 12 -
should be allowed to distribute part or all of their products directly. The
fertilizer pricing system in Turkey also needs review with a view to bringing
about necessary changes. While the Government has indicated in connection
with the Second Structural Adjustment Loan that it intended to eliminate all
fertilizer subsidies within five years, the phasing and other policy changes
needed to avoid a disruption of production requires review. Accordingly the
first Fertilizer Rationalization Project (Loan 1985-TU) includes a marketing
and pricing study scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1982.
Fertilizer Pricing
38.      Ex-factory and retail fertilizer prices are controlled by the
Government. Both were substantially increased in 1980 and 1981. Retail
prices are now 600 percent and ex-factory prices 200-300 percent above the
1979 levels. Despite this, retail prices are still about 40 percent below the
CIF landed price plus local distribution costs. The subsidy is financed by
the agriculture sector through a Price Stabilization Fund which derives its
resources from a levy on the margin between the price received by agricultural
product exporters and the price paid to farmers. This arrangement appears to
provide a reliable source of funds for the fertilizer producers. Earlier
accounts receivable problems, which impeded fertilizer producers ability to
produce, appear to have been eliminated.
39.       Under a new system established in January 1980, ex-factory
fertilizer prices are established every six months by a formula based upon
world market prices of comparable products (adjusted for abnormal
fluctuations). The formula is designed to provide an incentive for local
fertilizer producers to increase domestic value-added. By providing an
international reference point, it also encourages more economic investment
decisions by producers and facilitates the planned transition to a market
price system. Under the formula, ex-factory prices for most products are
currently between 100 and 113 percent of the CIF landed price for imports.
Most producers are now operating profitably and generating sufficient cash
from their operations. The Government has agreed that for so long as it sets
ex-factory prices for fertilizer, it would set such prices at levels not less
than the CIF price of comparable imported products (Loan Agreement, Section
4.02).
The Beneficiary Companies
40.      Gubre Fabrikalari (GUBRE) is a joint sector company established in
1953. Its ownership is divided among; three State Economic Enterprises
(SEEs), holding 34 percent of the shares; agricultural cooperatives and
insurance companies with 35 percent of the shares; and private shareholders
holding 31 percent. It operates two 200,000 tons per year (tpy) triple
superphosphate (TSP) plants, one at Yarimca and the other at Iskenderun, and a
200,000 tpy complex fertilizer plant also at Yarimca. The rationalization of
the Yarmica plants is being financed under Loan 1985-TU. Production at these
plants increased from about 400,000 product tons in 1980 (67 percent of
capacity) to 522,000 tons in 1981 (87 percent of capacity). However,
considering the age and corrosion problems of these plants, this production
level cannot be sustained without rehabilitation. GUBRE has shown a profit
over the last five years, and earned about $6.4 million equivalent in 1980,
after taxes. The company has a debt/equity ratio of 64/36 and a current ratio
of 1.2:l, which while somewhat low under normal circumstances, is acceptable



- 13 -
under current conditions of high inflation and high real interest rates with
the company reducing inventories and receivables to minimum levels. These
ratios will improve when the fertilizer price increase for the period July to
December 1981 is paid retroactively.
41.      Akdeniz Gubre Sanayii (AKGUBRE) is a joint sector company established
in 1968 to produce calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and diammonium phosphate
(DAP). It is owned 47 percent by AZOT (a fertilizer manufacturing SEE),
47 percent by two Kuwaiti companies and 6 percent by two commercial banks.
Its factory at Mersin depends on imported rock phosphate and ammonia, and
pyrites (partially local). Installed production capacity is 594,000 tpy of
CAN and 148,000 tpy of DAP. However, due to serious technical problems,
particularly in the sulfuric, phosphoric and nitric acid plants, capacity
utilization in 1981 was only 56 percent for CAN and 35 percent for DAP. The
company incurred continuous losses during 1977-79 due primarily to low
capacity utilization resulting from shortages of imported raw materials and
spare parts. Given the increase in prices in 1980 and improved collection of
receivables, the financial position of AKGUBRE improved substantially in
1980. The company showed a profit in 1980 of about $10 million equivalent.
In 1981, profits are estimated to have increased further to about $12 million
equivalent, and the debt/equity and current ratios improved to 17/83 and
8.7:1, respectively.
42.       Ege Gubre Sanayii (EGE) is a private sector company located in Yeni
Foca on the Aegean Sea Coast. Its plant was completed in 1978, but due to
mechanical problems could not start commercial production until 1979. The
plant has an installed capacity to produce 306,000 tpy of complex fertilizer.
However, capacity utilization was only 43 percent in 1980 and increased to 54
percent in 1981. EGE earned a profit in 1980 of about $3 million equivalent.
The company is in a sound financial position with a current ratio of 2.7:1 and
a debt/equity ratio of 48/52 in 1980.
43.      Karadeniz Bakir Isletmeleri A.S. (KBI), a public sector company, was
founded in May 1968 to process the copper ore mined by the Murgul Copper Works
on the Black Sea Coast. KBI operates copper mines and concentration plants at
Murgul. The ore extracted at Murgul is concentrated at site and the copper
concentrate is transported by sea to Samsun where it is smelted to produce
blister copper. As part of the smelting process, sulfuric acid is produced as
a byproduct which is supplied to the nearby AZOT fertilizer plant in Samsun.
Through a loan (1998-TU) in May 1981 to the State Investment Bank (DYB), the
Bank is assisting in financing the modernization of'KBI's copper concentrate
production facilities in Murgul which had been operating at about 50 percent
of capacity. This is expected to result in increased raw material
availability for the Samsun copper smelter and sulfuric acid plant. Due to
changes in Government policy in 1980, KBI is now free to set its price
independent of Government regulations. 1/ The current prices are close to
international levels. As a result KBI, which had shown losses in 1977-78 and
a small profit in 1979, increased its 1980 profit to TL 1.3 billion (about $14
million) and its debt/equity and current ratios improved to 4/96 and 2.2:1,
respectively. It also earned a profit in 1981.
On-lending Institutions
44.      The Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB), established in
1950, is one of the oldest and most experienced development finance companies
associated with the World Bank Group. Its principal shareholder is Turkiye Is



- 14 -
Bankasi, Turkey's largest private commercial bank, which together with its
pension fund owns 39 percent of the capital. The remainder is owned by eleven
private sector Turkish institutions (46 percent), private individuals (12
percent) and IFC (3 percent). TSKB has an experienced and competent
management team. While its portfolio has been seriously affected by the
disruptions to the Turkish economy over the past several years, it has mounted
a program for dealing with the situation which is being monitored under the
recently approved Export-Oriented Industries Project (Loan 2093-TU). For more
details see the President's Report on that project (P-3199-TU dated
January 29, 1982).
45.      The State Investment Bank (DYB) was established in 1964 to provide
long-term credits and other services to SEEs. DYB itself is an SEE reporting
to the Ministry of Finance. As part of its structural adjustment program, the
Government has decided to increase DYB's role in appraising the viability of
SEE investment proposals and in supervising their implementation. Starting
with the current fiscal year, all foreign exchange loans contracted by the
Government are being made available to operating SEEs through DYB. All local
currency loans to SEEs for investment purposes from the Government budget are
being made only after DYB has appraised the project and under DYB
supervision. For more details on DYB see the President's Report (P-3051-TU
dated May 4, 1981) on the State Industrial Enterprise Finance Project (Loan
1998-TU).        -
Bank Assistance in the Sub-Sector
46.      The Bank has financed two fertilizer projects in Turkey.  The first
was the IGSAS Ammonia/Urea Project (Ln. 84'5-TU of June 1972 with supplementary
financing approved in April 1975). The Bank's operations in the industrial
sector have been reviewed by the Operations Evaluation Department in its
report entitled "Sector Operations Review: Industries and DFC's Program in
Turkey" (Report No. 3077 dated July 18, 1980). This report and a separate
Project Performance Audit Report on the IGSAS Project (Report No. 3037 dated
June 17, 1980), noted that the IGSAS project had faced a number of financial,
managerial and technical problems, particularly during start up, including
frequent management changes and difficulty in maintaining adequate debt/equity
and current ratios. These problems have been subsequently resolved and high
capacity utilization has been achieved. The Audit Report also noted the
contribution of the IGSAS project to Turkey's agricultural development and
remarked on the high level of competence of middle-level technical and
managerial personnel in the Company. The other fertilizer project financed by
the Bank is the first Fertilizer Industry Rationalization and Energy Savings
Project (Loan 1985-TU) approved in May 1981 to finance rehabilitation and
modernization of four fertilizer complexes. This loan became effective in
September 1981 and the project is currently making good progress in its
initial phase of implementation.
47.      The Bank policy in the fertilizer subsector has been to encourage
progressive movement toward economic prices while maintaining suitable
incentives to farmers and fertilizer producers and avoiding distuptions of
agricultural production; provision of adequate supplies of fertilizer to meet
demand; improvement in capacity utilization, energy conservation, and
1/ While fertilizer prices are regulated, fertilizer raw material prices are
not.

productivity, and reduction in cost of existing plants (through rehabilitation
and energy savings projects such as this one and Loan 1985-TU); and investment
in new productive capacity for products which Turkey can produce more cheaply
than it can import, particularly for products based upon local raw materials.
These objectives have been assisted through our financing of appropriate
studies (the marketing and pricing study included under Loan 1985-TU and the
fertilizer raw material study included in the proposed project) and through
policy discussions in connection with our Structural Adjustment Loans and
economic and sector work, as well as through our direct lending activities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
48.       Since 1979 there has been growing concern over the poor capacity
utilization in the fertilizer industry. Encouraged by the Bank, the
Government and the major fertilizer producers identified seven of the eighteen
plants in the country as having the highest economic priority for
rehabilitation. Because of local and foreign resource constraints, these were
then separated into two projects. The first project, encompassing four
plants, was financed under Loan 1985-TU. The second project is currently
proposed for financing.
49.      Preparation of both projects was carried out by the sponsoring
companies, coordinated by AZOT and assisted by a number of specialized foreign
consultants financed by a $600,000 advance under the Bank's Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) (P-027-TU). The proposed project was appraised in
June 1981. Negotiations were held in Washington in February/March 1982, with
a delegation headed by the Chief Financial Counselor of the Turkish Embassy
and including representatives of the Treasury, the State Planning Office
(SPO), the four beneficiary companies and the two intermediary financial
institutions.
Project Objectives and Scope
50.      The project's objectives are to:  improve the productivity and
increase production in existing facilities; save energy and decrease costs;
increase the domestic production of key intermediates, especially sulphuric
acid; and reduce the foreign exchange burden of imports. Toward these
objectives, the proposed project includes spare parts and engineering services
to prepare final designs for modernization and energy savings investments at
GUBRE's facilities at Iskenderun, including conversion from TSP to DAP
production, and equipment and engineering services to rationalize and provide
energy savings at: (i) AKGUBRE's plant at Mersin with an installed capacity of
1800 tpd of CAN and 450 tpd of DAP; (ii) EGE's plant at Foca wjth an installed
capacity of 430 tpd of monoammonium phosphate and 960 tpd of NP; anid (iii)
KBI's copper smelter and the related sulphuric acid plant at-Samsun supplying
sulphuric acid required for AZOT's Samsun facilities plant with an installed
capacity of 730 tpd of TSP and 710 tpd of DAP. It also includes training, and
a study of fertilizer raw material resources. Details of the project are
provided below, in the Loan and Project Summary, in Annex III and in the Staff
Appraisal Report (No. 3708-TU, dated March 15, 1982) distributed separately to
the Executive Directors.



- 16 -
51.      The project includes specifically:
(a)   GUBRE's Iskenderun Complex: Spare parts and engineering services to
prepare final designs for the following investments: (i) rationalization of
the existing sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid plants; (ii) replacement of the
existing obsolete TSP plant with a new DAP plant; (iii) provision of
facilities to save energy and reduce pollution, and to produce ammonium
sulfate (AS) as a byproduct while scrubbing sulfur dioxide gases from the
sulfuric acid plant currently vented to the atmosphere; and (iv) expansion of
storage facilities to increase operational flexibility. The replacement of
the 25-year old TSP plant would lead to the production of DAP, a product with
increasing demand in Turkey, in place of TSP which is facing declining
demand. Costs of the components financed under this project are estimated at
about $6.0 million including $4.9 million in foreign exchanges. The
investments designed under this project are estimated to cost about $68
million, including $30 million of foreign exchange and to be ready for
implementation in about two years. GUBRE, which is currently occupied with
rehabilitating its Yarimca Plant under Loan 1985-TU, intends to proceed with
the Iskenderun rehabilitation in about 1984. Meanwhile, provision of spare
parts is expected to result in increasing capacity utilization by about 20
percentage points in 1983-86.
(b)   AKGUBRE's Mersin Complex;  (i) Addition of a new 600 tpd AS unit;
(ii) rehabilitation of the existing sulfuric acid plant to improve capacity
utilization and control air pollution; (iii) rationalization of existing
phosphoric acid plant; (iv) major overhaul of existing nitric acid plant
including installation of absorbtion devices to reduce nitrogen oxide
emissions to acceptable levels; (v) modernization of CAN and DAP plants to
improve their efficiency and product quality; (vi) installation of energy
saving equipment; and (vii) improvement and expansion of unloading and storage
facilities. Capacity utilization of existing facilities is expected to
increase from 50 percent to 90 percent. In addition the project would add
180,000 tpy of AS production (recommended for the alkaline soil in the Mersin
region), save 4.8 MW of power per year and solve serious environmental
pollution problems. Costs (including working capital but excluding interest
during construction) are estimated at about $45.5 million including about
$27.8 million in foreign exchange.
(c)   EGE's Foca Plant:  (i) Improvements in the granulation plant leading
to increased capacity and improved control; (ii) mechanical modifications to
permit production of DAP or 15-45-0 fertilizer in addition to the 20-20-0 (NP)
product currently being produced; (iii) provision of 5,000 tons of bulk
storage for finished products; and (iv) improvements in energy saving and
pollution control. Capacity utilization is expected to increase from 60
percent to 90 percent. Demand for DAP and for 15-45-0 fertilizer is growing
while there is surplus capacity at present for NP. The product changes
planned under the project are designed to meet this changing market demand.
Costs are estimated at about $4.9 million including about $2.4 million foreign
exchange.
(d)   KBI's Samsun Complex;  The sulfuric acid plant is based on sulfur
dioxide from the copper smelter. As copper concentrate supply was a major
constraint, the copper smelter and the sulfuric acid plant have not been able
to operate at more than 20 - 30 percent of capacity. The Bank's loan 1998-TU
is helping KBI to finance the modernization of its copper concentrate
production facilities. Subsequent studies indicated that once the copper



17 -
concentrate supply bottleneck is eliminated, KBI's Samsun facilities would
also need de-bottlenecking. The supply of sulfuric acid from KBI is of
critical importance to increase fertilizer production at the adjacent AZOT
plant being rehabilitated under the Loan 1985-TU. The work to be carried out
includes (i) improvements in the existing copper smelter; (ii) modifications
in the sulfuric acid plant; (iii) improvements in energy saving and the
electric supply system; and (iv) relocation of the existing water pumping
station since the present site will be under water after the Cakmak Dam (see
para. 65) is constructed. Costs of this component are estimated at about
$12.5 million including about $7.1 million of foreign exchange.
(e)   Training:  Presently none of the companies financed under the project
have training facilities. Although the UNDP financed training center, near
one of AZOT's fertilizer complexes, will also be able to assist in training
staff from companies other than AZOT, there is a need for establishing
training facilities at the plants for basic on-the-job training. The proposed
project includes about $3.4 million in foreign exchange to be onlent to the
beneficiary companies for (i) equipment and training aids for training
facilities to be built at the four plants; (ii) four man-months of expert
assistance in development of training programs and organizing training in
critical areas; and (iii) specialized overseas training for selected
personnel. The training programs are to be acceptable to the Bank (GAE and
KBI Project Agreements, Section 2.08).
(f)   The Fertilizer Raw Materials Resource Study would (i) review
information on the size and quality of reserves of raw materials suitable for
fertilizer manufacture; (ii) identify any deposits suitable for development
for fertilizer production on a priority basis; (iii) analyze infrastructure
requirements to develop these deposits; and (iv) recommend additional steps
to firm up estimates of reserves and their quality. This study is expected
to provide the basis for a fertilizer industry master plan. The Government
would, by September 30, 1982, make administrative arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank for coordinating the study, and would furnish the study to the
Bank for comment by June 30, 1984 (Loan Agreement, Sections 3.03 and 3.05).
It is expected that the study would be conducted by the Mining Research and
Development Institute with coordination and supervision provided by the SPO.
Costs are estimated at $2.8 million including $1.8 million in foreign exchange.
Project Costs and Financing
52.      The total cost of the proposed project (including an average of about
25 percent price and 10 percent physical contingency on base cost, but
excluding initial working capital requirements and interest and other charges
during construction) is estimated at about $71.3 million including about
$43.4 million in foreign exchange. If working capital, interest and other
charges during construction are included, costs increase to about $86 million,
including about $55 million in foreign exchange. International escalation
rates have been used for local costs, as well as for foreign costs, on the
assumption that differences between local and international inflation will
result in corresponding exchange rate adjustments. The above estimates
include $6 million for about 460 manmonths of foreign consultant services, at
an average cost (including subsistence expenses) of about $13,000 per
man-month.



- 18 -
53.      The Government has requested that the 1.5 percent front-end fee of
about $0.7 million be financed out of the proposed Bank loan. The remaining
$43.4 million would finance the foreign exchange requirement excluding working
capital and interest during construction, or about 80 percent of the total
foreign exchange financing. The remaining foreign exchange requirements for
working capital and financial charges during construction i.e. $11.2 million,
would be met as follows: GUBRE $0.7 million; AKGUBRE $8.8 million; EGE $0.5
million; and KBI $1.2 million.  The $29.2 million equivalent required for
local costs, including financial charges during construction, and the local
component of working capital would be financed from internal cash generation
as follows:  GUBRE, $1.4 million equivalent; AKGUBRE, $19.1 million; EGE, $2.7
million; and KBI, $6.0 million. The Government would provide $1.0 million for
the study.
54.      All of the companies are capable of meeting their local currency
expenditures from internal cash generation as their current cash flow
situation is good and, under the current ex-factory pricing policy, their cash
position is expected to remain sound in the future. If the internally
generated funds should be inadequate for the local cost financing of these
subprojects and/or if the Project should experience a cost increase, the
companies would be expected to borrow and/or increase their share capital. In
addition to the assurances on fertilizer pricing (see para. 39), the
Government has also agreed to continue to permit KBI the flexibility to set
prices for its products based upon costs of production under conditions of
efficient operation, investment requirements and market conditions (Loan
Agreement, Section 4.03). Agreement was also obtained from the companies that
they would not undertake nonproject investments (over and above those included
under previously approved Bank projects) exceeding $5 million per year except
with prior Bank approval (GAE and KBI Project Agreements, Section 4.06).
Onlending Arrangements
55.      Out of the proceeds of the loan the Government would onlend about
$34.4 million for rehabilitation and training to TSKB which would relend about
$6.1 million to GUBRE, $25.3 million to AKGUBRE, and $3.0 million to EGE. Out
of this $34.4 million, TSKB is taking $12.4 million of the credit risk itself
and has obtained letters of intent from Turkish commercial banks for providing
guarantees for the remainder. The Government has agreed that in case of
default by a beneficiary company, if a commercial bank should fail to honor
its guarantee, the Government would not have recourse to TSKB for the amount
due from the commercial bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(c)). This would
limit the amount of TSKB risk to well within its exposure limit. Since TSKB
can lend only to majority private sector firms, the Government would use DYB
as the intermediary for onlending about $7.9 million to KBI. The remainder of
the loan, about $1.8 million, would be retained by the Government for the
study component.
56.      The Government's loans to the intermediaries and their loans to the
beneficiary companies would be for 12 years including four years of grace.
The Government would onlend funds to the intermediaries at the Bank's standard
interest rate. The private and joint sector companies (GUBRE, AKGUBRE, and
EGE) would have the choice between fixed interest at the Bank interest rate
plus 5.5 percent or variable interest adjusted every six months based on the
average rate on all TSKB's foreign borrowing plus 5.5 percent. Such firms
will be eligible for a 25 percent interest rebate provided by the Government
for priority private and joint sector investments. KBI (public sector) would



- 19 -
pay interest at the Bank lending rate plus 3.5 percent (TSKB and DYB Loan
Agreements, Section 2.01). These spreads are the same as used in the Bank's
last lending operation through TSKB and DYB respectively. The beneficiary
companies would bear the foreign exchange risk and the cost of the Bank's
frontend fee on their portions of the loan.
Project Execution
57.      Project implementation for each plant would be the responsibility of
the individual beneficiary companies. They have already formed project teams
with experienced and qualified staff. GUBRE, AKGUBRE, EGE and KBI have agreed
to maintain adequately staffed full-time project teams to manage the Project
during its implementation (GAE and KBI Project Agreements, Section 2.02(a)).
58.      Procurement of equipment and materials would be handled by the
project teams with the assistance of technical advisors, engineering
contractors and existing procurement organizations of the companies
concerned. KBI needs technical advisors to improve its existing operations
and deal with project implementation. Therefore, as a condition of
disbursement of its loan pottion, KBI would hire at least three experts -- one
for operations, one for maintenance, and one for project implementation.
AKGUBRE, as a condition of disbursement of its loan portion, would hire at
least one expert for project implementation (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para
5). Similar arrangements are not required for GUBRE since it has already
appointed a technical advisor (financed under Loan 1985-TU), or for EGE which
does not require technical assistance for operation or implementation.
Procurement and Disbursement
59.      All mach{-'r-y and equipmlent to be financed under the loan would be
procured under international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
guidelines except for (i) proprietary items procured on a negotiated basis,
and time- or process-critical equipment and spares, procured under limited
international tendering, up to a total of $10 million; and (ii) small items
costing $150,000 or less, totalling about $2 million, which would also be
procured under limited international tendering. All such items would be
procured on the basis of a list of goods satisfactory to the Bank (GAE and KBI
Project Agreements,. Schedule). For goods procured through ICB, domestic
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent or the
actual customs duty, whichever is lower. The qualifications, experience,
terms and conditions of employment and selection of consultants would be
satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts for civil works and erection services
would be awarded under procedures satisfactory to the Bank, including
prequalification (GAE and KBI Project Agreements, Section 2.03(b)). Because
of the urgency of commencing rehabilitation, retroactive financing is proposed
for up to $2 million for engineering studies and downpayments to engineering
firms and equipment suppliers for contracts awarded in accordance with Bank
guidelines entered into after August 1, 1981 (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1,
para. 4).
60.      The Bank loan would be disbursed as follows:  100 percent of the
foreign expenditure for imported equipment and spare parts, foreign
consultants and training; 100 percent of local currency ex-factory costs of
contracts for equipment, materials or spares won by local suppliers under
international competitive bidding; and 57 percent of the cost of consultants
services for the rehabilitation component and 70 percent for the study
component in case any of these contracts should be awarded to local firms.

Project Operations
61.      The three joint and private sector firms to be assisted under the
proposed project are reasonably well managed and no special measures are
required in this regard, except for improvements in accounting and financial
planning (see para 64). KBI faces many of the problems which affect the
efficiency of SEEs in general. Some of the issues of overall SEE reform are
being addressed under our structural adjustment lending.  In addition, KBI has
agreed, under the terms of its agreement with DYB for the financing provided
under Loan 1998-TU, to implement various measures to deal with these
problems. Consultants are being financed under that loan to assist KBI in (i)
developing and implementing staff training programs; (ii) preparing and
implementing systems of cost accounting and budgetary control, including
systems for setting standard costs and monitorable objectives; (iii) designing
staff incentive systems; and (iv) improving production control, safety and
preventive maintenance systems. KBI has also agreed to (i) upgrade its salary
structure and selection and promotion policies so as to be able to hire and
retain qualified and experienced staff; (ii) curtail the hiring of new staff
except for engineers, technologists and financial experts, and develop plans
for rationalizing its staffing patterns; and (iii) delegate adequate authority
for day-to-day operations to their General Directors and plant managers.
These provisions have also been incorporated by reference as conditions for
this project (KBI Project Agreement, Section 3.02).
62.      The current ratio of three out of the four companies is over 1.3:1
and the debt/equity ratio of all four companies is within the 60/40 level.
Under the current high inflation and high real interest situation in Turkey,
the companies are holding inventories and receivables to minimum levels, and
the present current ratio of 1.2:1 for GUBRE is acceptable. GUBRE would be
obligated to maintain at least a 1.1:1 current ratio until December 31, 1986
(when the Yarimca rationalization subproject under Loan 1985-TU is expected to
be completed) and thereafter, to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.3;1.
However, GUBRE would not be permitted to declare dividends, without the Bank's
consent, if after such payments the current ratio would fall below 1.4:1 (GAE
Project Agreement, Section 4.08). The other companies would be required to
maintain a current ratio of at least 1.3:1 at all times. Further, the
companies have agreed (i) to maintain a debt/equity ratio of not less than
60/40; (ii) not to incur additional debt if, by so doing, the projected debt
service coverage would fall below 1.5 times; and (iii) to periodically revalue
their assets for memorandum account on the basis of replacement cost and in
accordance with sound accounting principles (GAE and KBI Project Agreements,
Sections 4.04, 4.05, and 4.07).
63.      GUBRE, AKGUBRE, EGE and KBI would submit annual reports examined by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank within four months of the end of
the accounting year. The companies would also submit quarterly financial
statements within 45 days after the end of each quarter.
64.      KBI employs modern financial planning, accounting, management
information and cost control systems. Its financial statements are audited by
three external auditors selected by the shareholders. Its audited statements
are reviewed by the High Control Board of the Prime Minister's Office. In the
case of AKGUBRE and EGE also, sound accounting and financial management
systems are used, and accounts are audited satisfactorily by external auditors
selected by shareholders. In the case of GUBRE, there is scope for improving
its accounting and financial management systems as they are still based on a



- 21 -
single-plant, single-product operation basis. GUBRE has employed a local
consultant to review the systems and recommend a plan of action for
improvement. GUBRE has indicated that it would implement a program to improve
its financial management systems, in consultation with the Bank, before
June 30, 1983. Further, all four beneficiary companies need training in
long-term financial planning. This will be carried out under the training
component of the Project.
65.      The water supply systems at Iskenderun, Mersin and Foca are adequate
to meet the requirements of those plants after rehabilitation. Water supply
is, however, a problem at Samsun especially during the summer months.
Therefore, KBI is participating in financing an earthen dam on the Abdal River
being implemented by DSI (Turkish Water Works) to meet the water supply needs
of the city of Samsun. This dam, which is expected to cost TL3 billion ($25
million equivalent), mostly in local currency, is scheduled to be completed in
1985/86. The dam will also supply water to nearby AZOT fertilizer complex,
for which rationalization is being financed under Loan 1985-TU. Until the dam
is fully completed, DSI is planning to supply water from the coffer dam
reservoir to meet the water supply needs of KBI and AZOT. DSI in cooperation
with KBI and AZOT, has prepared a detailed plan for meeting the water
requirements of the plants. This plan was reviewed during negotiations and
agreement was reached with the Government that water supply arrangements will
be carried out in accordance with an agreed schedule (Loan Agreement, Section
3.06).
66.      Except for KBI, the plants included under the Project depend heavily
on imported raw materials. In the past, inadequate foreign exchange
availability for materials and spares was an important constraint leading to
reduced capacity utilization. This situation has improved recently, in part
due to financing provided under the Bank's Structural Adjustment Loans. The
Government has agreed that adequate foreign exchange will be made available to
the beneficiary companies to enable them to import the raw materials and spare
parts required to operate their plants at capacity (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01(b)). In addition the Government has agreed to install two cranes for the
ammonia terminal at Mersin by June 30, 1983 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02) to
eliminate a bottleneck at the port affecting supply of imported inputs to the
AKGUBRE plant.
67.      The project includes components designed to make significant
reductions in pollution at the plant sites. The companies have agreed (GAE
and KBI Project Agreements, Section 3.01(f)) to operate the facilities
assisted by the Project with adequate attention to pollution control.
Economic and Financial Analysis
68.      In evaluating the impact of the Project, only the increase in
production over and above what could be achieved by ensuring adequate raw
material supply to those plants is attributed to the Project. Following
project completion, capacity utilization rates are expected to reach 85 to
90 percent. With adequate provision for revamping, training and technical
assistance, the attainment of the above capacity utilization levels is
considered realistic.
69.      Total incremental sales from the Project are estimated at $285
million in 1986, rising to $327 million in 1988 when most of the plants would
have reached the optimum capacity level. The project is expected to generate



- 22 -
a net profit of $46 million in the first year after rationalization/
modernization in 1986; this profit is expected to reach $52 million by 1988 as
production builds up and operating costs are reduced due to increased
operational efficiency and energy saving. The Project is expected to generate
from the first year of operations sufficient cash to more than meet its debt
service requirements. Estimated financial rates of return before taxes vary
from 23 percent for GUBRE to 76 percent for KBI and average 61 percent for the
project as a whole (34 percent after taxes). Sensitivity tests indicate that
even with a one-year delay in project implementation, a 10 percent capital
cost increase and 10 percent lower capacity utilization than assumed, the
average financial return would still be nearly 47 percent.
70.      The facilities benefiting from Project investment account for about
20 percent of fertilizer nutrient capacity in Turkey. The economic benefits
from the Project come from: (i) increased productivity reducing production
costs; (ii) energy savings and increased power production; (iii) the increase
in production volume (over and above that attributable to adequate foreign
exchange availablity); (iv) prolongation of the economic life of the plants
through necessary replacement investments; and (v) addition of new fertilizer
units to maximize utilization of existing upstream facilities. The
subprojects show economic rates of return ranging from 66 percent for KBI to
20 percent for GUBRE and averaging 49 percent. This reflects the high
economic return possible from rationalization of existing capacity. Even with
a one-year delay in implementation, a 10 percent capital cost increase and a
10 percent decrease in capacity utilization, the economic return would still
be 38 percent.
71.      In 1989, when full increases in production resulting from the Project
are expected to be achieved, average costs per ton of DAP and CAN would be
reduced by 10 percent and energy savings and additional energy production are
estimated at $5 million per year. The annual domestic production of
fertilizers, blister copper, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid
would increase by 630,000 tons, 10,000 tons, 240,000 tons, 180,000 tons, and
25,000 tons, respectively, and would save an estimated gross import cost (CIF
Turkish ports) of $208 million in 1980 prices. Net of foreign debt service
and direct material imports, the Project would still generate foreign exchange
savings of $80 million in 1989. After Project completion in 1986, the
foreign exchange cost of the Project would be more than covered by the
estimated net foreign exchange savings from the Project each year. While the
benefits of the fertilizer raw materials study can not be quantified, it is
expected to lead to identification of future possibilities of significant
savings through reduction in imports, energy savings and improved efficiency
of operations.
Risks
72.      Technical risks are moderate, as the project deals with existing
plants and commercially proven technology. The main risks are delays in
implementation. These have been mitigated by providing, where necessary,
expatriate specialists to strengthen the operational staff and by the
involvement of experienced engineering firms. No commercial risk is
foreseen. Even on the basis of conservative market forecasts, the country
will continue to be deficient in fertilizer production after the Project is
completed. The risk of inadequate internally generated funds to provide the
beneficiary companies' share of Project costs has been mitigated by the
pricing formula linking ex-factory prices to international prices (para. 39)

and by the arrangements for financing the fertilizer subsidy from the Price
Stabilization Fund (parta. 38) which have eliminated delays in payment to
fertilizer producers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
73.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank,
the draft agreements with the two intermediaries (TSKB and DYB), the draft
Project Agreements with the four beneficiary companies and the report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
special features of the Loan and Project Agreements are referred to in the
text and listed in Section III of Annex III.
74.      Special conditions of loan effectiveness include execution of:
(i) satisfactory subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and the two
intermediaries; (ii) satisfactory finance agreements between the two
intermediaries and the respective beneficiary companies; and
(iii) satisfactory agreements for the commercial bank guarantees (Loan
Agreement, Section 6.01). Special conditions of disbursement are: (a) for
the KBI component, the employment of three experts; and (b) for the AKGUBRE
component, the employment of a project implementation expert (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1, Para. 5).
75.      I am satisfied the proposed loan will comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
76.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Recent Economic Developments and Policy Changes
1.        Against a background of deepening economic crisis, the authorities
announced a policy framework in January 1980 to initiate a major shift
over the medium-term in the orientation of economic policy from detailed
regulation of the economy towards greater reliance on the market
mechanism. Overall, progress in the program to date has been encouraging.
(a) During the second half of 1980, there was a marked decel-
eration in the rate of inflation from a peak of 120 percent in March 1980
to 80 percent by December 1980, and less than 35 percent by October 1981.
While this deceleration did not proceed evenly, the overall trend is
unmistakable, and is due to a combination of factors. First, the effect of
the major upward adjustment of SEE prices in February 1980 and the large
depreciation of the lira in January 1980 which contributed to the initial
upsurge in the rate of inflation has largely passed. Second, a tight
monetary policy was maintained, together with a marked increase in interest
rates to positive real levels on deposits which arrested the flight into
goods. Third, with some easing of external financial constraint, there was
a marked improvement in the availability of fuels and other key inputs;
(b) From September 1980, once work stoppages were terminated by
the military government and the supply of imported inputs was eased,
economic activity rebounded somewhat from the severely depressed levels
earlier in the year;
(c) With domestic demand still weak, much of this increased pro-
duction was channelled into exports, which improved markedly; during the
first eight months of 1980 the year-on-year rate of growth was only 6
percent, while for the rest of the year the rate increased dramatically to
60 percent. This reflected a major expansion in industrial and mining
exports. These trends have continued over the whole of 1981; as a result,
export earnings are likely to exceed $4.5 billion in 1981, i.e. a growth of
about 60 percent over 1980. The direction of export trade has been
generally shifting away from the industrial countries of Western Europe and
towards Middle Eastern and East European countries, partly reflecting the
sluggish growth in many of the industrialized countries, and also Turkey's
interest and success in developing new export markets within its region.
Their share in total exports rose from 14 percent in 1978 to 44 percent
during the first ten months of 1981. The war-affected economies of Iran
and Iraq were a factor influencing these developments; export receipts from
these countries over the first eight months of 1981 were nearly four times
the level of the same period of 1980. Iraq is now second only to Germany
in Turkey's export trade. Exports have responded to the exchange rate
depreciation and the strengthening of the export incentives which have been

ANNEX I-B
Page 2 of 4
further improved during the first half of 1981 through better preferential
credit facilities, increased tax rebates for industrial exports, and the
instituting of a system whereby exporters may deduct 20 percent of their
foreign exchange receipts from taxable income.
(d) Workers' remittances also picked up sharply between
July-December 1980 in response to the interest rate adjustment and the
flexible exchange rate. They have remained strong in the first half of
1981, prompted by further increases in interest rates and a new savings
scheme for workers abroad which allows them to deposit their foreign
currency in Turkish banks, and redeem in Turkish lira on maturity at the
prevalent rate of exchange (they are not redeemable in foreign currency).
In addition a new and rapidly growing source of foreign exchange is income
earned from overseas contracting activities, mostly in the Middle East. By
August 1981, contracts outstanding totalled nearly $7 billion, of which $5
billion were in Libya.
2.       Serious imbalances, however, persist on the external account.
While total current receipts have grown considerably over the last 12
months, the same is true on the payments side. Substantial external assis-
tance permitted an increase in import volume of around 12 percent in 1980
(compared to export volume growth of around 9 percent), and import growth
has continued to be strong in the first half of 1981. Import volume,
however, had declined sharply in 1978-79, and, as a proportion of GDP,
remains well below the average for the years 1974-77. The terms of trade
have deteriorated for the fourth consecutive year, with import prices in
1980 rising more sharply than in any year since 1974, due mainly to the
increase in oil prices. As a result, the current account deficit rose to
$3.2 billion in 1980, (about 5.5 percent of GNP, compared to about 2.5
percent in 1979) and is expected to be about $2.5 billion in 1981 (4.2
percent of GNP).
3.       The problems connected with external indebtedness continue to
constrain rapid recovery. As of end-1980, the total external debt was
estimated to have increased by around 11 percent to $18.2 billion, inclu-
sive of IMF debt, reflecting substantially increased disbursements by the
OECD member countries, Saudi Arabia, IMF and World Bank. The maturity
structure has improved over previous years, partly on account of three
rescheduling arrangements with OECD member countries and two rescheduling
arrangements with commercial banks. Consequently, the share of M&LT debt
in the total has grown from 48 percent in 1978 to 79 percent in 1980.
Moreover, commercial arrears have declined $722 million since December
1980. While the term structure of the total external debt has improved,
debt service payments have grown rapidly on account of new borrowings to



- 31 -
ANNEX I-B
Page 3 of 4
finance the expanded current account deficit in 1980, the inordinately high
interest rates on rescheduled commercial debt (close to 20 percent because
of the surge in LIBOR rates), and higher interest rates even on the debt
rescheduled with OECD countries than when the debt was originally
contracted. Equally worrisome is the possibility that net capital inflows
from M&LT sources might decline markedly over the next few years. This is
due to the substantially higher debt amortization payments to be made over
the period 1984-89 when the debt relief afforded by the rescheduling
arrangements falls due, as well as to expected reductions in official debt
relief, in new commitments and disbursements of OECD and in credits from
banks.
4.       Domestic savings have for years lagged behind investment needs.
In 1980, the investment rate was 23 percent of GDP while the savings rate
was about 16 percent of GDP; the latter represented a decline of about 3
percent since 1978. Public savings have declined particularly sharply,
from 8 percent of GDP to-4 percent of GDP over these years. The
Govermnent's response 1981 has been to implement a major tax reform, grant
greater pricing autonomy to the SEEs, restrict public investment, and
improve private savings through increased interest rates and a regulated
capital market. -The need for a major tax reform had become critical.
During the years of rapid inflation in 1978-80, the elasticity of the tax
system with respect to GNP declined from around 1.2 to 0.8-0O9, and the
ratio of tax revenue to GNP declined from 19 percent in 1978 to 16 percent
by 1980. There had also been a marked shift in tax structure due to the
failure to adjust the tax system to inflation. The distribution of the tax
burden had become highly skewed and inequitable, the incentives were
distorted, and tax administration had become even weaker. A major tax
reform package was passed in late 1980/early 1981 with the objectives of;
(a) increasing the yield and future buoyancy of the system; (b) making the
tax structure more equitable; and (c) improving the efficiency of
collection. The package is now being implemented, but it is too early to
evaluate the results; the main impact of the new taxes, especially those on
non-wage earners and the agricultural sales tax, will only be seen later in
the year, and progress in their implementation is being monitored under
SAL II. Initial indications are that the tax reform is generating more
revenue than originally expected.
5.       Following the deregulation of commercial bank interest rates in
July 1980, and particularly after the breakdown of the "gentlemen's
agreement" between the banks at the beginning of this year, interest rates
have increased sharply and are now positive in real terms. There has been
a sharp rebound in bank deposits, particularly in time deposits (including
the new certificates of deposit). Between July 80 and June 81, total
deposits increased by 97 percent and time deposits (including certificates
of deposit) grew by an astonishing 265 percent. The deregulation of
interest rates has been further extended by the freeing of private bond
rates in July 1981. Private companies are now free to set their bond rates
in competition with the banks and can use flexible rates if they so chose.
In addition, the Government announced an increase in three-month Government
bonds' interest rate to 34 percent, comparable in after tax yield to bank

deposit rates. In response to the recent emergence of "brokers" offering
monthly interest rates of 10 percent, which threatenes to destabilize the
financial system, the Government issued a decree requiring all dealers to
register with the Finance Ministry and obtain Central Bank approval of
their advertising.
6.       The long-awaited law setting up a regulatory framework for the
capital market was passed in July 1981. This law among other things:
(a) regulates the public offering and sale of financial assets; (b) sets up
an independent Capital Market Board with seven members selected by the
Council of Ministers, with one seat nominated by the bankers association
and the rest nominated by the Government; (c) regulates non-issuing
secondary institutions and provides for investment funds and companies; and
(d) provides that the companies and intermediaries coming under the law are
subject to audit by the Board's auditors. The Board is expected to be
functioning within six months, and all institutions must conform to the
requirements of the law within 12 months.
SEEs
7.       To improve overall SEE financial performance, the Government began
in 1980 by freeing most SEE prices and by initiating steps to begin to
expose SEEs to market forces. This was followed in 1981 with additional
steps aimed at furthering their market exposure and improving their opera-
tional efficiency, culminating in a far-reaching reform package which has
been finalized as a draft law to be submitted to the "Parliament". The
initial steps taken were; all SEEs (except two agriculture service SEEs)
were cut off from the Central Bank, and a larger portion of budgetary funds
was channelled through DYB. These steps, particularly the freeing of
prices, have had some effect. SEE losses declined substantially, from
TL 72 billion in 1979 to TL 23 billion in 1980, and are projected by
Government to be further reduced to about TL 5 billion in 1981. However,
in terms of its impact on Government finances, this was more than offset by
the increase in SEE investment expenditures from TL 172 billion in 1979 to
TL 476 billion in 1980. As a result, budgetary transfers to the SEEs as a
proportion of total Government expenditure rose to around 20 percent in
FY80 as against 15 percent in FY79. IMF limits for 1981 on public sector
borrowing from the Central Bank and budgetary transfers to SEEs are
designed to reduce this drain in real terms. While the granting of pricing
autonomy to SEEs was a necessary adjustment, there was little improvement
in SEE operating efficiency, so that in many cases users of SEE products
and services were paying prices set at levels high enough to cover SEE
inefficiencies. In addition, there was a sharp build-up in commercial
arrears and tax and social security arrears, amounting to TL 209 billion,
in 1980, or 44 percent of total investment (compared to 10 percent in 1979).

C.  STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 1981 1/
Ln. No. 844, Istanbul Water Supply Project: IJS$37 million loan of June 30,
1972. Effective Date: January 4, 1973. Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
After initial delays, construction moved swiftly in 1977 and the two
major water resources development programs were completed in early 1979.
Substantial improvements to the distribution system were subsequently
completed, and tariff increases implemented. As of September 30, 1981, an
amount of $7.9 million was held in the loan account pending settlement of
final payments. Of this, $4.9 million have since been disbursed and
withdrawal claims for the balance are being processed.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360, Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44 million
loan and US030 million credit of March 22, 1973. Effective Date: March 20,
1974.  Closing Date:  December 31,1983.
Following delays due to difficult rock conditions and inappropriate
tunnelling methods, two diversion tunnels have been completed, about two years
behind appraisal estimate. The main dam construction is progressing
satisfactorily, with 70 percent of the works completed and the spillway ready
for evacuating the floods in the 1981/82 season. The installation of the
power plant has been started. The construction of the irrigation system is
progressing, with the system now supplying water for about 30,000 ha, one
third of the target. On-farm works are progressing steadily, with about 60
percent completed. Tile drainage is expected to be completed in 1983.
Staffing of the extension service is satisfactory, except as regards consul-
tants; the Government is taking steps to hire the latter. The project is
expected to be completed by end-1983.
Ln. No. 957 Antalya/Akdeniz Forest Utilization Project; US$40 million loan of
January 28, 1974. Effective Date; May 26, 1976. Closing Date; June 30,
1982.
Construction is substantially completed. The saw mill will be ready
for operation in October 1981, and the pulp and paper plant in May/June 1982.
Ln. No. 1023 Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project; US$148 million loan of
June 28, 1974. Effective Date: June 1, 1976. Closing Date: July 30, 1982.
Project implementation had been delayed by critical problems,
including insufficient staff, inefficient management, inadequate coordination
among various agencies and unsatisfactory performance of civil contractors.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Following continuous Bank and co-lender reviews of the situation with the
Turkish authorities from early 1977, the remedial measures initiated by the
Government resulted in some improvement of project execution, until mid-1979.
However, continuing and serious shortage of local funds then affected project
progress, which has been aggravated by staff and management deficiencies. The
Government's timely provision of adequate local funds for this high priority
project from the Structural Adjustment Loan counterpart funds has helped
resume momentum. The colenders and the Government agreed in November 1980 on
a detailed program of action to overcome remaining implementation problems;
this program is now being implemented. Further measures to strengthen project
implementation and to meet remaining foreign exchange needs are being
considered by the colenders and the Government.
Ln. No. 1130 Corum-Cankiri Rural Development; US$75 million loan of June 23,
1975. Effective Date; January 22, 1976. Closing Date; June 30, 1984.
The project is in general progressing satisfactorily although because
of disruptions in construction, the irrigation works will be completed only by
end-1983. The Corum dam has been completed as also the works to divert
run-off from 5 nearby watersheds. The Kumbaba pumping station is ready, and
irrigation has started. The Alaca dam, delayed because of extra excavation
required due to bad rock,  is expected to be completed by end-1982.  Damage to
the Alaca diversion tunnel, because of rock slides, has been repaired and the
tunnel lining is completed. Contracts for the irrigation system of the
Guldercek area have been awarded and work is in progress. The project
extension service is operating successfully and its impact on agriculture is
promising. Village roads, water systems, small irrigation facilities and
electricity works will be completed by end-1982. The project is expected to
be substantially completed by end-1983.
Ln. No. 1194 Second TEK Power Transmission Project: US$56 million loan of
June 14, 1976. Effective Date; April, 21, 1978. Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
Procurement action is complete, somewhat behind schedule, and almost
the entire loan is committed, but deliveries of some equipment are delayed.
The loan is expected to be closed shortly.
Ln. No. 1248 Agricultural Credit and Agroindustries; US$54.3 million loan of
May 5, 1976. Effective Date: May 11, 1977. Closing Date: June 20, 1984.
The ferryship component has been implemented, and the two roll-on and
roll-off ships purchased under this project and the First Fruit and Vegetable
Export project are now operating a regularly scheduled service between ports
in Turkey and two ports in Italy. The implementation of the agro-industries
component is delayed, mainly due to investors' reluctance to assume the
foreign exchange risk. The Government is reviewing possible measures to
overcome this problem. The Agricultural Bank (TCZB) has introduced improved
lending procedures for its ongoing supervised credit program, and this

component is being implemented satisfactorily. After considerable delay, the
consultants have completed the study of TCZB's structure and procedures. At
the Borrower's request, a cattle-fattening component of the Project, and
US$7.7 million of the original loan amount of $63 million allocated for this
purpose, were cancelled on May 5, 1977. Also, as provided for in the Loan
Agreement, $1.04 million for training was cancelled on December 22, 1977,
following approval of UNDP funds for this purpose.
Ln. No. 1258 Balikesir Newsprint;  US$70 million loan of May 21, 1976.
Effective Date: October 15, 1976. Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The project is nearing physical completion. The sawmill and
newsprint plant have begun operations although wood supply and marketing
problems for sawn wood need to be resolved.
Ln. No. 1265 Livestock III; US$21.5 million loan of May 26, 1976. Effective
Date; February 25, 1977. Closing Date; March 31, 1982.
After a slower than anticipated start-up, project implementation
improved but has been affected by deterioration in financial situation and
cash flow problems of farmers, causing some withdrawals from the project.
This has adversely affected the preparation of farm development plans. Though
project area offices have been established, they are not fully staffed. The
Government has taken some measures, and is reviewing others, to correct the
situation. A higher than expected proportion of sub-loans has been made to
small farmers. An extension of the Closing Date is being considered.
Ln. No. 1310 South Antalya Tourism Infrastructure; US$26 million loan of
July 9, 1976. Effective Date; March 1, 1978. Closing Date; December 31,
1982.
Implementation of most project components is underway, with progress
being made in preparation of specifications and project design work, although
the pace of overall project implementation is somewhat slower than expected
due to staffing constraints and difficulties in ensuring adequate
inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination. However, measures to
strengthen the Project Unit and its consultants, the Tourism Bank, are being
taken.
Ln. No. 1379 DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey); US$70 million loan of
March 23, 1977. Effective Date: July 21, 1977. Closing Date; March 31,
1982.
The loan has been substantially committed. DYB still has severe
staff constraints, which it has in part overcome by recruitment of additional
junior staff. Actions already initiated to recruit senior staff on improved
contract terms are expected to overcome staffing constraints by mid-1982.

million loan of June 3, 1977. Effective Date: August 29, 1977. Closing
Date: December 31, 1981.
Progress is satisfactory and the loan has been fully committed. TSKB
has essentially reached its agreed targets for allocation of its resources to
projects in less developed regions and export-oriented industries. It has so
far been unable to raise resources as expected in international capital
markets because of Turkey's economic difficulties, but the interest of several
financing sources is anticipated once conditions permit renewed efforts. The
loan is expected to be closed shortly.

underway, as also action for meeting staffing requirements agreed upon with
the Bank. Project farms are experiencing cash flow problems, inducing
withdrawal of many potential beneficiaries and resulting in lower demand for
sub-loans. The Government is considering measures to improve efficiency of
milk production and to develop an effective cadre of trained field staff.

system and the hot rolled shear line has been completed.  Product selling

existing facilities has been severely restricted from time to time because of
the lack of raw materials due to the limited availability of foreign exchange.

Date: January 22, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
