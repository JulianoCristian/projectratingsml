project objectives are: (a) to\n            improve public expenditure planning in the highway sector by\n            assisting the Government to develop appropriate road\n            maintenance and construction programs; (b) to strengthen\n            donor coordination in the sector with a view to channeling\n            external aid towards higher priority needs; (c) to improve\n            road maintenance and construction planning by the Ministry\n            of Public Works Road Branch (RB); (d) to strengthen RB for\n            increased operational effectiveness; and (e) through\n            effective road maintenance, to reduce road transport system\n            costs to the economy. The project, which is a part of the\n            Government's 4-year (1986-89) road maintenance and\n            reconstruction program, would include selected maintenance\n            and reconstruction works and institution-building during the\n            program period. It would provide for: (a) road maintenance\n            works by force account over a 4,060 km network; (b)\n            reconstruction of the Kigali-Gatuna road; (c) improvement of\n            the Government's soils laboratory; (d) staff training;\n            and (e) consulting services for development of better\n            techniques for maintenance of communal roads, and for\n            transport planning."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
