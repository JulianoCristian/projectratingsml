          11,400 ha in four subprojects along the Rompin, Pontin, Anak\n            Endau and Endau rivers in southeastern Pahang State on the\n            east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and for housing and social\n            facilities for about 4,750 settler families. The project\n            will focus on the smallholder rice farmers, who experience a\n            high incidence of poverty in Malaysia. It addresses the two\n            main factors responsible for their poverty, the small size\n            of holdings and the low productivity of rice land. All of\n            the direct benefits from the project will accrue to the\n            settler families, about 24,000 people, whose present income\n            is about US$125 per capita, well below the 1981 absolute\n            poverty level income of US$320 per capita. At full project\n            development in 1992 the per capita income of project\n            beneficiaries is expected to be about US$700 or slightly\n            less than the estimated US$790 critical consumption level in\n            that year."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
