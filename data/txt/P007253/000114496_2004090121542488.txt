                  (Third Technical Assistance Project)
                  Amendment
Dear Minister Greenidge,
      Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Third
Technical Assistance Project) between Guyana (the Borrower) and the
International Development Association (the Association), dated July
13, 1990 (the Credit Agreement).
      As a result of a meeting held in Washington on June 5, 1992
between yourself, Ms. Jul (IMF), Mr. Martin del Campo and Ms.
Mascarell (IBRD), it was agreed in principle to finance two new
activities under the Third Technical Assistance Project, the
extension of the contract of the current Advisor on Banking
Supervision with the Bank of Guyana, and the establishment of a
personnel record system as part of the start up activities under the
proposed Public Administration Project.  For this purpose we propose
the following amendment of the Credit Agreement:
      (a)   paragraph (d) of Section 1.02 of the Credit Agreement is
      hereby amended by adding thereto the acronym, "DPSM" before
      the word "and";
      (b)   a new paragraph (o) is hereby added to said Section 1.02
      to read "DPSM" means the Division of Public Service Management
      of the office of the President;"
      (c)   Schedule 2 to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
      adding thereto two new Parts F and G to read as follows:
      "Part F:    Strengthening Bank Supervision Capacity
            Strengthening and modernizing the regulatory and
      supervisory framework for commercial banks and other financial
      institutions in Guyana.
      Part G:     Improving Public Sector Management
            Development of a computer based personnel records system
      that will provide rapid access to information on individual
      staff at each of the Borrower's ministries and other relevant
      agencies and aggregate information on staff for overall
      personnel management purposes."
      (d)   Annex to Schedule 2 to the Credit Agreement is hereby
      amended by adding the following to the two columns thereof:
            "Part F                 Bank of Guyana
             Part G           DPSM"
      Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by
signing and dating the enclosed confirmation form in the enclosed
copy of this letter and returning it to us.
