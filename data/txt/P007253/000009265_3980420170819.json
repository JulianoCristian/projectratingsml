Technical Assistance Project in Guyana.\n            The project was intended to assist in strengthening the\n            public sector agencies responsible for implementing the\n            adjustment program by financing expert advice, staff\n            training and equipment to improve management and analytic\n            capacity and strengthen the borrower's capacity to\n            analyze the social costs of adjustment and the efficiency of\n            social sector programs. The overall International\n            Development Association (IDA) performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned were as follows: (a) most pressing sustainability\n            issue in Guyana, as in many countries, is attracting and\n            retaining qualified counterparts given the very low public\n            salaries; (b) between public sector salaries and consultant\n            fees Guyana has one of the weakest institutional structures\n            in the western hemisphere; (c) different approaches to\n            Technical Assistance(TA), therefore, may need to be taken;\n            and (d) what matters most for TA to be successful is the\n            combination of institutional environment factors and\n            qualities of TA personnel ."}, "docdt": "1996-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
