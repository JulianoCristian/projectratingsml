the environmental screening, and review of\n            enterprises applying for YECA facilitation. It was developed\n            in order to ensure that no working capital loans/guarantees,\n            contract bonds, or credit insurance would be available to\n            support environmentally harmful activities. The manual\n            follows current Yugoslav (Serbia, and Montenegro)\n            environmental procedures, and provides an in-depth review of\n            the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework on\n            environmental policy in the country, as well as the Bank\n            policy on environmental assessment. Categories of\n            environmental impacts are described, to help identify, and\n            assess potential environmental adversity of planned\n            subprojects, followed by measures to prevent, or minimize\n            negative potential impacts. The following activities shall\n            not be approved for financing by the project: production of\n            tobacco products; production of lead paints; sale of live\n            nature, and life nature products - banned by CITES\n            Convention (Washington, 1973) on trading wild fauna and\n            flora species, either endangered or extinct; introduction of\n            genetically mutated organisms; production of illegal\n            pesticides; fishing nets; activities related with\n            radioactive materials, chlorofluorocarbons, or ozone\n            depleting substances banned by the Montreal Protocol (1987);\n            electric products containing polychlorinated biphenyls\n            (PCBs); and, products containing asbestos.
