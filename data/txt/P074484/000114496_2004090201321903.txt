Re: 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: Japanese Grant Letter Agreement 
for Export Finance Facilitation Project Grant Number TF026818      
Dear Mr. Labus:
We refer to the above-mentioned Japanese Grant Letter Agreement between the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia and the International Development Association (IDA), in the amount of $328,380, signed 
by Neil Simon Gray on behalf of IDA on October 22, 2001, and countersigned by you on November 1, 
2001.
We would like to inform you that a small technical error was made in the signed Letter 
Agreement. In order to correct our mutual records, please note that the estimated cost in subparagraph (a) 
of Section 1 of the Annex to the Letter Agreement should read “$122,605” and not $114,505 as 
previously stated therein. 
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.  Please feel free to contact me if 
you have any questions.
Sincerely yours,
Lloyd Edgecombe
Senior Financial Specialist
Private/Financial Sector Development Unit
Europe and Central Asia Region
