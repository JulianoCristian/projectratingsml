Some lessons learned\n            included: commitment to macroeconomic stability and\n            structural reform is crucial to improve the business\n            environment and institution building. It also helps reduce\n            political risks. The project benefited from significant\n            improvements in the enabling environment. As a result of a\n            more stable macroeconomic situation and strong\n            Governments' commitment for structural reforms,\n            perception of political risk abated during the project\n            implementation period. Consequently, there was no demand for\n            the facility supported by this component, and the funds\n            could be reallocated to other components in demand.\n            Commitment to macroeconomic stability and structural reform\n            is crucial to improve the business environment and\n            institution building.
