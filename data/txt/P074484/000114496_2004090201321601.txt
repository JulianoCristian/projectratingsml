outstanding special commitments entered into by the Administrator pursuant to Section 5.02 of 
the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of US dollars 1,400,000. 
 
2. 
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures 
in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule. 
 
3. 
After the Administrator has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to 
replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows: 
 
(a) 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, SMECA, on behalf of the 
Recipient, shall furnish to the Administrator a request or requests for deposit into the Special 
Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized 
Allocation.  On the basis of such request or requests, the Administrator shall, on behalf of the 
Recipient, withdraw from the Italian Grant Account and deposit into the Special Account such 
amount or amounts as SMECA shall have requested. 
 
(b) 
(i) 
For replenishment of the Special Account, SMECA, on behalf of the 
Recipient, shall furnish to the Administrator requests for deposits into the 
Special Account at such intervals as the Administrator shall specify. 
 
(ii) 
Prior to or at the time of each such request, SMECA, on behalf of the 
Recipient, shall furnish to the Administrator the documents and other 
evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the 
payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On 
the basis of each such request, the Administrator shall, on behalf of the 
Recipient, withdraw from the Italian Grant Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as SMECA, on behalf of the Recipient, 
shall  have   requested  and  as  shall have been shown by said documents 
Page  12
-
11
-
and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the 
Administrator from the Italian Grant Account under the respective 
eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said documents and other evidence. 
 
4. 
For each payment made by SMECA, on behalf of the Recipient, out of the Special 
Account, SMECA, on behalf of the Recipient shall, at such time as the Administrator shall 
reasonably request, furnish to the Administrator such documents and other evidence showing that 
such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures. 
 
5. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Administrator shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account: 
 
(a) 
if, at any time, the Administrator shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Recipient directly from the Italian Grant Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of 
Section 2.02 of this Agreement; 
 
(b) 
if SMECA, on behalf of the Recipient, shall have failed to furnish to the 
Administrator, within the period of time specified in Section 5.01 (b) (ii) of the IDA Credit 
Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the Administrator pursuant to said 
Section and to Section 3.01 of this Agreement in respect of the audit of the records and accounts 
for the Special Account; 
 
(c) 
if, at any time, the Administrator shall have notified SMECA and the Recipient 
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Recipient to make withdrawals from 
the Italian Grant Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 
 
(d) 
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Italian Grant allocated to the eligible 
Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Administrator pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall 
equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.   
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Italian Grant Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Italian Grant allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the 
Administrator shall specify by notice to SMECA for and on behalf of the Recipient.  Such further 
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Administrator shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such 
notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures. 
 
6. 
(a) 
If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Administrator, SMECA, on behalf of the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Administrator: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Administrator may request; or (B) 
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Administrator shall so request, refund to the 
Administrator) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so 
Page  13
-
12
-
eligible or justified.  Unless the Administrator shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the 
Administrator into the Special Account shall be made until SMECA, on behalf of the Recipient, 
has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 
 
(b) 
If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Recipient or SMECA, on behalf of the Recipient, shall, promptly upon notice 
from the Administrator, refund to the Administrator such outstanding amount. 
 
(c) 
The Recipient or SMECA, on behalf of the Recipient, may, upon notice to the 
Administrator, refund to the Administrator all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the 
Special Account. 
 
(d) 
Refunds to the Administrator made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Italian Grant Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General 
Conditions.
