{"cdata!": "Overall, the project outcomes are rated\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, and the institutional\n            development impact high. Lessons convey that the strong\n            persistence, and follow-up during supervision, were the main\n            factors conducive to the progress achieved in privatization\n            (difficult to attain in light of strong vested interests),\n            and improved port management. However, there were problems\n            encountered in training small roads contractors,\n            particularly due to the lack of expertise in the subject, an\n            issue that needs to be dealt with as of the early stages.\n            Similarly, it was difficult to mobilize local counterpart\n            funding for rural road rehabilitation in the poorest areas;\n            it was at the mid-term review that it was decided to take\n            only the local labor contribution into account, increase the\n            contribution from the national budget - so as to prod\n            poverty alleviation - considering in turn, lower road\n            standards. Nonetheless, it is important to promote, and\n            develop road maintenance systems, a multifaceted effort,\n            which involves training of private contractors, and ensuring\n            access to capital, and the necessary equipment. This effort\n            was successfully achieved, demonstrating how small\n            contractors can evolve in urban areas, and how private\n            contracting can be promoted for maintaining trunk, and rural\n            roads. Most importantly, the independent road fund\n            demonstrated once again its valuable experience."}, "docdt": "2002-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
