participation.  They are: a)\n            to safeguard the competitiveness of Benin's transport\n            sector and of its transit corridor through open modal\n            competition; b) to improve Government's capacity for\n            planning, programming, and managing transport sector\n            investments; c) to boost infrastructure maintenance resource\n            allocation; d) to boost the recovery of infrastructure user\n            charges; e) to expand private sector participation in public\n            works and maximize its impact on unskilled labor job\n            creation; f) to build capacity in sector institutions and\n            optimize human resource utilization; and g) to protect the\n            environment and import road safety conditions.  The main\n            components are: a) paved road construction, rehabilitation\n            and maintenance; b) unpaved road rehabilitation and\n            maintenance; c) institutional strengthening for road network\n            management; d) feeder roads; e) port and maritime\n            improvements; and f) airport rehabilitation."}, "docdt": "1996-10-11T00:00:00Z"}
