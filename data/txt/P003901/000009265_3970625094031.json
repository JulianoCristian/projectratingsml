the Smallholder\n            Cattle Development Project will be to supply cattle to\n            smallholder farmers, for use as draft animals, to provide\n            manure for sustaining crop production, and to raise farm\n            incomes. The project, which would follow up on a smallholder\n            cattle project supported by a loan from International Fund\n            for Agricultural Development (IFAD), would finance: (a)\n            procurement of about 76,500 selected breeding heifers and\n            about 7,600 bulls and their transportation by private cattle\n            traders; (b) distribution of these cattle to about 76,500\n            smallholder farmers, including transmigrants, local\n            participants in transmigration schemes, and farmers near\n            transmigrant communities; (c) distribution of first and\n            second generation heifers to about 55,000 farmers; (d)\n            cattle handling facilities, veterinary services, extension\n            services, forage production and disease investigations; and\n            (e) technical assistance and training for project\n            implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and disease\n            eradication. Distribution of offspring would continue beyond\n            the five-year project period, reaching in total some 237,000\n            small farmers. By providing cattle, land preparation would\n            be speeded up, soil fertility and crop yields raised, and\n            farm labor would be freed-up to clear reserve land, mostly\n            for perennial cash crops."}, "docdt": "1985-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
