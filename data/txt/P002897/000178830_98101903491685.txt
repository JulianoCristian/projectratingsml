APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
Summtary
i.        The Government of Uganda has asked the Association to help finance
a project consisting of part of its road development program. Preparation
of the road project, which will be the first for Uganda, has been delayed
by difficulties in formulating an acceptable project and in obtaining satis-
factory engineering and economic information on which to base an appraisal.
iie       The project as now developed consists of:  (1) the reconstruction
to a paved surface of the main road from Mbarara to Katunguru (69 miles);
(2) the reconstruction to a gravel surface of three short feeder roads
totalling 6.6 miles; (3) the construction of two tea roads totalling 24
miles; (4) the engineering and supervision of construction of the above
roads and (5) the detailed engineering and design of 6 main roads and 10
feeder roads totalling approximately 460 miles for a future project.
iii.      The cost of the project, including engineering and contingencies,
is estimated at US$ 7.2 million equivalent. The construction cost estimate
is based on quantities obtained from detailed engineering and on recent
prices for similar work. The cost estimate for engineering is based mainly
on firm proposals and contract prices. The foreign exchange cost component
is estimated at about 70%, or US$ 5.0 million equivalent, to be financed by
the proposed credit.
iv.       Execution of the project will be the responsibility of the NinistrZ
of T-orks, Communications and Housing.  The designs of the main and feeder
roads to be constructed under the project have been prepared by consultants
and are satisfactory; the design standards used on the tea roads were some-
what high and were revised downiward during negotiations. Consultants
satisfactory to the Association have been engaged for the supervision of
construction on parts (1), (2) and (3) of the project and to do most of the
detailed engineering for the future project.
v.        The Mbarara-Katunguru Road, which will improve an important link
in Uganda's trunk road network, has a high priority in the country's road
development program.  Its reconstruction will result in substantial savings
in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance as well as provide reliable
all-weather access to an important part of the country.  The estimated rate
of return on the investment is about 10%, which is satisfactory. Other
benefits, in terms of savings in travel time and agricultural development,
are also expected, although these are not readily quantifiable.
Vi.       The three feeder roads in part (2) of the project will facilitate
access to fishing facilities while the two tea roads in part (3) of the
project will serve an important tea growing area.



- ii -
vii.      The inclusion in the project of detailed engineering for additional
main and feeder roads should ensure that the preparation of a further road
project can proceed with a minimum of delay.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$ 5.0
million equivalent to the Uganda Government.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1       Following several staff visits to identify and assist in preparing
a road project in Uganda, the Government submitted a preliminary application
to the Association in 1964. The application did not contain sufficient
engineering and cost information, although the economic studies were satis-
factory, and the NOW -undertook to engage consultants to get the information
needed.  Following a more detailed application received in early 1965, a
second appraisal mission visited Uganda in March of that year and reached
general agreement with the Govertunent on a list of roads to be included in
a project. The mission found that a considerable amount of survey and
design work had been carried out but that it had not been coordinated or
completed, and that as a result the cost estimates were still not soundly
based. The Government reaffirmed its intention to engage consultants as
required; eventually, the MOW selected two consulting firms early in 1966
to carry out the design on some of the roads, but delayed assigning the
remainder of the work. In view of the slow progress in completing the
engineering, the Association and the Government agreed in mid-1966 to reduce
the scope of the project.
1.2       This appraisal report is based on the findings of IDA missions
which visited Uganda in March 1965 and September 1966, and on studies
prepared by the Government and its consultants. This report was prepared
by Messrs. Halcer and Young, with the assistance of Messrs. Hogg and van
Dij ck.

2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.1       Uganda is a land-locked country,astride the equator,about the
size of the United Kingdom. Its total area is approximately 91,000 square
miles, of which about one-seventh is inland lakes and swamps. It is bounded
by the Sudan on the north, Kenya on the east, Tanzania, Lake Victoria and
Rwanda on the south and the Congo  (Kinshasa)    on the west. Most of
Uganda is undulating country, with few marked physical features. As the
greater part of the country is a plateau at about 4,000 feet above sea
level, the climate is temperate.  The population wasestimated at about 7. 7
million in 1966, and is growing at the rate of about 2.7% per annum. The
population is predominantly African but includes small Asian and European
minorities that number about 88,0oo and 9,000 respectively.
2.2       The economy is mainly agricultural of the subsistence type with
55% of the GNP being accounted for by the agricultural sector. Only about
one-half of this represents cash crops, principally coffee and cotton which
are cultivated almost exclusively for the export market. In terms of em-
ployment, the agricultural sector accounts for 90g of the potential labor
force.
2.3       Uganda's GNP has been estimated at I 275 million in 1966, or the
equivalent of a per capita GNP of about US$ 100. Over the past years, the
growth of GNP has been uneven due to the large influence of coffee and
cotton which have fluctuated as a result of the vagaries of weather and
international commodity markets. The figures available on the monetary
economy indicate a growth rate of 4.5% per annum over the years 1960-1965.
The transport sector is relatively small and accounts for only about %
of the GNP.
B. The Transport System
(a) General
2.        Apart from large swamps in the southern part of the country, the
land area of Uganda presents few physical problems to communications. The
tuwo largest cities (Kampala and Jinja) and a number of smaller centers
are served by road, rail and air transport. For historical reasons, inclu-
ding a long tradition of communal labor, Uganda has the best road system
of the three countries of East Africa in terms of coverage and technical
standards.
(b) Railways
2.5       The railway in Uganda is a part of the East African Common Ser-
vices Organization (EACSO) and is managed by the East African Railways and
Harbors Administration (EAR&H). 1/ The EAR&H operates a total route mileage
The Bank has made the following loansfor the EAR&H: i)  110 EA on
March 15, 1955 for US$ 24.0 million and ii) 428-EA on September 29,1965
for US$ 38.0 million.



- 3 -
in the territories of 3,646 miles, of which 721 miles are within Uganda.
The railway enters Uganda at Tororo and continues in a westerly direction
to Kampala and Jinja, the main commercial centers of the country, from where
it extends across the country to terminate at Kasese, near the Congo bor-
der. At Tororo, a branch line extends in a north-westerly direction to
Pakwach on the Albert Nile, also close to the Congo frontier.
2.6       Although the railway network is much smaller than the main road
system in terms of mileage, it is more important in terms of quantities
transported. The bulk of the country's transport is accounted for by
international trade, the largest part of which is moved by the EAR&H to
and from the port of Mombasa in Kenya and, to a much smaller extent, to
and from Dar-es-Salaam and Tanga in Tanzania via a ferry across Lake
Victoria to INwanza and thence by rail to the coast.
2.7       In 1964 the railways carried about 420,000 tons of Uganda exports
of which 130,000 tons were destined for Tanzania and Kenya and the re-
mainder for overseas markets, mostly via Mombasa.  About 340,000 tons of
imports to Uganda were also carried exclusively from Mombasa. The rail-
ways contribute little to the internal exchange between the various regions
of the country or to passenger traffic movements.
(c) Waterways
2.8       The inland waterway service on Lake Victoria is also operated
by the EAR&H. This provides a main link between the lake services and
the Tanzania and Uganda transport system, and forms part of Uganda's
alternative access to the sea at Tanzania ports.
(d) Airways
2.9       Airways are also organized on a regional basis.  Internal and
international services are provided by the East African Airways Corporation
which also falIs under EACSO. Entebbe, 21 miles south of Kampala, has
the only airport in Uganda handling international traffic. In addition,
there are l4 smaller airfields in Uganda served by scheduled EAA flights
as well as by private charter airlines catering for internal trips, pri-
marily tourist traffic.
(e) Highways
2.10      The highway system of Uganda  can be best described as falling
within a semi-circle based on Kampala as its center with the circumference
broadly following the international boundaries of the country. This sys-
tem is backed by a network of radials emanating from Kampala towards the
circumference and reinforced by tertiary or major feeder roads, linked with
either the circumference or the radials. (See Map)

3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.1       The total network in 1966 amounted to about 15,000 miles, includ-
ing some 3,700 miles of trunk roads (Table 1). Only 800 miles of trunk
roads are paved, with the remaining 2,900 miles generally being of good
quality gravel. The remaining 11,200 miles are feeder roads mostly of gra-
vel surface made of lateritic soil known in East Africa as "murram"t.
3.2       Highway development was fairly slow but steady until the early
sixties. In 1959, for example, there were only 8,500 miles of roads, of
which only 500 miles were paved. Since then with the help of U.K. and West
German bilateral aid the Government has made a significant effort to
accelerate the pace of main road construction and with its own resources to
develop and improve feeder roads.
B. Growth of Vehicle Fleet and Road Use
3.3       In 1965 there were about 40,000 vehicles in Uganda (Table 2),
or a vehicle density of one per 200 persons. This figure is about 20%
higher than the average for the African continent, South Africa excepted,
and is similar to that of Thailand or somewhat lower than that of Turkey.
While the average rate of growth of the total vehicle population was about
5.5% per annum for the period between 1955-1965,       it slowed down between
1960-65 to only 4%.  The Government estimates,and the Bank agrees, that
over the next 15 years the past long term average growth rate in total
vehicles will be maintained. This rate is slightly below the projected
rate of increase in GNP for the 5-year Plan period 1966-71.
3.4       Private cars constitute about 70% of the vehicle population.
Their numbers have been growing at about 7% per annum or slightly above the
average rate for the total fleet during the 1955-1965 period. The total
number of trucks and buses was almost stationary between 1955 and 1962.
This was mainly due to the following factors:  the stagnation of the eco-
nomy, an increase in the average carrying capacity of trucks, and their
more effective use as a result of road improvements. Since 1962, however,
there has been an upswing in the truck population, averaging 7% p.a. which
is equal to the growth rate of private cars.
3.5       Traffic counts have been taken regularly in Uganda since 1958/59
when there were about 100 counting stations. The number has now been
expanded to 216 and the quality of the counts has greatly improved. Since
1964/65 the counts have been planned, supervised and controlled systemati-
cally,with most of the counting being done mechanically but checked
manually on a sample basis. Counts are taken for weekly periods once every
six months, Until two years ago the location o6f some of the counting
stations was changed from time to time. As a result, it is difficult to
establish clear traffic volume trends along most of the roads in the coun-
try, except for about 70 counting stations for which continuous counts have



- 5 -
been kept since 1960. The data available suggest that the average annual
growth rate for most of these latter stations has varied between 6-8%.
3.6       Fuel consumption (See Table 3) has been rising between 1961
and 1965 at 4.7% per annum in the case of gasoline and at 8% p.a. for die-
sel. The weighted average of the two suggests that highway fuel consumption
has increased at about 6% p.a. in recent years, The rates of growth of
vehicles, traffic volume and fuel consumption are internally consistent
and in line with the Bank's observations in countries at a similar stage
of development.
C. Highway Administration
3.7       Uganda's road system is classified as follows:  Class I (primary
roads), Class II (secondary roads) and Classes III and IV (tertiary roads).
Primary and secondary roads are administered by the Ministry of Works,
Communications and Housing (MOW) while the tertiary system is administered
by Local Governments supported by 'grants-in-aid' from the Central
Government.
3.8       The MOW is divided according to four principal functions:  Housing;
Wiater Supply; Communications; and Roads, Bridges and Airfields. The
Communications Division is concerned with policy relating to aviation,
railways and other transport and communication matters falling within the
framework of EACSO through the Minister's participation in the East African
inter-ministerial transport committee. The Roads, Bridges and Airfields
Division is responsible for the construction, improvement and maintenance
of the Drimary and secondary road system and airfields. Its headquarters
are at Entebbe and it has regional offices in the Northern, Eastern,
Western and Buganda Provinces. The headquarters is further divided into
three sub-sections: a) Planning, b) General Administration and Budgets,
and c) Coordination, which deals with all operations related to foreign-
financed highway development.
3.9       Executive responsibility for maintaining the primary and secondary
road system lies with the four regional sections of the MOW, while the
responsibility of the headquarters is confined to general policy and budg-
etary control.  Maintenance and improvement of the tertiary road system are
done by local Governments with their own funds supplemented by grants from
the Central Government.
3.10      The MOW, in the past, has employed survey firms to locate, survey
and design road alignments while doing itself the soils work, bridge design
and preparation of specifications and contract documents. This has resulted
in a lack of coordination which has led to serious errors in design and
substantial increases in construction cost over the design estimates. The
Association has advised against this policy because it leads to a diffusion
of responsibility between the parties involved.(See paragraph 5.6).   The
long gestation period and substantial cost revisions involved in the pre-
paration of the present project illustrate the consequences of this policy.



- 6 -
The MOW uses its own forces to supervise construction;, some of this work
has been inadequately staffed in the past.
3.11      A shortage of qualified professional staff has developed in the
past few years. One important cause of this is the government salary
structure, which has not been revised in line with present-day rates to
attract and hold competent expatriates until Africans have been trained.
The shortage of staff imposes a serious limitation on the volume of new
highway work which the MOW can handle. For this reason the use of con-
sultants on the project covered in this report (paragraphs 5.19-5.21) is
essential,
D. Maintenance
3.12      The maintenance of Uganda's main road system is still generally
good but has deteriorated somewhat as expatriate staff continue to leave
the country and as the amounts allocated for maintenance (Table 4) have
not kept pace with the growth of the road network. As noted elsewhere,
feeder roads are maintained by local Government authorities; the quality
of this work varies widely. The Government intends to carry out a detailed
survey of the condition of the existing road network, prepare permanent
records, make proposals for appropriate classifications and for the divi-
sion of administrative and maintenance responsibilities. It has already
approached the U.K. Government for assistance in these respects. During
negotiations the Association obtained an assurance from the Government
that the road system will be adequately maintained and that the Government
will carry out the survey along the above-mentioned lines.
E. Construction Industry
3.13      At present, road contractors in East Africa can move freely from
one territory to another. The construction industry is primarily made up
of branches or subsidiaries of large European firms, mainly British and
Italian. Ovwer the last year Yugoslav and German firms have obtained work
in Tanzania. In view of the large amount of construction underway and
planned in East Africa, which will absorb most of the capacity of the
present firms, further works should be offered in large enough contracts
to attract outside bidders and thus keep prices at a reasonable level.
Small contracts such as for culverts, short span bridges and other labor-
intensive works are sought by small local firms which are mostly Asian-
owned. As yet there are no African firms in the road construction business
in East Africa except for haulers and truckers which obtain small contracts
for delivering Taurram.
F. Transport Development Plan
3.14      Uganda's Second Five-Year Plan (1966/67-1971/72) calls for the
investment of E 16.0 million by the Government and E 24.0 million by
EAR&H and the private sector in transport facilities.  About E 13.4 mil-
lion is to be invested in railways; primarily in further modernizing and



increasing the capacity of existing lines. A part of this railway invest-
ment is being financed with the help of a Bank loan (428-EA).
3.15      The road program calls for an investment of about I 14.0 mil-
lion over the five-year period. The recent Bank economic mission to East
Africa found that the physical program proposed for road development is
a comprehensive, well-rounded view of Uganda's long term road needs.
However, the cost of this program has been seriously underestimated, and
its time-frame is unrealistic. The Government is faced with the large
task of establishing priorities based on economic criteria. The mission
concluded that the financial target of 1 14.0 million in roads is feasible,
provided that immediate steps are taken to improve the executive capacity
of the MIOW. The proposed project, plus the eventual execution of those
roads to be engineered under the project, will account for roughly 50%
of the total road investment believed feasible by the economic mission
during the Plan period; these roads were found by the economic mission
to be of more obvious economic priority.

4. TRANSPORT COORDI'ATION
4.1       The road and rail systems of Uganda are complementary to a
considerable extent, each having a clearly established place in the
economy. Road transport serves the export sector by collecting produce
from numerous scattered production points and delivering it to processing
centers and railheads and by moving a reverse flow of imported goods to
the many small retail outlets throughout the country. It also provides
for the internal distribution of foodstuffs, particularly, and of local
raw materials and manufactured goods. The railway's prime function is
to haul exports to the coast and bring in imports to the main distributing
centers. Its role as a passenger carrier within Uganda is not important.
4.2       In Kenya and Tanzania, which are co-owners with Uganda of the
EAR&H, road-rail competition in freight traffic has posed particular
problems. In order to protect the financial viability of the railway as
a unit and its differential rate structure, Kenya and Tanzania have
instituted licensing restrictions on trucking. In Uganda, because road
and rail are complementary, trucking has not been similarly restricted.
On the other hand, passenger transport by road is subject to licensing
and route regulations, but in order to maintain standards of safety and
performance rather than as a device for protecting the railway.
4.3       Policies for road transport, highway investment and certain
types of road user taxes are decided by each Government separately.
However, taxes on the import of fuel, vehicles, tires, etc. are presently
based on a common East African tariff, which has to be agreed upon by
all three countries.
4.4       In connection with Bank Loan 428-EA for the EAR&H, the  three
East African Governments undertook to carry out a transport coordination
study. The UNDP has agreed to assist in the financing of this study which
is expected to begin shortly, with the Bank as Executing Agent. The
object of the study is to provide each of the three East African Govern-
ments with a sound basis for formulating its transport policies; the
study should develop an appropriately phased series of measures to co-
ordinate the use and development of the various modes of surface transport
in and among the three countries, so that the resources employed are used
in the most efficient manner.
4.5       Among the questions to be examined in this comprehensive study
is the extent to which road users do and should cover, through taxation,
the costs to government of providing, maintaining and administering the
road system in each ofthe countries. So far as Uganda is concerned, no
firm conclusions can be drawn from the presently available evidence. The
total revenue received from vehicle use and ownership has increased from



- 9 -
about E 2.3 million in 1961/62 to about IE 4.5 million in 1964/65 while
highway expenditures in the period averaged about L 1.7 million annually
(Tables 4 and 5). The increase in revenues is attributable more to up-
ward revision of tax rates than to an increase in vehicle use and owner-
ship. Conceptually, part of the import duties could be abstracted from
the total receipts, as representing general taxation; on the other hand,
part of the EAR&H's high-rated tariff on the transport of motor fuel and
vehicles from the coast to Uganda is intended to offset the loss on the
movemenu of bulky, low-value exports both to the East African markets and
ove.-seas. Hence this arrangement could be regarded as an indirect form
of taxation of road users - although the proceeds do not accrue directly
to Uganda. Issues such as these will be fully explored in the forthcoming
study and appropriate recommendations made.

5. THE PROJECT
A. Description
5.1       The project consists of the following parts (see Map):
(i)  the reconstruction, including bituminous surfacing,
of the main road from Mbarara to Katunguru (69 miles);
(ii)  the reconstruction with gravel surface of three short
feeder roads totalling 6.6 miles in length;
(iii) the construction of two tea roads 24 miles in length;
(iv)  the detailed engineering and supervision of construction
of the above roads; and
(v)  the detailed engineering of 16 additional roads (6 main
and 10 feeder roads) totalling approximately 460 miles
in length (see Table 6).
i)  Mbarara-Katunguru Road
5.2       The Mbarara-Katunguru road in the South-West part of Uganda forms
a part of the trunk road system between Kampala, Masaka, Mbarara and Fort
Portal. It is the only part that remains unsurfaced. It is presently
a low standard, gravel road which developed over the years from a track
over very rugged terrain. The new alignment follows the same general
location as the existing road. From Mbarara, the road passes through long
flat swampy areas but towards Ishaka the terrain becomes mountainous. Near
Kasunju, the road descends about 3,000 feet down two steep escarpments to
the plains of the Queen Elizabeth National Park, The road terminates at
the south side of an existing bridge across the Kazinga Channel which
drains Lake George into Lake Edward.
ii) The Three Feeder Roads
5.3-      The three feeder roads to be reconstructed under the second part
of the project are located near the Katunguru end of the trunk road. Two
of the feeder roads provide access to the shores of Lake George and the
third to Lake Edward. All three are located in flat terrain.
iii) The Two Tea Roads
5.4       These two roads would serve a tea-growing area in the vicinity
of Fort Portal. They are located in hilly to mountainous terrain on either
side on the main Fort Portal-Kampala road.



- 11 -
iv) Detailed Engineering and Supervision of Construction
of Parts i), ii) and iii)
5.5       The appraisal mission of March 1965 found that a considerable
amount of survey and design work on the Mbarara-Katunguru Road had been
carried out by various organizations, but that it had not been coordinated
or completed.  The geometric design of about one-half of the road had been
completed, but the remainder had only been surveyed. At the recommendation
of the IDA, the MOW agreed to engage a firm of consultants to review the
earlier work and to complete the final design. The design of the three
feeder roads which are located in the vicinity of the Mbarara-Katunguru
Road was also included.  Early in 1966, the MOW selected the Kenyan firm
of Edwards and Burrow of Nairobi for this work. This firm specializes in
road engineering and has satisfactorily carried out work on a number of
Bank-financed projects in East and Central Africa.
5.6       The consultants were instructed by the MOW to (i) review the
design of the section of the Mbarara-Katunguru Road which had been prepared
earlier; (ii) complete the geometric design of the section which remained
unfinished; and (iii) prepare a design of the base and pavement through-
out. The latter work was to be based on soils investigations carried out
by the MOW. The consultants submitted a report to the MOW in August 1966
which stated that, as the soils investigations made by the MOW did not
provide the information normally expected, they were unable to carry out
the design of the base and surfacing. The Association requested that this
remaining engineering work be carried out. This has been done by the con-
sultants who submitted a supplementary report in March 1967 completing
the detailed engineering.
5.7       The MOW did not originally assign to the consultants the pre-
paration of specifications and contract documents, as it uses its own
standard documents. The consultants' report noted differences of opinion
with the UVE as to its general specifications and recommended certain
changes. The Association believed that it was desirable that the party
who prepared the plans should also draw up the specifications as both form
a part of the description of the design. The same applies to preparation
of the contract documents, which should indicate the consultants' recom-
mendations for the execution of the work.  The Association, therefore,
suggested to the YOW that it authorize the consultants to prepare the
specifications and contract documents and the MOW agreed.
5.8       The detailed engineering of the two tea roads has been ca.ried
out by Norconsult (Norway). In April 1967, the Nairobi office carried
out a short appraisal of these two roads which were only recently added
to the construction part of the project at the request of the Government.



- 12 -
v) Detailed Engineering of Additional Roads
5.9       This part of the project provides for the final design of a
number of main, feeder and tea roads which were appraised by the March 1965
mission and appeared economically justified on the basis of the cost esti-
mates available at that time. The construction of these roads is not
included in the project because of delays in completing the detailed design.
As experience with the Mbarara-Katunguru road indicates that costs were
seriously underestimated on the basis of preliminary surveys done by the
MDW, justification of these roads should be re-examined on the basis of
the revised cost estimates arising from the final design before any decision
is reached on their construction. Regarding the Kabale-Rwanda border road,
FED has offered to finance the final engineering of the connecting section
in Rwanda between the border and the capital, Kigali, and has indicated
that it will cooperate with the Bank in the preparation of the terms of
reference.
5.10      The MOW has indicated that on this part of the project it has
turned over full responsibility for all phases of design to the various
consultants which it had already appointed.
B. Design Standards
5.11      The 1barara-Katunguru road is designed to a Class I standard (see
Table 7). The alignment basically follows the existing road and its design
is generally determined by the rugged nature of the terrain. The pavement
width of 20 feet is on the low side, but acceptable because of the difficult
terrain which requires a lowering of the design speed. The consultants
propose to depart from the standards in two cases to reduce unusually heavy
earthworks: radii of less than the minimum standard of 900 feet would be
used on six curves (the roadway is especially widened on these curves),
and on one slope the maximum gradient would be increased from 8 to 10 per
cent. In view of the difficult nature of the topography, these deviations
from the standards are acceptable, in order to avoid excessive costs.
5.12      The roads in parts ii) and iii) of the project are designed to
Class III standard. Also, the feeder roads, in part (v) of the project
with two exceptions, are being designed to Class III standards (see Table
7). These are relatively low but generally acceptable, and are in keeping
with the small volume of traffic anticipated on roads leading to tea-growing
areas, fishing facilities, etc. In the case of the tea roads in mountainous
areas, the proposed standards were modified, first by the consultants and
subsequently during negotiations, to reduce earthwork quantities and thus
construction costs. There may be further opportunities to make minor
adjustments to the standards selected as they are applied in individual
cases.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
5.13      The total cost of the project, including allowances and contin-
gencies, is estimated at US$ 7.2 million equivalent (see below).

1/  Includes  nreparition and review of detailed des%ign ,
prcparation of tondera, documents c2nd fi;1d supervision.
5.14      As noted earlier, the cost estimate of the main road is based on
completed detailed engineering. The consultants have indicated that
they have been conservative in estimating the cost of this work. The unit
prices in the estimate are considered reliable and are based on current
contract rates in East Africa, including the large amount of construction
now underway on road projects financed by the Association, and a main road
project near I4barara financed by the Federal Republic of West Germany.
5.15      The estimates for the engineering costs of parts i), ii) and
iii) are based on actual contract prices for design and on an existing
quotation for supervision, which have been adjusted upwards to allow for
a somewhat longer construction period than assumed by the consultants.
The engineering cost amounts to roughly 8 per cent of the overall cons-
truction estimate. This figure is low in comparison to similar projects
because a portion of the design of the main road had already been done,
and thus only a review of this workwas required. The estimate for the
final engineering in part v) is also based on actual contract prices for
over 80 per cent of the work,
5.16      In view of the completion of final design of parts i), ii) and
iii) and the availability of firm prices and quotations for most of the
engineering in parts iv) and v), the estimate is considered to be reliable.
The 15 per cent contingencies includes a 10 per cent allowance for quantity
contingencies and a 5 per cent allowance for price increases.



- 14 -
5.17      The foreign currency component was estimated by the MOW at 65
per cent for both construction and engineering services. However, no
allowance for profit of foreign contractors and consultants was included.
Assuming a profit of 5 per cent, the component is raised to 70 per cent,
a figure which is consistent with the Association's experience on similar
projects in Kenya and Tanzania. On this basis, the foreign component
amounts to about US$ 5.0 million equivalent. This will include retroactive
financing to January 1, 1966 in the order of about US$ 250,000 to cover
the consultants' expenditures on engineering work done since that date.
5.18      The local currency component will be financed by the Government
out of budget appropriations. The Government has given assurances that
local funds will be provided as required.
D. Execution and Credit Disbursement
5.19      Execution of the project will be the overall responsibility
of the MOW. As the present operations of the MOW are very much dependent
on two or three expatriate engineers, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Government will take prompt steps to ensure the
availability of sufficient staff to oversee the general execution of
the project.
5.20      Edwards and Burrow, the consultants who designed parts i) and
ii) of the project have been retained to supervise construction of this
work. Norconsult will be responsible for supervision of part iii) of
the project.
5.21      Consultants satisfactory to the Association have been engaged to
do the engineering of almost all of the roads in part v) of the project.
All of the engineering work already contracted was scheduled to be completed
by March 1967. This date was optimistic and late 1967 is considered more
realistic. On the Kabale-Uganda border road, an agreement between the
Rwanda and Uganda Governments to coordinate planning of the Kabale-Kigali
road will be a condition to disbursement for engineering costs.
5.22      The length of time to complete the overall project will be
governed by the time required to construct the Mbarara-Katunguru Road.
The consultants estimate that a construction period of thirty months will
be required, plus a 3-month period for call for tenders. It should be
possible to issue a tender call in August 1967. The consultants have
proposed that the roads in parts i) and ii) be let in one contract. The
roads in part iii) will be built under a separate contract. Contracts
will be let on the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with Bank/IDA procedures.



- 15 -
5.23      Estimated annual disbursements of foreign currency based on the
schedule of engineering and construction anticipated above will be as
follows:
1967    1968    1969    1970    Total
Amount in millions
of US $                    0.5     1.5      1.8     1.2      5.0
Any savings in the funds provided in the credit should be cancelled.
Credit funds will be disbursed on the basis of a percentage of the over-
all cost.

6. ECON4OMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. General
6.1       For a long time, Uganda has had one of the better road networks
in tropical Africa. Three factors are mainly responsible for this. First,
a widespread availability of laterite soils which provide an excellent
road building material. Secondly, the general absence of rivers and streams
requiring extensive bridging. Thirdly, a tradition of road-building based
on customary law, "luwalo" ,which gave the option to African taxpayers to
choose between the payment of local taxes in cash or community work.
6.2       Current and expected traffic volumes, on many main roads, are such
that the gravel surfaced (murram) roads are not able to stand up to the
wear imposed. The growing traffic volumes on these often crudely aligned
gravel roads cause increasing amounts of dust that restrict road capacity,
increase vehicle operating costs and add to driving hazards. In addition,
the frequent renewal of gravel and/or grading of the roads becomes increas-
ingly costly and, is itself, a delaying factor to traffic. Bituminous sur-
facing, therefore becomes necessary, although it is not economic to do so
unless the roads to be upgraded are on their final alignments. Such upgrad-
ing lowers the costs of vehicle operation, avoids rising road maintenance
costs and provides safer all-weather communications.
B. The N'1barara-Katunguru Road
6.3       The l-barara-Katunguru road now carries about 200 vehicles per day
over its full length, with higher volumes on some intermediate sections and
near the terminal points. About 30 per cent of the traffic consists of
trucks and buses. Improvement of this road stands high in the Government's
current priorities for highlway development because the road performs a
number of important functions. It is a part of the main trunk road from
Kampala, eastern Uganda and Kenya to the western part of the country. In
addition, it is one of the main access routes into the Congo as well as to
important natural parks and game reserves found on both sides of the border
and, particularly, the Queen Elizabeth National Park. It functions as an
inter-district road betwqeen Toro, Ankole and parts of Kigezi Districts.
Finally, part of the road provides a link to the nearest railroad, at Kasese,
for much of south-western Uganda.
6.4       The District in which the road is primarily located, Ankole, has
an area of 5,900 square miles and a population of over 600,000, giving a
density of about 100 persons per square mile which is above average for
Uganda. Rainfall in the area varies from low in the eastern parts, where
cattle-grazing is practiced, to high in the ridged area along the Congo
border to the West. Only about 15 per cent of the land area is currently
under cultivation, primarily for subsistence needs. For example, of the
cultivated area, about 70 per cent is devoted to plantains,  which
is the basic subsistence crop, Twhereas about 5 per cent is fully devoted to
cash crops such as coffee, cotton, groundnuts, tobacco and tea. As a result,



- 17 -
therefore, there is potential not only for a shift from subsistence farming
to cash cropping but also for an expansion of the margin of cultivation as
transport costs decline (see Table 8).
6.5       Detailed plans for the development of the Western Province and its
individual Districts have not yet been fully worked out. One important pro-
ject, however, for tea cultivation is already being considered for financing
by the Association after having been investigated in detail by the Association
and the Comnonwealth Development Corporation.  Up to 1964 about 28,000 acres
were planted with tea in Uganda. By 1970 the area under tea is expected to
rise to 42,000 acres. A considerable part of this increase is planned to take
place in the Kigezi (2,010 acres) and Ankole (2,640 acres) Districts and will
be within the service area of the project road. At present there is one tea
factory located alongside the project road about halfway between Bushenyi and
Katunguru. The tea development program envisages the construction of another
factory to process small holder tea at Bushenyi and a second at a location
in Kigezi District yet to be determined. It is forecast that by 1975 about
25,000 tons of green tea and 5,500 tons of made tea will be produced in the
areas, a significant part of which will be moved over parts of the project
road.
6.6       A second development affecting the volume of traffic on the
Nbarara-Katunguru road is tourist travel to the national parks and game
reserves. So far, the number of tourists visiting IJganda has not been large.
In 1965, for example, about 10,000 visitors arriving as tourists in East
Africa had Uganda as their first stop.  An additional but unknown number
visited the country after first having been to Kenya and Tanzania. The Govern-
ment recognizes that developm.ent of the tourist industry is of high priority.
Important investments are planned to develop the game reserves, tourist
accommodations, roads, tracks and airstrips, A team of consultants has been
engaged by the Government to draw up a specific program for the development
of tourism for inclusion in the 1966-1971 Plan. The provisional target is
to increase the volume of tourist earnings threefold by 1971.
6.7       Traffic on the project road has been growing at about 9 per cent
per annum, or a doubling in eight years (Table 9). This rate is about 30
per cent above the average for roads in the country as a whole. For the
purpose of the benefit analysis however, more conservative traffic growth
rates of 7 per cent ner annum for heavy vehicles and 6 per cent per annum
for light vehicles have been assumed between now and the first five years
after the completion of the project improvements, tapering off to 4 per cent
per annum for both vehicle groups in the last 5 years of the expected 20-
year economic life of the new road. In view of the project road's past
record of growth, the expected development of tea production and tourism
and the possibilities for agricultural development, these rates are reason-
able and are consistent with the Bank's experience in similar types of
projects in Africa.
6.8       The project works constitute an improvement not only in type of
surface but also in geometric design standards - lower gradients, larger
radii of curves, fewer curves, etc. The two groups of benefits to be



- 18 -
derived from such improvements are savings in vehicle operating and road
maintenance costs. Calculations of these savings have been based on the
extensive work of the U.K. Road Research Laboratory in East and Central
Africa, and on the Bank's exrerience with similar projects in these areas.
The cost (net of taxes) of ooerating a tynical truck (7-ton carrying
caDacity) has been estimated to be about U30 21  per vehicle mile over
the existing road. If the road was not improved it has been estimated
that the cost of oneration would rise to over USYs 30   per vehicle mile
over the next twenty years because of increasing traffic, increased dust,
and the technical difficulty of adequately maintaining gravel surface for
the expected traffic volumes. As a result of the road improvement, costs
are expected to fall to USt 15  per vehicle mile, rising only slightly
over the life of the improvements with traffic growth to about USO 17
per vehicle mile.  For light vehicles, the figures would be USP 9  and
USX 15  respectively without improvements and US¢ 8  and 'US¢. 9  res-
pectively with the project improvement.
6.9       These estimated unit savings in vehicle operating costs are also
consistent with the recent study by the Bank's Economic Staff.l/ The dis-
counted rate of return on the  road,   over its assumed economic life, is
10 per cent. This figure, however, understates the potential total bene-
fits of the project in that it does not take into account the benefits to
the national economy of any added agricultural output beyond those included
in transport cost and savings due to reductions' in travel time.
C. The Feeder Roads
6.10      The three feeder roads included for construction in the present
project will provide access to Hamukunga and Kahendero on Lake George and
to Kisenyi on Lake Edward, near the northern end of the Mbarara-Katunguru
Road. There are now three modern fish processing plants located in the
area - two on Lake Edward and one, the largest of the three, at Kisenyi on
Lake George.
6.11      Of the total output of fish from the Lakes, about 30 per cent
is handled and packaged by these modern factories for eventual re-sale
in the specialized markets in the main urban centers of Kampala, Entebbe,
Jinja, and M4bale. About another 30 per cent is accounted for by trade'
with the Congo of locally dried and smoked fish. This trade is based on
Katwe, the largest village in the area with a population of 4,000.  The
remaining 40 per cent of the output is for domestic consumption for the local,
non-urban market, which is-growing rapidly.  Ilost of this fish is trar.zpor-
ted substantial distances, either fresh or smoked, via Mbarara to the
heavily populated rural markets of Eastern Uganda.
6.12      The value of the present total landed catch of 1,300 tons, before
processing, is about E 40,000. The building of the feeder roads is
1/ Quantification of Road User Savings - EC14Oa, December, 1965.



- 19 -
expected to avoid losses of fish caused by delays and the impassibility
of the present tracks at times, and permit an overall improvement in the
quality of fish marketed or delivered to the factories for processing.
It is estimated that an increase in ex-landing prices amounting to around
E 5,600 for the present output will be feasible. On an assumed life of
10 years for these 6.6 miles of modest standard roads, these benefits are
equivalent to a return of about 13 per cent on the roads.
D. The Tea Roads
6.13      The two tea roads are located in the vicinity of Fort Portal,
which is one of the four areas covered by the IDA-financed outgrowers
tea project. This project has been negotiated and is expected to be
presented to the Executive Directors shortly. The proposed Hima-
Kinyantale-Mirongo Road is a loop of 15 miles to facilitate the collection
of outgrowers leaf for the Munobwa factory. It is expected that within
5 years about 20 two-acre tea gardens will be established per mile along
the loop. The Kagorogoro-Hakibale Road will replace 9 miles of bush
track and facilitate the transport of green leaf to factories in the
Kijura area at the northern end and Munobwa at the southern end.  The
area served is about 20 square miles and it is estimated that 200 acres
of tea will be planted within 10 years as a direct result of the road
being built. The tea roads are an essential part of the tea project,
which has a satisfactory economic justification.
E.  Detailed Engineering of Additional Roads
6.14      The 16 additional roads (see Table 6) that constitute this part
of the project are envisaged as forming the basis for a future project
suitable for external assistance. The first four roads in Table 6 would
serve tea-growing areas, while road M1-7/M-36 will improve a regional
link to Tanzania.  The next six roads are located in Buganda, the most
heavily populated part of the country, and an area with very high agricul-
tural production and potential. The Iganga-Mbale Road will provide a
shorter link between Kampala and Jinja, and Mbale, the country's third
largest center.
6.15      The Kabale-Rwanda border road will form part of a direct connec-
tion to Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. This link will shorten by approxi-
mately 35 miles the existing 150-mile round-about connection over which
most of Rwanda's imports are transported. The remaining roads in Table 6
will serve agricultural areas in the eastern and central part of the
country.
6.16      All the roads to be engineered form an integral part of the Five-
Year Road Development Program. The Government's overall road strategy is
considered sound, despite some of the basic problems touched upon in Sections
1 and 3. It is desirable to provide for continuity in the road construction
program by making funds available now for the engineering of roads to be
constructed at a later stage.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMNEIIDATIONS
7.1       The construction part of the project is technically sound, and
the standards for the roads to be engineered are considered satisfactory.
The cost estimate for construction is based on completed final designs,
while the unit prices are in line with recent cost experience in East
Africa. The cost estimate for engineering is mainly based on firm prices
and is considered reliable.
7.2       Construction of the roads in parts i) and ii) will yield an
adequate return. The economic justification of the two tea roads included
in part iii) is related to the tea project. The final engineering of the
additional main and feeder roads included in the project will enable the
Government to carry on with its road development program and thus speed
up the preparation of a future road project for financing by the Association
or other interested agencies. As experience with the Mbarara-Katunguru
Road indicates that costs were seriously underestimated on the basis of
preliminary surveys, the justification of these roads will be re-examined
on the basis of the revised cost estimates arising from their final design
before any decision is reached on their construction.
7.3       The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of
US$ 5.0 million equivalent to the Uganda Government.
