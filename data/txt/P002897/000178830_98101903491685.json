totalling about 7 miles; (3) the construction of two\n            tea roads totalling about 24 miles; (4) the detailed\n            engineering and supervision of construction of the above\n            roads; and (5) the detailed engineering of 6 main and 10\n            feeder roads totalling approximately 460 miles. All of these\n            roads form an integral part of the road program contained in\n            the Government's Five Year Development Plan and were\n            found by the recent Bank economic mission to be of high priority."}, "docdt": "1967-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
