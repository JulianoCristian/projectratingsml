                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made significant advances since last mission which is likely to be the last Implementation Support Mission for the Project. The Project has made significant progress
                         including completion of infrastructure activities and progress in sub-projects implementation. The targets for four of five PDO Indicators, two of three GEO Indicators and 12 of 14
                         Intermediary Outcome Indicators have been achieved or exceeded. Over 98% of IDA, 95% of PHRD and 92% of GEF resources are disbursed and remaining funds are expected to
                         be disbursed by project closing. Therefore, the Implementation Progress has been upgraded to Satisfactory, and the PDO/GEO rating remains as Satisfactory. However, there has
                         been continued delay in parliamentary approval of the draft Conservation Law, and completion of the Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) in Limpopo National Park, financed by KfW,
                         especially in the issuance of the Land Use Right (Direito de Uso e Aproveitamento da Terra - DUATs) for resettled households, completion of remaining civil works and resettlement
                         of remaining two families. The Conservation Law is tabled for discussion and approval by the Parliament. RAPs are expected to be completed by May 2014.
