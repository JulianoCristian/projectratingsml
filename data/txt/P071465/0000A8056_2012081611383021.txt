                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In 2011 and up to end May 2012, the project team focused its attention on protected area planning, on community sub-projects and infrastructure developments. The project made
                         solid progress and achieved most planned activities. The following project achievements can be noted: (i) The management of protected areas under the project has improved with
                         most significant progress in the Maputo Special Reserve and Ponta do Ouro Marine Reserve. (ii) All protected areas have been declared mine free and have adopted management
                         plans. (iii) Three protected areas are redefining their boundaries with the objective to exclude as much as possible encroached land. Manica Province and Vilanculos District
                         adopted Tourism Master Plans. (iv) Matutuine District adopted its Integrated District Development Plan. Substantial land areas around protected areas have been demarcated for
                         community usage. (v) The first community-private lodge opened in Moribane in the Chimanimani Reserve and several others have been approved as community sub-projects and are
                         under construction. (vi) At the national level, a Conservation Policy has been adopted and a new Conservation Bill completed consultations and is almost ready to be submitted to
                         cabinet. (vii) A new protected area institution, ANAC, has been approved and is being established. With one year of project implementation period remaining, the project
                         implementation team needs to focus on completing the protected area transformation plan, complete the implementation of all sub-projects in the pipeline and accelerate
                         infrastructure development in the protected areas.
