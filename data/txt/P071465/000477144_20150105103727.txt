H. Restructuring (if any)
In March 2009, a reallocation of GEF proceeds was approved to increase the allocation of
funds for training from US$ 400,000 to 700,000.

In September 2009, a mid-term review (MTR) of the Project was conducted and several
changes were agreed. The PIU adopted these changes immediately after the MTR,
including changes in staff, adoption of revised indicator targets and a revised work plan.

                                           xvii
The corresponding formal restructuring (Level 2) happened in August 2011, due to
Government’s delays in officially sending the request for Project restructuring. At the
time of restructuring, US$12.8 million of the IDA Credit and US$ 3.88 million of the
GEF grant had been disbursed, and resulted in changes to the Project’s indicator targets,
reallocation of Grant proceeds and changes to some Project activities.

In March 2012, a second Level 2 restructuring was approved to allow some corrections in
the disbursement categories of Consultant Services and Training of the IDA Credit and
GEF Grant Agreements.

In March 2013, the closing date was extended from June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2014.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Mozambique is strategically located on the east coast of Africa, bordering six
countries including South Africa. With an area of 800,000 Km2, the country is richly
endowed with natural resources (arable land, forests, water, gas and mineral resources).
Despite this wealth, Mozambique is currently ranked as one of the poorest countries in
the world with approximately 70% of its 22.9 million people living and working in
extreme poverty (<US$2/day). After emerging from a protracted fifteen-year civil war
that ended in 1992, Mozambique achieved impressive economic growth rates, averaging
8.5% annually (annual GDP per capita growth averaging 6%) between 1995 and 2002.
Although the benefits of this growth were mainly concentrated in and around Maputo and
some other urban areas, over the 1996-2003 period poverty rate declined from 69 percent
to 54 percent. Despite this progress, at appraisal the country’s rural areas, where over 70
percent of Mozambicans lived and were mostly dependent on subsistence agriculture,
continued to be affected by extreme poverty.

2.      In terms of biodiversity, Mozambique falls within the biodiversity-rich
Zambezian biogeographic region, and contains a wide diversity of habitats including
mountainous, woodland, wetland and coastal/marine ecosystems. Its 2,700 km of
coastline are unique in the East African Marine Region in terms of the species quality,
diversity and richness.

3.      Consistent with the country’s overall economic growth pattern, tourism in
Mozambique began to develop after the civil war. Between 1995 and 2001, arrivals had
increased by 10-15 % annually, reaching a total of 400,000 tourists by 2001. Since
tourism had become the third largest investment sector in the country, the Government of
Mozambique (GMO) (i) created a separate Ministry of Tourism (MITUR) in 2001, (ii)
adopted a Tourism Policy and Implementation Strategy (TPIS) in 2003; (iii) prepared a
Strategic Plan for Tourism Development in Mozambique (SPTD, 2004-2008) and (iv)
adopted a new Tourism Law that provided a framework for building regulatory capacity.

4.      Within this policy framework, Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) were
considered as Priority Areas for Tourism Investment (PATIs). TFCAs, as described in the
country biodiversity and tourism strategies, are large, defined areas which include both
core Protected Areas (PA) and multiple-use areas where the primary management
objective is to promote socially and environmentally sustainable development compatible
with the area’s conservation goals. The TFCA concept includes the participation of local
communities and other stakeholders in PA management and the sustainable use of the
natural resources by communities, particularly through sustainable tourism.

5.      The GOM established a national TFCA Program in 1998 whose long-term
objectives are to conserve the biodiversity and natural ecosystems within TFCAs, and to
promote economic growth and development based on sustainable use of their natural
resources by local communities, with a particular emphasis on ecotourism. The Program

                                            1
promotes GOM’s adherence to international agreements aimed at coordinating activities
across national borders, and promoting conservation activities in the portions of the
TFCAs within Mozambique. This operation, within the context of the longer-term
program, sought to increase the natural assets, especially wildlife, and improve the
physical infrastructure within the TFCAs as a basis for encouraging and accommodating
increased nature-based tourism in the Project area, thereby enhancing biodiversity while
also stimulating greater and more sustainable local economic growth.

6.      The World Bank has been supporting Mozambique’s TFCA Program for 15 years
now. An initial project (the Transfrontier Conservation Areas Pilot and Institutional
Strengthening Project – TFCA I) was implemented by the Bank with GEF financing
between 1998 and 2003, and launched the TFCA concept in Mozambique. Its
achievements included the establishment of three TFCAs (Greater Limpopo,
Chimanimani and Lubombo), improved policy and institutional development, and modest
investments to strengthen the management of the PAs within those three TFCAs. The
second Project, the Transfrontier Conservation Area and Tourism Development Project
(TFCATDP), was implemented from 2006 to 2014, and its achievements are described in
detail in this ICR. Building on the results and lessons of these first two projects, the third
phase of the Program will be supported by the MozBio Project, approved by the Board in
November 2014, and expected to become effective in early 2015, whose goal is “to
increase the effective management of the Conservation Areas and enhance the living
conditions of communities in and around the Conservation Areas”.

7.      The TFCATDP was fully aligned with (i) relevant country strategies (Tourism
Development, Biodiversity Conservation, and Poverty Reduction); (ii) the Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy, (iii) GEF’s global priorities, and (iv) assistance provided by
several donors in support of conservation. The Project was also fully aligned with Bank
and GEF global commitments, by addressing issues of global concern including
ecosystem protection and management, species protection, and the enhanced
management and protection of important transfrontier areas. Specific to GEF, the Project
was fully consistent with the objectives of the Biodiversity Conservation focal area, and
covered several Operational Programs due the variety of habitats within the TFCAs:
Semi-Arid Zone Ecosystems (OP#1); Coastal, Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems
(OP#2), Forest Ecosystems (OP#3) and Mountain Ecosystems (OP#4).

8.     The TFCATDP Project area included the Mozambique portion of three TFCAs
(Chimanimani, Lubombo, and Greater Limpopo). In these TFCAs, Project
implementation was expected to be focused on 7 to 9 districts of 4 Provinces: Ihambane
(Vilankulo District), Maputo (Matutuine District), Manica (Sussudenga District), and
Gaza (priority 1: Chicualacuala, Massingir, Mabote, Massangena Districts; priority 2:
Chigubo and Mabacane Districts). In the 3 TFCAs, the protected areas (PAs) targeted
were Chimanimani National Reserve, Maputo Special Reserve, Limpopo National Park
(NP), Banhine NP, and Zinave NP (see map).

9.     Regarding TFCATDP’s complementarities with other initiatives, several donors
and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were also actively involved in

                                              2
conservation-related activities in the Project area during the period of its implementation.
Most relevant among these were Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW) and the Peace
Parks Foundation (PPF), which supported the establishment of the Greater Limpopo
Transfrontier Park; the Transfrontier Natural Resource Management initiative financed
by the US Agency for International Development (USAID); the African Wildlife
Foundation (AWF), which provided support for community land demarcation and
capacity building in and around Zinave and Banhine National Parks (ZNP and BNP); and
the joint DANIDA/GEF initiative on coastal zone management. The Project also
provided a link to IFC-supported activities such as the Small and Medium Grants
program and the Southeast Africa Tourism Investment Program (SEATIP), aimed at
facilitating private sector investment and developing the regional tourism market
necessary for community-based tourism to succeed.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
    approved)

10.     The Development Objective (PDO) of the Project was to achieve growth in
community-private sector led environmentally and socially sustainable tourism in
TFCAs. The PDO’s reference to “community-private sector led environmentally and
socially sustainable tourism” should be understood in the context of the overall objectives
of the longer-term TFCA program – i.e., “to conserve the biodiversity and natural
ecosystems within TFCAs, and to promote economic growth and development based on
sustainable use of their natural resources by local communities, with a particular
emphasis on ecotourism.”

11.     Key indicators and targets for the PDO were:
 3,500 local residents formally and informally employed in conservation and tourism
    in target districts;
 100,000 visitors and bed-nights in tourism facilities in the target districts;
 80% of tourism ventures in target districts have adopted a conforming District
    Tourism Master Plans (DTMP);
 US$2 million of new capital in investment in private tourism and/or conservation-
    related joint-ventures with communities in target districts; and
 Total annual revenues of US$0.85 million generated by targeted formal PAs.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
    approved)

12.     The GEO included in the PAD was “To increase the area, connectivity, and
effectiveness of biodiversity conservation in three TFCAs.” However, the objective stated
in the GEF Grant Agreement is identical to the PDO, i.e. “To achieve growth in
community-private sector led environmentally and socially sustainable tourism in
TFCAs.”

13.    Key end of Project indicators for the GEO were:
 3,400 km2 of new priority areas formally designated and managed for biodiversity
    conservation;

                                             3
   10% increase in bio indicator species (2 species/area) in formal PAs; and
   Less than 10% of area with agriculture, habitation or incompatible land use in all
    areas zoned for biodiversity conservation.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
    and reasons/justification

14.    The original PDO, GEO and Components remained unchanged throughout the life
of the Project. However, as part of the first restructuring (Level 2, August 2011), the
scope of each component was revised and the target values of five key indicators and
most intermediate indicators were revised to adjust to more realistic and measurable
values and implementation capacity (see further details in datasheet, and sections 1.9 and
2.2).

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

15.      The Project had direct and indirect beneficiaries. Among the direct beneficiaries
were the local households and communities living within the three supported TFCAs,
particularly within and in the buffer areas of the targeted PAs the Project’s revised target
for formal and informal employment generation in conservation and tourism in the target
districts (at least 2,000 local residents) was achieved. Local communities also benefited
from employment in civil works during Project implementation (such as construction of
infrastructure), as well as from technical training on horticulture, water management and
irrigation, conservation agriculture, carpentry, construction, electricity, financial
management and accounting. The formalization of community associations and the
community-private enterprises promoted by the Project have also strengthened local-level
communities’ and individuals’ capacity to undertake new businesses. Community
enterprise projects (e.g. chili production and marketing, horticulture, honey and
community lodges) also created jobs and generated meaningful revenue for local
communities. Other community projects had widespread benefits within the community,
such as boreholes in semi-arid Banhine and Zinave NPs areas. Communities around the
PAs likewise benefitted from higher fees collected by the PA administration, as 20% of
those fees were redistributed to them.

16.      Other direct beneficiaries included management and technical staff at the national
level (i.e., at MITUR headquarters) and at the level of the PAs who received training and
improved working conditions (infrastructure and equipment).

17.     Indirect beneficiaries included formal and informal business owners who
benefitted from the construction phase through temporary jobs and new business
opportunities (retailers), District management and staff, tourism industry in the PAs

                                             4
(particularly in Ponta do Ouro). Although difficult to assess the extent of these benefits,
indirect beneficiaries also included those households that benefitted from the increased
value of local environmental services, such as better preserved forests and water flows,
resulting from improved management of the TFCAs under the Project.


1.7 Original Components (as approved)

18.    The Transfrontier Conservation Areas and Tourism Development Project
(TFCATDP) is a US$35.1 million Project financed by an IDA Credit of US$ 21.4 million
equivalent, a US$10 million Global Environment Facility (GEF) Grant. and co-financing
from a US$3.72 million PHRD Grant, (100% allocated to Technical Assistance) Parallel
financing for management of targeted PAs was also provided to GOM by Peace Park
Foundation (PPF) and African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) in the amount of US$ 2.2
million.

Component 1: Strengthening Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework for TFCAs
($1.15 M) - IDA: $0.50 M; GEF: $0.65 M. Component 1 was designed to build on the
achievements of the first phase and further strengthen the enabling environment for
TFCAs by helping create the policy, legal and institutional framework for GOM to
improve regional collaboration for management of transfrontier resources; promote
interagency collaboration and vertical linkages between central and local governments;
build the capacity of public sector institutions at all levels and communities to manage
biodiversity and natural resources; and form productive partnerships with the private
sector. Community land and natural resource ownership and use rights were also to be
addressed.

Component 2: Integrated District Development Planning ($0.48 M) - IDA: $0.29 M;
PHRD $0.19 M. This component was aimed at piloting a proactive approach to
integrated planning in two of the Project’s 7 to 9 districts, through the development of the
Integrated District Development Plans (IDDPs) which focused on defining and
implementing a series of practical steps to ensure that biodiversity and natural resource-
based assets are mainstreamed into District Development Plans (DDPs). This component
was divided into two Subcomponents: (2.1) National capacity building and stocktaking,
and (2.2) Production, adoption and dissemination of the two IDDPs.

Component 3: Community and Private Sector-Led Tourism Development ($12.96 M) -
IDA: $5.47 M; GEF: $4.08 M; PHRD $3.30 M. Component 3 was designed to develop
the capacity of the tourism sector (government, local communities and the private sector)
to participate in the preparation and implementation of tourism master plans for key
tourism districts (Matutuine and Vilankulos). This component intended to support
MITUR to establish a comprehensive and clearly defined set of procedures to implement
the process for land concessions, from land identification to on-the-ground investment. It
was also intended to support MITUR to implement legislation allowing it to ‘recuperate’
land previously allocated for tourism investment where the investment period had expired,
so that this land could be marketed to appropriate investors. This component was also
divided into two subcomponents: (3.1) building capacities in National Tourism

                                             5
Directorate (DINATUR), Elephant Coast Development Agency (ECDA) and targeted
private sector and community associations to unlock opportunities for sustainable tourism
investment and growth; and (3.2) Community-led conservation and tourism development
through the establishment of a Community Equity Fund (CEF).

Component 4: Protected Areas management ($16.64 M); IDA: $8.46 M; GEF: $5.27
M; PPF and AWF: $2.20 M. This component aimed to support the identification,
monitoring and protection of the most significant and vulnerable biodiversity assets
within the three TFCAs, through the establishment/rehabilitation and management of a
network of National Parks and Reserves under the direct administration of the National
Directorate of Conservation Areas (DNAC). This was intended to initiate a long-term
process of major improvement of the Maputo Special Reserve (MSR), including
gazetting the Futi corridor and a new marine reserve; and supporting BNP and CNR. In
addition, modest support would be provided to Limpopo National Park to supplement
current PPF, KfW and AFD efforts and to ZNP.

Component 5: Project Management, Communications, and Monitoring and Evaluation
($4.90 M) - IDA: $4.68 M; PHRD $0.22 M. This component would finance Project
management costs, including procurement, accounting and monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) activities. This included strengthening the capacity of the TFCA Unit to
coordinate the TFCA program by recruiting additional long-term staff for the Unit, as
well as field-based TFCA Coordinators to support decentralization of planning and
implementation to the Provincial and local levels. The component included: (i) an M&E
system to track and assess Project implementation and impacts; (ii) a system for adaptive
management based on the M&E information generated; and (iii) an information system
and communications strategy to ensure timely flow of accurate information among the
implementing agencies, and to increase awareness and understanding about ecosystem
management and TFCAs nationally, regionally and worldwide.


1.8 Revised Components

19.     The Project components remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project.
Their scope was revised after the MTR, and the targets for five key indicators and most
intermediate indicators were adjusted upwards or downwards to more realistic values and
the borrower’s implementation capacity (see details in the datasheet, and sections 1.9 and
2.2).


1.9 Other significant changes

20.      The Project was declared effective on April 13, 2006. It was approved to be
implemented for a period of 7.5 years and was scheduled to close on June 30, 2013. In
March 2013, the Project was extended through June 30, 2014 to allow for completion of
ongoing construction contracts and community subprojects, as well as to ensure overlap
with preparation of the third phase of the TFCA Program (the MozBio Project). As a
result, actual Project implementation was 8.5 years.

                                            6
21.     As mentioned in Section 1.4, the MTR resulted in a number of changes to the
scope of the components and subcomponents. Although none had significant impacts on
Project outcomes, such changes were needed to revise some of the initial targets.
Component revisions were aimed at addressing implementation problems identified by
the MTR regarding: (i) GOM decisions to drop some of the institutional development
instruments envisaged under Component 1, particularly the Integrated District
Development Plans, for which an alternative funding source was found; (ii) delayed and
under-budgeted infrastructure construction due to problems to retain
contractors/engineers qualified and willing to operate in the remote areas of the Project;
and (iii) limited engagement of communities, resulting mainly from complex operating
procedures for the “Community Equity Fund”, as well as the PIU’s lack of expertise in
community development. Original and revised PDO and GEO indicators can be
summarized as follows:

22.     In addition, with greater emphasis given to community development and
infrastructure following the MTR, it was necessary to reallocate funds between
disbursement categories of both the IDA credit and the GEF grant.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23.     The PDO and associated GEO were defined based on the underlying assumption
that nature-based tourism could contribute to economic growth and poverty relief in
adjacent rural areas while also promoting biodiversity conservation. As such, the main
strategic directions were to: (i) leverage private sector investment in association with
conservation activities; (ii) develop tourism-related opportunities for greater community
participation in rural economies, particularly those associated with protected areas; (iii)
strengthen conservation areas and institutions; and (iv)expand and connect conservation
areas to increase opportunities for tourism.

24.    Building on the experience and lessons learned from the previous TFCAPISP, the
design process of TFCADP was largely responsive to GOM’s development priorities, and
recognized the need for five interrelated and co-dependent pillars linked to the Strategic
Plan for Development of Tourism (SPDT):

      Strengthen capacity and institutional arrangements for conservation from
       community scale upwards to the international scale of the TFCAs, supported by
       Component 1: Strengthening Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework for
       TFCAs;
      Incorporate conservation and protected areas into planning processes at local,
       district and national levels, supported by Component 2: Integrated District
       Development Planning;
      Integrate conservation into the tourism economy to provide opportunities for
       investors and local communities, supported by Component 3: Community and
       Private Sector-Led Tourism Development;
      Introduce a professional approach to conservation management, supported by
       Component 4: Protected Areas Management; and
      Improve the capacity of the TFCA Unit so that it performs its facilitation function
       efficiently and effectively through Component 5: Project Management,
       Communications, and Monitoring and Evaluation.

25.     The components were designed as an integrated set to achieve both the PDO and
the GEO while also seeking to address capacity constraints within the MITUR / TFCA
Unit and GOM. Both IDA and GEF resources were allocated to finance tourism-related
infrastructure improvements in the Protected Areas (PAs), for example. The envisaged
duration, resources and approach were considered reasonable to achieve the desired
outcomes. Together, the five components present a logical and comprehensive approach
to meeting the objectives of the SPDT. However, Project design was lengthy (2.5 years)

                                            8
and complex given the scope and interdependence of the components, and, in retrospect,
underestimated the capacity limitations of the TFCA Unit and GOM in general, the
difficult conditions the Project started from, and that some of the variables to achieve the
PDO were outside the scope of the Project, such as the overall tourism demand for
Mozambique destination and infrastructure development outside the PA to ensure access
to the PAs.


2.2 Implementation
26.     While initial Project implementation was relatively slow, it improved steadily as
procurement and financial management capacity was strengthened. During
Implementation Support, the likelihood that the Project would achieve its development
objective was consistently rated Satisfactory and implementation progress was
Moderately Satisfactory. However, at the time of the MTR (September 2009) the Project
was experiencing considerable implementation delays resulting from: (i) infrastructure
construction which was under-budgeted and suffering delays due to difficulties to retain
suitably qualified contractors/engineers capable and willing to operate in the remote
Project areas; and (ii) very limited progress with the community support activities, due to
complex operational procedures to implement the CEF and lack of appropriate capacity
within the Project team.

27.    The comprehensive MTR was conducted in two stages during the second
semester of 2009, and concluded on September 17, 2009. Its main conclusion was that:
“While tourism remains the economic driver on which the project is based, the project’s
main focus will be on product development through all facets of management of
Conservation Areas. This requires a stronger focus on protected area development
including community support and tourism through joint community-private investment in
tourism accommodations.” In line with this, the original targets for most key and
intermediate indicators were assessed as having been overly ambitious, and/or difficult to
measure, and were adjusted accordingly.

28.    In addition, Project-financed activities were revised, funds were reallocated
between disbursement categories, and arrangements for Project implementation were
modified. The perceived high cost of Project management relative to product delivery
was addressed by closing the three regional offices (in Xai Xai, Chimoio and Matundo), a
reduction of staff and the implementation of tighter control systems on operating costs
and travel. To achieve greater focus of resource allocation and improve return on
investment the following measures were taken: (i) financing for infrastructure
development was concentrated in the protected areas most likely to deliver economic or
conservation benefits, namely the Maputo Special Reserve, the Zinave National Park and
the Chimanimani Reserve; (ii) the proposed pilot Integrated District Development Plan
in Vilanculos District was cancelled, as it was financed by other sources; and (iii) the
capacity of the Project team to support infrastructure development in PAs and
community subprojects in and around protected areas was strengthened.




                                             9
29.     Regarding Project activities supporting communities, the MTR observed that,
although all service providers (Community Brokers) had been recruited, implementation
was not proceeding as planned. Population surveys had been conducted for each PA;
however, each site presented different, often modest, approaches to organizing
communities, socioeconomic surveys, if done, were superficial, awareness building was
very limited in coverage, and community plans had not been developed. As a result, there
was a delay in approving subprojects. The main reasons identified were related to
challenges in the design of the subproject cycle, the inadequate approach and capacity of
the Community Brokers, the operational instruments used (Process Framework and CEF
Manual) and the structure of the TFCA Unit. Corrective measures were identified by the
MTR for each of these issues and implemented during the remainder of the Project.

30.     Revised Costs – Project costs were revised at the MTR. The changes in cost
allocation appear in the table below. As most tourism and community activities that
occur in Protected Areas were moved to Component 4, the substantial decrease in
Component 3 is accompanied by a parallel increase in Component 4.

31.     From MTR to closing (4.5 years), the Project was implemented in accordance
with the above-described modifications formalized in the restructuring. Overall Project
implementation improved considerably, although the implementation period was longer
than originally scheduled. Procurement and Financial Management capacity were
strengthened, and Project instruments were improved. In particular, the scope of support
to communities was improved through the revision of the Process Framework and the
CEF Manual to facilitate subproject selection and implementation. In addition, the
Project management team was reorganized to improve delivery and efficiency while
adding new critical skills such as community extension and infrastructure specialists.



                                            10
2.2 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     The M&E framework adopted by the TFCA Unit was comprehensive, well
operationalized, and fully consistent with the PAD in terms of PDO, GEO and
Intermediate indicators and targets. The Results Framework was mainly founded on the
assumption that the Project would attract investment in community-based tourism
enterprises, although, in retrospect, the targets were not always realistic. Identified
shortcomings included: (i) the PDO indicators were not sufficiently linked to the PDO
(GEO indicators were better aligned); and (ii) the framework was comprised of an
excessive number of indicators (5 PDO, 3 GEO, and 16 Intermediate).

33.     In terms of utilization, the information generated by the M&E system was
consistently used for progress reporting by the TFCA Unit and for Bank supervision,
although the collection and processing of data for several of the indicators was costly,
time-consuming and, in some cases, obtained from unofficial sources.

34.     Complementing the indicator-based M&E framework, a Management
Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) was adopted to assess the overall performance of
all targeted PAs. It was implemented and reported in a consistent manner, as well as
utilized by Bank supervision to assess progress by individual PAs. Its importance lied as
much in its consistent application as in the scores achieved, but more particularly, in the
management response to the score. Performance-based management systems were also
adopted towards the end of the Project to assess performance of the TFCA Unit, and are
expected to be further strengthened and expanded under the MozBio Project, thus
contributing to the system’s institutionalization and long-term sustainability.


2.3 Fiduciary and Safeguard Compliance

Procurement
35.      An assessment of the TFCA’s procurement capacity was carried out during
appraisal, and it was concluded that the future implementing unit would require
additional support in procurement, which took them time to implement. Thus, during the
initial stages of implementation the Project unit experienced difficulties in areas such as
procurement planning, record keeping, contract management, which led to delays in
payments of the suppliers, contractors and consultants.

36.     The implementation of the Project was challenging due to its nature, complexity
and specificity, including: (i) the existence of many small transactions, requiring
involvement of several stakeholders in the process; (ii) implementation in remote areas
with difficult access; and (iii) procurement staff with limited exposure to complex
projects and inadequate for dealing with technical aspects such as the drafting of TORs,
specifications, evaluations reports, etc.

37.    Over time, with dedication and interest of the TFCA Unit’s procurement officer
and the enhancement of the procurement function by an additional procurement officer
and a procurement assistant, implementation showed considerable improvement.

                                            11
Procurement training, procurement clinics, and hands-on support provided by the Bank
also contributed to this positive turn of events.

38.     During the life of the Project, several post procurement reviews were conducted
by the Bank and none uncovered any misprocurement. Nevertheless, some minor
deviations were found. As a result, the Project was rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
during at least four consecutive years. Mitigation measures, action plans with the
recommendations were prepared after each post procurement review exercise and closely
monitored. Due to implementation of these recommendations, the Project was upgraded
to Satisfactory (S) following the post-procurement review of April 2013 and continued to
be so rated until the closing date.


Financial Management
39.     The Project performed well with regards to financial management and fiduciary
aspects, and no significant internal controls issues identified. It was adequately staffed
throughout its life with experienced and qualified FM personnel, and all the required
quarterly un-audited reports, as well as audited reports were generally submitted in a
timely fashion. Audit reports under the operation had unqualified (clean) opinions.
Overall, the Project had a satisfactory financial management performance.


Environmental safeguards
40.      The World Bank’s safeguard policies triggered by this Project were OP 4.01
Environmental Assessment; OP 4.04 Natural Habitats; OP 4.09 (Pest Management), OP
4.36 Forestry, and OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement; Three stand-alone safeguards
instruments were prepared by the Borrower: (i) an Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF); (ii) a Policy Framework to deal with issues related to
restriction of access in PAs; and (iii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). According
to OP 4.01, TFCATDP was categorized as “B” - partial assessment - since its potential
negative impacts were localized, site- specific and thus easily manageable. The Project
was also required to be in compliance with applicable national environmental regulations,
which are generally aligned in principle and objectives with the World Bank’s safeguard
policies.

41.     The Project has shown a good record of compliance with both Mozambique’s
environmental requirements and the Bank’s safeguards policies. Under Mozambique’s
requirements, those sub-projects which entailed construction activities for tourism
infrastructure, such as the community lodges, required Environmental and Social Impact
Assessments (ESIAs) to be prepared and consulted with local stakeholders, which was
adequately carried out by the TFCA Unit. The environmental and social impact
assessment studies were successfully conducted by specialized consultants, and disclosed
following clearance by the Ministry of Environmental Coordination (MICOA) and the
Bank. Reporting on the status of the implementation of the Environmental and Social
Management Plans (ESMPs) as per MICOA’s requirements and the approved ESMF,
however, should have been carried out more systematically. Overall, therefore,

                                           12
implementation of environmental safeguards within the Project was moderately
satisfactory.


Social Safeguards
42.      As stated above, two social safeguards instruments were prepared: a Policy
Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)1. To mitigate potential impacts
caused by potential loss of access to livelihoods in the targeted PAs, Participatory
Community Action Plans (PCAPs) were prepared in accordance with the principles and
prerogatives of the Process Framework for all targeted PAs. The PCAPs were
implemented through Community Management Committees. Several capacity building
activities, such as training and community participation, were also carried for sub-
projects financed by the Community Equity Facility (CEF), benefiting households and
communities within the TFCAs.

43.     Despite the lack of a social scientist in the TFCA Unit during Project preparation
and the early years of Project implementation, the Bank was able to encourage the
Government to ensure due consideration of social issues during Project design and
implementation. Consultative and inclusive community consultation and participation
workshops were organized during Project preparation, and most of the concerns of
project-affected communities, including those from women and youth, were retrofitted in
the Project design documents. Overall, social safeguards implementation was Moderately
Satisfactory (see footnote 1).

2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
44.    The third phase of the TFCA program, the Mozambique Conservation Areas for
Biodiversity and Sustainable Development Project (MozBio 1), has been approved by the
Board and is expected to start in early 2015, six months after the closing of TFCA II,


1 Involuntary resettlement within the targeted TFCAs was not an objective of the TFCATDP, and no project
funding was allocated to resettlement activities. However, the World Bank agreed to provide advisory
services to involuntary resettlement activities funded by the KfW in Limpopo National Park, but outside of
TFCATDP implementation and Bank supervision. Since the Bank was collaborating with other
development partners in support of the TFCA Program, it agreed to supervise this resettlement as a way of
helping to build capacity within the Government and of sharing best practices with the partners through the
application of Bank’s safeguards policies. The implementation of both RAPs faced some issues, mainly due
to (i) the Government’s lack of knowledge and commitment; (ii) KfW’s lack of knowledge on Safeguards,
particularly on Involuntary Resettlement, plus insufficient budget for implementation; and, (iii) on the
Bank’s side, the lack of a local Social Scientist, knowledgeable on Social Safeguards to guide the process.
The involvement of Social Scientist, especially from TFCA II as well as the classification of TFCA II in the
list of Corporate Risk Projects in 2011 helped to resolve the situation on the ground. The Bank’s Social
Safeguards Specialists offered a series of safeguards training workshops as well as on-the-job training to
MITUR, Park wardens, the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) and local officials on the
appropriate ways of implementing resettlement operations. These efforts were further expanded with joint
supervision missions (3 times per year) encouraged by the Bank that involved all interested parties (The
Government, KfW and the Bank) and supporting agencies (INGC, and Local Administrations). The Plans
were implemented with enthusiasm and commitment was shown by the local government in collaboration
with other relevant actors which ensured that the livelihoods of affected communities would likely be
improved once the process has been duly concluded.

                                                    13
which will ensure a smooth transition between TFCA II and MozBio 1. MozBio 1 was
structured as a four-year Project, and is part of a ‘Series of Projects’ (SoP) approach in
support of the recently-prepared national MozBio Program, which will replace and scale
up the TFCA Program in the years to come. TFCA II financed some of the preparatory
work for MozBio, and ensured continuation of the project management/fiduciary team
that will also be in charge of implementing MozBio, a significant asset in the face of the
capacity constraints of the National Agency for Conservation Areas (ANAC), which was
established with support from the present Project. In the context of the long-term support
sustaining the TFCA program, post-completion aspects of the TFCATDP, including
infrastructure operation and maintenance (O&M) and consolidation of technical,
operational and institutional achievements, will be maintained and further developed by
the follow-up operation.

45.    The MozBio 1 Project is expected to consolidate and scale up the achievements of
the TFCA Program by continuing to address the threats to conservation and to help
reduce poverty among the rural population within and around PAs, including through
tourism promotion. Key lessons from the TFCATDP have also been incorporated in
Mozbio 1’s design. The first is that Mozbio 1 was structured as an SoP, which means that
the World Bank recognizes the need to maintain its long-term engagement in the
conservation agenda in order to ensure sustainable outcomes. MozBio 1 will also
emphasize consolidation of the entities established with support from TFCATDP –
ANAC and BIOFUND – so as to ensure a solid foundation for conservation in the
country. In addition, MozBio has assessed the tourism potential of the PA network in
Mozambique, and will targeted tourism development in those areas considered to have
highest tourism potential, particularly the marine PAs. Annex 5 presents further
information on the MozBio 1 operation, particularly how it fits in the long-term WB
engagement in conservation in the Project area.

46.     Engaging communities in the sustainable use of natural resources within and
around CAs in Mozbio 1 is in line with two lessons learned from TFCATDP: (i) nature-
based tourism cannot be achieved before tourism assets, namely, well established and
managed wildlife and infrastructure in the Conservation Areas is developed; and (ii) a
broader array of integrated conservation development activities, particularly those related
to sustainable natural resource management (such as conservation and climate-smart
agriculture, community forestry and fisheries, and appropriate wildlife management)
should be promoted among local communities surrounding the targeted PAs. As the
enabling conditions to promote community tourism facilities is not yet present in
Mozambique (including an adequate level of education of targeted communities, tourism
potential in the short-term in the terrestrial CAs), MozBio 1 will promote a broader menu
of integrated conservation-development interventions. It will also seek to improve
implementation of the existing benefit sharing mechanism of PA revenues with local
communities, as another way to ensure that they benefits from conservation.

47.    Another important lesson derived from the present Project that has been
incorporated into MozBio is the adoption of a landscape approach to PA management. In
two of the targeted PAs by MozBio, sustainable landscape pilot projects will be launched

                                            14
whereby support to CA management will be coupled with natural resource management
(NRM) activities (i.e., agriculture, forestry, fisheries, wildlife management) outside the
PAs, in the Districts wherein the PAs are found. This is expected to reduce the threats to
the PA integrity including deforestation and associated carbon emissions and biodiversity
loss.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

48.     The objectives of the TFCA program (and the TFCATDP Project) remain highly
relevant to the objectives of GEF’s Biodiversity Conservation Focal Area. They also
support one of the major pillars (Competitiveness and Employment) of the Bank’s 2012-
2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mozambique, which specifically highlights
increased employment and growth in the mostly nature-based tourism sector. In terms of
the GEO, the Project was aligned with the renewed emphasis at the World Bank (and
internationally) on: (i) wildlife management in the face of the poaching crisis in southern
Africa; and (ii) climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly with respect to
rural land use sector (forestry and agriculture). The vision promoted by the Project,
namely linking NRM to economic growth and to rural poverty reduction through nature-
based tourism development, remains highly relevant to the World Bank’s current NRM
strategy. The relevance of design was also substantial, as the Project built on lessons from
the TFCAPISP and drew on important analytical work (McEwen, D. 2005. Study of the
Economic Potential of Tourism in Mozambique: Final Report, Ministry of Tourism,
Maputo). The components design and results framework were well aligned, although
some targets were high, and adjustments were subsequently made. Implementation was
led by the Ministry of Tourism, in partnership with other entities actively engaged in the
management of PAs, including NGOs. The MTR introduced changes to the Project which
resulted in tangible improvement in performance and results. Thus, relevance of
implementation is also deemed substantial.

49.    Implementation of the broader TFCA Program remains a top priority within
GOM’s investment framework, as demonstrated by the recent regulatory and institutional
reforms (including the new conservation law, the establishment and strengthening of
ANAC, the creation of new PAs (such as Primeiras e Segundas in Northern Mozambique
and the Magoe National Park in Tete province), bi-lateral agreements with South Africa
to combat wildlife poaching), and the increasing technical and financial support being
provided for conservation initiatives by several bilateral and multilateral development
partners, including the Bank and GEF through the recently approved MozBio 1 Project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
    Objectives

The TFCATDP Project Development Objective (PDO) was to: achieve growth in
community-private sector led environmentally and socially sustainable tourism in
TFCAs (Substantially achieved).

50.     As demonstrated by one of the key performance indicators - number of visitors in
tourism facilities in the target districts - there was considerable growth in private sector-
led tourism in the three TFCAs 2 (a total of 196,149 bed nights in 2013 compared to
66,182 in 2006, an increase of almost 200%). A large proportion of this tourism was
concentrated in the beach destination of Ponta do Ouro, located within the Lubombo
TFCA, to which the Project made relevant contributions through the improved tourism-
related policy and regulatory instruments developed by the Project (Components 1 and 2)
and, most importantly, by establishing the Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve.

51.      Growth in terrestrial nature-based tourism in PAs within the TFCAs was lower
than originally expected but still positive (a total of 10,811 bed-nights in 2013,
representing a growth of 32% compared to 2008) This was largely due to the fact that the
basic assets required for tourism development in PAs (park infrastructure, lodging
facilities and, above all, wildlife populations) were slower to develop than anticipated in
Project design. Project design was premised on the assumption that the concept of bush-
beach tourist routes would gain traction within GOM and would become a priority for
investment and marketing. This did not happen as quickly as anticipated. Without greater
and more timely investment in infrastructure required to service tourism and encourage
investment at bush locations, inland lodges have not yet been able to compete with
coastal facilities, particularly when wildlife populations still need to be rehabilitated, a
process that also requires time. In any case, the somewhat modest expansion of tourism
within the PAs has been facilitated by the construction of lodges and tent camps under
rigorous environmental standards and the active participation of private sector
entrepreneurs in partnership with local communities. This growth was instrumental for
achievement of the revised targets for the remaining key indicators of the PDO
(leveraging of investments, community employment and PA revenue). It should be noted
that the growth in tourism in the targeted TFCAs is, to a large extent, attributable to the
Project, since it created the conditions (infrastructure, tourism facilities, better managed
wildlife, etc.) to attract tourists. An evidence of this is that the number of tourists has
increased more significantly in some of the TFCAs (particularly the Lubombos TFCA)
than the national average. A detailed analysis of the specific contributions of each Project
component to the achievement of the PDO is provided in Annex 2.




2
 Most data for this section comes from the Annual Project Implementation Reports and from the
Borrower’s Completion Report, prepared by the TFCA Unit. When a different source is cited, it is
mentioned in the main text.


                                              16
52.     In this context, six new tourism ventures were implemented, but have not yet
realized their potential in terms of visitors and income. At the present, Mozambique is
still widely perceived, particularly by neighbouring South Africans, as well as by national
tourists, as a ‘beach tourist destination’ rather than as a ‘nature or wildlife destination’.
This was acknowledged at Project appraisal. Although not explicitly stated, the
assumption was that enhanced ‘bush’ tourist operations would draw on tourists whose
principal motivation was to spend time at the coast, once wildlife quality and the
hospitality experience offered could compete with other locations.

53.     The Project has contributed to employment of local residents. Over 2,000 have
been employed by the activities financed by the Community Equity Facility (CEF),
including community lodges (the CEF-financed activities are detailed in Annex 2). This
figure does not include tourism-related employment by private sector/community
business due to the lack of available data. Hence, this figure understates actual direct and
indirect tourism-related employment in the target districts.

54.     Despite the slow start, the end-of-Project target of leveraging US$ 2 million in
private investments was exceeded by US$ 1.2 million. A single private investment, the
Chemucane Lodge (opening December 2014 in MSP/Libombo) contributed US$ 2
million (or 82% of the total), enough to meet the target by itself. Together with two other
investments (Covane Lodge in Limpopo) and Ndzou Lodge in CNR) these three facilities
contributed almost 96% of the total funds leveraged. Excluding investment in lodges, the
Project invested US$ 794,695 in eighteen community projects that directly benefited
local communities (including Chikwidzi Lodge). The ex-post analysis of costs and
benefits (Rylance, 2014) shows that private sector investments did not start until the
fourth year of the Project (2009), and reached US$ 2,447,143 by the end of 2013.
Funding provided by the Project to CEF initiatives totalled US$ 2.1 million (52% of the
PAD estimate); while the amount disbursed for technical assistance (Community
Brokers) was US$ 1.4 million. Despite these shortfalls, as the main indicators for
achievement were measured in terms of the amount of funds leveraged and local
residents employed (proxies to community revenue), the revised end-of-project (EOP)
target was exceeded.

55.    In terms of revenues generated by the PAs through visitor fees, annual revenue
doubled from US$ 187,400 in 2006 to US$ 373,304 in 2012 and increased by a further
14% in 2013 (US$ 426,977). Of the total, LNP raised 68 %, MSR 31% with less than 1%
from BNP, CNR, and ZNP. The requirement for visitors transiting LNP to overnight in
the park helped increase revenue generation but, on the other hand, also provided a
disincentive to use this route to the coast. This, together with a general decline in tourists
to neighbouring Kruger National Park in South Africa contributed to the slowing of
growth in revenue generated by LNP between 2012 and 2013. This contrasts with MSR,
where revenue increased by 53% between 2012 and 2013, providing justification for the
decision made to invest additional resources in improving the MSR, establishing Ponta
do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve, and developing tourist facilities and concessions in this
TFCA.


                                             17
56.     The Project also achieved major policy and institutional accomplishments,
including the approval of a new Conservation Policy and Conservation Areas Law and
establishment of the Administração Nacional das Areas de Conservação (ANAC) as an
autonomous public agency tasked with the management of all Conservation Areas. New
Protected Areas, such as the Ponta do Ouro Marine Reserve and the Futi Corridor (part of
the Maputo Special Reserve) were also established by GoM with Project support.
MITUR together with civil society and private sector stakeholders, and with support from
the TFCATDP, also facilitated the establishment of the Foundation for the Conservation
of Biodiversity (Biofund), which will play a significant role in raising funds to support
the long-term management of Mozambique's PAs through an endowment fund, and other
mechanisms such as biodiversity offsets. The Project also supported the signature of three
international treaties for cooperation on TFCA management. These institutional
accomplishments lay the foundations for future conservation and nature-based tourism
promotion.

57.     In summary, despite the post-war context, the poor conditions of the PAs and the
limited initial basis for business development, the Project put in place much needed
infrastructure and equipment in the targeted PAs, established management processes at
both national and PA levels and promoted innovative partnerships with private sector,
other development agencies, NGOs and communities, hence significantly contributing to
the conservation and tourism agendas in Mozambique.

The Global Environment Objective (GEO) was to “Increase the area, connectivity,
and effectiveness of biodiversity conservation in three TFCAs.” (Substantially
achieved)

58.    The Project substantially achieved the GEO by providing significant Project
resources, from both IDA and GEF, which resulted in:
     Increased area under conservation, including boundary realignment and
       establishing a new marine reserve (Ponto do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve), the
       first marine transfrontier conservation area (TFCA) in Africa, the Ponta do Ouro-
       Kosi Bay TFCA, part of the Lumbombos TFCA.
     Improved effectiveness of conservation through institutional reform,
       infrastructure and implementation of park management plans; and as evidenced in
       the increased socres in the “Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT)”.
     Increased wildlife populations and diversity, including presence of species (such
       as giraffes in the Zinave National Park) long absent from the country.
     Better management processes and practices, and increased professionalism in PA
       management.
     Increased area under conservation management, and improved operational,
       managerial and conservation-related infrastructure and equipment;
     Increased connectivity, particularly through the establishment of the Ponto do
       Ouro Partial Marine reserve, and of the Futi Corridor, terrestrial corridor part of
       the Maputo Special Reserve (MSP), which connects the MSP to the Tembe
       National Park in South Africa and allows movement of elephants and of other
       species.

                                           18
59.     More specifically, the area under formal conservation increased by 1,910 Km2 of
which 679 Km2 was due to establishment of the Ponta do Ouro Marine Reserve and the
remainder by realigning the boundaries of three PAs within the Limpopo TFCA (ZNP,
BNP and CNR). Regarding encroachment, remote sensing was used to map land use and
determine incompatibility with biodiversity conservation. The analysis of the percentage
of land use within each of the protected areas in 2005, 2007 and 2012 showed that
inappropriate land use accounted for less than 3.5% of the total land area, well below the
target of 10%.

60.     Regarding the goal of increasing wildlife populations in the PAs, the Project
financed a comprehensive reintroduction program which contributed to their numbers and
diversity having exceeded the targets in all of the PAs. The counts indicate that
populations exceeded targets in all cases, and in some cases by large margins (see Table
in Annex 2). This likewise reflects improved control over poaching as Project records
show that patrols have become more formal and frequent, and have perhaps also led to
modifications in community hunting behaviour.

61.     In terms of improving the management of the PAs within the targeted TFCAs
(Zinave NP, Banhine NP, Limpopo NP, Maputo Special Reserve and Chimanimani
Nature Reserve), the Project supported a number of investments in infrastructure,
equipment and capacity building (see the table in Annex 2), including: (i) improvement
of park design and planning (Management Plans); (ii) increasing the area under
protection; (iii) building or rehabilitating essential infrastructure; (iv) procurement of
essential equipment required for management; (v) deployment and capacity building of
staff; and (vi) improvement of communication and information. This, together with the
substantial increase in wildlife populations achieved through introductions, contributed to
the development of the assets, namely, well managed wildlife and infrastructure in the
PAs required for the establishment of a sustainable nature-based tourism industry.

62.   In addition, through the achievements of Component 1 (Strengthening Policy,
Legal and Institutional Framework for TFCAs) and Component 4 (Protected Areas
Management), the Project contributed to the long-term sustainability of the GEO by:

   Improving the institutional foundations for conservation by supporting the drafting
    and adoption of a new Conservation Policy and Conservation Law;
   Establishing the new autonomous conservation agency (ANAC) and, together with
    civil society and private sector stakeholders, facilitating the establishment of the
    Foundation for the Conservation of Biodiversity (Biofund);
   Reducing the potential for adverse impacts on protected areas from local communities
    by providing access to resources (particularly water) outside the PAs, and by
    realigning park PAs to reduce the population living within some of them;


                                            19
63.      The adoption of the Conservation Law together with the establishment of ANAC
and Biofund represent highly relevant instruments developed with Project support, as
they provide the legal and institutional framework for the long-term management and
sustainability of the PA network. Both institutions create an enabling environment to
attract further private investments in or around the parks and reserves, thus strengthening
the much needed tourism infrastructure in the country's PAs.

64.     In assessing TFCATDP’s achievements, it is also important to analyse the PDO
and GEO both in the context of the Project’s contribution to the longer-term objectives of
the TFCA Program, of which the Project constituted the second phase, specifically: (i)
the conservation of biodiversity and natural ecosystems within a number of large Trans-
frontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs); and (ii) economic development within these areas
based on sustainable use of their natural resources by local communities. Concerning the
Program’s objective 1, the substantial achievement of the GEO discussed above attests to
the Project’s contribution to the conservation of biodiversity in TFCAs. In turn, the
moderately satisfactory achievement of the PDO, also discussed above, attests to the
Project’s contribution to the TFCA Program’s objective 2.


3.3 Efficiency

65.    The Project achieved the following benefit streams: (i) additional employment in
tourism and conservation; (ii) additional income for previously unemployed local
residents; (iii) additional visitation to TFCAs and money spent by tourists in the local
economies; (iv) additional investment from the private sector and NGOs; and (v)
additional government revenues from tourism entrance fees. The value of these streams
throughout the Project period is displayed below:

  67.    The Project was economically desirable with returns above the 12% threshold,
  notwithstanding the factors that delayed and constrained progress of the Project and even
  with the assumptions and uncertainties applied in the analysis (see Annex 3). Although
  no economic analysis was conducted at appraisal, the ex-post analysis estimates an
  Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 17.84% and a Net Present Value (NPV) equal to US$
  2,205,726 (at a 10% discount rate). If the benefits after year 8 were taken into account,
  these values would be even higher. Thus, efficiency is assessed to be substantial.


  3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

  Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

  68.    Overall, the TFCATDP reached satisfactory levels of achievement in relation to
  the PDO and substantially achieved the GEO, as measured by the revised targets of the
  key performance and intermediate indicators, as well as, and perhaps more importantly

                                                       21
for the longer run, by the tangible strengthening of the institutional and regulatory
framework supporting the country’s PA system. Furthermore, the Project’s PDO and
GEO remain highly relevant to the conservation and tourism development priorities of
MITUR, as well as within the broader development priorities of GOM and the Bank’s
current CPS with Mozambique. The Project also shows satisfactory levels of efficiency
based on the positive net economic benefit flows resulting from Project interventions.
The contribution of the Project to the long-term objectives of the TFCA program has
been significant, both in terms of providing valuable lessons and establishing more
favourable conditions for the implementation of the follow-on MozBio Program.

69.     In spite of these achievements, the Project was affected by a number of design
shortcomings and implementation delays that affect the overall assessment of outcomes,
particularly in relation to a number of the original indicator targets, which, by the time of
the Mid-Term Review had been recognized by both the Bank and the Borrower as having
been too optimistic. In addition, it was also acknowledged at that time that insufficient
attention had been devoted to human resource development of PIU and MITUR staff, and
that higher level political support to the Project objectives was needed to ensure PDO
achievement. These issues justify an MU rating for the Project outcomes prior to the
MTR. However, the shortcomings were identified during the MTR, remedial actions
proposed and immediately adopted by the PIU.

70.     Consistent with OPCS Guidelines, the overall outcome rating of the Project has
been determined using the evaluation methodology which takes into account the original
and formally revised targets, weighing pre- and post-revision performance by the share of
actual disbursements before and after the restructuring.

*Combined IDA Credit, GEF Grant and PHRD disbursements at restructuring

71.     The team considers the overall outcomes as Moderately Satisfactory, given the
significant contributions made by the Project to meet the PDO and the fact that the GEO
was substantially achieved, combined with a number of additional achievements,
including (i) significant contribution to strengthening the national institutional and legal
framework for conservation and nature-based tourism, including establishment of ANAC,
the new Conservation Policy and Law, the establishment of the innovative BIOFUND
(conservation trust fund); (ii) the significant contribution to the objectives of the longer-

                                             22
term “parent” program (the TFCA program), including the creation of new PAs
(including the Ponta do Ouro Marine Partial Reserve and the Futi Corridor, part of the
Maputo Special Reserve) and continued follow-up to international agreements; and (iii)
the fact that the GEO was implicitly part of the PDO as reflected in the significant
allocation of IDA resources to finance infrastructure improvements in the PAs. Finally,
Project restructuring occurred de facto right after the MTR, i.e. towards the end of 2009,
as the agreed changes were implemented by the PIU immediately, including changes to
PIU staffing, use of revised indicator targets, new work plan; which resulted in Project’s
disbursements to increase in the following years. Hence, it would have been more
appropriate to use disbursement rate at MTR, rather than at formal restructuring, in this
exercise, which would result in a higher final weighted value, further making the case for
an MS.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72.    Project design was premised on a need for socio-economic interventions and
while indicators such as revenue and numbers of beneficiaries were included in the
design, an assessment of the social consequences of the proposed interventions was not
made.

73.     The Project was designed to influence the wellbeing of communities living in or
adjacent to protected areas through the Community Equity Grant Facility (CEF) that
made available technical assistance and additional funds for specific subprojects initiated
by organized communities. To this effect, Project design included indicators of
employment and revenue flow to local people. Despite not been designed as a
Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) project, TFCATDP
included interventions to address some of the key processes in CBNRM, including
definition of land rights, development of conservation-based commercial enterprises,
support to investments in productive assets, and strengthening of community governance
through establishment of community associations. Due to the institutional, operational
and capacity challenges mentioned in previous sections, the implementation of these
relevant processes was not consistently applied during the life of the Project, nor in each
of the TFCAs.

74.     In terms of the Project’s impact on communities, the formalization of community
associations and the resulting opportunities for community-partner enterprises have been
foundational processes, but their impact has not yet been determined. Community
enterprise projects within MSR, CNR, LNP and BNP (e.g. chili production and
marketing, horticulture, honey and community lodges) nonetheless created jobs and
generated meaningful revenue generation for local communities.

75.     The Project was also structured on the assumption that improving the wellbeing of
the communities would reduce their dependence and negative impact on resources within
the protected areas, while encouraging support for conservation management. Although it
                                            23
could be assumed that interventions that improve employment, revenue accruing to
communities and access to basic services, such as potable water, would lead to
community support for conservation management and sustainable use of natural
resources, possible changes in beneficiary community attitudes towards conservation
and the impact of the Project on these premises were not assessed.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

76.     The intention of both GOM and the TFCATDP was to strengthen the public and
community-level institutional framework related to conservation in ways that would
support conservation-based tourism. In the case of conservation, the impact can be
measured by indicators such as the establishment of ANAC, the improvement of policies
and legislation (including the Conservation Policy and Conservation Law), and the
introduction of greater structure and discipline into PAs management. Undoubtedly, the
most significant institutional achievement for GOM was the establishment of ANAC. The
Project also supported the signature of three international treaties for cooperation on
TFCA management. The TFCATDP has likewise had a substantial impact on MITUR’s
capacity and competence, as well as on national awareness in relation to conservation and
its role in social and economic development. Although still somewhat limited, national
competence was also strengthened through training, including master’s degrees (3
persons), diplomas (one person) and attendance at wildlife management courses (13
persons).

77.     Regarding communities, Project achievements can be measured by the
establishment of community associations. While EOP targets were achieved (24
associations were established and supported), the effectiveness of these transformative
interventions in improving the performance of community associations individually and
in their interactions with the PAs has not been assessed. Creation of a Community
Enterprise Fund at the start of the Project signalled the strong intention that communities
should be targeted as beneficiaries. However, the lack of adequate operational
instruments and the difficulties in establishing community enterprises in locations
isolated from mainstream markets and where people have limited experience and
capacity were underestimated. The challenges were partially addressed in 2009 when a
community facilitator was appointed in the TFCA unit and a CEF Manual was prepared.
As a result, the process gained the desired momentum. In addition, community brokers
and commercial operations are required to link these enterprises with markets and to
leverage additional financial and human resources.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environmental
    Outcome

Risk: Moderate

78.      In terms of institutional sustainability, the Project supported the establishment of
two semi-autonomous institutions: the National Agency for Conservation Areas (ANAC)
and the BioFund. These institutions, particularly ANAC, will be in charge of managing
the PA network in Mozambique, often in partnership with other partners (including
NGOs). ANAC’s capacity is still weak given its recent creation, but has recently shown
sign of strengthening (including through the appointment of a highly-qualified General
Director). The consolidation of the culture of management by objectives and ongoing
evaluation promoted by the TFCATDP will further strengthen ANAC. Moreover, the
approval of the Conservation Policy and Conservation Law will further enhance the
institutional sustainability of Project outcomes, as it clarifies provides a strong legal
foundation for conservation management in Mozambique.

79.    The sustainability of the community activities promote varies. Some have shown
signs of financial sustainability, such as the chilli production project around the Maputo
Special Reserve which is now being scaled up to a larger area and to encompass more
households. The sustainability of the community lodges, such as the Covane lodge in
Limpopo and the Chemucane lodges, are difficult to assess at this stage, as it will depend
on the overall tourism industry and their capacity to attract tourists. It should be noted,
however, that tourist arrivals to Mozambique are projected to continue to increase at
about 8% annually to reach 3 million in 2017, and nature-based tourism is the sub-sector
growing at the fastest rate.

80.     Financing sustainability of the PAs is a major concern, not only in Mozambique
but throughout the developing world. While the PA network in Mozambique continues to
be critically under-funded by government sources, the prospects are better, as ANAC
places a strong emphasis on income-generating activities, including the promotion of
tourism (particularly in marine PAs) and sports hunting. In addition, the Biofund, which
was established with TFCATDP support, will have its endowment fund capitalized by
2015 (with funds from KfW and WB/GEF through the MozBio 1 Project), and will be
able to start disbursing funds to support the operational costs of PAs. It should be noted,
however, that the expectation that all PAs, regardless of their geographical location, can
become self-sustaining through tourism is unrealistic, at least in the medium term.

81.     On the other hand, emerging threats to PAs create new risks to the TFCATDP
outcomes. Two are particularly noteworthy: i) wildlife poaching in Mozambique,
particularly of rhino and elephants, is on the rise in Mozambique (and throughout
southern Africa); and ii) pressure for infrastructure development (including mining) in
PA areas is likely to increase given the economic boom the country is going through,
particularly in the extractive industry sector.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

                                             25
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.     The Bank participated actively and constructively in the design phase, ensuring
that the Project took account of Bank and national government priorities, and built on the
experience and lessons learned from the first phase of the TFCA Program (TFCAPISP).
Among the lessons included in the design were: i) integrating communities into the
design of the Project through sustainable projects with local benefits, such as private-
communities partnerships around tourism; ii) approaches to involving communities in
conservation and PA management, other than promotion of involuntary resettlement,
should be favoured.

83.      TFCATDP objectives were well aligned with the Government’s Tourism Policy
and Implementation Strategy (TPIS) and project components with the Strategic Plan for
Tourism Development in Mozambique (SPTD, 2004-2013). The Bank encouraged
modern business approaches through rigorous requirements for planning, monitoring,
assessment and reporting, and recognized the need and challenges (despite overlooking
some critical risks) of a multifaceted, complex Project. Overall, the components were
designed as an integrated set to achieve both the PDO and the GEO while attempting to
take into account capacity constraints within the TFCA and GOM. The design also
correctly addressed the different aspects of conservation and tourism promotion –
including strengthening institutions at national and local (District) level, building
infrastructure and providing operational support to PAs’ functioning, and promoting
community-led businesses around tourism and other types of revenue-generating
activities.

84.      By placing emphasis on the promotion of “community-private sector led
environmentally and socially sustainable tourism in TFCAs”, the Project promoted a
business-oriented mind set within ANAC, which resulted in the attracting of new
investments in PAs which would likely not have occurred otherwise. Some of the key
indicator targets were too ambitious and later required adjustments to make outputs
clearer and more realistic and no performance indicator related to the important legal and
institutional objectives promoted by the Project was included at the level of the PDO. The
Bank could have assessed more realistically the time requirement needed for improved
natural asset development, particularly the sustained restoration of wildlife, as
prerequisites for tourism development as well as the recipient’s poor implementation
capacity (i.e. training needs).

85.     The institutional arrangements proposed at entry were also adequate. A well-
staffed PIU within the Directorate of Protected Areas (DNAC) at the Ministry of Tourism
led the technical, fiduciary, safeguards and management aspects of the Project, with the
main office in Maputo and three regional offices (which were later closed to reduce
operational costs). The PIU capacity could have been strengthened earlier on to deal with

                                           26
community aspects, which led to delays in the implementation of the Community Equity
Facility activities.

86.    The safeguards instruments prepared, particularly the ESMF and Process
Framework, were adequate to the country’s and sector’s reality, which allowed their
smooth implementation during the Project. The M&E framework was also overall well-
designed, and encouraged systematic data collection not only within the PIU, but at
MITUR in general, including among the PA managers. In retrospect, the M&E
Framework could have been simpler, with fewer indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.     Bank supervision/implementation support missions were frequent, regular and
constructive, and actively contributed to improved Project performance. The Bank team
was able to identify issues readily, extract lessons from practice and propose solutions to
challenges proactively, including on technical, fiduciary and safeguard matters. A total of
33 formal and follow-up supervision missions were conducted during the life of the
Project, averaging four missions per year from effectiveness to closing. Aide Memoires
and internal reporting through ISRs were timely and detailed, with commendable efforts
to maintain all indicators adequately updated. The Bank team included most of the
expertise needed to supervise the Project. The initial lack of a Community Development
specialist was later remedied through the active participation of a Senior Social
Development Specialist. The frequent missions allowed the Bank to provide close
technical assistance to the Project team (and MITUR more broadly) on conservation,
tourism and natural resources management which contributed significantly to
strengthening capacity. The transaction costs from these frequent missions were
mentioned by the TFCA personnel as a downside. However, they also recognized that
this assistance was needed given the innovative nature of the Project and the low capacity
base that the Implementing Agency started from.

88.      The Project team demonstrated great adaptive management capacity at the Mid-
Term Review (September 2009), by thoroughly identifying the main challenges faced by
the Project and proposing effective remedial actions. The MTR confirmed overall Project
design, and identified changes to the results framework needed to improve the realism
and measurability of indicators. The MTR also proposed institutional organizational
changes that improved the focus on community-related activities and expedited these
activities, and unblocked delays infrastructure construction. The MTR shifted some of the
Project funds towards activities that would build the tourism assets, such as building
infrastructure in the PAs or further promoting wildlife management (such as the
reintroduction of some species in the Zinave NP), to ensure the pre-conditions for PDO
achievement would be available. The MTR process resulted in the formal restructuring of
the Project, approved by the Bank in August, 2011. The Task Team also actively
followed up on the recommendations of the MTR, which were immediately implemented,
even though formal Project restructuring happened in August, 2011. However, because of

                                            27
the delay between the MTR and formalization of the first restructuring, quality of
supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.    The Bank provided valuable support to the client during Project preparation and
was able to translate a complex set of innovative interventions (given the complex and
interconnected nature of nature-based tourism promotion) into a coherent set of
components and activities. The Bank subsequently provided significant guidance and
technical assistance during supervision, and was highly proactive in identifying and
addressing implementation constraints, in particular through the revisions in Project
scope and focus that resulted from the MTR, albeit their formalization was delayed.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.     Government supported the Project throughout its implementation, although with
varying intensity during the period. Evidence of Government’s support to the Project and
to the conservation and tourism agenda more broadly, include: i) Government followed
up on most of the commitments from the TFCA treaties they signed, and actively
participated in the TFCA inter-country meetings and committees during the period. As a
result, joint TFCA work plans were prepared and implemented; ii) Government’s
established an independent agency to manage the Protected Areas network in the country,
ANAC; iii) Government passed a new Conservation Policy and a Conservation Law,
which establishes a progressive vision for conservation in Mozambique; iv) Government
established new highly relevant PAs, including the Ponta de Ouro Partial Marine Reserve
and the Futi Corridor (part of the Maputo Special Reserve); and revised the limits of
other areas (including Bahine and Zinave National Parks and Chimanimani National
Reserve). On the other hand, government support has been less evident in: i) creating an
enabling environment for tourism promotion in PAs, including delays in adopting new
concession regulations; ii) in clarifying the type of development they wanted in some
areas, resulting in a perception of possible threats to the integrity of existing PAs,
particularly in case of a potential construction of the Dobela Habour in the Maputo
Special Reserve; and iii) in lack of leadership of the Project Steering Committee, which
was not active in the final years of Project implementation, and resulted in lack of inter-
sectoral collaboration for the management of the TFCAs.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                            28
91.     After a slow start in the first years of Project implementation, given capacity
constraints and inexperience on WB procedures, the PIU within MITUR performed
satisfactorily during Project implementation, particularly after the MTR (prior to that, its
performance was moderately unsatisfactory). The PIU was managed with outstanding
professionalism, counted on a good team of technicians during most of the Project
implementation period, and had a very strong fiduciary team. The PIU team demonstrated
enthusiasm, competence and commitment to the Project. The PIU developed not only its
own capacity but that of other departments within MITUR (at headquarters and at the
level of the PAs) and partner organizations (such as the National Tourism Institute),
particularly on data-driven management of PAs. The PIU is now recognized in Maputo as
a centre of excellence on conservation, and that knowledge will be mainstreamed into the
recently-created ANAC with the help of the follow-up operation (the MozBio 1 Project).

92.     The PIU was able to successfully implement recommendations by Bank missions
which led to reorganization and tighter control systems that improved efficiency and
effectiveness, particularly regarding procurement and financial management. It is
noteworthy that the Project had one of the highest disbursing rates in the Mozambique
CMU portfolio; and was closed with 100% of disbursement. In terms of M&E, Project
staff was required to collect primary data, and reported according to the indicators. One
weakness identified is that the PIU should have used the data collected in a more
analytical way to guide their actions.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.    The substantial institutional and regulatory reforms adopted by the Government,
the demonstrated commitment and support to Project objectives by MITUR, the strong
performance of the TFCA’s Unit (after MTR), and the Project achievements on the
ground outweigh the shortcomings, including delays in establishing an enabling
environment to support Project objectives and in providing the necessary guidance
through the Steering Committee. Hence, overall borrower performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

94.     Continued and high-level political commitment to conservation is needed to
move the agenda forward, particularly when pressures from other sectors on
protected areas are strong. Government leadership was needed throughout TFCATDP
implementation: enabling concessions for investment, fostering inter-sectoral
collaboration, expanding and re-delineating PAs and following up on transfrontier
collaboration. Government leadership varied during TFCATDP implementation, and
failed the Project at times, as evidenced by the inability of the MITUR to have mining
permits in the Chimanimani National Rserve cancelled. Interventions that seek to
promote conservation goals in the face of pressure to the integrity of the CAs from other

                                            29
sectors should guarantee that the institutional arrangements are well designed, so as to
ensure cross-sectoral coordination and effective participation of policy makers. The plans
and decisions from sectors less concerned with conservation, such as agriculture, mining,
and infrastructure, with an impact on PAs should be discussed in a transparent way by a
high-level inter-sectoral body (such as the Council of Ministers, in the case of
Mozambique). The participation of non-governmental entities and of the private sector
engaged in conservation in public discussions (e.g., tourism and safari operators) should
also be promoted.

95.      Long-term World Bank engagement in the conservation and tourism
agendas. The TFCATDP is a flagship Bank operation that demonstrates the value of
long-term programmatic engagement in national programs (such as the TFCA Program).
Through a programmatic phased-approach, the World Bank was able to foster
institutional changes, human capacity development and the establishment of partnerships
in a way that a traditional short-term single Project cannot achieve. Given the Bank’s
intention to continue engaged in the conservation agenda in Mozambique, the follow-on
MozBio Program has, appropriately, been structured as a “Series of Projects”.

96.     Develop nature-based tourism asset is a long-term process. Although not
explicitly stated, the TFCATDP assumed that most ‘bush’ tourist operations would draw
on tourists whose principal motivation to come to Mozambique was to spend time at the
coast, at least until the quality of wildlife and hospitality experience offered could
compete with other locations. This Project has shown that it takes much more than
establishment of accommodation facilities and basic infrastructures to draw tourists in
sufficient numbers to bush experiences in Mozambique. At issue is not the supply of
accommodation, or even accessibility, but rather quality of experience (the ‘tourism
asset’). While coastal destinations carry a marketable brand, this is generally not so for
bush destinations in Mozambique, as wildlife has been significantly reduced during the
civil war and PA infrastructures are poor.

97.     Tourism as a means to generate sustainable financing for PAs. TFCATDP
also showed that not all PAs will be able to really generate tourism at a level to allow
them to be self-sustaining, which means that public resources to maintain these areas
(which provide local and global public goods and services) should be ensured. This also
shows that not all PAs should be assessed by the national government against their
capacity to generate tourism business, as not all have the same potential to do so.
Governments and development partners should be realistic and business-oriented when
assessing PAs’ potential to generate tourism revenue, and they should also bear in mind
that PAs generate other types of ‘positive externalities’ (environmental services) which
calls for continued public financing.

98.   Enhancing the benefits from PAs to local communities needs to go beyond
the promotion of tourism, and encompass a broader array of integrated
conservation development activities, particularly those related to sustainable
natural resource management (such as conservation and climate-smart agriculture,
community forestry and fisheries, wildlife management). Not all PAs have high tourism

                                           30
potential, and yet surrounding communities expect direct benefits from the PA and are
likely to support conservation goals more readily when they experience benefits directed
linked to the PA. Community-led tourism businesses benefitted fewer people in the
community than other types of NRM activities, such as boreholes and small commercial
agriculture ventures, particularly when the US$/beneficiary ratio is assessed. Tourism-
related community development options need to be focused on the areas with real short-
term tourism potential, while other income-generating activities should be promoted in
other areas.

99.      Private sector investments in tourism and partnerships with communities.
Professional facilitation is needed for the public sector to be able to attract private
investment into PA concessions. In the case of the Chemucane lodge in the Maputo
Special Reserve, the role of IFC in facilitating the joint venture between the private sector
and local communities was fundamental to create trust and common understanding about
the terms and conditions of the undertaking, and to reduce the perceived risks by all
parties. Other sites did not involve such professional facilitation services, and mistakes
were made in dealing with the package offered to investors which resulted in their pulling
out, such as the cases of in Zinave and Banhine National Parks. Agencies in charge of
managing CAs should seriously consider engaging specialized support to deal with
private sector investments, while also increasing in-house capacity to do so. As to
community-private partnerships, an important lesson from TFCATDP is that such
initiatives can shift the balance of power within the communities, and can hence support
or disrupt property rights regimes and increase or decrease vulnerability of certain
community members. As such, strong attention should be given to building community-
based institutions (such as Associations and Cooperatives), in addition to strengthening
the capacity of individual community members.

100. Importance of innovative partnerships in conservation. In order to mitigate the
lack of local capacity and appropriate institutional coordination, the Project partnered
with NGOs. The modality of these partnerships was innovative, as NGOs were required
to provide technical and fiduciary staff and support as well as co-financing. Although the
arrangement was not equally successful in all cases, it worked better than the classical
Technical Assistance approach. The NGO partnership in the Maputo Special Reserve was
fundamental to complement the support from the TFCATDP and ensure that the CA
management could continue seamlessly. This was particularly important towards the end
of the Project, as funds for some of the CA operational costs became scarce, and were
completed by the partner NGO (Peace Parks Foundation). This lesson underscores the
importance of the trend in southern Africa to develop partnerships with NGOs for the
management of protected areas. In moving forward, Mozambique should clarify the
scope of these partnerships as well as the respective rights and responsibilities of the
Government and the NGOs in managing the PAs.

101. Landscape approaches to conservation. The TFCA concept is closely linked to
the landscape concept, since TFCAs encompass areas with different types of land uses in
addition to protected areas, and their management requires collaboration across several
entities (such as local and provincial governments) and multiple stakeholders (including

                                             31
communities, smallholders and large-scale private land owners). The TFCATDP focused
most of its efforts on the strengthening of the CAs and gave limited attention to building
the relationship between the CA and the broader landscape it is inserted in, including
facilitating better relationships with the Districts where the CAs are located, and with
other sectoral bodies, such as the forest services. Since significant threats to the integrity
of the CAs and their biodiversity come from outside the PAs, adopting a more

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.     The Transfrontier Conservation Areas and Tourism Development Project
(TFCATDP) was a US$35.1 million Project with an IDA Credit of US$ 21.4 million
equivalent, a US$10 million Global Environment Facility (GEF) Grant. Its
implementation also benefitted from a US$3.72 million PHRD Grant.

2.     The Project area included the Mozambican portion of three Transfrontier
Conservation Areas (Chimanimani, Lubombo, and Greater Limpopo). In these TFCAs,
Project implementation was focused on 9 districts of 4 Provinces: Inhambane
(Vilanculos District), Maputo (Matutuine District), Manica (Sussudenga District), and
Gaza (priority 1: Chicualacuala, Massingir, Mabote and Massangena Districts; priority 2:
Chigubo and Mabacane Districts).

3.     In the 3 TFCAs, the protected areas targeted were Chimanimani Special Reserve
(CSR), Maputo Special Reserve (MSR), Limpopo National Park (LNP), Banhine
National Park (BNP), and Zinave National Park (ZNP). In addition, improvements in
environmental infrastructure were envisaged for the beach tourism towns of Vilanculos
and Ponta do Oro (see map in Annex 7).

4.     The Project was implemented through five components:

Component 1: Strengthening Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework for TFCAs.
Component 1 was designed to build on the achievements of the first phase and further
strengthen the enabling environment for TFCAs by helping create the policy, legal and
institutional framework for GOM to improve regional collaboration for management of
transfrontier resources; promote interagency collaboration and vertical linkages between
central and local governments; build the capacity of public sector institutions at all levels
and communities to manage biodiversity and natural resources; and to form productive
partnerships with the private sector. Community land and natural resource ownership and
use rights were also to be addressed.

Component 2: Integrated District Development Planning. This component was aimed at
piloting a proactive approach to integrated planning in two districts, through the
development of the Integrated District Development Plans (IDDPs) which focused on
defining and implementing a series of practical steps to ensure that biodiversity and
natural resource-based assets are mainstreamed into District Development Plans (DDPs).
Component 2 was divided into two Subcomponents: (2.1) National capacity building and
stocktaking, and (2.2) Production, adoption and dissemination of the IDDP.

Component 3: Community and Private Sector-Led Tourism Development. Component 3
was designed to develop the capacity of the tourism sector (government, communities
and the private sector) to participate in the preparation and implementation of tourism
master plans for key tourism districts. This component supported MITUR to establish a
comprehensive and clearly defined set of procedures to implement the process for land
concessions, from land identification to on-the-ground investment. The component was

                                             36
divided in two subcomponents: (3.1) building capacities in the National Tourism
Directorate (DINATUR), the Elephant Coast Development Agency (ECDA) and targeted
private sector and community associations to unlock opportunities for sustainable tourism
investment and growth; and (3.2) the establishment of a Community Equity Fund
(CEF).to support community-led conservation and tourism development

Component 4: Protected Areas Management. This component aimed to support the
identification, monitoring and protection of the most significant and vulnerable
biodiversity assets within the three TFCAs, through the establishment/rehabilitation and
management of a network of National Parks and Reserves under the direct management
of the National Directorate of Conservation Areas (DNAC). This was intended to begin a
long-term process of major improvement of the MSR including gazetting the Futi
corridor and a new marine reserve; and supporting BNP and CNR. In addition, modest
support would be provided to LNP (supplementing efforts by PPF, KfW & AFD), and to
ZNP.

Component 5: Project Management, Communications, and Monitoring and Evaluation.
This component financed project management costs, including procurement, accounting
and monitoring activities. The design of the component included: (i) an M&E system to
track and assess project implementation and impacts; (ii) a system for adaptive
management based on the M&E information generated; and (iii) an information system
and a communications strategy to ensure timely flow of accurate information among the
implementing agencies, and to increase awareness and understanding about ecosystem
management and TFCAs nationally, regionally and worldwide.

5.      In order to monitor Project outcomes and outputs, a results framework was
developed during Project preparation. This framework included 8 key performance
indicators to assess compliance with the PDO and GEO, as well as 16 intermediate
indicators linked to the individual components of the Project. The full set of indicators,
together with the targets and achievements are summarized in the data sheet of this ICR.

6.     At Project completion, the outputs produced by each components            were as
follows:

Component 1: Strengthening Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework for TFCAs

7.      Component 1 was designed to develop an enabling environment for
effective/sustainable management of biodiversity, including the institutional
arrangements for conservation that would be required for consistency and integration,
vertically from local community-based initiatives to international TFCAs and
horizontally across the country.

8.     Through technical assistance, consultation, workshops, training (master’s degree
programs (3 persons), diplomas (one person) and attendance of wildlife management
courses (13 persons)) and study tours, as well as the production, publication and
dissemination of available information materials. A total of 18 policy or regulatory

                                           37
documents were prepared by the Project and adopted by GOM. Of these, four represent
major Project outputs and have contributed significantly to the development of an
improved policy and legal framework supporting tourism and conservation, as well as the
establishment of a new institutional structure:

   Conservation Policy and Strategy: Approved by the Council of Ministers on the
    18th of August 2009 (Resolution 63/2009) and gazetted in the Boletim da República
    on November 2, 2009 (BR Série I, Nr 43);
   Conservation Law: The Draft was approved by the Council of Ministers and by
    Parliament, and was gazetted in the Boletim da República on June 20, 2014 (BR Série
    I, Nr 50 - Law 16/2014) on June 30, 2014. Preparation of Regulations is underway.
   Tourism Concession Manual: The draft Manual was developed with Project support
    and is awaiting approval by MITUR. The Manual is intended to be applicable at all
    levels of government (Central to District).
   New institution for management of conservation areas: ANAC (Agency for
    Managing Conservation Areas) established in April 2011.
   Together with civil society and private sector stakeholders, the Project facilitated the
    establishment of the Foundation for the Conservation of Biodiversity (Biofund), in
    August 2011 through approval for the Council of Minister, and a public utility status
    attributed to it on April 2012;


9.       Regarding the institutional framework, a new conservation management
institution (ANAC) was established in April 2011 (Ordnance 11/2011), following a
process of inter-ministerial consensus building. Reports were prepared to support
transition to and functioning of ANAC: Manual of Administrative and Financial
Procedures for the National Administration of Conservation Areas; ANAC business plan
and the plan of transition of DNAC and other relevant institutions to ANAC; Draft
Statutes distributed to appropriate ministries; and Terms of Reference for staff
recruitment. The first Director General was appointed in July 2013, and a new Director
General took functions in August 2014. The Statutes and Regulamento Interno have been
approved and adopted. Six technicians were moved from former DNAC to ANAC and
the recruitment process for staff and advisors is underway.

10.     In addition, the Project supported Mozambique in advancing a number of TFCA-
related initiatives with neighbouring countries. International protocols for management
have been agreed for Lubombo and Limpopo TFCAs. The target of 4 agreements was
revised down to 3 at MTR because of slow progress with setting up collaboration among
Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Zambia (ZIMOZA). A technical and ministerial meeting
took place on May 26, 2009 to discuss the proclamation of the ZIMOZA TFCA. The
Ministers requested changes and agreed that once suggested amendments were made the
legal process would follow. Although the ZIMOZA Agreement was completely
negotiated at technical level, the Ministers of Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique did
not meet to ratify the Agreement. On September 29, 2013 a MOU was signed by the

                                            38
Mozambican Minister of Tourism and the Zimbabwean Minister of Hospitality with the
intention of developing tourism and promoting economic growth, but the TFCA has not
been established yet.

11.     Also in 2013, a Joint Operational Strategy was adopted by park agencies in
Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. This is intended to focus effort on PA
administration, management of biodiversity, and law enforcement. In support of law
enforcement, a draft MOU between Mozambique and South Africa was signed to provide
an integrated, international approach to the control of rhino poaching.

12.     The Project also supported the development of a series of management and
operational instruments some of which have contributed to strengthen MITUR’s
administrative capacity, while others have provided improved tools for PA management
and tourism development at the district level. A full list of instruments produced by the
Project is presented in the table below.

Component 2 - Integrated District Development Planning (IDDP)

13.      A specific indicator of the Project’s result framework, the intention of supporting
the preparation of two pilot IDDPs was to ensure that all developments in the selected
districts (Matutuine and Vilanculos) were aligned with, and did not adversely impact,
nature-based tourism. The District Development Plan for Matutuíne District was
produced, with Project support, by the District authorities in 2006 and approved at the
district level. The plan was strengthened in 2007 and 2008, with assistance from a
Technical Advisor for the National Directorate of Planning (DNP) recruited by the
Project. The Mid Term Review did not change Component 2 although it formalized the
decision of Vilanculos District to withdraw from the initiative and acknowledged the
limited direct influence of the Project by not requiring the TFCATDP to be accountable
for the IDDP process. As a result, the elaboration of IDDPs was limited to Matutuíne
district. Later, the Ministry of Planning and Development took the leadership in further
preparing the IDDPs for Matutuine District.

14.     The Elephant Coast Development Agency (ECDA) had responsibility to promote
tourism in Matutuine district, along the Ponta do Ouro coast, and gather tourism data.
Although it managed to gather some data on overall tourism for the district, it failed
to deliver in a series of areas, and as a result the Agency ceased to exist in 2010. Attempts
made by the TFCATDP to have the Instituto Nacional de Turismo (INATUR) continue
the implementation of the ECDA tasks were not successful, due to lack of capacity of
INATUR. As a result, the contribution of the overall growth in tourism has not been
assessed.


Component 3 – Community and Private Sector-Led Tourism Development

15.    The overall intention of Component 3 was to situate PAs within a broader
planning process such that they would be protected from inappropriate development and
income could be generated through increased tourism. The role of the Project was to
support (i) building capacities in the National Tourism Directorate (DINATUR), the
Elephant Coast Development Agency (ECDA) and targeted private sector and
community associations to unlock opportunities for sustainable tourism investment and
growth, including the preparation of tourism plans in the target TFCAs; and (ii) support
community-led conservation and tourism development through the establishment of a
Community Equity Fund (CEF). Although progress would be measured by the number of



                                             40
plans prepared, how they were implemented and adapted would determine attainment of
the intention to link conservation with tourism.

16.    Regarding the Capacity Building Subcomponent, the Tourism Framework for
the Maputo Special Reserve and Futi Corridor was produced and approved by MITUR in
2006, and was helpful in facilitating tourism in the Lubombo TFCA. In 2012, additional
Tourism Master Plans (TMPs) were prepared for the Districts of Vilanculos,
Sussundenga and Manica.

17.     While the target output (increased from 4 to 5 Tourism Plans at Mid Term
Review) was achieved, the anticipated benefits of integrated development planning (such
as appropriate concessioning) were not fully realized due to the late preparation of the
plans and the institutional problems described previously, except to some degree in the
MSR. However, the TFCATDP requirement for reporting tourism data has generated
significant improvements, as it has led to a more formal and organized approach to data
gathering and reporting. Park managers and the District services for economic activities
are responsible for data collection. This has become a routine activity that, in addition to
providing regular updates, also makes conservation personnel conscious of the
importance of visitors in park management.

18.     One of the indicators in the results framework was the level of conformity of new
tourism ventures with the new guidelines for awarding of concessions. The MTR
recommended that this indicator should be dropped because even though the Project had
prepared draft regulations for concession in protected areas, the Government had decided
that these would be incorporated into the Concession Law. Consistent with this decision,
the new Conservation Law (approved during the last year of the Project) provides a
revised framework for awarding concessions.

19.     In addition, investor satisfaction was assessed using a four point scale in 2006,
2008 and 2011. The determinants of investor satisfaction, or lack of, were consistent
across the three TFCAs, as illustrated by the tables below. Level of investor satisfaction
in 2006 was 37% increasing to 48% in 2008 and 60% in 2011 yielding a net increase of
23% which is a 62% increase in investor satisfaction. As a result, the EOP target of 55%
was exceeded.

(Data from Annual Reports). Sample size varies across years. In 2013 assessment included 26 respondents
from Libombo, 18 from Limpopo and 16 from Chimanimani TFCA

20.     The second subcomponent focused on support to enable communities to develop
enterprises and to partner with the private sector. To achieve his goal, the Project
established a Community Enterprise Fund (CEF) at the start of the Project reflecting the
strong intention that communities should be targeted as beneficiaries, and provided
technical and financial assistance for the following activities: (i) increase in tourism
operations in the target TFCA in conformity with environmental and social standards
contained in TMPs; (ii) establishment of community associations; (iii) conservation
and/or tourism-related community subprojects; and (iv) partnerships between private
investors and communities for the construction and operation of tourism operations.

21.    The Project monitored the growth in tourism operations in conformity with
Tourism Master Plans (TMP) in the target districts. The target at Project appraisal was
1,200 beds in 2012 and 1,480 beds in 2013, which was considered unrealistic at MTR and
was downgraded to 400 for 2012 and 500 for 2013. By the end of 2013, a total of 244
beds had been established. This shortcoming can be attributed to the delays in preparing,


                                                  42
approving and giving effect to the TMPs, and particularly because development of
concessions for Milibangala and Ponto Dobela did not materialize.

22.     Of the 244 beds established, 45 were located within PAs and developed with
Project support mainly through the CEF (26 at Ndzou Camp, 10 at Tondo Lodge, and 19
at Covane Lodge). Additional 24 beds were added to the Chemucane lodge, in the MSR.

23.     As illustrated below, the CEF, with support provided by contracted NGOs
(performing as community brokers) established a total of 24 community associations
(exceeding the original target of 20 associations). Because of the emphasis given to
community development in the Project not only the number of beds was important but
also that all operations had strong community involvement and have generated
employment for community members. Despite the limited outputs generated by this
activity, the establishment of lodges within PAs has provided an extremely valuable
demonstration effect, as well as important lessons learned for MozBio to improve and
expand the type of initiatives supported by the CEF.

24.     In terms of specific subprojects, the CEF supported a number of initiatives in all
three TFCAs. The formalization of community associations and the resultant
opportunities for community-partner enterprises have been foundational processes
promoted by the Project. In addition to supporting tourism development in community –
investor partnerships, the CEF invested US$ 794,695 in 18 community projects that
directly benefited local communities. In total, CEF supported subproject provided
benefits to almost 3000 community members and generated over 1100 jobs. Community
enterprise projects within MSR, CNR, LNP and BNP (e.g. chili production and
commercialization, horticulture, honey and community lodges) created jobs and
generated meaningful revenue generation opportunities for local communities. The
Project focused on creating employment through small-scale enterprises and. Three
community enterprises dedicated to production of chilies (one) and honey (two) are
linked to markets and are potentially viable. Craft projects have been less successful as
beneficiaries were not connected to markets, either through local tourists or agents, so
production has been supply- rather than market-driven. Tour guide and hospitality
training to community members have improved economic opportunities associated with
tourism ventures. Little attention was directed specifically at sustainable natural resource
use projects and those to promote conservation agriculture and horticulture were not
successful, mainly due to design deficiencies. In addition, community boreholes
supported by the Project have made tangible contributions to improving living conditions
of beneficiary communities.

25.    The tourism subprojects supported have not yet generated meaningful outputs
given that construction took place during the final years of the Project. Regardless,
because of its beautiful beaches, Mozambique is widely perceived as a ‘beach tourist

                                            44
destination’ rather than a ‘nature or wildlife destination’. Although not explicitly stated,
the implied assumption is that most ‘bush’ tourist operations would draw on tourists
whose principal motivation was to spend time at the coast, at least until the quality of
wildlife and hospitality experience offered could compete with other locations. Even
then, more aggressive marketing and incentives would be required to establish a
compelling brand. Experience of this Project has shown that it takes much more than
establishment of accommodation facilities to draw tourists in large numbers to bush
experiences in Mozambique. At issue is not the supply of accommodation, or even
accessibility, but rather quality of the bush tourism experience. While coastal destinations
carry a marketable brand, this is generally not yet the case for bush destinations in
Mozambique.

 27.     In addition to the outputs described in this section, three key performance
 indicators are directly related to the achievements of this component.

 28.      Number of visitor and bed nights in tourism facilities in the target districts. The
 PAD indicator included two variables (visitors and bed nights) which created uncertainty.
 The Restructuring Paper increased the target from 100,000 to 220,000 and selected bed
 nights and the M&E Framework recorded bed nights in TFCAs. Project staff continued to
 record both bed nights in tourism facilities and visitors. Both statistics are considered
 relevant because they measure different things: bed-nights measures use of lodging
 facilities which is particularly pertinent for community employment, while the number of
 visitors measures use of the parks.

 29.     The Project contributed to considerable growth in private sector led tourism in the
 three TFCA’s (a total of 196,149 bed nights in 2013 compared to 66,182 in 2006, an
 increase of almost 200%). Although a large proportion of this tourism was concentrated
 in the beach destination of Ponta do Ouro, located within the Lubombo TFCA, the
 Project made relevant contributions to this growth through the improved tourism-related
 policy and regulatory instruments developed by the Project (Components 1 and 2) and,
 most importantly, the creation of the Ponta do Ouro Marine Reserve. The total number of
 bed nights and visitors in TFCA districts and PAs is presented in the table below.

30.     Growth in terrestrial nature-based tourism in PAs within the TFCAs was
significantly lower (a total of 10,811 bed-nights in 2013, nevertheless representing a
growth of 32% compared to 2008). This was largely due to the fact that the basic assets
required for tourism development in PAs (park infrastructure, lodging facilities and
wildlife populations) were slower to develop than anticipated. Regardless, the expansion
of tourism within the PAs was facilitated by the construction of lodges and tent camps
under rigorous environmental standards and the active participation of private sector
entrepreneurs in partnership with local communities. By generating employment, private
sector investments and payment of park fees, this expansion was also instrumental for
achievement of the revised targets for the remaining key indicators of the PDO
(leveraging of investments, community employment and PA revenues).

31.     Percentage of tourism ventures (in target districts that have adopted a
District Tourism Master Plan-DTMP) /’;in conformity with the DTMP. Although the
Project had originally intended to establish Integrated District Development Plans (IDDP)
in five TFCAs, during implementation it was decided to pilot only two District
Development Plans: one in Matutuine (which was completed and approved), and one in
Vilanculos. Other DTMPs were judged not necessary, as the Ministry of Planning and
Development (MPD) was supporting the targeted Districts in preparing their District
Development Plans, which also encompassed tourism.

32.     This indicator was included in an effort to ensure that all tourism-related facilities
and operations were developed in the context of wider district planning and met social
and environmental and environmental standards. Conformity was measured against GOM
legislation and the Tourism Framework that was developed for the Maputo Special
Reserve and Futi Corridor as well as the Tourism Master Plans prepared for the districts
of Vilanculos, Sussundenga and Manica. Project reports record that the four tourism
ventures listed in the table below conformed to plans.

33.     Amount of new private tourism or conservation-related funds leveraged as
joint-venture with communities in target districts. Despite the slow start, the Project
exceeded the EOP target of US$ 2 million by US$ 440,000 (22%), as a result of the six
tourism projects that were implemented with Project support through the CEF. A single
private investment, the Chemucane Lodge (opening December 2014 in MSP/Libombo)
contributed US$ 2 million (or 82% of the total), enough to meet the target. Together with
two other investments (Covane Lodge (Limpopo) and Ndzou Lodge (Chimanimani)) they
contributed almost 96% of the total funds leveraged. In general, subprojects which did

not include a private sector partner, did not leverage significant funding, as most
counterpart funding provided by communities was in kind.

34.    Excluding major investment in lodges established through investor-community
partnerships, the Project invested US$ 794,695 in 18 additional conservation-related
community projects (including Chikwidzi Lodge) that directly benefited local
communities. Financial information and funds leveraged are described in the following
table.

Component 4 – Protected Area Management


35.      This component supported the identification, monitoring and protection of the
most significant and vulnerable biodiversity assets within the three TFCAs, through the
establishment/rehabilitation and management of the network of National Parks and
Reserves under the direct management of DNAC (now ANAC) within the target TFCA.
It initiated a long-term process of major improvement of the Maputo Special Reserve,
including gazetting the Futi corridor and the new marine reserve; support to Banhine
National Park and the Chimanimani Special Reserve. Modest support was also provided
to Limpopo National Park, to supplement existing efforts of The Peace Parks Foundation
(PPF), KfW & AFD, and to Zinave National Park.

36.     Component 4 was designed to develop a professional approach to management
of protected areas in support of the conservation of biodiversity and included two
subcomponents. The first focused on capacity building and the second on management,
including improvement of facilities. With funding from the IDA credit and GEF, specific
support provided by the Project included construction and/or rehabilitation of
infrastructure, operating equipment and supplies, technical assistance and training, and
introduction and management of wildlife. As a result of this support, PAs improved their
basic assets and management, increased the area under protection; improved
communication, information and law enforcement; and increased their’ revenue
generation capacity.

37.     The area under formal conservation increased by 1,910 Km2 of which 918 Km2 is
due to the establishment of the Ponta do Ouro Marine Reserve and the Futi Elephant
Corridor, and the remainder to the realigning the boundaries of three PAs within the
Limpopo TFCA (ZNP, BNP and CNR). The realignment of boundaries not only resulted
in a significant reduction in the population living inside the protected areas (from 2,050
to 448 families), but also contributed to an increase in the total area under conservation in
the target TFCAs. The first table shows the changes in area achieved due to Project
supported activities, while the table below quantifies the reduction in population in the
PAs due to demarcation.

38.     In terms of incompatible land uses, remote sensing was used to map rural land use
and determine the presence of uses incompatible with biodiversity conservation. The
analysis of the percentage of land use within each of the PAs in 2005, 2007 and 2012
showed that incompatible land use accounted for less than 3.5% of the total land area,
which did not result in any significant loss of natural habitat and was well within the
Project target of 10%. This analysis also reflected Government concern about the impact
of incompatible land use, as it was difficult to contain impacts when people live in the
parks, including expansion of agriculture, grazing and poaching. This encouraged DNAC
to consider ways of reducing the number of people residing in the parks by excising (i.e.
re-demarcation) the more densely populated areas so that fewer people would have to be
resettled while at the same time including new unpopulated areas with high conservation
value into the parks.

39.     The process of developing infrastructure experienced considerable delays during
the initial years of Project implementation. At the time of the MTR these delays were
attributed under-budgeting of cost estimates, problems in tendering due to capacity
limitations in the TFCA Unit, and the absence of suitably qualified contractors/engineers
capable and willing to operate in the remote Project areas. Because of these constraints, it

                                                52
   was only after the Mid Term Review, when targets were redefined and more funds were
   allocated to infrastructure, that progress improved, Based on the needs of each PA,
   infrastructure provided included office blocks, senior staff housing, dormitories, ranger
   posts, entrance gates, water supply, fences, crossings, and internal roads. Equipment
   included vehicles, solar panels and generators, pumps, and office equipment The post
   MTR improvement is illustrated by the results summarized in the table below, showing
   that a significant portion (48 out of 53) of the structures were completed during the last
   three years of the Project. In addition to Project Bank and IDA funds, PPF also
   contributed to the provision of infrastructure at the MSR, including aircraft hangar and,
   airstrip, fencing, boreholes and ranger post.

40.     Wildlife reintroductions contributed to ensure that diversity and numbers
increased above targets. The 2006 TFCA Annual Report identifies two bio-indicator
species for each PA. The 2006 – 2009 targets were somewhat arbitrary because little was
known of the status of these species in the PAs. Targets were revised to 10% or 5%
increase in population depending on the species. Although standard practices were used
for assessment, it is accepted that counts, particularly for smaller species, especially when
populations are low, commonly show wide variation. Censuses were infrequent because
of cost, and the changes introduced in surveying procedures, as improved techniques and
equipment became available.

41.     Within these constraints the counts indicate that wildlife populations exceed
targets in all cases and in some by large margins (see Table below). This reflects
introductions and possibly also improved control over poaching as patrols have become
more formal and frequent. However the generally low numbers of wildlife initially and
the wide confidence limits associated with wildlife estimates suggest the need for caution
in drawing conclusions.

42.     In terms of PA performance and management, two indicators were used to
monitor Project outcomes: (i) Increase in PA revenues; and (ii) Change in management
effectiveness.

43.     PA Revenues: Although revenues differ considerably between the different PAs,
overall, annual revenue generated by all PAs increased by more than 120% during the life
of the Project, from US$ 187,400 in 2006 to US$ 426,977 in 2013 Of the total revenues,
LNP raised 68 %, MSR contributed 31%, while BNP, CNR and ZNP combined generated
less than 1%. In the case of LNP and MSR (both terrestrial and marine), the growth in
revenues is not only significant for the operation of the PA, but also has contributed to
increase the incomes of communities as they received 20% of the annual revenues
generated by the PA.

44.     Project design was premised on the assumption that the concept of bush-beach
tourist routes would gain traction within GOM and would assume priority for investment
and marketing. This did not happen to the extent anticipated. Without investment in
infrastructure required to service tourism and encourage investment at bush locations,
inland lodges would not be able to compete with coastal facilities, particularly when
wildlife populations had still to be rehabilitated. Although there was encouraging growth
in revenue generation, targets were overly optimistic and did not adequately take account
of the remoteness, poor infrastructure, visitor preferences and the associated difficulty of
attracting private investors. Infrastructure investments planned for MSR, LNP and
Chimanimani were not realized and anticipated revenue generation was adversely
affected. Also, most visitors from South Africa use coastal destinations (of which MSR
is one of many) and transit through LNP and MSR to these locations. The requirement for
visitors transiting LNP to overnight in the park helped increase revenue generation but
provided a disincentive to use this route to the coast. This, together with a general decline
in tourists to Kruger National Park in neighboring South Africa contributed to the
slowing of growth in revenue by LNP between 2012 and 2013. This contrasts with MSR
where revenue increased by 53% between 2012 and 2013, which justifies the decision
made to increase investment in improving the MSR, establishing the Ponta do Ouro
Partial Marine Reserve and developing tourist facilities and concessions at those
locations. Revenue growth at CNR was adversely affected by the political unrest in
Zimbabwe and Zimbabew’s weak commitment to establishing the Chimanimani TFCA as
a tourist destination.

45.     PA management effectiveness: In accordance with the requirements of the GEF,
design of Project activities was largely configured by the Management Effectiveness
Tracking Tool (METT). Scores were intended to largely be used as a strategic self-
management instrument to identify areas requiring attention. The intention was that park
authorities should regularly assess performance, not only when required to do so by the
terms of reference for a particular Project. The table below shows that management
effectiveness has been assessed consistently during the life of the Project, suggesting that
the process has been internalized in the culture of park management and will be sustained
beyond the Project and expanded to other PAs, partly due to the specific assistance
allocated by MozBio to further improve management effectiveness .

46.    At Mid Term Review most targets were judged to be overly optimistic and were
reduced. However, with the exception of the Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve, none

                                             55
of the others achieved the target. This is not surprising given the delays experienced with
procurement and construction and with implementing community subprojects through the
CEF. Although the relatively high score for the Marine Reserve can be attributed to
promulgation of the reserve, it also reflects the commitment of the PAs management and
staff to law enforcement.

47.     Park management cannot be effective if a PA does not have a management plan
and a tourism management plan. While the 2013 Annual Report records that management
plans with performance-based management systems were successfully completed and
approved for all Project PAs such plans are not yet being fully applied to assess
performance. Contributing factors for this are that the plans do not include business plans
and approved performance indicators.

48.     The intention of deploying this indicator was to internalize a culture of
management assessment in the conservation agency, thereby improving professionalism
in conservation practice that would have positive outcomes for tourism. That this has not
yet happened is disappointing. It is the responsibility of ANAC, rather than the TFCA
Unit, to introduce and sustain performance-based management and it would be helpful to
see greater commitment to this. Including contribution to performance-based
management as Key Performance Areas (KPAs) for staff would encourage commitment.
The EOP target was that three PAs would have operational performance-based
management. At present it is not being adequately implemented in any of the PAs.

   .
Component 5 – Project Management, Communications and Monitoring and
Evaluation

49.    This component was designed to finance a team of technical and fiduciary staff to
undertake Project management, including Project procurement, accounting and
monitoring as described by their respective manuals. Inputs expected to be financed were
aimed at (i) strengthening the capacity of the TFCA Unit to coordinate the TFCA
program; (ii) support its related operating costs; and (iii) enable recruiting a few
                                             56
additional long-term staff for the Unit, including TFCA Coordinators based in the field in
order to support the shifting of planning and implementation to the Provincial and local
level. However, the MTR concluded that rather than facilitating operations, the field
coordinators were adding a level of complexity and inefficiency. The organization of
Project management was restructured to increase specialist capacity and efficiency. The
regional management office and positions were cancelled while the TFCA team added a
community development specialist and an infrastructure specialist. In addition, the
component included the implementation of an M&E system to track and assess Project
implementation and impacts, a system for adaptive management based on the M&E
information; and the development and implementation of an information system and a
communications strategy to ensure timely flow of accurate information, and to increase
awareness and understanding about ecosystem management and TFCAs nationally,
regionally and worldwide.

50.     The performance of the TFCA Unit was assessed based on the effectiveness in
completing tasks included in annual work plans, which improved from 48% in 2006 to 80
% in 2008 (Table 23) reflecting the growth in capacity within the TFCA Unit. The EOP
target was set at 80%, a value that would be difficult to achieve in the complex multi-
sectoral context of the TFCATDP, which was characterized by multiple
interdependencies and actors over which the Unit had limited control. The comparatively
low score obtained in 2013 reflects both the delays of GOM with respect to legislation
and concessioning, and the challenges of developing infrastructure in remote locations as
well as of working with communities and investors.

51.     Although a Communication strategy was prepared it had only been partially
implemented and relied largely on the web site and annual reports. Annual Reports were
timely and comprehensive, with a detailed description of activities implemented, progress
of indicators, and issues encountered. However, only two editions of the proposed
Newsletter have been released. The Project also financed the design, operation and
maintenance of the website. The target was originally set at > 10 000 hits at year 2, to be
increased by 25% every year thereafter. As the site only became operational in 2008, this
would have set an EOP target for 2013 at more than 30,000 hits. However, there has been
rapid growth from 3,539 in 2009 to 86, 218 in 2011 and 166, 355 hits in r 2013. In 2013,
the site was accessed from a great diversity of countries, predominantly the USA (25%),
China (21%) and Mozambique 12% in 2013.

 Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       The TFCATDP PAD presented some economic analysis of tourism potential to
generate foreign exchange, employment and contribute to GDP. It presented three
scenarios for the tourism sector in 2015. The optimistic scenario estimated that tourism
would contribute to around 3.4% of GDP, which has probably been achieved at present
(2013 figures indicate that tourism contributed to 3.2% of GDP). An ERR for the Project
was not carried out at Project preparation, probably because data on tourism was very
scarce.

2.       A cost-benefit analysis to calculate the TFCATDP’s economic rate of return
(ERR) and its corresponding net present values (NPV) was conducted during ICR
preparation. It predominately focuses on the economic benefits generated within TFCA’s
in Mozambique as a result of the Project. The Project development objective (PDO)
indicators provide the basis for determining which benefits to assess.

Methodology

3.     Data collected by the Ministry of Tourism (MITUR) TFCA Unit was used but,
where necessary, was supplemented with information from previous national reports.
Assumptions (presented below) were made in collaboration with local experts and the
TFCA Unit.

4.      The cost benefit analysis was conducted for 8-year Project period (June 2005 to
June 2013) with a discount rate of 10% (with 5% and 12% rates included for comparison).
This could be considered a conservative discount rate for a public investment in
conservation as it may undervalue the expected long-term benefits as well as additional
ecosystem benefits not directly assessed here, but to which the Project contributed3.

5.       Activities financed under this Project were expected to generate five main benefit
streams (of which four are quantifiable):

     (i) Numbers of local residents formally and informally employed in conservation and
          tourism in target districts;
     (ii) Number of visitors and bed nights in tourism facilities in the target districts;
     (iii)Percentage of tourism ventures in target districts that have adopted a conforming
          District Tourism Master Plan (unable to quantify the economic impact of the
          indicator);
     (iv) Volume of new capital investment in private tourism and/or conservation-related
          joint-ventures with communities in target areas; and,



 3
   The value of ecosystem services is not quantified in this section, but can potentially represent significant
 indirect benefits from the project, especially in the long term.


                                                       58
     (v) Volume of total annual revenues generated by targeted formal Protected Areas
         (PA).

6.       The level of benefits for each quantifiable indicator is annexed to this report. In
addition, the following activities provided a benefit to neighbouring communities but are
not quantified:

 Assumptions
7.       Quantifiable benefits resulting from the Project are dependent upon the following
main assumptions:
    (i) Local residents employed in conservation and tourism in target districts. The
         Mozambique Ministry of Tourism (MITUR) TFCA Unit reports the number of
         local residents employed each year. An average annual salary (2013 prices) was
         calculated for conservation staff working within the following National Parks and
         Reserves: Limpopo, Ponta do Ouro, Banhine, Chimanimani, Qurimibas,
         Gorongoza. The 2013 average salary was correctly annually by the average rate of
         inflation (8.4% between 2004 and 2013). In order to avoid double counting the
         salaries of tourism staff is not counted here as it is assumed that it is captured
         within the ‘number of bed-nights’ indicator (explained further in (ii)). Therefore,
         the aggregated total salaries of all conservation staff employed between 2006 and
         2013 as a result of the Project are presented.
    (ii) Number of visitors and bed nights in tourism facilities in the target districts.
         The original Project Appraisal Document (PAD) recommended that bed-night
         data be collected for the districts surrounding TFCAs, rather than just the TFCA
         itself. However, this approach is based on the assumption that all people staying
         within accommodation in target districts are visiting TFCAs, which is not the
         case. As a result, this analysis uses the bed-night data from the National Parks that
         form the Mozambican component of targeted TFCAs, which is significantly lower


 4
  No data had been collected on livelihood improvements as a result of the interventions during the project
 period.


                                                      59
          than the indicator-reported data. The value of the bed-nights is determined by
          multiplying the numbers of bed-nights by the average daily expenditures of a
          tourist. This is a proxy for determining the revenue generated by tourism in PAs
          (with the exceptions of tourism entrance and concession fees). Batey (2011:43)
          provided an “average daily expenditures” of a tourist visiting Vilanculos, which
          includes spending on accommodation, food and beverages, in-house activities, as
          well as goods and services. It excludes car hire and international flights, which
          would distort the average value. It therefore assumes that the money spent by
          tourists for accommodation and services include the salaries of local residents
          employed in the tourism sector, as salaries are funded from tourism expenditures.
     (iii)New private investment in target districts. As above only private investment
          within TFCAs is counted in order to avoid distorted figures, as not all investments
          within Districts are linked to PAs.
     (iv) Annual revenues from PAs. Entrance fees paid by tourists and concession fees
          paid by private operators do not form a component of the tourist daily expenditure
          reported by Batey (2011), and therefore not double counted.
  Benefits Stream and Project Costs
8.        Based on the average exchange rate (2006-2013) of MTS 27.28 = USD 1, the
Project achieved the following benefits streams: (i) additional employment in tourism and
conservation; (ii) additional income for previously unemployed local residents; (iii)
additional visitation to TFCAs and money spent by tourists in the local economies; (iv)
additional investment from private sector and NGOs; and (v) additional government
revenues from tourism entrance fees. The value of these streams throughout the Project
period is displayed below:

  The total cost of the Project by the end of 2013 was USD 36,165,500. Although costs
  accrued to the Project in 2014, monitoring of activities is only available until 2013.

 9.       The total value of direct benefits equate to USD 44.7 million as compared with a
 total Project cost of USD 36.2 million between 2006 and 2013. The Project has budgeted
 an additional USD 2.1 million for Project costs in 2014 but data on the benefits accrued in
 2014 have not been collected. Therefore 2014 is not reflected in this analysis. However, it
 is assumed, based on 2013 performance, that the benefits would significantly outweigh the
 costs.

 10.     The analysis has provided three scenarios based on discounts rate of 5%, 10% and
 12%, representing a range of low to high rates. The table below displays the NPV
 depending upon the selected discount rate.

 11.      The sensitivity analysis shows that the average annual wage of conservation staff
 have a significant impact on the ERR as well as the exchange rates. Private investment
 and tourism revenues are not assessed as they represent real numbers. Only the economic
 assumptions are scrutinised. The results of the sensitivity analysis are displayed in the table

  Conclusion
 12.      Subject to the above assumptions and uncertainties, results suggest that overall the
 Project was economically desirable (returns above the 12% threshold). The ERR is 17.84%
 and the NPV equals US$ 2,205,726 (at a 10% discount rate).

 13.      Other benefits from this Project, such as improvement of environmental services,
 have also not been reported as no data was collected during the course of the Project. Had
 this been monitored it would have resulted in a significant increase in the NPV and ERR.
 The result of the economic analysis should therefore be considered within this context.

Annex 5. The MozBio 1 Project and its link to the TFCATDP

1. Building on the TFCA I, and II the GoM has requested WB assistance to implement
the Mozbio Program – an ambitious long-term Program that brings biodiversity
conservation, tourism development and poverty reduction together. The Mozbio Program
will continue to serve as a platform to address the threats to the conservation of
Mozambique’s natural capital, take full advantage of the potential tourism growth in
Mozambique, and contribute to the reduction of the high poverty levels around CAs.
Mozbio will be financed with GoM’s resources and support from various donors (WB,
AFD, KFW, USAID, international NGOs, among others).

2. The objective of the Mozbio Program is to sustain and improve the progress made
during TFCA I, and II, by further strengthening Mozambique's institutions and policies
for CAs and tourism development. The institutional and policy framework for tourism
development to manage Mozambique's CAs system, built with the support of TFCA II,
are still quite new and require significant technical assistance and support to ensure that
the new laws, policies and institutions are fully implemented. Furthermore, most
terrestrial CAs do not yet have sufficiently attractive products, or a level of public
infrastructure, to scale up tourism. Tourism development requires improved basic
infrastructure and access to areas with potential tourism attraction, improved tourism
investment promotion and facilitation and clear and simplified tourism licensing and
registration procedures.

3. The Mozbio Program will address challenges through six strategic pillars (Table 1).
The WB will provide support to the MozBio Program through a ‘Series of Projects
(SoP)’. The first phase, Mozbio 1 (the follow up Project) will be a four-year project with
a focus on reducing rural poverty through: i) improving the benefit-sharing mechanism
that returns tourism revenues to communities; ii) increasing job creation and business
opportunities from tourism; and iii) promoting alternative livelihood activities that reduce
destructive practices, particularly those linked to NRM (agriculture, forestry, fisheries
and wildlife management).

4. MozBio 1 will implement the new institutional framework for conservation in
Mozambique, with a strong emphasis on building the capacity of the recently-established
CAs Management Agency (ANAC) and the Biodiversity Foundation (BIOFUND),
founded under the TFCA II, while strengthening the management of key CAs with the
highest potential for generating revenue and reducing poverty in rural communities. The
Project will promote nature-based tourism by improving regulations, strengthening
government capacity and promoting the sector. The Project will also finance sorely
needed infrastructure and some of the recurrent costs of existing CAs to ensure they can
attract tourism and manage biodiversity adequately.

5. New and important objectives of Mozbio 1 is also to strengthen communities’ rights
to land and resources and promote livelihood alternatives to local communities, though a
broader landscape approach (within and around the CAs), that goes beyond tourism. This
includes for example improved agricultural methods (such as climate smart agriculture
techniques), community forest management and non-timber forest products management

                                            69
and sustainable fisheries. To enable a broader beneficiary base and to better monitor
results, two socio-economic household surveys will be carried out, in year one, and three
of the Project. These surveys will be carried out in the targeted CAs and will look at the
economic conditions of the population inside the CAs, their buffer zones, as well as the
benefits they obtain from their surrounding natural resources, and their levels of
satisfaction with the CAs. The Project is estimated that over 11,200 households (around
56,000 people) will benefit directly from the Project. A significant portion of this
population is found in the poorest areas of Mozambique: the rural population in the
Central and Northern regions and coastal areas.

6. The Project is expected to create the foundations for future MozBio Program phases.
Potential future phases of the SoP would draw on lessons from the Project. They would
extend financial and technical support to other CAs (including support to further
infrastructure development) and scale up the support to local communities, particularly
by providing more technical and financial support to scale up those income-generating
activities shown to be viable in Phase 1.
