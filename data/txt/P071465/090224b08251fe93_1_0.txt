                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final implementation status update as the project will close on June 30, 2014. The project has achieved most of the results envisaged at appraisal stage:
                         (i) four of five PDO Indicators, i.e., new capital investments in private tourism or conservation-related; tourism ventures that are in conformity with Tourism Plans (TPs) in targeted
                         project sites; bed-nights in tourism facilities in the targeted districts; and local residents employed in conservation & tourism in target districts are all fully achieved and end of the
                         project target exceeded.
                         (ii) two of three GEO Indicators, i.e., area with agriculture, habitation or incompatible land use in all areas zoned for biodiversity conservation; and population index of bioindicator
                         species in formal Protected Areas (PAs) are also fully achieved and end of the project target exceeded.
                         (iii) the remaining one PDO Indicator (i.e., total annual revenues generated by targeted formal Protected Areas (PAs)) and one GEO Indicator (i.e., area formally designated &
                         managed for biodiversity conservation) were partially achieved, 97% and 66% respectively.
                         (iv) Nine of 14 Intermediary Outcome Indicator targets have also been achieved or exceeded.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This is the final implementation status update. The project has achieved most of the results envisaged at appraisal stage and almost fully disbursed the funds:

                         RESULTS:
                         (i) Four of five PDO Indicators, i.e., new capital investments in private tourism or conservation-related; tourism ventures that are in conformity with Tourism Plans (TPs) in targeted
                         project sites; bed-nights in tourism facilities in the targeted districts; and local residents employed in conservation & tourism in target districts are all fully achieved and end of the
                         project target exceeded. The fifth PDO Indicator (i.e., total annual revenues generated by targeted formal Protected Areas (PAs)) has made progress and 97% of end of the project
                         target has been achieved.
                         (ii) Two of three GEO Indicators, i.e., area with agriculture, habitation or incompatible land use in all areas zoned for biodiversity conservation; and population index of bioindicator
                         species in formal Protected Areas (PAs) are also fully achieved and end of the project target exceeded. The third Indicator (i.e., area formally designated & managed for biodiversity
                         conservation) has made progress and 66% of end of the project target has been achieved.
                         (iii) Nine of 14 Intermediary Outcome Indicators have also been achieved or exceeded.
