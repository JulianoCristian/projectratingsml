                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In 2011, the project team focused its attention on protected area planning, on community sub-projects and infrastructure developments. The project made progress, but did not
                         complete all planned activities for 2011. The following project achievements can be noted: (i) The management of protected areas under the project has improved with significant
                         progress in the Maputo Special Reserve and Ponta do Ouro Marine Reserve. (ii) All protected areas have been declared mine free and have adopted management plans. (iii) Three
                         protected areas are redefining their boundaries with the objective to exclude as much as possible encroached land. Manica Province and Vilanculos District adopted Tourism Master
                         Plans. (iv) Matutuine District adopted its Integrated District Development Plan. Several thousand hectares land areas around protected areas have been demarcated for community
                         usage. (v) The first community-private lodge opened in Moribane in the Chimanimani Reserve and six have been approved as community sub-projects and are under construction.
                         (vi) At the national level, a Conservation Policy has been adopted by cabinet and a new Conservation Bill completed consultations and is almost ready to be submitted to cabinet.
                         (vii) A new protected area institution, ANAC, has been approved and its establishment is starting. With one and a half years of project implementation period remaining, the project
                         implementation team has been advised to focus on completing the protected area transformation plan, complete the implementation of all sub-projects in the pipeline and accelerate
                         infrastructure development in the protected areas.
