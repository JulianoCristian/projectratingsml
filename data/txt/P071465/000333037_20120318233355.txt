     TRANSFRONTIER CONSERVATION AREAS AND TOURISM DEVELOPMENT
                             PROJECT

                                        Restructuring Paper

1.      The Transfrontier Conservation Areas and Tourism Development Project (TFCATDP) is
a US$35.1 million project with a SDR 13.9 million (US$ 21.4 million equivalent) IDA Credit, a
US$10 million Global Environment Facility (GEF) Grant and a US$3.72 million PHRD Grant.
The Project became effective in April 2006. In 2011, the Project was restructured to amend the
Project’s results indicators, reallocate Grant proceeds, account for the withdrawal of a Project
partner and to adjust/cancel certain specific Project activities. The restructuring of the TFCATDP
was approved in August 2011.

2.       This paper requests a third restructuring to allow some corrections in the disbursement
tables of the IDA Credit and GEF Grant Agreements.

3.      The Project performance toward the Project Development Objective and the Global
Environment Objectives are rated satisfactory as demonstrated by the monitored outcomes
indicators. Project implementation is rated moderately satisfactory largely because of a
disbursement lag caused by initially slow procurement and difficulties in contract management.
To date, the cumulative IDA, PHRD and GEF disbursements amount to US$16.4 million (76%
overall disbursement), US$2.45 million (66% overall disbursement) and US$5.0 million (50%
disbursement), respectively. The Project is closing on June 30, 2013.

4.     Under the IDA Credit, the restructuring corrects the category description of Disbursement
Categories (3) Consultant Services and (4) Training. All allocations remain unchanged.

5.     IDA Credit. Proceeds for the Mozambique, Transfrontier Conservation Areas and
Tourism Development Project, Credit No 4130, P071465 will be rephrased as follows:

6.       Under the GEF Grant, the restructuring corrects the amount of Disbursement Category 1
from US$4.52 million to US$4.54 million, creates a new Disbursement Category 5 for
Component 4 Sub-projects and reallocates the US$2.77 million undisbursed balance of Category
3 for Component 3 Sub-Projects. This reallocation became necessary because Sub-Projects were
relocated from Component 3, Tourism Development to Component 4, Protected Area
Management in the 2011 restructuring. The numbering of Disbursement Categories also needs to
be adjusted as it was incorrectly changed in the 2011 restructuring: Category 5 Unallocated
returns to its initial labeling as Category 4 Unallocated while Category 4 Civil Works becomes
Category 6 Civil Works.

7.      GEF Grant. Proceeds for the Mozambique, Transfrontier Conservation Areas and
Tourism Development Project, Grant No TF56038, P076809 will be rephrased and reallocated as
