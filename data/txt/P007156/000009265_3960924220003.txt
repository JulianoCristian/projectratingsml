PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EL SALVADOR
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1738-ES
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Fourth Education
Project in El Salvador (Loan 1738-ES). The total loan amount was US$23.5
million, as approved by the Board on June 21, 1979.   The loan amount
disbursed vas US$18.68 million and US$4.82 million was cancelled.   The
final disbursement took place on January 26, 1989.
This PCR was prepared by the Human Resources Division of the
Technical Department in the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office.
It is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the record of the
Board discussion of this project, the Loan Agreement, and material in the
Bank's file pertaining to this project.   Bank staff connected with the
project were interviewed. Discussions were held with Borrower staff by a
Bank mission who visited San Salvador in May 1989.   No travel was
undertaken to the project areas outside San Salvador because of security
concerns.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for comment in
January 1990. The comments received have been reproduced, in English, as
Attachments I and II.

PROJECT CoMmLETION REPORT
EL SALVADOR
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(L-OAN 1738-ES)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
Identification of the Fourth Education Project was carried out by
a Bank mission in January 1978 and the project was appraised in September
1978, approved by the Board in June 1979 and the loan became effective in
January 1980.   The project's total cost was estimated to be US$33.6
million, including US$23.5 million from the Bank loan and US$10.1 million
from the Government of El Salvador (GOES).
Objective and Content of the Proiect
The Fourth Education Project aimed to support the broad objectives
set by the Salvadurian Government's Second and Third Education Development
Plans. It's main objectives includee. expanding bastc education and train-
ing opportunities for children and adults in rural areas; improving
quality, efficiency and school administration and supervision through the
establishment of an improved nuclearization system; and giving support to
industry by the training of technicians at a new post-secondary technologi-
cal institute (para. 2).
At appraisal the project was expected to be completed in 55 months
and comprised:   (a) construction, furnishing and/or equipping of the
following institutions: 50 rural basic education nuclei that included 356
schools (new, extensions/replacements as well as equipping only); office
and storage for teacher training (PPMS); office building for the Textbook
Division (PLANALIBRE); and a postsecondary technical institute; (b) teacher
training programs (pre-service, in-service and other training courses); (c)
textbooks and teaching materials (design, development, production and dis-
tribution of textbooks); (d) technical assistance (specialists services and
fellowships) and (e) project administration assistance - (Annex 1).
Implementation Experience and Results
Implementation of the project faced adverse circumstances and
complex situations (para. 4.) resulting in:  time overrun, reduction of
project size and scope and incorporation into the project of a new
component on school reconstruction in the San Salvador metropolitan area.
Implementation of the project spread over a period of 109 months (a 198
percent time overrun) and remained practically inactive for about two years
following project effectiveness date (disbursements were only 1 percent of
the appraisal estimate).   The time overrun was caused mainly by the



- vi -
Government's existing financial difficulties, which were aggravated by its
inability to cope with the financial and administrative burden imposed by
the simultaneous implementation of the Second and Fourth Education projects
and by a worsening of civil disobedience and political conflict in the
country.   In adjusting to the situation, the project size and scope was
reduced (para. 5b). On the other hand, the component on reconstruction of
300 classrooms was incorporated to the project in view of destruction
caused by the October 10, 1986 earthquake.
The project potential for meeting appraisal objectives and targets
was curtailed by the significant alterations/deletions that took place. A
main project objective consisting of training technicians for industry was
not achieved because the technology institute was deleted from the project.
The target for expanding basic education opportunities for rural children
was scaled down from 90,000 beneficiaries estimated at appraisal to 46,000
(para. 8).  The introduction in the project of the school reconstruction
coimponent switched the focus of the main project objective from rural to
urban basic education.
Perhaps the most significant achievement of the scaled down proj-
ect Was that nearly 54,000 children (41,500 rural and 12,000 urban) bene-
fitted fr   new or better school facilities and that an even greater number
benefitted from more and better books and better trained teachers. These
accomplishments were made possible by the successful implementation of
components that included construction, furnishing and equipping education
units.  They included:  500 rural school classrooms (83% of the adjusted
appraisal target); facilities for the PLANALIBRE and PPMS programs; and
the reconstruction of over 190 urban school classrooms (64% of the added
post-appraisal target).   Other targets were also successfully met.  The
PLAHALIBRE and the PPMS components both largely surpassed the appraisal
target (over twofold) and 4.5 million textbooks and teachers' guides were
produced and printed and over twenty thousand teachers, school directors/
administrators and school technicians were trained (paras. 8-10 and 11 and
Annex 1).
The project success in implementing quantitative targets was not
matched by improvements in quality, efficiency and school administration
and supervision, another project objective.   The major instrument for
achieving quality improvements (nuclearization) did not fully operate as
planned because four-grade associate schools (included at appraisal as an
innovation in nuclearization) did not fit local conditions and were sub-
sequently deleted from the project, while the use of multigrade teaching
did not materialize. The components on education supervision, curriculum
review and pre-service teacher training were not implemented and the train-
ing of school administrators had limited success (para. 9). The PLANALIBRE
and PPlS components were unable to utilize facilities provided by the
project, which handicapped their operations; despite this, PLANALIBRE was
able to produce books of good quality and content. However, the extent to
which the provision of textbooks and better qualified teachers improved the
quality of teaching measured by student performance is a matter that follow
up activities should be able to assess.   The project studies on these



- vii -
matters were not implemented.   The specialists services component was
scaled down in size and scope and was not implemented sufficiently early
and with adequate planning (Annexes I and 9). Lack of specialists services
adversely affected the areas of curricular revision and textbooks and in-
service teacher training education (para. 24).
Project effectiveness vas reduced by Borrower's difficulties in
meeting counterpart fun"' obligations, by political decisions made for
reasons of expedience and by weak PIU management during several years of
project implementation. It is quite likely that with a stronger PIU during
early implementation, better support to the project by the Ministry of
Education authorities and improvement of the cumbersome bureaucratic
procedures (para. 18), implementation time could have been greatly reduced
and project results could have been better.
9.       As far as IBRD performance is concerned, a major strength was
staff patience and flexibility.   Major weaknesses were: launching the
Fourth Education Project at an inappropriate time when scarce financial and
administrative scarce resources were co-mitted to the implementation of the
Second Project; accepting a model of school nuclearization unsuitable to
locel conditions; and being too lax with the Borrower regarding the early
approval of the "special account" and the implementation of education
quality and management improvements (para. 16).
Sustainability
Provided that the financial and political situation normalize and
the Government supports rural basic education as a priority, there should
not be concern about any serious sustainability problems.   PLANALIBRE,
perhaps the most successful and promising component, may face 0ceater sus-
tainability risks because of Its large dependence on external aid, pressing
demand and commitments regarding textbooks and its still-insufficient
institutional consolidation.   An evaluation study to examine means to
consolidate PLANALlBRE and alternatives to reduce the financial burden of
the program on the Government, including cost recovery options, should be
carried out.
Findinas and Lessons
In hindsight, it is clear that: (a) greater caution should have
been exercised at appraisal on assessing the Borrower's financial capacity
to implement the project simultaneously with another Bank-assisted project;
(b) the inclusion of components inconsistent with the main focus and objec-
tives of the project should have been discouraged; (c) educational models
or methods not supported by previous country experimentation should have
been avoided; (d) successful performance requires a strong PIU and an
aggressive PIU coordinator fully committed to the job; and (e) specialists
services programs require detailed planning and should be clearly defined
in the project to get full benefits. A system for monitoring and assessing
quality of services should be established by the Borrower.

improvement in agricultural productivity) had produced slow economic
growth; the annual growth rate of GDP per capita between 1968 and 1978 was
about 1.4Z.  In order to make up for this shortcoming, the Salvadorian
Government was encouraging the use of the country's abundant human
resources by importing raw materials for domestic processing.   This
strategy required specialization in export-oriented industrial activities
and investment in human capital formation to improve productivity of the
labor force.   Therefore, the Government had prepared a Third Education
Development Plan (1978-82) on the basis of a comprehensive USAID assisted
sector study. The Government also had plans to expand and improve basic
education further through implementation of its strategy program "Expansion
and Improvement of Rural Basic Education." Py the year 1985, the program
was expected to increase enrollment in the first two cycles of rural
schools (grades 1 to 6) from 702 (1970) to 89Z of students in the corres-
ponding age group and for the third cycle from 81 (1970) to 372, through
construction of 4,000 additional classrooms. Strategies for improving the
efficiency and quality of rural basic education relied on the extension of
a revised nuclearization system,.J which included the expanding double
shift attendance and multigrade teaching.   Other areas of improvement
included teacher training, curriculum and teaching materials revision and
education services.  The vlan's main objectives were to:  (a) strengthen
the education system and i. ;rove quality and efficiency of basic education
to redress inequities between urban and rural areas; (b) fill the gaps in
post-secondary technological education; and (c) continue expanding non-
formal education and training programs for out-of-school youths and adults.
Project Obiectives
2.      The fourth education project provided technical and financial
assistance to the government to help implement the high priority educa-
tional investment programs included in the aecond and third education
development plans.   It supported the following efforts selected at
appraisal:   (a) expand basic education and training opportunities for
11 Nuclearization is a school location and administrative system whereby a
Central Nuclei School (trades 6 to 9) is linked to a number of
neighlioring schools offering either six grades ("subcentral" schools)
or four grades ("Associate" schools).   Central nuclei-schools have
responsibility for overseeing administration and supervision of the
nuclei.

children and adults in rural areast  (b) improve the quality, efficiency,
and school administration and supervision through the establishment of an
improved school nuclearization eystem; tc) expand in-service training
programs for basic education teachers and school directors; (d) 6xpand
production of textbooks and teacher materials for basic education; and (e)
establish a new post eecondary technological institute to increase oppor-
tunities for training of technician. in selected priority specialties
needed for industrial developwint. Subsequent project revisions are shown
in Annex 1.
Project Design and Ornsnization
3.       The project was designed following GOES priorities identified in a
USAID assisted eCication sector study.  It covered two main areass  (a)
rural basic education (Grades 1-9); and (b) establishment of the post-
secondary San Miguel Technological Institute. More details on the project
composition are given in Annex 1. The project aim was to strengthen rural
basic education and to expand nuclearization, a new system the GOES had
been experimenting with for several years. It should be pointed out how-
ever, that in rural basic education an innovation adopted in the project
consisting in the introduction of four-grade associate schools in the
organization of the nuclearization system did not fit into the structure of
basic education in the country (3 cycles of 3 grades each); also that the
inclusion in the project of the Institute of Technology was questionable
considering that the Institute's level, technical nature, complexity of
execution and objectives departed drastically and vere offline with the
major focus of the project.  Both the associste schools and the Institute
of Technology were deleted from the project at a later stage.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.       Implementation of the project faced many adverse circumstances,
some unforeseen, with serious implications for project content, progress
and outcome:
(a) A substantial fall in the country's economy and shortage of avail-
able counterpart financing hampered project implementation partic-
ularly in the period 1980-1983;
(b) Civil disobedience and political turmoil weakened the country's
economy, caused loss of life and destruction (including project
schools, as in Usulutan department) and impaired project implemen-
tation and supervision leading to Bank suspension of loan dis-
bursements (January - July, 1981) and an amendment to scale down
school construction in areas of conflict (see Annex 1);
(c) The earthquake on October 10, 1986, destroyed hundreds of schools
in Metropolitan San Salvador, and GOES priority switched from the
construction of rural basic schools to the reconstruction of
schools in metropolitan Ssn Salvador (see project amendment in
Annex 1);



(d)  Certain factors intrinsic to the project affected implementation:
Insufficient support from some higher authorities of the Ministry
of Education; weak project management in the initial years of
implementation; political interference and burdensome procedures
for the approval of contracts, bidding documents, and other dis-
bursements. The lack of liquidity, identified in supervision as
early as 1982, was not addressed until 1986 when a "special
account" was established by the 8orrow.r after a long legal and
bureaucratic process. Even so, it subsequendly remained inactive.
5.       Critical gaps between planned and actual project implementation
appear in the elapsed time required for project closing and proiect
content.
(a)  Elapsed Time.  The project was closed nearly five years beyond the
closing date expected at appraisal.  Major causes for delay were
rightly predicted at appraisal under the risks section:  shortage
of counterpart funds and inability of the existing adw4nistration
to adhere to a fixed schedule.  GOES was unable to cope with the
financial and administrative burden imposed by the simultaneous
implementation of the second and fourth education projects.
During the period 1980-1982, only 12 of the appraisal estimate was
disbursed.   Only in 1986, with the change of PIU director did
disbursements climb to about 342 of the appraisal estimate.  The
appointment of arother PIU director employed on a permanent basis,
who replaced another appointed on an acting position, improved
management during the period 1987-1988, so that by the closing of
the project, disbursements had attained 802 of the appraisal
estimates.   The speed of project implementation could have been
significantly improved by a stronger PIU with better support from
authorities in the Ministry of Education.
(b) Proiect Content. The major variances in project content were the
following:
(i)    reduction by amendment in August 1983 of the number of
education nuclei from 50 to 40 and the total number of
schools from 245 to 205 - (see Annex 1);
(ii)    deletion of equipment for 111 existing schools, which
was subsequently financed instead by USAID;
(iii)    deletion of the San Miguel Institute of Technology by
amendment of July, 1986 (see Annex 1).
(iv)    failure to implement the cmponent on training 700 new
teachers at Ciudad Normal because the premises of the
institution were occupied by the armed forces;
(v)    deletion of the conetruction of four-grade associate
schools - see para. 3k(c) - by IBRD/Borrower agreement
because rural basic schools with less than six grades
were inappropriate to local conditions;



(iv)    Due to political and security reasons nuclei supervision
was discontinued, and project assistance to educational
3upervision did not materialize.
6.       The following lessons for design, organization and implementation
may be drawns
(a) The Borrower's capability to provide counterpart fuuds and manage
the project should be assessed carefully at appraisal, especially
when another Bank-assisted project is being implemented simul-
taneously.   The experience in this project shows that the
appraisal assessment indicated risks of shortage of counterpart
funds and weakness in management. The seriousness of these risks
and the likelihood that implementation would be disrupted were
perhaps underestimated (para. 5).
(b) The project should exclude components inconsistent with the main
focus and overall objectives of the project (see para. 3C related
to the San Miguel Institute of Technology);
(c) Educationsl models or methods not supported by previous country
experimentation should be avoided unless the project is itself
experimental.   The "revised" model of nuclearization included
associate schools which were inadequate to the country and
structure of the education system. This was a model that did not
operate and the multigrade method of teaching was not extended
(paras. 3C and 9).
III. PROJECT RESULTS
7.       The comparison between actual project results and appraisal proj-
ect objectives is complicated because of significant alterations/deletions
that took place during implementation (see Annex 1).
8.       A major project objective was to expand basic education and train-
ing opportunities to 90,000 rural children and 12,500 out-of-school youths
and adults in the rural area. The project target of 90,000 students was
later reduced to about 46,000 students when the equipping of 111 school was
deleted from the Project.21 Project school enrollment in 1988 reached over
41,000 students in rural schools and 12,000 students in urban schools (see
Annexes 7 and 8).  For rural students, enrollment met 91S of the adjusted
target (46,000 students). Given all project problems this is a remarkable
result.
9.       The results of the project on quality, efficiency, administration,
and supervision were not fully satisfactory.   The major instrument to
achieve improvements (nuclearization) did not operate as expected because
associate schools were deleted and multigrade teaching was not expanded as
planned.   Education supervision was practically abolished for security
reasons, and curriculum improvement was not reviewed as expected. Attempts
2/ Financed by USAID.



- 5 -
to improve nuclei administration through the training of nuclei directors
were offset by high job mobility. The major quality improvements made were
perhaps related to the PLANALIRRE31 and PPMS components.4/
10.     The PLANALIBRE's component produced about 4.5 million copies of
textbooks and teacher guides for grades 1 to 6, nearly 2.4 times the com-
bined appraisal targets (see Annex 1). Design and quality of the books is
good. The planning for the production of textbooks for grades 7 to 9 has
also been implemented (not included originally in the project) and teachers
have been trained in the use of the books.  PLANALIBRE'S buildings have
been constructed and equipped.
11.     There are, however, three points of concern about the PLANALIBRE
component: (a) no information is available on the impact of PLANALIBRE'S
textbooks on student performance; (b) the project building and vehicles for
PLANALIBRE are being used for purposes other than the project as the build-
ing was taken over by the Ministry of Culture as a consequence of the
earthquake; and (c) there is uncertainty about sustainability of the
PLANALIBRE program, a matter dealt with in the "sustainability" section.
12.     The PPMS component exceeded the appraisal target by about 2001
(see Annex 1). It provided in-service training to teachers, school direc-
tors and deputy schools directors.   The quality of the courses did not
fully satisfy expectations, owing to a shortage of funds and a reduction in
time devoted to the program by instructors. The construction and equipping
of the building for the PPMS component was fully implemented. PPMS major
drawbacks are: (a) lack of adequate planning, strategy and evaluation of
the program (for example, the proposed study of the impact of school
resources input on the performance and achievement of trainees was not
done); (b) inadequate management (for example, there are no data on number
of participants by type of course in the various regions); and (c) project
PPMS facilities are currently lodged in the Ministry of Education
Technology Department.  Both PLANALIBRE and PPMS are operating in this
building. An evaluation study along the lines of that recommended for
PLANALIBRE in para. 15 is warranted.
13.     Actual project costs (US$25.5 million - see Annex 5A) represent
76% of the project cost estimated at appraisal (US$33.6 mi:llion).   The
Borrower utilized 80% of the US$23.5 million loan fund originally allocated
to the project - see Annex 4A. The actually-used loan funds amounted to
US$18.7 million.   US$4 million was cancelled when the Technological
Institute was dropped and US$0.8 million cancelled at the closing date. In
the final analysis, the Loan covered 732 of the actual project costs, as
opposed to the 70% originally stipulated in the Loan Agreement which was
subsequently amended to 75%.
14.      In summary, nearly 54,000 students (41,500 rural and 12,000 urban)
benefited from better schools and an even greater number benefitted from
more and better textbooks and better trained teachers.   The impact on

student p;r.z.,c,  ,nu .aievement is unknown. Appraisal objectives to
improve quality, eificiency and supervision and administration were probab-
ly too ambitious.   Adult education was practically nil because of shortage
of funds and inadequate organization. The many obstacles, some unforeseen,
and discussed elsewhere in this report, explain why the project did not
meet the objectives more fully.
Proiect Sustainabilitv
15.      It is hoped that once the economy improves and the political situ-
ation stabilizes in the country, project inputs not being currently
utilized for project purposes would be restored (PLANALIBRE, PPMS, Ciudad
Normal) and educational services would be normalized and improved, giving a
higher return on investments made in the project. With regard to the text-
book component (PLANALIBRE), which was successfully developed from its
embryonic stage due to project assistance, there are three important points
to consider for its consolidation and further development: (a) the program
has been so far heavily dependant on external assistance; (b) immediate
program needs include the printing of textbooks for 7-9 grade students and
for the substitution of a large part of textbooks for 1-6 grade students
and increase enrollment by new students in these grades; and (c) available
information is insufficient regarding the immediate and longer term
planning of PLANALIBRE's textbook production and printing and on other
important aspects such as textbook demand, program effectiveness (measured
by students performance), management efficiency, feasibility of local text-
book printing (most are done abroad), costs, program financing require-
ments, institutional needs. PLANALIBRE program requires consolidation, and
to this effect, it is suggested that:  (a) an evaluation study be carried
out on the financial, managerial and educational aspects of the program;
and (b) the study should examine cost recovery options or other alterna-
tives to reduce GOES financial burden of the program.
IV. BANK PERFORMANCE
16.      Perhaps the major strength in Bank performance was the attitude of
patience and flexibility adopted to resolve complex project situations. On
the other hand, the completion mission considers that:  (a) the timing to
launch the Fourth Education Project was inappropriate for reasons already
discussed; (b) the Bank should have avoided including a theoretical model
of nuclearization that was not operational at the time of appraisal (see
para. 3c); (c) the Bank suipervision should have stimulated the Borrower to
implement improvements in quality and management (curriculum, technical
assistance, evaluation studies on school resources inputs on students
performance and achievements, teacher training management); (d) the Bank
should have been more active in promoting the Borrower's approval of the
"special account" (lack of liquidity was consistency identified from 1982
onwards; the special account was eventually approved by Borrower four years
later); and (e) the Bank should have maintained close communication with
the Borrower in the early years of project implementation (no progress
reports from the Borrower and two years 12/79-02/80 with no supervision
visiting the country) - see page iii.



V. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
17.      The major weaknesses in Borrower performance were financial,
political and managerial in nature.   The Borrower had serious financial
difficulties in meeting its counterpart funding obligations, a major reason
for reducing the size of the project and for the numerous extensions in the
closing date. The Borrower made several decisions for reasons of expedi-
ency (understandable given civil disorder and the earthquake) that reduced
project effectiveness:  appointments; transfers of personnel; the switch
from rural schools to reconstruction of urban schools, cancelling the
educational supervision component; utilizing project facilities (PLANALIBRE
and PPMS) for activities other than those targeted at project appraisal.
18.      The project had its weakest point in PIU's management during the
first six to seven years of implementation; The Ministry of Education gave
it only cursory support. Cumbersome procedures of the "Corte de Cuentas"
(local control office) in processing the approval of contracts, biddings
and other documents (on average seven months elapsed between contract award
and contract effectiveness) were a further problem.
19.      The PIU director held another job, which prevented his full
commitment to the project. With the change of PIU coordinator after nearly
six years of project implementation, the Borrower's performance started to
improve, and with the assignment of a permanent position in 1987 of a new
PIU coordinator there was an even greater improvement. Better performance
was due to better management and helped by:   availability of new funds
allocated by the Bank to the "Special Account" converted to colones; a
better defined geographical area of stability in the political conflict;
and that implementation of civil works for the reconstruction program was
made up of larger units with higher disbursement value.
20.      The lesson is that successful performance requires a strong PIU
and an aggressive PIU coordinator fully committed to the job.  The Bank
should be assured by the Borrower at appraisal of the above condition for
appointing the PIU coordinator and should monitor the matter in project
supervision.
VII. PROJECT RELATIONSHIP
21.      The relationship between Bank and Borrower was characterized by:
(a) Bank patience that permitted several extensions and a grace period, (b)
flexibility tha. permitted amendments to adapt the project to the changing
socio-economic environment  including the Bank's decision to increase in
the Bank share of the total project cost financing from 702 to 752, and (c)
a positive and swift reaction to the October 10, 1986, earthquake, which
permitted the development of a school reconstruction program in metro-
politan San Salvador from Loan 1738-ES.
22.      Good collaboration between GOES/BANKIUSAID developed in the pre-
appraisal atsge for assisting rural basic education. USAID supported the
expansion of existinx rural schools and pre-service teacher training; the



- 8 -
Bank supported construction of new, and replacement of existing, rural
schools and in-service teacher training.   In project amendments this
collaboration continued including in the reconstruction of schools in
Metropolitan San Salvador due to the October 1986 earthquake.   However,
duplication was not completely avoided, as happened in the area of text-
books, an area where financial responsibilities were not well defined
originally.   This definition is an essential element for establishing a
system of successful collaboration.
23.      The PlU was unsuccessful in maintaining an adequate relationship
with other Government departments and in some cases (PPMS) it was unable to
get timely and appropriate information about project activities and costs.
VII. SPECIALISTS AND FELLOWSHIPS
24.      The appraisal technical assistance component was modified and
reduced (see Annexes 1 and 9). Implementation of the technical assistance
program had a late start because the PIU had some difficulties acquiring
specialist services, whether through personal contacts or through institu-
tions (UNESCO). Implementation of specialists services was low in relation
to the original target (35Z) because this was reduced by amendment and
better in relation to the adjusted target (842) - see Annex 1.  On the
other hand, the fellowship program surpassed the revised target and met 82%
of the original appraisal target.   The failure to obtain specialist
services in some areas (curriculum, in-service teacher training evaluation,
school supervision and administration) is likely to have adversely affected
project outcomes, particularly as these were areas not covered by the
fellowship program - see Annex 9. Technical assistance programs, because
of their nature and complexity, require detailed planning and they should
be clearly delineated early in the project to get full benefits. This was
not the case in the project. The lack of a system for monitoring these
services during project execution renders impractical any judgement on
their quality in this report.
VIII.   PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
25.      The Borrower expressed the view that the list of covenants in the
Loan Agreement was adequate and considered them helpful to maintain the
structure of the project despite the numerous changes of administration in
the Ministry of Education. The Borrower failed to prepare a PCR draft, as
agreed with the Bank, because bureaucratic procedures delayed approval of
the contract for consulting services.   See Annex 6 about this covenant
Section 3.10(d). However, the mission was provided by the PIU with suffi-
cient information to prepare the PCR.

(a) Experience with this project points to the importance of proceding to implementation only after
ensuring that prerequisites for success are present, an obvious point but one that was ignored
in the face of substantial pressure to lend, i.e., (i) the project was permitted to proceed
with only minimal or weak assurance that the Government was able to provide the required
counterpart funds during implementation without reallocating from other p-)jects or important
activities; (ii) the most serious risk at appraisal was considered the possible delay in
execution due to frequent changes in high level personnel, lack of coordination among Ministry
of Education departments and inability of existing administrative machinery to adhere to a
fixed schedule.
(b) This is a rating from the last SPN (6/09188)

Note:   In twe componnte costs were euch sea I lr than the appr Isal

Technical Trainins: (a) the training of new teachers (costed at USS.6
millIon at approtisi) was not Implemented; and (b) the type. of course
were modified with shorter periods or *sminars, which reduced costs.
Technical Assistance: (a) By Loan Amendments, the appraisal target were
reduced to 41S for specialists services and to 32W In fellowships; (b) a
large proportion of speciallst services wre rendered by Salvadorias and
several fellowships were for course within the country, both factors costs
much lower.

I refer to your note of January 31, 1990 where you request
comments on the PCR Fourth Education, Loan 1738, prepared by the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office.
I would like to inform you that due to the fact that there
were deficiencies in the execution of this project on the part of said
Bank as well as the Government of El Salvador, represented by the
Ministry of Education, I would like to suggest that in order to reach
the objectives in the projects financed by said institution in due
time and avoid negative results as those stated in the report, there
should be made periodic evaluations that will allow us to solve the
deficiencies during the process of same.
We thank you for consideration.
