the\n            1978-1982 Third Education Development Plan. They include\n            expanding basic education and training opportunities for\n            children and adults in rural communities, improving the\n            quality and efficiency of rural school administration and\n            supervision, expanding in-service training programs for\n            basic education teachers and school directors, expanding the\n            production of textbooks and teaching material for basic\n            education, and establishing a new post-secondary\n            technological institute to train technicians in selected\n            priority specializations needed for the country's\n            industrial development. The project consists of\n            construction, replacement or expansion and equipping and\n            furnishing of 245 schools in rural communities, equipping\n            and furnishing of an additional 111 such schools; equipping\n            and furnishing new facilities being constructed at the\n            National Teacher Training School and provision of supplies\n            for the production of teacher training material; production\n            of about one million basic education textbooks and teaching\n            guides; construction, equipping, and furnishing of a new\n            post-secondary technical institute; and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
