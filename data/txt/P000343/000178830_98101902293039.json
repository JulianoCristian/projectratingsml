to\n            reduce transport costs on the south-north Transcameroonian\n            rail/road route and to improve overall transport planning\n            and coordination. It consists of: (a) reconstruction of the\n            Garoua-Figuil road (95 km) to two-lane paved standards; and\n            (b) technical assistance and fellowships to strengthen the\n            planning and coordination capacity of the Ministry of\n            Transport. The Third Highway Project would improve land\n            transport facilities for the external trade of Northern\n            Cameroon and Chad, and form an important part of the overall\n            development effort for Northern Cameroon by serving\n            agricultural, industrial and administrative centers. It\n            would also assist in better allocating scarce resources in\n            the transport sector. The risk that the main project\n            benefits would not materialize due to cost increases is\n            minimal, since the reconstruction contract has already been\n            awarded and work is starting."}, "docdt": "1978-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
