                         For the original NSAP credit ($35 million), 582 out of 600 sub-projects are completed. The remaining sub-projects are mostly near completion pending the availability of additional

                         funds promised by the government. A Beneficiary Assessment found that the project was successful in driving significant increases in access to services for beneficiaries and
                         mitigating risk of renewed conflict at the level of communities. Over seventy percent (78%) of all respondents rated projects implemented in their communities as either successful or
                         very successful, and there was no difference by gender. Phase 1 ($4m) of the Cash for Work (CfW) component has now concluded, with a total of 367 small works projects
                         completed. The first phase created temporary employment for 16,515 people, which translates into 825,750 person-days of labor.

                         After being launched in March 2010, phase II of the Cash for Work program ($4 million) has progressed well and is fully disbursed. As of September 30, 2010, all 358 sub-projects
                         had received their first tranche of financing from NaCSA, and 297 had received the second tranche. Of the 358 sub-projects, about 25% are agricultural activities, and 75% are
                         feeder roads. 171 projects had been completed as of September 30, 2010. The number of beneficiaries reached in the second phase amounts to 16,110, bringing the total for the
                         entire project to 35,785, including the 3,160 beneficiaries of the Cash for Work pilot under the original NSAP credit. All sub-projects are expected to be completed by closing on
                         December 31, 2010.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          Given the upcoming project closing, NaCSA agreed to begin preparation of its Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The preparation of the Bank's ICR will begin soon for
                         completion before June 30, 2011. NaCSA's own completion report should be completed well in advance of that of the Bank and will be attached as an Annex to the Bank's ICR.
