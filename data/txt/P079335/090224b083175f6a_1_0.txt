 SAFETY NETS FOR THE POOR

 Restoring Access to Basic Services in a
 Post-War Sierra Leone




Overview
The National Social Action Project (NSAP) has restored infrastructure and services, and built
capacity for collective action in war-affected and poor communities in Sierra Leone. Over
700,000 people have gained access to health facilities, 360,000 children to educational
facilities, and over 115,000 people to economic infrastructure such as markets. In addition, over
30,000 people, including unemployed youth, female-headed households and vulnerable rural
and urban households are benefitting from an emergency Cash-for-Work program that was
introduced as a new component and as a response to food price increases.


Challenge
Sierra Leone emerged from a 10-year civil war in 2002 with
                                                                   More Results

rebel-held areas. Following the war, it had the lowest Human

Development Index in the world, with 82 percent of its
population living below the poverty line, approximately a
quarter of its population without access to safe drinking
water, only 52 percent of children enrolled in school, and         people gained access to
                                                                   improved health and sanitation

                                                                   equipped between 2004-2009
—including a 125 percent rise in the price of wheat flour and
a 60 percent increase in the price of rice—severely
threatened the food security of the poor and vulnerable.

The NSAP was designed to provide an immediate and a
tangible response to the gaps in basic service availability,
with the priority on the areas and populations most affected

project activities and resources were targeted to the newly

Bank Contribution

IDA provided US$35 million equivalent in financing. Under the Global Food Crisis Response
Program, the project received additional financial supportof US$8 million in 2008 and 2009 to
support the Cash-for-Work program in the wake of the food and financial crises.

Partners

There is a close collaboration with the World Food Program (WFP) in the implementation of
the Cash-for-Work sub-component of the operation, which builds on the lessons from
experience of WFP and other donor programs. In this context, the existing analytical work of
the WFP on shocks and vulnerability is used as a basis for targeting resources geographically
according to food insecurity.

Moving Forward

The lessons learned from the project, in particular the experiences working with communities,
have been carried forward into the design of a flagship program, the “Decentralized Service
Delivery Program,” approved by IDA in September 2009. In addition, NACSA, the implementing
institution, was given the mandate to lead the social protection agenda in Sierra Leone. With
support from IDA ( Youth Employment Support Project approved in June 2010), NACSA has
launched a labor-intensive public works program—the first large intervention of its kind, which
has been expanded nationwide. The NSAP experience in working with communities and local
institutions was taken into consideration in the design and launch of the Cash-for-Work
component of this new operation.

Beneficiaries

The Beneficiary Assessment found that the project was successful in driving significant
increases in access to services for beneficiaries, and mitigating risks of renewed conflict at the
level of communities. A sample survey of the Cash-for-Work component revealed that (i) cash
payments were timely for beneficiaries; and (ii) income earned by beneficiaries was spent on
food (47 percent), school fees (23 percent), basic needs (13 percent), health expenses (12
percent), and small business start-up (10 percent). A more comprehensive impact evaluation is
underway to collect information on beneficiary livelihoods.
