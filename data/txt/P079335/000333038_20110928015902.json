      Project for Sierra Leone were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            pilot rural public works program proved very useful in\n            laying the foundation for International Development\n            Association (IDA) to respond promptly to evolving country\n            priorities and scale up safety nets support in the face of\n            shocks. This underscored the importance of having scalable\n            safety nets systems in place before the onset of shocks in\n            order to respond effectively and in a well-targeted manner.\n            In fragile states, requiring counterpart funding from\n            Government can be counter-productive, especially when other\n            forms of ensuring government ownership are possible.\n            Government provision of counterpart funding became a problem\n            soon after the project commenced, as noted in the 2005\n            Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR). Government\n            displayed other signs of ownership, and implementation will\n            have proceeded more smoothly with 100 percent Bank\n            financing. The implementation of a sustained and tailored\n            capacity building program was important in fostering\n            community participation with local government in all stages\n            of the subproject cycle in a post conflict environment. The\n            creation of Project Management Committees (PMCs) served as a\n            catalyst in mobilizing communities to effectively\n            participate and perform their oversight and monitoring\n            functions. This in turn strengthened a sense of ownership\n            and led to sustained support to operations and maintenance.\n            The restoration of infrastructure and essential services, in\n            addition to their own merits, also generated social benefits\n            by promoting cohesiveness, rebuilding trust and fostering\n            community engagement."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
