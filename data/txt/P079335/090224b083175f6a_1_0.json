Sierra Leone emerged from a ten year civil war in\n            2002 with most of its basic infrastructure in ruins,\n            particularly in the rebel-held areas. Following the war, it\n            had the lowest Human Development Index in the world. The\n            National Social Action Project (NSAP) was designed to\n            provide an immediate and a tangible response to the gaps in\n            basic service availability, with the priority on the areas\n            and populations most affected by the war. The project was\n            set to maximize the capacities of local civil society,\n            communities and local governments. NSAP had restored\n            infrastructure and services, and built capacity for\n            collective action in war-affected and poor communities in\n            Sierra Leone. Over 7 million people had gained access to\n            health facilities, 3.6 million children to educational\n            facilities, and over 1.15 million people to economic\n            infrastructure such as markets. In addition, an emergency\n            Cash-for-Work program was introduced as a new component in\n            the project, and as a response to food price increases. Over\n            30,000 people, including unemployed youth, female-headed\n            households and vulnerable rural and urban households were\n            benefitted from the program. NSAP was successful in driving\n            significant increases in access to services for\n            beneficiaries, and mitigating risks of renewed conflict at\n            the level of communities."}, "docdt": "2010-09-14T08:09:04Z"}
