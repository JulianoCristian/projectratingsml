"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objective of the Co-financing of the\n            National Social Action Project  for Sierra Leone is to\n            assist war-affected or otherwise vulnerable communities to\n            restore infrastructure and services, build local capacity\n            for collective action, and assist vulnerable households to\n            access temporary employment opportunities, with priority\n            given to areas not previously serviced by the government,\n            newly accessible areas (those which were under rebel control\n            until January 2002), food insecure areas, and the most\n            vulnerable population groups within those areas. The\n            rationale behind the co-financing will be to capitalize on\n            the solid performance of the International Development\n            Association (IDA)-funded National Social Action Project\n            (NSAP) to put in place and scale up safety net interventions\n            to help the poor cope with the drastic increases in food\n            prices in Sierra Leone. Global food prices have increased 26\n            percent over 2004 - 2007, and food crop prices are expected\n            to remain above 2004 levels through 2015. The average export\n            price for rice, for example, increased from US$375 per\n            metric ton in January 2008 to US$775 per metric ton by June\n            2008. In Sierra Leone, rice is the main staple food in both\n            urban and rural areas; furthermore, the country produces\n            only two thirds of the national consumption (355,000 metric\n            tons per year), with the shortfall sourced though imports\n            and food aid. As such, Sierra Leone is particularly\n            vulnerable to rising food prices and the Food and\n            Agriculture Organization (FAO) has listed Sierra Leone as\n            one of the eight most vulnerable food deficient low income\n            countries globally in the current food prices crisis."}, "docdt": "2008-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
