Lessons learned: Pilot projects offer\n            feasible opportunities for developing instruments and\n            testing models. The timing of a health project that seeks to\n            test reform elements is particularly sensible, and not\n            always perfectly manageable. Incentives remain a critical\n            variable in order to guarantee results. Performance\n            evaluations are critical, even more in learning efforts.\n            Consensus building is critical, but requires proper\n            instruments with the correct timing. Human resources and\n            labor-related issues remain a major bottleneck for health\n            sector reform and can not be underestimated. Persistence is\n            fundamental for a learning experience to take place."}, "docdt": "2005-07-20T00:00:00Z"}
