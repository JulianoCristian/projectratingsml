support the Government\n            of Panama's health strategy to improve the efficiency\n            of health expenditures, and the accessibility and\n            utilization of health services across all population groups,\n            particularly the poor. The project consists of four\n            components. The first component will implement the piloting\n            of a new model for providing, organizing, and financing\n            health services in San Miguelito Health Region. The second\n            component will initiate the strengthening of the Ministry of\n            Health (MOH) central level in the areas of policy making,\n            regulation, and financing in order to support the pilot. It\n            will also implement the corporate agreement between the MOH\n            and Social Security Institute in key strategic areas. The\n            third component will carry out studies, pilots, technical\n            assistance, and training activities to scale up the reform\n            to other health regions. It will also facilitate the\n            constitution of health reform teams in other health regions\n            together with the adaptations of the San Miguelito pilot to\n            local conditions. Finally, the fourth component will finance\n            administrative and operating costs of both the Project\n            Coordinating Unit and the health region over a period of\n            three years."}, "docdt": "1998-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
