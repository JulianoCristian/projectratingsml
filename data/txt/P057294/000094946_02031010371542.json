  and the sustainability of the reform program supported by\n            the project is likely. Overall performance of the World Bank\n            is rated satisfactory: The Bank helped to sharpen the reform\n            agenda through frank and patient dialogue with the\n            Government, carefully nurtured the ownership of the reform\n            program in the country by raising awareness among\n            stakeholders of the need for reforms to address\n            Rwanda's deep-seated econonomic and social problems.\n            Borrower performance is also overall satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include the following: To be effective, the project\n            design needs to be sensitive to the capacities of government\n            and private entities in a post-conflict situation. It is\n            important to be flexible and patient, and to regularly\n            consult with other development partners as capacity is weak\n            and operating conditions are subject to unexpected change.\n            There are often widely divergent perception of the risks,\n            which can be narrowed by dialogue between the parties.\n            Second, regular supervision missions and strong monitoring\n            by the Bank is esential when the Borrower's capacity is\n            limited. Provision of capacity building is essential. In the\n            case of Rwanda, the Bank overestimated the speed of\n            processing legislation through the bureaucracy, the Cabinet,\n            and the National Assembly. To avoid delays and undue\n            pressure on the National Assembly, it is recommended that\n            conditionality be linked only to presentation of the\n            relevant laws to the National Assembly."}, "docdt": "2002-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
