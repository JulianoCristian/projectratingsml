Following the massive return of more\n            than a million refugees to Rwanda, the World Bank in June\n            1997 approved a 50 million dollars economic reintegration\n            and recovery interest-free credit to support the\n            government's reform program and assist in the\n            resettlement and reintegration of those returning to their\n            homeland. The return of refugees to their communities during\n            1996 and 1997 boosted agricultural production, which rose 14\n            percent between 1996 and 1998. The reforms spurred a rapid\n            recovery of the private and financial sectors. Real gross\n            domestic product (GDP), which declined by 50 percent in\n            1994, rebounded by 24 percent between 1996 and 1998."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
