Recovering from Civil War in Rwanda                                                                      July 1, 2002
                      In 1995, the Rwandan post-war government started liberalizing the trade and currency regimes and
                      also key product markets.  Following the massive return of more than a million refugees to Rwanda, the
                      World Bank in June 1997 approved a $50 million Economic Reintegration and Recovery interest-free
                      credit to support the government’s reform program and assist in the resettlement  and reintegration of
                      those returning to
                      their homeland.

                       Some 1.3 million people have been resettled and reintegrated by the government, with the help of this
project. The credit has also been used to stimulate economic recovery and stability by providing foreign exchange for imports,
and by boosting private sector production and employment. The effects have been widespread.

The return of refugees to their communities during 1996 and 1997 boosted agricultural production, which rose 14 percent
between 1996 and 1998.  Dependency on emergency assistance, such as food aid, has waned.  Children went back to school
in large numbers and primary school enrolment rose to 88 percent in the 1998-1999 school year.  Health centers are
functioning.  The reforms spurred a rapid recovery of the private and financial sectors.  Real GDP, which declined by 50
percent in 1994, rebounded by 24 percent between 1996 and 1998.
