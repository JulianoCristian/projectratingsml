PROJECT ODMPLETION REPORT
CYPRUS: SECOND LOAN TO THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK
(LOAN 1278-CY)
HIGHLIGHTS
The objectives of Loan 1278-CY was to provide assistance to Cyprus at
a time when its economy had suffered a severe setback.   Specifically, the Loan
was to provide funds to CDB to finance medium-sized industrial and tourism
projects which provide substantial employment opportunities and foreign
exchange earnings, to provide for the first time in Cyprus assistance to small
scale industries, and to provide a conduit for Bank assistance for rebuilding
CDB and prepare it for its assigned role as a major factor for stimulating
industrial development in Cyprus (para 4.01).
These objectives were achieved. A total of 34 larger and 106 small
scale industries projects with an aggregate cost of $30 million were financed
with the assistance of the $6 million Bank loan, and 1,100 new jobs were
created.  CDB, in its restructured form, financed about one-fifth of private
sector manufacturing projects, participated in nearly all major hotel
projects, and has become active in promotion including joint ventures with
IFC. In addition, IFC is providing assistance to CDB's initiative to develop
a capital market and investment bank in Cyprus.   CDB now also provides
technical, financial and managerial advice to its borrowers (para 5.01).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CYPRUS: SECOND LOAN TO THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK
(LOAN 1278-CY)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Cyprus Development Bank Limited (CDB) was founded in [963, at the
initiative of the Government of Cyprus, as a new type of institution, deriving
financial support from both the Government and the private sector, and
designated to provide medium and long-term loans and equity capital for
industry and tourism and other private productive enterprises, to act as
underwriter for securities of these enterprises, to promote new enterprises,
and to assist entrepreneurs in preparing investment proposals. CDB was also
to mobilize domestic and foreign capital for long-term investment purposes by
the sale of its own shares and debentures locally, by borrowing abroad, and by
providing its guarantee to Cypriot enterprises desiring to borrow abroad.
CDB's authorized share capital is C£3 million of which C£1 million has been
issued and fully paid-up; this consisted of 400,000 C£1 Class "A" voting
shares originally held by some 890 private investors and 600,000 CUl Class "B"
non-voting shares held by the Government.
1.02     The first Bank loan to CDB of $3 million, approved in 1972, helped to
finance the foreign exchange component of 17 projects with a total value of
$20.6 million. The events of 1974 in Cyprus disrupted CDB's operations. Many
of the enterprises financed by CDB in the northern area either closed down or
operated at a greatly reduced rate, and were no longer under CDB's control or
supervision.
1.03     The 1974 events had serious consequences for CDB.    CDB's portfolio in
the northern area, amounting to half of its outstanding total loans and to
one-third of its total equity holdings at the end of 1975, was lost, and CDB
was subsequently saved from insolvency only through a Government rescue
operation. The Government, with the objective of making CDB the major
instrument of development assistance to industry and tourism, restructured and
refinanced CDB in 1976 with World Bank assistance. The Government took over
all the voting rights from the private shareholders, and agreed to provide CDB
with grants and guarantees of payment to offset past and future non-payments
of principal and interest on the northern area portfolio; CDB also received
compensation for its small equity holding in the north.
1.04     In conjunction with a $4.0 million financing by the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW), the Bank made a second loan to CDB for $6.0 million, which
included an allocation of $0.75 for small scale industries (SSI). This second
loan was approved by the Executive Directors on May 28, 1976, and is described
in Appraisal Report 1079a-CY of May 10, and in the President's Report
P-1853-CY of May 11, 1976; these reports also contain a more detailed
description of the Government restructuring and refinancing scheme.

1.05     This project completion report (PCR) deals with the second loan.
This loan was given to a restructured CDB, operating with specific Government
guarantees to compensate for most of the losses incurred as a result of the
foreign intervention.
1.06     CDB co-operated fully with the PCR preparation mission, and has
provided a substantial amount of the data used in this report which relate,
after 1974, to the Government controlled, southern section of the island.
Data relating to CDB's financial overall performance and economic impact (para
4.09) relate to all resources used, including those provided under the Bank's
third loan to CDB, Loan 1744-CY of $5.0 million, including $1.0 million for
SSI. See Staff Appraisal Report 2471-CY and President's Report P-2598-CY,
both dated June 14, 1979. As of October 1981, 98% of this loan had been
committed and 92% had been disbursed.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
A. Background
2.01      Cyprus became an independent country in 1960 and now has a total
population of about 620,000. Since independence, the country has been
troubled by political difficulties arising from the intercommunal disputes
between the Greek Cypriots majority (80%) and Turkish Cypriots minority
(20%). In spite of these difficulties, Cyprus as a whole had an impressive
growth record. Economic growth averaged over 7% per annum in real terms from
1960-72, but an unprecedented drought lead to stagnation in 1973. The events
of 1974 led to a major upheaval of the political, economic and social life in
Cyprus. A de facto Turkish-Cypriot administration took control of the
northern part, which included rich agricultural areas, a quarter of industrial
investments, cities with important tourism investments and infrastructure, and
the island's major port of Famagusta. A massive displacement of population
took place as 180,000 Greek Cypriots moved south, and about 45,000 Turkish
Cypriots left for the north; about one-third of each community was thus
displaced. Full employment was replaced by an unemployment rate of about 25%
in the southern, Government-controlled area, although less than half of those
unemployed registered at labor exchanges.
B. Economic Development 1975-1981
2.02     After the 1974 events, the Government set up a relief service for the
refugees which supported almost 140,000 people; embarked on a large housing
program; reduced incomes in both the public and private sectors on a
progressive scale, and channelled the proceeds into refugee relief; and
embarked on an expansionary monetary and fiscal policy to supplement private
demand which was greatly reduced in 1975. The Government, through Emergency
Economic Action Plans, put emphasis on the promotion of export-oriented light
industries and on tourism; in both sectors CDB plays an important role.
2.03      The economy recovered rapidly; after a significant drop in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 1975, the economy grew continuously but at a
declining rate, as shown below (constant 1973 factor cost);

Year     GDP          Change                Year         GDP        Change
(C£ Mil.)     in GDP (%)                       (C£ Mil.)     in GDP (Z)
1975       204.8      -19.3                 1978         303.6      +7.7
1976       244.5      +19.4                 1979         326.5      +7.5
1977       281.9      +15.3                 1980         340.6      +4.3
The slowing down of the increase in the GDP after 1977 is not surprising,
since much of the fixed assets lost had been rapidly replaced, unemployment
became minimal, and the international economic climate--which has a direct and
immediate effect on the country's export-oriented industries and
tourism--became less favorable. The composition of the GDP has not changed
significantly between 1975 and 1980, with the exception of an increase in the
share of the construction sector and a decline in the share of agriculture.
2.04       Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation (GDFCF) has also grown
continuously since 1975, as follows (at constant 1973 market prices):
Total     Change over                         Total       Change over

1975       40.2          -40                1978            98.5        +21
1976       51.8          +29                1979           105.9         +8
1977       81.7          +58                1980           111.3         +5
Housing continues to be by far the leading sector, while investment in
manufacturing after a rapid rise in 1975-78 showed a relative decline in 1979
and 1980, both in value and in the share to total GDFCF.
2.05     A significant development of the period under review is employment.
At the end of 1974, 24.5% of the economically active population were
unemployed, while by 1978 conditions of nearly full employment had been
achieved and have been maintained since.
2.06     After a decline in 1976, the increase in price levels, as measured by
the retail price index, rose steadily to reach 13.5% for 1980, the first ever
double digit inflation figure in the Republic. The development of inflation
since 1975 was as followst

2.07     The Government took a number of corrective measures to combat
inflation, but these were not fully effective and the budget deficit has
continued to increase. Monetary policy was hampered by a fixed interest rate
ceiling of 9%, set by the House of Representatives which so far has refused to
change this rate. Under the circumstances, the Central Bank resorted to
impose ceilings on bank credits in March 1980. (It is understood that the
Government intends to present a bill to the House of Representatives in late
1981 that would allow the Government to set maximum interest rates in line
with prevailing conditions).
III. CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK (CDB)
A. Position in 1975
3.01     Following the 1974 events CDB had lost control of, and access to loan
and equity investments of C£2.6 million ($7.1 million) in the northern area,
but had retained the liabilities related to borrowings incurred to finance
these projects. As the total book value of the holdings in the north
including arrears amounted to C£2.9 million ($7.9 million) at the end of 1975,
or about 2.4 times CDB's equity at that time, CDB had lost its
creditworthiness and would have become insolvent without Government or other
outside assistance. In addition, the CE2.7 million ($7.3 million) portfolio
in the Government-controlled, southern part of Cyprus was also seriously
affected by the general economic upheaval following the 1974 events, resulting
in arrears affecting 54% of the portfolio in the south as of end-December 1975.
B. Restructuring Operation
3.02     The Government, recognizing that CDB had an important role to play in
reactivating the economy, undertook special measures to restore CDB's
creditworthiness. This involved the immediate transfer of all voting rights
to the Government, the gradual acquisition by the latter of all Class "A"
Shares, which became non-voting 5% preference shares, and the provision to CDB
of non-liability resources to offset maturities of interest and principal due
on loans made to projects in the northern part of Cyprus. CDB became
essentially a quasi-Government institution, but its operational independence
has been safeguarded in its Charter and in the adopted new Statement of
Policies and Procedures. All powers of the CDB are vested in its Board which
consists of seven directors; four, including the Chairman, are selected by the
Government from among independent and experienced private sector leaders, and
three are appointed by the Government from among senior officials of the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Planning
Bureau. The details of the rehabilitation scheme, as well as the allocation
to reserves to compensate for possible losses in the portfolio in the south,
were finalized in close cooperation with the World Bank (see Appraisal Report
1079-CY of May 10, 1976).
3.03     At the end of 1975 CDB had no resources other than C£35,000 in local
currency funds in the form of Government loans and self-generated funds; it
had exhausted all its resources in foreign exchange. The Government and CDB,
therefore, approached the Bank and KfW for (second) loans to CDB. In addition



5-
to requesting funds for the normal operations of CDB, which provide financing
to medium and large scale industrial operations and tourist facilities in the
island, the Government asked that part of the new Bank loan would be allocated
to more labor intensive small scale industries (SSI) to alleviate the very
high unemployment rate.
C. Management and Staff
3.04     The CDB managemnent team consists of the General Manager who is
directly responsible to the Board, an Assistant General Manager with specific
responsibilities for project promotion and special projects, including
projects in difficulties, and four managers respectively in charge of the
Economic, Technical, Finance and Investment Departments. Until 1980, an
experienced foreign technical advisor made available by the British Oversea
Development Ministry was also associated with CDB. A small section deals
exclusively with SSI operations, but can draw on other staft for assistance.
CDB engages reputable auditors and at the moment relies on outside legal
assistance; engagement of one staff member with legal training is being
considered by CDB.
3.05     CDB professional staff has grown from 7 at end-1975 to 16 in 1981,
while total staff increased from 16 to 32 over the same period.   The increase
in staff has been lower than the increase in business volume, particularly in
the more staf f-intensive SSI scheme is considered.  CDB's management and staff
are highly qualified; most of the professional staff have studied in the UK or
USA, and have obtained advanced degrees, mainly in business administration and
economics. The Assistant General Manager and one Department Manager are EDI
Fellows.  Five experienced engineers on the staf f are capable of reviewing the
technical quality of project proposals.  The quality of appraisal reports and
financial statements received from CDB have been consistently of the highest
quality, and Bank missions judge the staff and management very competent,
responsive to new ideas, and able to cope with the high workload imposed.
CDB's operational policies (SSI, export industries, tourism) have been sound
and in support of the country's successful economic policies.
D. Financial Performance 1976-1981
3.06     CDB has achieved satisfactory results during the 1976-1981
disbursement period of the loan, in spite of government restrictions on
interest rates which tended to depress its profitability.  Total assets,
including those associated with the SSI scheme, rose from CE7.15 million
($18.7 million) in 1976 to CE22.4 million ($58.5 million) in 1981; the latter
figure is almost double that projected at the time of the appraisal of Loan
1278-CY in 1976. The net profit, expressed as a percentage of net worth, rose
from 5.6% in 1976 to 7.3% in 1980, slightly above the level projected at the
time of appraisal, but dropped to 4.6% in 1981. Administrative expenses
averaged 1.4% of total assets, a good performance considering the relatively
small operations of CDB, and were in line with projections.  The current ratio
also developed in line with projections, and stood at 2.7:1 as of end 1980.
Details of the leading financial indicators for 1976-1981, more detailed
performance indicators for 1980-1981, and a comparison of the actual and



projected disbursements for Loan 1278-CY, are given in Annexes I, II and III.
Detailed annual and quarterly financial statements are in IDF Files.
3.07     Approvals increased froma CE1.83 million in 1976 to CF3.07 million in
1980, and commitments from CE1.27 million to Cf-3.50 million. Disbursements in
1976, still affected by the 1974 events, were only Cr0.99 million, but reached
C£3.57 million in 1980. The 1980 figures are substantially higher than the
totals projected at the time of the appraisal of the second loan to MDB in
1976, but are in line with the projections made during the appraisal of the
third loan to CDB in 1979.
3.08     CDB, in spite of its successful growth fuelled by the rapidly
expanding economy in Cyprus, is nevertheless now faced with a mounting arrears
situation, and decreasing profitability. Although these factors are mainly
due to Government policies beyond the immediate control of CDB, and do not
constitute an immediate danger to CDB's availability or creditworthiness, the
solution for those problems in cooperation with the Government is becoming
urgent, and the Bank has been in frequent contact with all parties concerning
this matter.  The arrears and profitability situation are discussed in more
detail below.
E. Constraints
3.09     The arrears situation, particularly during the last two years, has
become a matter of concern.  The total amount of arrears in relation to total
loans outstanding on CDB's normal operations increased from 6% in early 1979
to 10% in October 1981; the amount of loans affected in relation to
outstanding loan amounts increased from 19% to 33% in the same period. In the
case of the much smaller SSI component, the amount involved in arrears
increased from 2% in early 1979 to 21% in October 1981, while the amount of
loans affected increased from l9/i to 57% in the same period. However, ot the
150 projects in arrears, only 12 projects are in difficulties; the
corresponding figures for SSI are 7 out of 96. CDB is providing technical
assistance to these enterprises.  Repayments are received for projects not in
difficulties, but with some delay; CDB has not rescheduled such repayments for
reasons explained below.
3.10     The main cause for the increase in arrears appears to be the 9%.
interest rate ceiling in the country, and the recent credit ceilings imposed
by the Government to reduce inflation.  The interest rate charged by CDB is at
the maximum of 9%, and no penalties can be imposed; retention of interest and
principal due CDB by entrepreneurs thus provides working capital at the
prevailing rate, outside the credit restrictions. Moreover, borrowers who can
show that they have been affected by the 1974 events, cannot be sued in court
for overdue loan or interest payment (and most companies can show some
evidence to that effect). There is thus no incentive for borrowers to repay
CDB on time.
3.11     CDB's profitability is also directly affected by the 9% lid on
interest rates.  Foreign exchange is obtained by the Government at market
rates, and funds are provided to CDB at 6% with the Government taking the



- 7 -
foreign exchange risk (tne actual cost is somewhat higher due to commitment
charges, etc.).   In addition, C£1.0 million Loan Commissioners funds which
should have been converted into equity at end 1980, still requires an interest
payment of 7% during 1981, further decreasing profits.    Domestic funds have
been obtained from bond issues at 7-1/2%.   The resulting spread with a 9%
relending interest ceiling is small (2.6% in 1979, and 2.7% in 1981).    Net
profits fell from 7.9% of net worth in 1979 to 7.3% in 1980, and were only
4.6% in 1981; CDB has the lowest profitability ratio among comparable DFC in
thle EMENA Region (range 8.9% for BNDE to 13.5Y. for ICC; 1979 figures).
3.12     In spite of the arrears problems and the limited profitability, CDB's
financial structure remains satisfactory.   Reserves for losses appear adequate
and were determined with participation of the auditors; there are also hidden
unrealized profits in the equity portfolio of about CEi0.4 million.   However,
the debt :equity retio reached 8.3 at the end of 1980, which is a breach of
Section 4.06 of the 1744-CY Loan Agreement, which limits the ratio to a
maximum of 7.5.   The breach of this financial covenant is the direct result of
a delay in implementation by the Government of Section 2.02 (ii) of the
corresponding Guarantee Agreement, which committed the Government to convert
C£1.0 million of Loan Conmissioners loans into equity "not later than December
31, 1980".
3.13     The conversion of the Cf£1.0 million Loan Commissioners funds into
equity had to be approved by the House of Representtives.    In view of the
election campaign in early 1981, and the convening of the newly-elected House
not before the fall of 1981, the Government did not consider it opportune to
introduce both measure beforehand. A Supplementary Budget Bill to enable the
Government to acquire a further C£1.0 million equity in CDB was approved in
late 1981; the Government complied with its obligations and converted C£l.0
million of obligations of CDB to the Loan Commissioners into equity on
December 21, 1981.   As a result, the debt:equity ratio at the end of 1981 was
6.4.  The Bank has also repeatedly been in contact with the Government
regarding the more complex issue of relaxation of the 9%. interest ceiling
which, although it assisted the rapid economic recovery of Cyprus after the
1974 events, is now a negative interest rate in view of the more rapid
inflation in recent years. Liberalizing the interest rate would not only
allow CDB to increase its profitability, but also permit it to charge
penalties on arrears and thus induce more rapid repayment of outstanding
principal and interest. The Government is fully aware of this matter, and is
considering the issue.
F. Prospects
3.14     The prospects for CDB will be satisfactory when the outstanding
issues relating to credit ceilings and loan-into-equity conversion are
settled, hopefully before the end of 1981.   CDB will then be able to become
more financially independent and could work to further strengthen its credit
rating to secure, in due course, foreign exchange resource from commercial
banks without requiring Government guarantees.    In its dealings with the World
Bank, in a joint venture with IFC (asbestos cement pipes), its contacts with
KfW and other institutions and commercial banks, it has displayed the
sophistication required for such operations.



3.15     CDB should thus continue to be a main source for industrial and
tourism/hotels financing; it has agreed to limit its exposure in hotels to
less than one-third of its total loan portfolio, a prudent decision in view of
the volatile tourist market. Recognizing reduced demand for SSI financing
reflecting the sharply decreased unemployment rate and the Government's desire
to support modern, export-oriented industries, new SSI financing will be
limited to the roll-over funds resulting from repayments of earlier SSI loans
(see para 4.13).
3.16     Total disbursements are expected to increase from C£3.6 million in
1980 to about Cf4.0 million in 1983; the share of disbursements for
manufacturing would be respectively 58% and 71%, for tourism 26% and 21%, and
for all other activities 16% and 8% in these years.
3.17     CDB is also broadening its activities, including providing technical,
economical and financial expertise to Cypriot companies, including for the
development of new projects, whether financed by CDB or not; providing advice
to the Government for crucial investment or restructuring decisions; promoting
new ventures; financing of a possibly energy conservation effort in industry;
investigating the possibility of establishing a stock exchange and local
investment bank (with IFC assistance); and coordinating the establishment of
construction supervision and consulting capacity, for use on the island and
abroad.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The specific objective of Loan 1278-CY was to provide assistance to
Cyprus at a time when its economy had suffered a severe setback. For this
purpose, the $6.0 million loan was designed to;
a. provide funds to CDB to finance medium-sized industrial and tourism
projects ($5.25 million); these sectors were projected to provide the
greatest employment opportunities and be able to earn quickly foreign
exchange for the country;
b. provide for the first time in Cyprus direct assistance to SSI ($0.75
million); the promotion of such labor-intensive industries was
considered of great importance due to the prevailing high
unemployment rate;
c. assist with the institutional rebuilding of CDB through Bank
technical assistance, in order to prepare CDB for its assigned major
role in financing viable private-sector industries.
B. Cofinancing
4.02      Over the period under review, 1976 - mid-1981, CDB received two Bank
loans (1278-CY and 1744-CY), one loan from KfW, two loans from commercial
banks, made one issue of debenture stock, and obtained one Central Bank and
five Loan Commissioners loans, as follows (details in Annex IV);

4.03         During the 1976 - 1979 period, the Bank provided 55% of CDB's
foreign exchange requirements, compared to the 60% projected at the time of
appraisal. For the full period under review, 1976 - mid-1981, the Bank's
share of foreign exchange financing was only 32%.
4.04         Of the total new funds injected into CDB during the period under
review, only about one quarter were Bank funds, nearly half were provided by
commercial banks, one-tenth by KfW, and the remaining 15% by the Cyprus
Government. However, under the CDB restructuring scheme (para 1.03) the
Government through the Central Bank provided compensatory funds to CDB to keep
LIBOR borrowings obtained through the commercial banks at a cost of 6% (plus
commissions and management fees).
C. Use of Loan 1278-CY
4.05         The $6 million loan assisted in the financing of 34 larger and 54
SSI projects, with a total value of $30 million, and employing about 1100.
The average maturity of the CDB sub-loans for medium-sized projects under Loan
1278-CY was 7.0 years (4.6 years for SSI),including an average grace period of
just over one year. In summary, the results achieved as compared with the
projections at the time of appraisal are given below;

4.06         The discrepancies shown reflect the inflation experienced, and
indicate the trend towards larger, more capital intensive industries for the
export market, and the sharp reduction in unemployment. The absence of firm
projections for SSI at the time of appraisal were due to the still
experimental nature of the SSI component at that time. Due to the rapidly
decreasing unemployment, as well as the competing demand for investments in
other industries, the second $0.75 million tranche for SSI, which could have
been made available under the loan, was never activated.
4.07         All projects financed by Loan 1278-CY, either in the traditional
or SSI sector, are operational, and no serious difficulties have arisen with
any of the major projects financed under Loan 1278-CY, while only a few SSI
projects are experiencing financial difficulties. Of the 34 larger projects
financed, 11 were completed within the CDB appraisal cost estimates, 4
projects had an overrun of less than 10%, and 7 projects had overruns between
10% and 20%. Twelve projects had an overrun above 20%, but 8 of these
resulted from an increase in working capital requirements; two further
projects were enlarged during the implementation period, while only 2 projects
in this category had a classical cost overrun due to delays in start-up and
cost underestimates.
4.08         Disbursements followed very closely the estimates made at the time
of the appraisal. CDB expressed some concern about the delays encountered in
receiving disbursements from Washington, even after all required documentation
had been submitted.

As shown, CDB has made a major contribution to financing private industry; it
has also been involved in almost all significant tourism projects established
or expanded since 1974.
4.10        An analysis has been made of the sectoral distribution of the 34
larger projects financed under Loan 1278-CY (Annex V). In view of the small
amount involved, and the diversity of projects financed, no such analysis was
made for SSI. The 34 projects financed mainly industry (67%) and tourism
(22%), while smaller amounts went to transport (9%) and the remainder to
miscellaneous. Within industry, the largest beneficiary was non-metallic
minerals with 22%, followed by textiles (11%), plastics (6%) and food products
(4%). In the tourism industry, CDB financed an average of 12% of the total
project cost, while in industry this percentage was 34%.
E. Development of Small Scale Industries (SSI)
4.11        A total of 106 projects have been approved under Loan 1278-CY (55
projects) and Loan 1744-CY (51 projects), involving 1.4 million of Bank funds,
and a matching amount of Government funds. Less than $0.1 million remains
available for commitment under Loan 1744-CY, and this will be used before the
end of 1981.
4.12        The arrangement whereby a unit in the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry was to act as a filter for SSI projects submitted, to reduce the
workload for CDB, has not worked well. It proved politically difficult for a
Government entity to screen out the bad projects, and advise prospective
borrowers that their proposal could no longer be considered. CDB management
also feels that the scope for SSI is now limited as the most likely profitable
opportunities have been taken up already, and recently submitted projects are
of poor quality; in addition, and most important, the high unemployment rate
which precipitated SSI promotion has vanished, and labor shortages now exist.
4.13        CDB will, therefore, limit SSI to the resources becoming available
through the roll-over of funds previously lent to SSI, and now being paid
back; this will mean about 10 SSI projects per year of an average of CE10,000
($26,100) each from 1982 onwards. CDB will directly check the viability of
the projects submitted, and will no longer rely on technical assistance
provided by the Government; however, the procedures will otherwise remain
unchanged.
V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01        The World Bank Loan 1278-CY has achieved its stated objectives.
Projects totalling about $30 million were financed with assistance of the $6.0
million Bank loan, and 1100 new jobs were created. CDB, in its restructured
form, financed about one-fifth of its target group of private sector
manufacturing investments (excluding Government investments, and
self-financing large-scale organizations), participated in nearly all major
hotel projects, and has become active in promotion. IFC has entered in one,
and is considering a second joint-venture with CDB, and is assisting CDB with



- 13 -
the development of a capital market and investment bank. CDB has become a
leading institution in Cyprus, and has developed a very capable management and
staff. In addition to its traditional function as a financier of industry and
tourism establishments, CDB also provides technical, financial and managerial
advice.
5.02       The financial situation of CDB is sound, in spite of high arrears
which are caused by external conditions and do not primarily relate to the
financial strength of CDB's borrowers (para 3.10). The removal of certain
constraints resulting from Government policies (including limits on interest
rates), as well as the agreed broadening of the equity basis, is necessary to
strengthen CDB's ability to attract foreign exchange resources based on its
own reputation and performance.
5.03       The SSI scheme filled a need to reduce the prevailing high
unemployment on the island after the 1974 events, and the enterprises financed
are, with a few exceptions, operating profitably. The system of Covernment
technical assistance for SSI has not fully lived up to its expectations,
partially because it proved politically difficult in Cyprus for a Ministry to
filter loan applications, and thus turn away prospective borrowers; in future
project designs, this sensitivity should be taken into account. With the
unemployment rate now at insignificant levels, SSI no longer has priority in
Cyprus and will be continued under the full control of CDB using only
roll-over funds from the repayment of earlier SSI loans.
5.04       CDB has indicated that further Bank loans for its normal operations
are not essential, as it can now attract funds from commercial banks.
However, CDB management has expressed a keen interest to be associated with
Bank funding for specific projects of high priority for Cyprus, such as energy
conservation.
5.05       Management has made a very strong plea for continued technical
assistance from, and exchange of ideas and association with the Bank. CDB
management suggest that this be done through continued visits by Bank
supervision missions or, also in view of the approaching full commitment of
the last Bank Loan to CDB (1744-CY), by attracting an experienced adviser with
Bank experience and broad international exposure and contacts for a one or
two-year period to assist with the formulation of CDB's long-range strategy,
and the implementation of new ventures now under consideration.
5.06       No particular difficulties, except some reported delays in
disbursement (para 4.08), have arisen during the supervision of this loan,
mainly due to the excellent and cordial co-operation received at all times
from CDB and Government authorities.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur,
Director,
Operations Evaluation Department,
1818 H. Street, N.W.,

U.S.A.
Dear Sir,
Project Completion Report on the CDB - Loan 1278-CY
Thank you for your letter dated 11th January, 1983, on the above referrecd
to subject and its enclosure.
We have considered the Project Completion Report for Loan 1278-CY and
we are in general agreement with the contents and its conclusions.
We would like however to point out the following:
a. On the 21st December, 1981, the Government complied with its
obligations cc.ntained ir the Guarantee Agreement, and converted
C£1,000,000 cf obligations of the Bank to the Loan Commissioners,
into 1,0CO,CJOO Class "B" shares of C£1.- each fully paid, thus
increasing the Bank's share capital to CE2,000,C0O.   As at 31st
December, 1981, the Debt/Equity ratio was well within the maximum
stipulated in the Loan Agreement 1744 CY, and stood at 6.4 to 1.
b.  The profitability problem, despite the reducticn of the average
cost of debt to about 6%, is expected to persist in the foreseeable
future unless the Government takes the political decision of
liberalising interest r-ates.
c. The arrears position in the normal operations in no way affects the
Bank's creditworthiness and standing. The problematic projects are
a minute proportion of the total portfolio and the Bank is taking
the necessary steps for assisting these enterprises. All other
arrears were either gradually collected or rescheduled by mutual
client and CDB consent. By the end of October, 1982, the delinquency
ratio for nonmal operations, i.e. the proportion of loans affected
by arrears to the total portfolio, was reduced to 8.7%.

d. As many of the operational, financial and other data cited in the report
were at the time taken from projected figures or were subsequently
revised, we are enclosing a statement setting out these new data
and a statement of the performance indicators for the years 1979,
1980 and 1981 for your infonnation and perusal.
Your conclusions, however, are in no material way affected by the
actual figures.

Adjustnents or Updating of sorme pertinent data included
in Project CcaTpletion Report on Loan 1278-CY.
Taking into account that the Prcject Completion Report was prepared in
October, 1981, we list belov; certain adjustments or up-dating to figures
included in the report. We do this for the sake of accuracy, and for
your records, but we emphasize that in no material way are the conclusions
of the report affected. We note some brief explanations where relevant;
Para.  2.06   The actual inflation rate in 1981 was 10.8%o.
Para.  3.06   Total assets in 1981 reached C£22.4 million.
Para.  3.07   a.  Approvals in 1980 reached C£3.07. This downwards
revision is largely the result cf casualties, re-approved
in subsequent years.
b. Commitments in 1980 reached Cf3.50 million. This
slight decline is the result of a casualty before
disbursements.
Para. 3.09 "The amount of loans aff'ected in relation to outstanding
loan amounts increased from 19%/ to 33%/o in the same period."
Para.  3.11   The spread in 1981 was 2.7%0. Net worth in 1981 was 4.6%.
Para. 4.09    a. Total GDFCF in manufacturing for 1980 is revised to
CZ26.4 million.
b. CMB's share in 1980 is revised to 8% oon the total,
excluding self-financing organisaticns.
c. The share of CDB-financed projects on GDFCF in 1980,
excluding self-financing orgaiisations, is revised to 17%.
d.  Total GDFCF in tourism in 1980 is C£10.1 million and
CMB's share is 9%o. Total figures were estirrated by CTC
and include only the official sector.
Annex II      a.  The 1979 and 1980 approvals have been revised as follows:
1979       1980
Cf£00 Is   C£000' s
Manufacturing                         1,762.1    21051.7
Tourism                               1,079.0      869.3
Other                                   404.0      150.0
Total            3,245.1    3,071.0
The changes are the result of casualties at the stage of
approval.



ANNEX VI
- 25 -                       Page 6 of 6
b. A casualty after commitment resulted in a revision of
"other" commitments for 1980. The new figure is C£350.9
thousand instead of C£364.9 thousand. The total
commitments figure for 1980 is thus reduced to C£3,495.1
thousand from C£3 ,508.7 thousand.
c. All the figures in this Annex are in C£ thousa-ds and not
Ci millions.
