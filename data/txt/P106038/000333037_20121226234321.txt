    BRAZIL — SÃO PAULO TRAINS AND SIGNALING PROJECT (P106038) AND
                   ADDITIONAL FINANCING (P117122)

                                 Restructuring Paper

1. The closing dates for the São Paulo Trains and Signaling Project with the State of
   São Paulo (Borrower) are to be extended to April 30, 2015 for the original loan
   (P106038, IBRD Loan No. 7506-BR) and October 31, 2014 for the additional loan
   (P117122, IBRD 7820-BR), representing a 22-month extension of each loan. In June
   2012, the Borrower formally requested the Brazilian Federal Government and the
   project co-financiers (IBRD and JBIC) for approval to extend the loan closing date of
   both loans and update the results framework to reflect the current project timeframe.
   The Bank was informed by November 2012 of the Brazilian Federal Government’s
   approval of the closing date extension for the loans. The Bank, Borrower and
   implementing agencies have agreed with this plan. This will be the first restructuring
   of the project.

2. Loan 7506-BR in the amount of US$550 million was approved by the Board on May
   1, 2008, and became effective on July 28, 2008. The closing date of this original loan
   is June 30, 2013 and has not been extended previously. The additional loan 7820-BR
   in the amount of US$112.91 million was approved by the Board on September 21,
   2010 and became effective on December 8, 2010. The Borrower specifically
   requested a loan closing date of December 31, 2012 for this additional loan during
   negotiations although it preceded the closing date of the original loan.

3. The latest ratings for progress towards achievement of the Project Development
   Objective (PDO) and Implementation Progress are both Moderately Satisfactory. The
   project is 77 percent disbursed overall (original loan is 84% disbursed and its
   additional financing is 44% disbursed). The PDO remains the same, namely to: a)
   improve the level-of-service provided to the urban rail transport users in the São
   Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) in a safe and cost-efficient manner by increasing
   the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines 7, 11 and 12 (formerly known
   as Lines A, E and F) of CPTM and Lines 1, 2 and 3 of the METRO; and b) continue
   the strengthening of the transport management and policy framework in the SPMR.

4. Under the Project, considerable progress has been achieved to date from adding 17
   new Metro trains and 40 CPTM suburban trains in service and institutional
   components including the consolidation of the regional transport coordination
   commission and updating of elements of the integrated metropolitan transport plan.
   Once fully completed, the Project is expected to achieve significant improvement in
   the level-of-service by reducing headways and increasing passenger capacity and
   comfort with both trains and systems.



                                           3
5. However, further progress related to level-of-service improvements depend on the
   successful implementation of new signaling systems on Metro and CPTM and
   upgraded track infrastructure on CPTM. These contracts, signed in 2008 or 2009,
   have been significantly delayed due in large part to unforeseen technical issues with
   implementing complex systems and infrastructure while trains continue to operate on
   the lines and while ridership on all lines continues to increase. While Metro and
   CPTM have recently taken measures to accelerated implementation, these critical
   contracts remain significantly behind the original schedule. The Borrower is
   regularly updating the Bank on the progress of these contracts and the Bank is
   providing close implementation support on a quarterly basis to evaluate progress.

6. The PDO is unchanged and remains achievable. The proposed extension enables the
   satisfactory attainment of the PDO through the completion of the contracts for
   signaling and track upgrade and implementation of the institutional components,
   including initial results of an impact evaluation of the Project on low-income users.

7. As the signaling and track upgrade components of the Project are significantly
   delayed, the target indicator values for level-of-service (number of trains and average
   trip duration) originally expected in 2012 and 2013 will only be achieved in 2014 and
   2015 considering the most recent schedule presented by the Borrower. The tables in
   the Annex of this paper reflect the new target dates for the indicators which otherwise
   remain unchanged.

8. Throughout project implementation, the implementing agencies (METRO and
   CPTM) and the Borrower represented by the Metropolitan Transport Secretariat have
   given appropriate attention to fiduciary (financial management and procurement) and
   safeguards (social and environmental) requirements as per Bank policies and
   guidelines. There are no outstanding audits. In addition, neither the loan in
   particular, nor the country in general is subject to an ongoing suspension of loan
   disbursements.
