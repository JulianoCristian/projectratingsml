F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective was to: a) improve the level-of-service provided to the urban rail
transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in a safe and cost-efficient manner by
increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines A and F (now known as Lines 7
and 12) of the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) and Lines 1, 2 and 3 of the
São Paulo Metro Company (Metro); and b) continue the strengthening of the transport
management and policy framework in the SPMR.


                                                        ii
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The project development objective was revised only to include Line 11 of CPTM (beside Lines 7
and 12) as the object of intervention.

The final development objective became: a) improve the level-of-service provided to the urban
rail transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in a safe and cost-efficient manner by
increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines 7, 11, and 12 of the Companhia
Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) and Lines 1, 2, and 3 of the São Paulo Metro Company
(Metro); and b) continue the strengthening of the transport management and policy framework in
the SPMR.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Brazil’s economy. By 2007, when the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was finalized, the
economy was growing at high rate, 5.4% in the second quarter of 2007. Poverty reduction had
been accelerated by conditional cash transfer program and inequality had decreased (GINI
coefficient dropped from 0.59 in 2002 to 0.56 in 2006). Inflation seemed to be under control and
the country was showing resilience to external shocks of the initiating financial crisis, but interest
rates remained high if compared to international standards. However, Brazil still ranked 122 out
of 178 on the Doing Business Report, below China (83), Russia (106), and India (120).

Sector context. Brazil had been experiencing steady economic growth and thus had seen a
considerable increase in motorized vehicle ownership from 2001 to 2012 (138%) 1. The country
presented high levels of urbanization (85%) 2, and in cities with over 60,000 inhabitants, the public
transport mode share had declined, with private car use surpassing public transport participation
in 2005, according to the National Association of Public Transport. Congestion in large cities was
estimated to cost from 1% to 3% of the total gross domestic product.

Economy and Urban Transport in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR): in 2007, the
São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) had 19.5 million inhabitants spread irregularly over 8,000
square kilometers. Although dominated by the São Paulo Municipality with 11.5 million
inhabitants, SPMR comprises 39 municipalities. The region generates roughly 20% of Brazil’s
GNP and is considered the most important economic region of the country. Poverty and inequality
were high and there were numerous slums in São Paulo city, where poverty and public safety were
predominant issues. Of the 26 metropolitan regions in Brazil, SPMR had the highest population
density and the fourth highest share living in slums (9% 3). Rapid urbanization had resulted in
uncontrolled urban sprawl with associated traffic congestion, long travel distances, and social
problems including crime and rising unemployment. Each day, 39 million person-trips took place,
of which 13 million (33%) were by foot, 14 million (37%) by car and the rest by public transport
(23% by bus, 4.5% by metro rail and 2.5% by suburban rail). Despite the 315 km rail-based
network, the lack of full physical and tariff integration between the bus, metro and the suburban
trains had over the years discouraged low-income users from using rail. This had led to an over-
reliance on other less sustainable modes including automobiles and motorcycles, and contributed
to the heavy traffic congestion experienced in the SPMR. Low-income urban households tended
to live in areas with limited access to jobs, and generally had to rely on public transport. As a
consequence, they were subject to extreme travel conditions such as: i) overcrowding of trains (>8
pass/m2) due to shortage of capacity at peak hours; ii) long commute times (2.5 hours/day from
the metropolitan periphery to the urban centers); and iii) high costs of transport, resulting in the

need to pay between 15% and 20% of income towards fares, a situation which was exacerbated
for those not formally employed.

Environmental aspects: the over-reliance on cars, motorcycles (and buses) had also a negative
impact on air quality and contributed to increases in accidents. In 2006, there were 4.3 million
vehicles registered in the SPMR. Air quality was degraded by the presence of excessive levels of
carbon monoxide, ozone and particulate matter. During 2006, health warnings due to air pollution
from CO were issued for a total of 250 days, ozone--108 days, and particulate--54 days. Motorized
vehicles accounted for 73-94% of most air pollutants in the SPMR, and contributed to 31% of
particulate matter. Vehicular air pollution had been somewhat mitigated by the use of alcohol in
lieu of gasoline. However, vehicular accidents continued to increase and pose environmental risks.
In 2006, there were about 150,000 road accidents in the SPMR, which accounted for 35,000
injuries and about 1,500 deaths, with a cost conservatively estimated at US$1.5 million/day.
According to the SP's Traffic Engineering Department, congestion had been increasing at a rate of
20 percent per year; the economic cost of time and fuel lost due to traffic congestion had been
estimated at US$6 million per day.

Rationale for Bank assistance: The project was a logical sequence to a long-term engagement
with the State to consolidate and expand its rail-based transport systems addressing the important
issues of inter-modal integration and sensible tariff policy to recover costs and meet social
objectives. The State of Sao Paulo, after the decentralization of the CBTU in the late 1990’s, had
started a series of investments to better integrate the subway system, the commuter rail, and the
interurban bus system, including an integrated fare scheme. The improved integration had resulted
in a new challenge: a dramatic increase in user demand for rail-based systems, with more than
12% increase from 2006 to 2007. This significant growth in demand had led to the urgent need for
a rapid increase in the carrying capacity and frequency of trains, especially at peak hours, in order
to maintain an acceptable level-of-service quality that ensured passenger safety while minimizing
waiting time at stations. In addition, the continuation in the improvement of the carrying capacity
of the system was expected to further attract users from road to rail thereby containing or reducing
congestion, while also contributing to positive environment impacts, which are important to the
climate change agenda. The project was in line with the Bank’s overall Transport Strategy, as well
as the customized sectoral strategy for Brazil, in terms of: (i) improving public transport in urban
areas as a means to improve access to jobs, education and health facilities; (ii) contributing to
poverty alleviation; and (iii) improving financial performance of service providers through better
cost recovery and reducing dependence on public subsidies. This was linked to higher level
objectives of affordable and accessible urban transport services to promote higher equity and
poverty reduction by allowing all segments of society, and particularly those with low-income, to
be able to reach employment areas, health, education and leisure facilities, thereby contributing to
an improvement in quality of life. This project would also make important contributions to the
improvement in air quality and reduction in vehicle emissions as a positive impact on climate
change.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The original development objective was to: a) improve the level-of-service provided to the urban
rail transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in a safe and cost-efficient manner by
increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines A and F [now known as Lines 7

                                                 2
and 12] of the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) and Lines 1, 2 and 3 of the
São Paulo Metro Company (Metro); and b) continue the strengthening of the transport
management and policy framework in the SPMR.

The improvement in the level of service was achieved through the increase of peak-hour and off-
peak carrying capacity, measured by the increase in the number of trains per peak hour and off-
peak hour per direction, the reduction of waiting time and through the reduction in the number of
passenger/m2 in the peak.

The impact on the transport users was assessed through the evaluation of the additional demand
serviced. The focus in the low-income population, which was not included in the PDO but was a
strong focus of the project as described in the PAD, was assessed through the increase in the
number of users with income levels smaller than 4 and 2 minimum salaries.

The achievement of the PDO in a cost-efficient manner was assessed through the working ratio,
which is calculated including revenues from the compensation of gratuities and excluding
subsidies.

The project’s results framework did not include indicators for safety, but this ICR provides some
data on this outcome (see Section 3.2).

The strengthening of the transport management and policy framework in the SPMR was
assessed through the completion of the Integrated Urban Transport Strategy (PITU). The PITU is
the main planning instrument that the State has developed and updated continuously. It serves both
as a strategic plan for the SPMR, and as guidance for prioritizing investments; the plan has a focus
on integrating transport planning among the different institutional levels.

Finally, intermediate outcome indicators measured the progress in the manufacturing, installation
and/or delivery of trains and systems included in the project.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The PDO of the original financing was scaled-up to include the scope of the Additional Financing,
namely the Line 11-Coral of the CPTM system:

The revised project development objective became: a) improve the level-of-service provided to
the urban rail transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in a safe and cost-efficient
manner by increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines 7, 11, and 12 of the
Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) and Lines 1, 2, and 3 of the São Paulo Metro
Company (Metro); and b) continue the strengthening of the transport management and policy
framework in the SPMR

After the inclusion of the scope for Line 11 with the additional financing, the project was
restructured in December 2012 and the closing dates for both the original and additional financing
were extended. The key indicators remained the same after the additional financing but included
the scope of Line 11 of CPTM; in the restructuring, a revision of the target dates was processed.

                                                 3
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The beneficiaries included the public transport users of the São Paulo Metropolitan Region,
particularly low-income households (earning up to four minimum salaries) who w e r e a n d
r e m a i n the major users of public transport.

By appraisal, the share of low-income users of the rail system (CPTM and Metro) was equivalent
to 40% of the total demand. The share of low-income users was also growing rapidly. In CPTM,
the proportion of users with family income below 4 MS had grown from 37.7% to 63.7% from
2001 to 2005 and in the Metro, from 20.3% to 28.0% 4. In the two systems, the higher growth
occurred among the users with lowest family income—below 2 MS.

The project would provide a higher level of comfort and shorter intervals between trains to
passengers.

1.5 Original Components
The project is comprised two components:

Part A: Infrastructure and Equipment
   1. Provision of financing for CPTM’s trains and systems, including: (a) the acquisition of
      forty trains (EMUs) of 8 cars each and accessories for a total of 320 cars to be operated in
      Lines A and F of the CPTM network; (b) the supply and installation and/or rehabilitation
      of traction electrical power systems for selected substations of Line A and Line F of the
      CPTM network; (c) supply and installation and/or rehabilitation of the electrical cabinets
      in selected stations of Line A and Line F of the CPTM network; (d) supply and installation
      of auxiliary power lines for Lines A and F of the CPTM network; (e) supply and installation
      of a signaling system operated from the operations control center (OCC) of the CPTM
      network; (f) the supply and installation of an electronic telecommunication system for the
      CPTM Lines A and F; and (g) associated civil works for (b) to (f) above if necessary;

      2. Provision of financing for SP Metro trains and systems, including: (a) the acquisition of
         seventeen trains (EMUs) of 6 cars each and accessories for a total of 102 cars to be operated
         in Line 1 and Line 3 of SP Metro network; (b) the supply and installation of a new signaling
         system known as Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) in Lines 1, 2 and 3 of the
         SP Metro network; (c) supply and installation of a telecommunication system, access
         control system (ACS) and platform screen doors (PSD) for the SP Metro Lines 1, 2 and 3;
         and (d) the modernization of the existing OCC for the SP Metro Lines 1, 2 and 3.

Part B: Institutional and Policy Development
   1. Provision of technical assistance to the STMSP for the carrying out of studies on policy
       development, including: (a) consolidating the CDTI for the SPMR; (b) updating the current
4
    Estimates from “Pesquisa AD CPTM” and Pesquisa da GOP / Metro.




                                                     4
       integrated transport policy, land use and air quality management strategy (PITU) for the
       SPMR to meet both transport and air quality targets and to introduce sound cost recovery,
       tariff, regulatory and subsidy policies; and (c) providing an action plan to review the
       funding of the urban transport system in the SPMR in view of the adoption of the BUI;

   2. Provision of technical assistance to CPTM for (a) the carrying out of studies on evaluating
      the outsourcing to the private sector of selected services including, inter alia, maintenance
      of track and systems, rolling stock and other operational services; and assessing the impact
      on affordability, accessibility, availability and acceptability of the Project for the low
      income urban rail transport users; and (b) management and supervision of the carrying out
      of Part A.1 of the Project;

   3. Provision of technical assistance to SP Metro for: (a) carrying out of studies to assess the
      impact on affordability, accessibility, availability and acceptability of the Project for the
      low income urban rail transport users; and (b) management and supervision of the carrying
      out of Part A.2 of the Project; and provision of financing for the operating costs of SP
      Metro PMU.

Components related to the Part A, of acquisition of trains and signaling systems, allowed for an
improved the level-of-service to the urban rail transport, by increasing the frequency of trains in
the peak and off-peak hours, therefore attracting more users, particularly low-income users living
in the peripheral areas of the SPMR. The new system, with approximately 1.3 million new users,
required a stronger institutional environment, and this was supported by the institutional
component, Part B. This component, besides providing resources to manage and supervise
implementation, provided guidance to establish fare policies and legal frameworks compatible
with the system’s financial sustainability and strengthened planning capabilities in developing an
integrated land use-transport model to allow for mitigation of the transport costs on the mobility
of poor populations.

1.6 Revised Components
The following changes consistent with the objectives of the project and scope of Part A and B of
the loan were made with the approval of the additional financing:
a) Acquisition of at least (9) nine trains (Electrical Multiple Units, EMUs) of eight cars each
    and related accessories for CPTM to increase the level of service on Line 11-Coral;
b) Inclusion of technical assistance for the design of a climate change strategy in accordance
    with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank;
c) Inclusion of technical assistance to manage and supervise the carrying out of Part A of the
    Project, including with respect to the manufacturing and implementation of the new trains.

The AF loan also financed about 75% of the total estimated purchase cost of new trains and
equipment for CPTM. The breakdown of all IBRD financing for the original and additional
financing by component is presented below.

1.7 Other significant changes
The project was restructured in December 2012. The closing dates for both the original loan
(P106038, IBRD Loan No. 7506-BR) and additional financing (P117122, IBRD 7820-BR) were
extended respectively to April 30, 2015 and October 31, 2014.

By December 2012, considerable progress had been achieved from adding 17 new Metro trains
and 40 CPTM suburban trains in service and institutional components including the consolidation
of the regional transport coordination commission and updating of elements of the integrated
metropolitan transport plan. However, further progress related to level-of-service improvements
depended partially on the successful implementation of new signaling systems on Metro and
CPTM and upgraded track infrastructure on CPTM. These contracts, signed in 2008 or 2009, had
been significantly delayed due in large part to unforeseen technical issues with implementing
complex systems and infrastructure in “brownfield” systems, i.e., while trains remain operating.
While Metro and CPTM had taken measures to accelerate implementation, these critical contracts
were significantly behind the original schedule and an extension of the closing date was requested.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project quality at entry was satisfactory because of the reasons detailed below.

The Project and PDO were solidly conceived and structured, given what was known at
appraisal. A cost benefit analysis was performed to compare the outcomes with or without the
project, and a sensitivity analysis provided the reassurance of a sound project. A technical
evaluation was undertaken to compare the acquisition of new trains with other alternatives such as
do-nothing, rehabilitation and/or modernization of trains, acquisition of second hand trains, and
leasing of trains. The acquisition of new trains in this case was found to be the most cost-effective
alternative because the others were either not feasible or there were no available immobilized trains
to be rehabilitated. The proposed “systems” were also compared with a do-nothing alternative and
other types of systems. Specialized consultants examined the options rejected and agreed that the
proposed alternatives were the most suitable for both CPTM and Metro. Financial projections were
prepared both for Metro and CPTM for the 2007-2026 period and showed that the working ratio
of both operating agencies would be equal or less than one, and operating costs would therefore
be below operating revenues.

The project incorporated in its design the lessons identified in previous urban transport and
urban projects around the world to include institutional strengthening in all levels of
government involved with urban transport, to ensure adequate and timely counterpart funds, and
to mitigate risks of slow project implementation through measures to deal with factors such as lack
of familiarity with Bank procedures, overoptimistic scheduling at appraisal, lack of final

                                                 6
engineering designs at appraisal, and changes in political commitment. Of those, overoptimistic
scheduling remained an issue. The cause for this is that rail projects with palpable benefits tend to
take longer to implement than typical terms of elected officials, and technicians tend to feel the
pressure to aim for non-achievable schedules. Another important risk identified related to political
context relates to the way fares are established. Counterparts agreed to proceed with adjustment in
fares taking into account the recovery of operational costs; however, political pressures have often
been determinant of fare levels, and CPTM did not manage to reach the target of operating/working
ratio smaller than 1. This was reinforced by the establishment of the integrated fare. Although
resulting in great impact in terms of allowing for a larger participation of low-income users to the
system and a general growth of demand, the integrated fare has resulted in an overall decrease of
revenue generation for the system.

Risks of not achieving the projected demand levels were clearly identified and closely
monitored during implementation by Metro/CPTM. Metro had established demand projections
based on state-of-the-art transport models. Physical integration was identified as critical for the
achievement of demand targets because it affects the ability of passengers to access the stations in
an efficient way, and thus affects the attractiveness of the system. Additionally, because the
integrated system (physical and fare integration) works as a system in dynamic equilibrium,
fluctuations may arise when any change occurs in the carrying capacity of one of the lines.
Historically, demand was growing at a fast pace and projections for the next years were promising,
because of optimistic projections of economic growth and increasing limitations of the alternative
modes due to higher congestion levels. As evidenced by the demand indicators, the targets were
adequately met for almost all lines. The influence of the dynamic equilibrium system is
exemplified by the inauguration of Line 4, which produced two small changes to the targeted
results, one positive and one negative. The positive consequence was that peak-hour indicators for
pax/m2 were achieved for Metro lines 1 and 2 even though the numbers of trains offered were
below the end targets. The negative consequence was that, since line 4 stations that would reach
poorer areas in the Sao Paulo periphery second phase were not completed, the growth in the
number of low-income users in the Metro system was just below the end target.

Risks related to procurement were taken into consideration, such as the possibility of long
litigation periods to award the contracts for the trains and higher than appraised costs in the
acquisition. The successful and efficient procurement process confirmed that government was
fully committed to mitigate these risks. The cost estimates for the trains and each of the systems
proposed were in line with those acquired by other equivalent metro and suburban rail systems,
and the specialized consultants had reviewed the proposed specifications for the acquisition of the
trains and the signaling, telecom, and energy systems, ensuring that they were sound and not
favoring any particular manufacturer. Some risks related to the signaling contracts were not clearly
identified, although in previous operations these had not emerged as critical. These issues will be
further detailed in the sections below.

Finally, recommendations emerging from the IEG review of the transport sector 5 were taken
into account in terms of building up the sector’s monitoring and evaluation efforts and aligning

them with the new strategy which emphasizes urban transport and multimodal transport. This
was achieved through the use of relevant indicators that were readily measured and are
applicable to a broad range of projects.

2.2 Implementation
Delivering large infrastructure projects, especially in urban environments, present intrinsic
complexities that often lead to long periods of implementation. The main critical risks identified
during project preparation were based on accumulated experience from the counterpart and lessons
learned from similar operations in the Bank. The lessons learned included several institutional
risks, but because of the appropriate mitigation measures, none of these risks emerged as especially
critical during project implementation. The main problems experienced during implementation
were more of a technical nature, related to the underestimated difficulties of implementing
upgrades in brownfields and to the readiness of the technology when compared to the Metro system
level-of-service requirements. During implementation, these issues started to become increasingly
critical, and construction companies gradually started to slow down implementation. When project
implementation progress became minimal and the resolution of contract issues seemed to have
reached a point of no return, the rating was adjusted to moderately unsatisfactory. After the closing
date, the implementing agencies continued to negotiate and some of the issues were resolved while
others remain under negotiation.

Delivery of trains was fully satisfactory. On one hand, contracts for the delivery of 49 trains to
CPTM and 17 trains to Metro were fully achieved with minimal delays and trains are now
operational. Contract fines for delays were appropriately applied. There were considerable savings
in the procurement process, with the final contract values being 40 and 49% lower than initial
estimates.

Delivery of systems suffered delays and was not completely met. On the other hand, the
signaling contracts presented successive delays and by mid-term review were significantly behind
schedule, resulting in a project restructuring request by STM to extend the loan closing date.
Disputes between the implementing agencies and the trains and systems’ companies ranged from
issues of import taxes, the lack of access to the tracks because of the unfeasibility of stopping
ongoing operations, and the lack of transparency in the way the CBTC system was being
developed, generating concerns to the Bank team if the targets would be met. Contractual disputes
arose and arbitration was put in place to resolve these issues. During this process, the team actively
engaged with CPTM/Metro, before problems had escalated, and Metro/CPTM showed
commitment by strengthening the supervision of the contractors and by requesting better
management in terms of planning the access and actually using the available windows. The
arbitration process is still ongoing for two major contracts. Metro informed that the negotiations
with the CBTC contractor have evolved substantially in the last months and an agreement is
foreseen in the next months. The CPTM signaling contract is still undergoing arbitration.

Furthermore, the delivery of the CBTC technology (main component of the systems
contracts) was particularly complex and was not yet fully achieved by the closing date of the
project. A few months after the contract was signed, the contractor started showing signs of
challenges in meeting the admittedly high performance standards stipulated in the contract. The
Bank team actively assisted the clients and the contractor in addressing these issues. Eventually it

                                                  8
was agreed, as part of the project restructuring in 2010, that the system would be deployed
incrementally, starting with Line 2, and later moving into Lines 1 and 3 (which carry more
passengers) only when issues with Line 2 were resolved. At the close of the project, the CBTC
system was not yet fully operational, but the parties were collaborating to achieve this objective in
a reasonable time frame.

Upgrading metro lines under operation proved to be more difficult than initially envisioned.
The project included upgrading the existing signaling systems and civil works for railway lines
under operation. These lines carried more than 1 million passengers daily, so an interruption in
operations was not a feasible option. In some cases, especially for CPTM where the demand was
lower, an alternative bus service was provided to allow for the complete shutdown of the line,
allowing for a longer window for implementation. However, this solution could not be used
indiscriminately because it was costly. Works had to be conducted during a small time window,
generally from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m., which included time for mobilization and de-mobilization,
meaning that the actual productive time was even shorter. The services had also to compete for
space with the more urgent needs of maintenance of current operations, since safety of the current
system was a priority. Therefore, the time windows often could not be provided by CPTM/Metro.
Another constraint was related to the right-of-way and the interference with the concessionaire for
freight transport, which shares the same railroad space with passenger trains. The project’s works
included the construction of porticos that interfered with the concessionaire’s space. The solution
came eventually with adaptations to designs and through an agreement with the concessionaire,
but this also created delays. The Bank team worked with the companies to increase and monitor
the number of time windows offered, but the pace of implementation remained slow and the initial
delays could not be overcome. Nevertheless, 75% of these services were completed, which resulted
in increased safety, as evidenced by the indicators presented in 3.2.

Macroeconomic conditions were favorable to the country during project implementation.
This meant that government was collecting increasingly more tax revenues, securing adequate
flow the funds to the project. On the other hand, the heated economy created a boom in the
construction sector. During project implementation, according to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics), unemployment reached extremely low levels in Brazil, with only 0.4
percent of unoccupied workers in the construction sector. This influenced the costs of labor and
the capacity of construction companies to deliver services that were labor intensive.

The Additional Financing increased substantially the benefits for the project as a whole.
When the AF was appraised, progress of the original loan was satisfactory, with disbursements of
around 48% and physical progress of 39% and 51% for CPTM/Metro trains and 54% and 26% for
CPTM/Metro signaling systems. The components financed by the AF, related to new trains and
signaling systems for Line 11, were adequately implemented and the targets were fully met.

Despite the issues raised above, final outcomes were achieved for the majority of the PDO
indicators, and for 75% of the intermediate indicators, as will be presented in section 3.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 M&E Design: The project was monitored through an appropriate set of indicators adopted
by the Borrower to reflect the achievements of the PDOs (see Section F of Datasheet). The

                                                 9
indicators of number of trains in peak, reductions in travel times, and passengers per square meter
address the first goal of the PDO, which is the improvement of the level of service. The indicators
related to increase in demand, particularly the increase in low-income users, address the targeted
beneficiaries, and the operating costs address the cost-efficient manner through which results have
to be achieved. The indicator of the completion of the PITU addressed the achievement of second
PDO, of strengthening of the institutional capacity. Although it is generally difficult to measure
institutional capacity building outcomes, the project could have included one or two additional
indicators of the utilization or adoption of the project’s technical assistance products. No
indicators were included in the results framework to measure safety during the implementation of
the project. However, available data show increased safety in CPTM operations (again, see section
3.2 below). The intermediate indicators were used to assess outputs, including the physical
progress of the train manufacturing, the systems, the permanent way, the overhead lines, and the
PITU study.

2.3.2 M&E Implementation and Utilization: The Borrower appropriately used the outcome and
output indicators to supervise the progress of the objectives and implementation. Updated values
of indicators were reported in a timely way in the ISRs. However, progress reports during
implementation demonstrated some inefficiency in the calculation of physical progress indicators
for some specific contracts. For instance, the calculation of physical progress in some components
used metrics of time spent divided by total contract time. Since the contracts were behind schedule,
these indicators were erroneously optimistic and had to be adjusted towards the end. Additionally,
safety and reliability-related indicators could have been used to reflect the improvement in
operations, especially for CPTM. Although some of the indicators in terms of headways have not
been achieved, improvements in reliability and safety of the systems are strong positive impacts
that were not acknowledged through the indicators. Although some indicators targets could have
been restructured towards the end of the project, by the mid-term review both the Bank team and
the Borrower considered that the full objectives would be met.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Procurement: The implementing agency had good procurement capacity, as assessed during
preparation, and was knowledgeable of Bank procurement procedures. The procurement ratings
were satisfactory during most of the Project, but were downgraded to moderately satisfactory by
the end of the Project due to temporary lapses or delays to implement supervision and project
management contracts. The procurement of the CBTC technology proved to be complex and
somewhat problematic. The Bank team felt that Metro should not have procured the new
technology without sufficient certainty about the contractor’s capacity to deliver. An alternative
option might have been for the contractor to have implemented the system progressively in one
line and then in other lines. Additionally, the schedule of payments of the contracts with the
systems’ suppliers was found to be skewed towards the initial deliveries of components and
equipment. While these are costly items, the actual installation on the ground is the most complex
part of the contract. Coupled with the high costs of labor, companies may have lost
ability/motivation to conclude the installation. In subsequent projects, Metro has incorporated this
experience and applied a schedule of payments in which the initial delivery of equipment had a
lower weight.




                                                10
2.4.2 Financial Management: Financial management was in compliance with Bank procedures.
Both the State and Metro had previous experience with Bank loans and were able to handle all
aspects related to the financial management of the project including accounting, disbursement and
auditing functions. Auditing was carried out annually by independent consultants selected on a
competitive basis according to Bank procurement guidelines. Financial management reporting and
auditing were satisfactory throughout the life of the project.

2.4.3 Environmental: The Project was rated Category B and triggered the Environmental
Assessment Safeguard Policy (4.01). It was expected to create a net beneficial impact on society
and the environment. The improved rail capacities helped relieve congestion by providing a better
quality clean transport alternative, resulting in lower emission of pollutants per vehicle-kilometer.
In addition to this beneficial impact, the Project was also the catalyst for a series of internal
institutional transformations, especially in the case of CPTM. A specific environmental
management unit was created and is being empowered. Of great importance in this scenario is an
ongoing initiative related to consulting services for survey and diagnosis, mapping, systematic and
georeferenced consolidation of environmental and territorial information, and preparation of
environmental management plan and master plan of use, occupation and treatment of the CPTM
territory.

In the Mid-term review in April 2011, the project was found to be implemented in accordance with
the environmental management plan. CPTM/Metro have adopted comprehensive environmental
management systems and all project interventions were found to be properly licensed in the São
Paulo city and State environmental agencies, which follow strict environmental standards.

In the course of field visits, because of some interventions related to the CPTM modernization
program, the Bank’s environmental specialists raised a possibility that additional safeguards would
have to be triggered (Natural Habitats, Physical Cultural Resources and Pest Management).

A specific due diligence was carried out confirming the scope of the Bank-financed project and
the CPTM’s Modernization Program (not financed by the Bank) on Lines 7, 11 and 12. The results
were the following: (i) the Bank-financed project had not created any significant impacts with
regards to Natural Habitats, Physical Cultural Resources and Pest Management; (ii) the due
diligence carried out on the Bank-financed project and the Modernization Program confirmed the
consistency of the interventions and activities by CPTM with regards to Bank Policies on Natural
Habitats, Physical Cultural Resources and Pest Management; (iii) although not covered in the due-
diligence report, the Bank Team confirmed with CPTM that neither the Bank-financed project nor
CPTM’s Modernization Program had involved any resettlement activities. The Project Team also
reaffirmed that CPTM's Modernization Program was not a requirement for the achievement of the
Bank-financed project PDOs.

2.4.4 Social: The project did not include involuntary resettlement, so the Bank’s Involuntary
Resettlement Policy was not triggered. Reconstruction of stations along CPTM lines 7 and 12 was
carried-out with non-Bank funding and took place within the railroad right-of-way. Aside from
minor traffic disruptions and short-term delays on the trains, no adverse social impact occurred, as
evidenced by the users’ surveys.



                                                 11
The results from the user’s survey, further detailed in Annex 5, demonstrate that the project-
supported improvements increased the beneficiaries’ approval rates, with the exception of 2012,
when a few localized problems and disruption in operations due to construction affected the survey
results.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The Bank team continues to follow-up on the activities related to this project through engagement
with Metro and CPTM’s team and the support to implementation activities related to other ongoing
loans. Metro/CPTM continue to implement the project after the Bank loan has closed, with their
own funds. The current fiscal crisis in Brazil might generate a slow pace of implementation of next
steps, but both Metro and CPTM are committed to conclude the project scope. The contract with
EFACEC is being terminated by CPTM and a new procurement is being prepared for the
installation of remaining permanent way and electric systems. Metro is negotiating an agreement
with the contractor to complete the existing scope on the signaling contracts. The focus is to get
Line 2 fully operational, and then agree on a plan to complete Lines 1 and 3, which are more
complex.

The Bank continues to engage with Sao Paulo on a US$130 million loan for Line 4 Phase 2, which
includes the civil works and systems to complete the 12.8 km subway with 11 stations. This loan
was matched by financing from JBIC for an amount of US$130 million. The Bank is also financing
Metro Line 5 through a US$650 million loan to extend the current Line 5 to the Chacara Klabin
station and benefit the low-income population of the Capao Redondo and neighboring areas.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The PDOs remained relevant throughout the life of the two loans and did not require any revisions
in response to changing government priorities or external conditions. The only adjustments were
related to the scope of the PDO to include CPTM Line 11 and the schedule of the proposed targets.
The objectives also stayed relevant in light of Bank’s priorities regarding Brazil. The current Sector
Country Diagnosis notes that although a wider range of transport alternatives can be explored for
improving quality of life and sustainability of urban centers, there is still a strong need for heavy
infrastructure projects, especially in the large and heavily populated cities of the country. The
objectives remained aligned with the country strategy because they prioritized public over private
transport and allowed for a shift towards a cleaner transport matrix. Moreover, because of the
socioeconomic profile of the main beneficiaries, the objectives emphasize the impacts on the
poorest bottom 40%, achieving considerable benefits in terms of commute time reduction and
improved accessibility. The project was also coherent with the social demands for better transport,
which arose as the main concern in the 2012 demonstrations that joined millions of Brazilians
complaining about quality of life in urban centers.

The project’s design, in terms of components and subcomponents, remained fully aligned with its
objectives. There were no deviations from the original objectives or design that would diminish
the project’s relevance in implementation. Overall the relevance of the project is rated High.




                                                 12
Project amendments, including the additional financing and extensions of the closing date,
reflected an appropriate level of flexibility by the Bank that allowed for the achievement of the
PDO. The planned implementation period of 5 years was appropriate given the risks identified
during preparation but turned out to be too short given the complexity of the project and unforeseen
delays regarding technical difficulties regarding the signaling systems.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Achievement of the first PDO, “improve the level-of-service provided to the urban rail transport
users in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in a safe and cost-efficient manner by increasing the
peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines 7, 11, and 12 of the Companhia Paulista de
Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) and Lines 1, 2, and 3 of the São Paulo Metro Company (Metro)”,
is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the following:

a) The trains for both Metro and CPTM were delivered and are under operation, increasing the
   transport capacity in the CPTM lines. Although the trains in operation for the Metro Lines 1,
   2, and 3 have not increased for the peak period, the actual comfort levels in the peak, measured
   through the indicator passengers/m2, were fully achieved. This was a result of a new trip
   distribution through the metro network after the introduction of Line 4, and changes in
   transport patterns that produced a less pronounced peak in demand and allowed for a better
   level of service to be offered even without adding trains.
b) For CPTM Line 11, the target for trains under operation was fully achieved and so for the
   passengers/m2, indicating a full achievement of the improvement in the level of service. For
   CPTM lines 7 and 12, the indicators for trains in operation were surpassed, but the levels are
   comfort are still far from ideal, reaching up to 7.2 passengers/m2 during the most crowded 15-
   minute-period.
c) The results in terms of demand achieved are dramatic; 1.35 million new users were added to
   the system during these years (96% of the 1.4 million target), of which more than 51% are
   from the lowest income groups (monthly income of 4 or less minimum salaries). There was
   substantial reduction in travel times (80% of the indicators met on average for the six lines).
   Comparing this with a scenario that all these new passengers would have shifted to private
   road based modes, there has been up to an estimated 14% savings in CO2 emissions (2,929
   ton/day), 9% savings in passenger travel times (1,423,232 pax-hours/day) and a 16% reduction
   in traffic volumes. Results can be even more pronounced when signaling systems for Metro
   Lines 1, 2 and 3 are fully operational. Refer to Annex 9 for detailed information and other
   counterfactuals.
d) Metro’s working ratio (defined as operating costs divided by operating revenues) has always
   remained below one as planned and has actually improved. This is a very important
   achievement for the financial sustainability of the metro transport network, but it is important
   to analyze also the working ratio of the CPTM system, from an integrated perspective.
e) CPTM’s working ratio (defined as operating costs divided by operating revenues) had been
   estimated as 1 at the time of project appraisal, but subsequent analysis showed that this was
   incorrect, and in fact was 2 at the start of the project. CPTM’s working ratio decreased during
   the course of the project to 1.5, but at the end of 2013 it returned to 2. Although operational
   revenues have increased 70% in the 2008-2013 period, because of the increase in demand,
   operational costs have increased 105%. Operational and maintenance costs have increased
   considerably (around 15% only in 2012-2013) and so did administrative costs (more than 100%

                                                13
   for the same period), a consequence of the more intensive use of the system. Revenues, on the
   other hand, did not increase at the same rates, because of political pressures to avoid raising
   tariffs, together with tariff integration that does not generate higher revenues. Although the
   end-of-project working ratio of 2 might seem high, it had neither improved nor deteriorated
   during the project period.
f) The share of Metro trips among motorized trips in the Region increased from 16% estimated
   for 2001 to 19.3% estimated for 2011. This is a significant achievement considering the rapid
   growth in motorization during this period that is highly correlated to rising incomes. The other
   rail ridership and mode share of CPTM also increased significantly in this period. This positive
   trend is attributable to a portfolio of investments made by the SSP, including the
   implementation of Line 4, improved reliability and service frequencies on CPTM lines, and
   improvements and/or extensions to Lines 1, 2 and 3.

Although the majority of results in terms of demand, comfort levels and travel time savings were
achieved, the working ratio for CPTM is considered high, and the sustainability of the system as a
whole (Metro + CPTM), might be endangered if strong measures to contain costs and to find
additional sources of revenue are not explored. Fortunately, studies from the institutional
component have provided the companies with a tool to test different fare schemes to encourage
evidence-based discussion of financial sustainability issues, even while the political environment
may be unwelcoming of fare increases or changes.

Finally, no indicators were included in the results framework to measure safety during the
implementation of the project. However, available data show increased safety in CPTM operations,
with the rate of accidents in the whole system declining from 9 to 5 accidents/year and from 67 to
12 injured passengers/year when comparing the years before project to the period of project
implementation. CPTM has also an indicator that measures events of operational safety to the
public which has seen a dramatic decrease in the last years, as presented below. No accidents/safety
related data for the Metro was available.

Achievement of the second PDO, “to continue the strengthening of the transport management
and policy framework in the SPMR”, was also rated Moderately Satisfactory because of the
delays in the development of the PITU and the fact that the actual content of the report did not
cover a full long term plan, only the updating of the transport network in the transport model.
Although this was an important first step towards the implementation of the full PITU, STM did
not manage to develop this study in the period of the project implementation. STM has informed
the Bank that it intends to proceed with a full version of the study and will suggest that the Line 5
loan finances the new contract.

3.3 Efficiency
A conventional cost-benefit analysis was carried out for this ICR using the same approach used
during appraisal. The situation with the project was compared against the situation without the
project. The revised Net Present Value (NPV) of benefits calculated for this report is US$720 m.
and Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) is 15.3%. This ex-post assessment confirms a
positive economic efficiency of the project and the EIRR is higher than international experience
with metro projects of this kind, which average around 8%. The result is also generally consistent
with, though lower than, the NPV and EIRR calculated at appraisal in 2007 (US$1.34 bn.; 21.4%)
primarily due to an increase in costs and delays that postponed accruing benefits. The following
conservative assumptions were made in this analysis with respect to the situation at appraisal:
    a) Updated investment cost stream to reflect the changes to the components and timing;
    b) Updated benefits stream to reflect the approximately 4-year delay in the benefits;
    c) Maintained the reduction in wages and the incremental increase in operating and
        maintenance cost which were consistent with appraisal.

Overall the efficiency of the project is rated as High, given the very positive ex post NPR and
EIRR.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on: (i) the High continued
relevance of the project objectives and design; (ii) the Moderately Satisfactory achievement of the
two development objectives; and (iii) the High estimated economic efficiency of the investments
despite significant delays to complete the Project.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts
As described above, the project improved the access of low-income populations to the system. A
geographical analysis of census data provides additional indications of the impacts on poorer
segments of the population. The following table presents the growth in populations in buffer areas
of 1, 3 and 5 km distance to the Metro and CPTM stations, classified by low income/not low
income. Low-income is defined as the bottom 40% in terms of family income. High income, in
this case, is defined as the 60% richest percentiles. The overall data includes families that have not

declared their income. The source data is the 2000 and 2010 census 6. Although 2010 does not
represent the final date of the project, some of the project objectives had been completed by then.

While the overall growth in population cannot be attributed (entirely or exclusively) to the project,
the analysis of growth in population evokes an interesting discussion in terms of synergy of
policies of land use planning and transport.

From the table above, on one hand, it is clear that relative growth in population outside the areas
of influence of both Metro and CPTM is higher than in areas closer to the rail, which decreases
the attractiveness of the public transport system. One can analyze for instance the 3 km buffer for
CPTM. While relative growth in population was 9.3% outside the 3 km buffer, the growth inside
the 3 km buffer was only 1.6%. Additionally, there is a population decline on the 1 km buffer
around CPTM stations (-1.44% for low-income, -5.3% for not low income, and a -3.63% for
overall growth).

These unfortunate symptoms of unsustainable development were addressed in the new Master
Plan for the city of São Paulo in 2014, which incorporates incentives to accelerate the
densification around transport terminals/stations.

On the other hand, on a positive note, it can be seen that growth for low-income populations is
much higher than for the remaining populations inside the buffer areas. For instance, while in the
3 km buffer for CPTM, there was a decrease of 1.6% in population of high-income, there was an
increase of 5.8% of low-income populations, which can be seen as a consistent gain. The data for
Metro shows even more encouraging results. Low-income populations have increased inside areas

of influence of 1, 3 and 5 km, between 8 and 13.7% while high-income populations have decreased
from 1.8 to 7.8%.

This movement of low-income populations closer to the stations is a positive signal of poorer
populations migrating closer to rail stations. The generally higher speeds provided by the rail
system generate a decrease in travel times possibly resulting in higher quality of life, and/or of
higher accessibility to a larger set of opportunities (jobs, leisure, etc.) for a given travel time
budget.

(b) Impact assessment
An impact assessment of São Paulo Trains and Signaling Project on traffic volumes, travel
times and emissions was conducted by the Bank team. Data came from the 2012 Mobility
Survey from Metro, CAF – Observatorio de Movilidad Urbana and the project indicators
provided by Metro and CPTM. The detailed results can be found in Annex 9.

The current scenario was compared to counterfactual scenarios that considered that part of the new
users of the rail system would have migrated to other less efficient modes of transport in case the
project was not implemented. Considering the fact that in 2007 the systems were vastly saturated,
this is a reasonable assumption. The most critical counterfactuals considered that all new users
would have migrated to either bus, cars, or motorcycles. Two other scenarios simulated that the
same modal shift from 2007 (before implementation) would be preserved, taking into account
mobility patterns of different socioeconomic levels. The results indicate up to 14 percent in CO2
savings, up to 21 percent savings in traffic volumes, and up to 9 percent in travel time savings.

(c) Institutional Change/Strengthening
One aspect of particular importance relates to the series of reforms that the state government has
introduced to improve the system integration, with particular attention to the integrated modal
tariff implemented in 2004 for the municipal system, and expanded to the Metro system in 2005.
Up to the mid 2000s, public transit was inconvenient and unaffordable for a majority of citizens in
São Paulo. Reform started when State and City governments provided physical and tariff
integration between Metro and suburban rail services. Ridership increased, particularly by low-
income users. The fully-integrated transit system through the BUI has made transit more
affordable, and low-income family expenditures on transport decreased, with considerable impacts
in demand. While before the reforms, less than 5 percent of rail users were low-income, thanks to
the reforms 35 percent of Metro users and 63.7% of suburban rail users are low income 7.
Government has continued to expand its integration policies with the BOM fare card that integrates
the Metro to the inter-municipal bus transport system. One impact of these integration policies is
that demand increases have not been backed up with sufficient investment, and system
crowdedness may lead to rapid deterioration of the system through excessively intensive usage.

The revised PITU, the land-use transport model and the improved environmental management
have been important steps towards integrating metropolitan region planning. The companies are
now more aware of the impacts of the Metro on land use and are more actively involved in terms
of identifying integrated policies. The Bank is currently working with Metro on an Impact

evaluation study for Line 5 that intends to address opportunities for enhancing metro use by low-
income people and by providing poor populations with tools to remain in the areas most benefited
by the rail system and thus be able to assess the benefits more efficiently.

Finally, the continuous Bank financing and RAS provided on public private partnerships have
included a wider range of financing mechanisms to allow for a more rapid growth of the network.
Nevertheless, because of the complexity of agents involved in urban projects and the high costs of
implementing these infrastructures, strong government financing is still crucial for the success of
the system expansion.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey
The analysis of users’ perceptions was based on information from three different data sources: the
ANTP (“Associação Nacional de Transportes Públicos) and CPTM and Metro’s users’perception
surveys. The complete analysis can be found in Annex 5.
From 2010 until 2012, the Metro and CPTM systems were perceived by users as the transport
modes with most improvements, when compared to the bus system. Approval rates ranged from
50 to 70% for CPTM and from 50 to 80% for the Metro. Reduction in waiting times, decrease in
trip times, the provision of new and modern cars, enhancement of train stations, increased speed,
and the operation of new metro lines were cited as the main reasons. In all surveys, the most quoted
complaint was related to overcrowding of the systems followed by the need for building new metro
and rail lines.

A double difference analysis was conducted for the CPTM and Metro lines and the results indicate
positive results that can be attributable to the Trains and Signaling project. Although the approval
rates for Metro lines have been decreasing, mostly because of overcrowding, this analysis indicated
that the lines improved under the project had much lower declines in perception than the control
line. Moreover, for the CPTM lines, besides an overall increase in approval rates for the targeted
lines, the improvement was considered higher for these lines than for the control line.

It is important to highlight, however, that data from the ANTP 2015 survey (not yet publicly
released), indicate an increased dissatisfaction with public transport services in Sao Paulo. The
worst evaluation was obtained for the bus systems, where some important interventions of bus
corridors have been implemented. Specialists point out that the systems are still crowded, and
average speeds have not yet consistently changed. Moreover, the higher awareness about the
subject of public transport, which was the main complaint in the 2013 demonstrations in the city,
meant more demanding customers who will assess more critically the level of service being
offered. Finally, the overall image of CPTM and Metro, although declining, is still rated highly
positive, indicating a general satisfaction with the systems and a strong beneficiary support.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome of this operation is moderate for the following reasons:
   a) Technical: as presented above, the signaling systems contract was not concluded and there
       is uncertainty in terms of when the CBTC technology (or any similar technology) will be
       able to fulfill the level of service requirements. Moreover, improvements in the permanent
                                                18
   ways and overhead cables, although not particularly complex, will likely still take time to
   be completed (1-2 years). While the development objectives are mostly but not fully met
   and the benefits already incurred are likely to be permanent, the non-completion of the
   smaller headways between trains will limit the capacity of the network to offer users with
   adequate levels of service, especially if the demand continues to grow. However, as noted
   above, shifts in the distribution of trips have attenuated these effects and currently Metro
   Lines 1 and 2 are offering adequate levels of comfort, despite the growth in demand.
   Metro’s plans for the next years in terms of providing a solid expansion of the network will
   likely contribute to a redistribution of flows, reducing the need for lower headways in the
   current lines. For Lines 3 and most CPTM Lines, comfort levels have already reached the
   limit (in some cases 8 passengers/m2 in the peak period), so improvements in the level of
   service are still strongly needed to improve the lives of the transport users, in particular
   low-income users. High risks of not sustaining the development outcomes will arise if these
   improvements are not met, and, given the current economic situation, the likelihood of
   these improvements not happening is moderate.
b) Social: the project has contributed to improving the lives of low-income passengers, but a
   lot remains to be done, especially in terms of improving the levels-of-service. CPTM has
   been able to gain increasing community support by providing gradually higher levels of
   service but this support is at risk because of the crowdedness of the system and the
   uncleanliness of tracks. Despite the services being considered good by 44% of the users
   (according to the CPTM customer satisfaction survey), this number has been recently
   declining. The company’s management system has been working with the community and
   has trained more than 3,000 collaborators since 2010 to improve the cleanliness of the
   station and tracks, and employees are oriented on how to improve passengers’ awareness
   in terms of their behavior and care for the railway.
c) Financial: there is moderate risk that the continued expansion of the Metro and CPTM
   network under the current fare structure (flat fares with BUI) could upset further the
   equilibrium of operating revenues in the metropolitan network, negatively impacting Metro
   and CPTM operations in the future. Despite the public transport system being crucial to
   improve accessibility to opportunities for a high share of the low-income population, the
   decision to subsidize the system must be accompanied by a compensation mechanism to
   guarantee its financial sustainability, and by a strong effort to increase efficiency in
   operations and possibly explore other sources of revenues. One of the possible mitigations
   is to make the fare structure less rigid, for example by gradually introducing zonal fares or
   more targeted subsidies designed to minimize any negative impact on low-income
   passengers in the periphery that currently benefit from flat fares. There is a modest risk of
   government not being able to continue or develop the necessary adjustments to the fare to
   provide fiscal sustainability, since decisions on fares are commonly influenced by political
   factors. There is also a modest risk of not achieving optimal efficiency in operations, to the
   extent that this may require some cuts in personnel, which tend to face strong resistance by
   unions and some other stakeholders.
d) Economic: the current risk of macroeconomic or fiscal conditions adversely affecting the
   conclusion of this project and future operations is moderate. Significant additional
   investments in rolling stock, stations, and system upgrades are needed to increase operating
   capacity in the SPMR and alleviate the continued growth in congestion. These investments
   in transport infrastructure are among the highest priorities for municipal and state

                                             19
      governments in SPMR. However, because of the macroeconomic scenario, there is a
      modest risk of government not being able to commit to the necessary investments to the
      network.
   e) Institutional support: Metro/CPTM have committed to implement an extensive expansion
      to the system. However, the pace of implementation of these investments has been slow,
      and there is a strong societal demand to deliver these projects more efficiently. Therefore,
      the implementing companies are likely to suffer from negative public opinion claiming
      lack of capacity to deliver these projects. Options of other forms of financing from public-
      private partnerships are currently being explored, such as the MIP (Manifestação de
      Interesse da Iniciativa Privada) programs used for Lines 6 and 18. The MIP legislation
      allows private initiative to kick-start the process for a new project and was designed as a
      means to accelerate project preparation and investment, as well as to address the lack of
      available “shovel-ready” engineering designs for priority infrastructure projects for the
      State. The Bank supported this effort through a RAS, and while the process potentially
      generates efficiency in streamlining rigid procurement processes in Brazil, there are several
      risks associated with the complexity of implementing rail projects that should be mitigated
      by the public sector (e.g., related to resettlements, interferences with utilities,
      environmental permits, traffic permits) or there will be low interest from the private sector.
      Alternatively, the risks should have to be counter balanced by higher premium rates.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

At entry, the project was designed as an urban transport operation completely aligned with the
long-term transport plan for the SPMR but also with the urgent needs for better quality of transport
for users, especially low-income users. The strategy to upgrade the quality of the suburban rail
entailed taking advantage of a 315 km of existing network so that growth could be directed to
where infrastructure, although degraded, already existed. The fare integration (metro-rail
integration occurred in 2006) had allowed for reducing the costs of travel, but the low-income
population was still bearing the brunt of extreme overcrowding and long work journeys, both of
which increase the generalized cost of traveling, leaving the poor with few alternatives and
inducing a growth in motorcycle and car ownership, with high impacts on congestion and on the
environment.

In this context, the Bank and the Borrower prepared the project by: (i) carrying out a solid
background analysis; (ii) evaluating lessons learned from previous operations and appropriate
alternatives; (iii) holding detailed missions with specialized teams of consultants; (iv) designing a
technically well-conceived project based on data and information available at the moment; (v)
evaluating a range of foreseeable risks and proposing appropriate mitigation measures; (vi) paying
attention to institutional aspects, such as ensuring that the project had support from the Metro
Employee Union as well as from all São Paulo political parties; and (vii) ensuring the availability
of the necessary funding for the project. While some implementation problems, such as delays and
the lack of readiness of the technology, in retrospect could have been evaluated further by the Bank

                                                 20
during preparation, these risks ultimately had to be borne by the implementing agency. In fact, the
Bank team successively suggested that the implementing agency adopted a sequential approach,
which in the end, during implementation, was the approach adopted. Additionally, although some
of the upgrades could not be completed by the closing date of the Loan, these activities are still
relevant and will continue to be pursued by the companies.

Finally, the project development objectives were comprehensive and flexible enough to remain
valid.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank supervision is rated “Satisfactory” on the following basis: (i) frequent supervision missions
(15 ISRs filed between June 2008 and March 2015, or more than 2 per year, not including FM,
safeguards, and procurement supervision missions which took place twice a year); (ii) prompt
identification of implementation problems such as delays in contracts with appropriate responses,
including additional reporting and supervision requirements from the Borrower with the support
of the PMOC; (iii) high-quality advice and support to the Borrower during the entire process,
especially with specialists to assist in disputes between the implementing unit and its providers;
and (iv) Bank follow-up actions to deal with unexpected implementation problems in a timely and
appropriate manner, for example by approving the Additional Financing that enhanced the impact
of the project. Overall, the Task Team demonstrated sensitivity and responsiveness to the client’s
needs, excellent engagement, and appropriate adaptation of the project to ensure maximum
relevance and achievement of PDOs, in light of changing conditions and delays mostly outside the
Bank’s control. By the mid-term review (in April 2011), the main concerns were issues largely out
of the control of the Bank: the non-delivery of the CBTC system and the financial difficulties that
some contractors were facing because of high labor costs, among others. The Bank team, however,
kept assisting Metro in all of those aspects, providing the international experience required for
Metro to design locally acceptable options, serving as an intermediary in the discussions among
stakeholders.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank helped the Borrower in the adequate preparation of the project and provided instrumental
assistance in implementing project. The Bank also actively addressed implementation problems
thanks to a careful, versatile and proactive supervision. This helped adapt the project to changing
circumstances and resulted in the achievement of most of the PDO targets.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

SSP was effective in providing counterpart funds, which have proven to be a major problem in
recent Bank-funded operations. However, delays in the engagement with the Regional Transport
Coordination Commission (CDTI) and in the preparation of procurement documents, delayed the
implementation of the Long Term Transport Plan (PITU). Additionally, the scope covered in the
                                                21
PITU, despite being an important step towards updating the overall plan, could have been more
comprehensive.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Metro is an experienced organization with a department dedicated to supervising this project.
Metro has always run project management in-house, while CPTM relied more on outside
consultants because of a leaner management structure. Both formed Project Management Units
(PMUs) focused on institutional, financial, fiduciary, reporting and safeguards requirements of the
Bank loan. CPTM has a greater challenge because of a much larger and complex network to
supervise. The PMUs were supported by a Project Management Oversight Consultant (PMOC)
financed by the loan, which issued monthly and ad hoc reports to the State Secretary of
Metropolitan Transport (STM-SP) and to the Bank. Finally, there was a additional Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) reporting to the STM-SP Secretary and to the Governor on strategic
aspects of the project.

The project underperformed in terms of the schedule and technical difficulties that will end up
having longer-term impacts on cost. During the Project implementation, CPTM was unable to
secure sufficient time windows for companies to perform at an adequate speed and was slow to
resolve physical interferences with the Concessionaire for freight transport that uses the same right
of way. Both CPTM and Metro did not succeed in enforcing companies to provide more detailed
schedules that would allow quicker implementation. The contracts did not have sufficient
mechanisms to enforce the companies so as to generate effective recovery of delays.

Delays also occurred because of contractual disputes in the two major signaling contracts.
Although the companies tried to follow sound procedures, neither the conflict resolution nor the
international arbitration allowed for resolution within the Loan period. The process of resolving
these disputes required multiple approvals in different departments which resulted in lengthy
processes. Having all documents in English was a burden and time-consuming exercise for Metro.
However, national litigation processes may suffer from the potential influence of contractors in
the domestic market.

These problems, while never entirely preventable, could have been better anticipated by the
implementing agencies by designing better contracts and by producing more detailed
implementation schedules. Moreover, both CPTM and Metro were slow in terms of identifying
possible alternate solutions when contracts started to underperform.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance is Moderately Satisfactory based on the performance of the
SSP, Metro and CPTM. Despite a significant delay in project completion and other implementation
problems, main project outputs were delivered and outcomes were substantially achieved.

6. Lessons Learned
The project was strategic in terms of improving transport quality and taking advantage of a vast
rail network to transport passengers of the SPMR in an efficient, environmentally friendly way.
The main lessons learned are described below:

Implementing rail projects in brownfield is substantially more complex than in greenfield,
and require longer implementation schedules. The project included upgrading the existing
signaling systems and civil works for railway lines under operation. These lines carried more than
1 million passengers daily, so an interruption in operations was not a feasible option. It is
important for all parties in future projects of this type to carefully analyze all the detailed
ramifications of implementing upgrades while systems remain under operation and to translate
these assessments into realistic time frames, with contingencies.

New (signaling) technologies should be deployed gradually to mitigate risks. The current level
of service provided by the metro system in Sao Paulo, measured in terms of headways (interval
between trains) seems to have reached the ceiling. Few, if any, systems in the world have been
able to deliver such small headways for such a large demand. This has been achieved along the
years by a strong operations team in Metro that has worked to optimize operations by introducing
changes to the off-the-shelf products that signaling systems providers offered. Metro specified this
time even more stringent requirements, to a technology that until this point has not shown sufficient
results. However, technicians all over the world were (and are) confident that this technology will
eventually be made robust enough to set the standard for the future. Even so, it would have been
sensible to implement the technology in stages, focusing the resources of both contractors and
Metro’s supervision team on a smaller scope.

Schedule of payments in contracts should minimize the risks of incomplete deliveries. One of
the problems that arose during implementation was that the systems contracts specified large
payments for the delivery of equipment and components. This decision was based on the fact that
these expensive components have a large weight in the financial proposal, so the logical decision
was to set the schedule of payments accordingly. However, in terms of complexity of the activities
involved, installation can be the critical part. Since providers were paid a large percentage of the
contract value towards components’ deliveries, the installation phase might have become less
attractive, especially when considering the low availability of labor force during times of heated
economic. The solution is to design payment schedules that incentivize successful installation, not
just equipment provision.

Indicators of reliability and safety should be incorporated into the results framework. The
project incorporated upgrading permanent ways, signaling, energy, and auxiliary systems.
Although not fully achieved, improvements in those systems have conferred a higher level of
service to the rail system that was not evidenced by the chosen indicators. Indicators of reliability,
directly related to these improvements, can be proposed as a measure of quality of service being
delivered. Indicators related to service stoppages (in units/month or hours/month) and
punctuality/regularity (in percentage of on-time trips or coefficient of variation of the headways
offered) are good examples of possible indicators. These improvements have an effect on the
attractiveness of the system and influence the outcomes related to demand. Indicators related to



                                                 23
safety could also be included since, besides being a desirable outcome per se, have an impact in
the long-term image of the system.

Having strong institutional support is a crucial point for sustainability of the transport
system. The long term plan (PITU) and the land use and transport model that supports the PITU
policies and guidelines are important instruments for consideration when planning for new
infrastructure, since they allow for a comprehensive view of the Metropolitan area’s challenges
and opportunities. The dynamics of population across the territory, especially considering low-
income population access to employment and services, are aspects that have been incorporated
into the metropolitan region planning and new important policies, such as densification around
metro stations, were proposed as a result of these models. Moreover, issues related to affordability
and the financial sustainability of fare schemes are a crucial theme that have been in the center of
the discussion in several fora, especially in Brazil where physical integration has been pursued
and successfully achieved in some situations. São Paulo, through this loan, has developed a tool
that allows for simulation of different fare schemes, and although proper action towards
changes in fare structure is constrained by political pressure to keep fares low, this tool
allows planning agencies to foresee impacts of possible fare schemes and propose actions to
mitigate problems.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The borrower raised some inconsistencies in the indicators and dates that were appropriately
revised. The borrower also observed that the ratings of project implementation were downgraded
to moderately unsatisfactory during the last 3 months. The Bank team clarified that the rating
reflects the difficulties in resolving the contractual disputes with the systems suppliers’ thus
jeopardizing full achievement of target indicators, but noted that the overall project rating is
Moderately Satisfactory.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
An incremental cost-benefit analysis of the existing and proposed investments was undertaken to
evaluate the economic feasibility of the project, taking in account modifications incurred of the
initial scope of projects.
1. The demand and transport economics study review involved the following activities: a) a
     review estimating passenger stations in the 2010-2014 during project implementation and
     demand projection of the period 2014-2038; b) Investment flows as reported by the PMU; c)
     Calculation of the internal rate of return considering updated unit costs and operational
     parameters of the transport system.

2.   The methodology used consisted in comparing the situation with and without project and
     quantifying the benefits due to time savings for users of all public modes, operating cost
     savings for all modes, road maintenance cost savings, accident savings, air pollution savings
     and the investment and operating costs. The demand for each mode was determined using a
     demand model which estimated the passenger-hours and passenger-km saved by mode with
     the project for without and with scenarios.

3.   The main benefits considered were:

•    Operating cost savings resulting from the lower costs of operating all modes with and without
     the project through estimates of passenger-km with and without the project which are
     multiplied by the respective estimated operating costs;
•    Travel time savings estimated by determining the passenger-hours saved, by type of trip
     (home-to-work, business or other) and multiplied by the value of time for each mode according
     to each scenario with and without project;
•    Reduction in road maintenance costs due to the reduction of bus-km with the project
     (minor);
•    Reduction in the bus system managing costs due to avoided costs of expanding the existing
     public management structure;
•    Reduction of air pollution costs due to reduction in bus-km with project (minor). To be
     conservative the costs of avoided investments in the do-nothing situation were not considered;
•    Reduction of accidents costs estimated by multiplying the average cost per accident per 1000
     passenger-km with and without project and are a function of the number of bus-km saved
     (minor).

4.   The main costs considered were:

•    Investment costs for the acquisition of trains, partial costs for systems upgrading and
     consulting and management services and
•    Operating costs including personnel, consumption and maintenance of Railway
     infrastructure, fleet and systems.


5.   The project decreased the number of bus-km and bus passenger-hour traveled on the urban
     network through the construction of a new subway line. The bus-km saved per year are
     estimated by the demand model. The main beneficial impacts of the project under evaluation
                                                31
     are reduced congestion (mainly due to less buses on the street), reduction in traffic-related
     accidents, reduced vehicular air pollution, reduced noise due to less buses on the street and
     economic savings from reduction of travel time.

6.   The above are all quantifiable and were used in the economic analysis. There are, however, a
     great number of non-quantifiable benefits which cannot be captured in a standard cost-
     benefit analysis but are worth noting:

•    Improvement of travel level of service: (i) Train occupation rates decreased due to the
     expansion of the network and services within the metropolitan area; (ii) Comfort level
     improvements on railway services are difficult to measure benefits and will lead to higher
     utility levels of travel consumption and associated benefits.
•    Avoidable costs in building up urban road infrastructure capacity – several investments on
     roadway infrastructure were avoided or postponed by the enhancement of the proposed railway
     services.
•    Employment Generation: the project promoted the creation of jobs with multiplier effects in
     several sectors of the economy.

 Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
The current analysis of users’ perception is based on information from three different data sources;
i) for general conclusions, the main data source is the survey conducted by ANTP (“Associação
Nacional de Transportes Públicos) from 1985 to 2012, ii) for the analysis of the metro system, the
information was provided by Sao Paulo Metro for the 2008-2014 period, and iii) for the train
system, information was provided by CPTM for the 2010 to 2014 period.
Since 2008, ANTP surveys included household-based surveys (around 1,300 in Sao Paulo) and
onsite intercept surveys’ (around 100 for EMTU). Confidence index for these surveys was 95%
and sampling error 2.0%. CPTM’s database included a perception’s survey of more than 3,500
users from 2010 to 2014. The confidence index is 95% and sampling error vary between 4.5% in
2010 to 3.6% in 2014.

   1. General user’s perceptions

From 2010 until 2012, according to ANTP data, Metro and CPTM systems were perceived by
users as the transport modes with most improvements. In 2010, among the reasons reported by
users, the most significant is the reduction in train waiting times. Other reasons were the decrease
in in-vehicle trip times and the provision of new and modern cars, both for Metro and CPTM
systems. In 2012, the reasons were mainly related to the enhancement of train stations, the
acquisition of new and modern trains, the increased speed, and the operation of new metro lines.
In all surveys, the most quoted complaint is related to overcrowding of the systems followed by
the need of building new metro and rail lines.

   2. Perceptions about the Metro System

The graph below show the evolution metro users’ perception by line. It considers the percentage
of Good and Very Good answers. The graph depicts the answers for Metro lines affected by the
project and for the system as whole. It is important to highlight that the answers for the whole
system are not an average of the answers of each line, but the actual percentage of “Good/Very
Good” answers to the question addressed specifically to evaluate the metro system as a whole.

Lines 1 and 2 are constantly rated better than the whole metro system; however, line 3 is repeatedly
rated worse. Surveys do not provide specific information about the reasons behind the answers
specifically addressed for each of these lines. However, this difference might be related to the fact
that when a specific line is being addressed, the user makes stricter judgement of the quality of
service, while when analyzing the whole system the user tends to judge the overall adequacy of
the metro systems, including a policy bias. The highest perception ratings of the Metro system and
its different lines occurs in 2009, when the project had not yet produced any effects.

Between 2008 and 2011, over 60% of line 1 respondents and over 65% percent of line 2
respondents rated the service as very good or good. However, in 2012 and 2013 there was a sharp
decline of very good and good answers which have not been recovered yet. Finally, line 3 is
constantly rated worse than the system as whole. Between 2008 and 2011 the percentage of very
good and good answers were over 55% and again after 2012, there has been a sharp decrease in
the quality of service perception, which can be attributed to overcrowding.

The figure below includes the perception of users from 2010 to 2014 for all Lines and the system
as a whole. As seen, Line 5 presents in general the highest approval rates and was not part of the
Trains and Signaling project, while Line 3 has the lowest approval rates.

To assess if the project has produced positive results according to the metro users, we conduct a
double difference between the intervened lines and line 5, which has no intervention and is
considered the “control” line. Table below presents the results. Since we do not have specific data
on approval rates, we have considered the percentage of Good and Very Good answers as the
values of users’ approval.

The first column presents the difference in ratings from the intervened lines and Line 5. As can be
seen, the difference in approval rates in 2010 between Lines 3 and 5 is high; of 15 points (Line 5
had higher approval rates). The same happens in 2014; nevertheless, this difference is now smaller,
indicating that Line 3 has improved more than Line 5. The same is true for lines 1 and 2. In these
cases, in 2014 their approval rate is higher than the one for Line 5, improving 8 and 7 percent
points respectively during the period.

   3. Perceptions about the CPTM System

Users’ approvals rate of the CPTM rail system as a whole is higher than the average of all the lines
between 2010 and 2014. In 2012, there was a pronounced fall in the approval rate of the system,
which was more accentuated for lines 7 and 12. This could be due to the fact that the interviews
were conducted at the same time the modernization interventions were intensified which affected
the operation of lines especially at the end of the weed and during weekends. Besides, other non-
frequent incidents have been also reported by CPTM during interviewing days (falling tree over
line 7 which caused performance difficulties and delays and a train failure in line 12 which also
caused delays). Approval rates were rapidly recovered in 2013 and Line 12 surpassed the CPTM
whole system levels. Excluding 2012, the approval rate for the lines improved by the project is
over 55%.

The survey also provides information about quality of service evolution between 2010 and 2014.
As can be seen in the figure below, the vast majority of users think that the quality of the service
for the train system as a whole and the lines upgraded by the project is better or stable.

Line 12 is the one with the best ratings, 53.8% of “better” answer and 31.4% of “stable” answers,
followed by Line 11 (45.4% of “better” and 37.6% of “stable” and finally Line 7 (43.4% of “better”
and 36.4% of “stable”). Line 12 is better rated than the train system as a whole while Line 7 is
worse. Only 12% surveyees think than the lines are today worse than they were before the
implementation of the project. Line 7 is the worst rated line with 16.6% of “worse” answers, which
can be attributed to overcrowding and low rates of comfort, at 7.2 passengers/m2 in the peak-hour.

The figure above presents the approval rates from 2010 to 2014 for all Lines and the system as a
whole. As seen, Line 10 presents in general the highest approval rates and was not part of the
Trains and Signaling project, while the Line 7 has the lowest approval rates.

A double difference analysis was conducted also for CPTM intervened lines. The objective was to
assess if, according to the users’ perception, the project has produced positive results. Line 10,
which has no intervention, is considered the “control” line. Table below presents the results.

The first column presents the difference in ratings from the intervened lines and Line 10. As can
be seen, the difference in approval rates in 2010 between Lines 7 and 10 is high, of 16.3 percent
points (Line 10 has higher approval rates). The same happens in 2014; however, this difference is
now smaller, indicating that Line 7 has improved more than Line 10. The same is true for Line 12,
which shows the higher improvement comparing to Line 10, and Line11.

According to users’ perception, although approval rates have been declining over the last 4 years,
mainly due to overcrowding of systems, the intervened lines, both for Metro and CPTM, have
shown an improvement in approval rates when compared to the control lines, where no
intervention was made. Finally, the decline in users’ perception of the quality of service along the
last years can also be attributed to a higher standard brought by the inauguration of Line 4 and the
overall public dissatisfaction with the limited investment in public transport, as evidenced by the
2013 demonstrations.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. Introduction
The basis of the partnership between the State of São Paulo and the Bank in the transport sector
was established more than 15 years ago, with the decentralization of state suburban rail system,
run by the federal agency CBTU (Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos). The long term strategy
was based on 4 pillars: (i) creating a commission of regional coordination with the municipalities,
operators and users, (ii) implementing an integrated land use, urban transport and air quality
system, (iii) create financial mechanisms to guarantee long term sustainability of the system, and
(iv) progressive participation of the private sectors in the operations.

After the successful decentralization of the federal system, the State has asked the Bank to support
the integration of the CBTU-SP with FEPASA (suburban train system at the time), promoting
physical integration and improving main transfer stations. After that, the Bank supported the
implementation of Line 4 phase I and the Trains and Signaling Project, and has been supporting
Line 4 phase II with an additional loan and Line 5 with a new loan.

The state has also advanced in the institutional aspects through the creation of the Comission of
Coordination of Regional Transport (CDTI), which has been responsible for implementing an
integrated fare cheaper than the sum of individual fares. An important consequence of the
improvement in the metropolitan system and enhanced physical integration is the dramatic growth
in demand, creating an urgent need of improving transport capacity and train frequency, especially
during peak-periods, in order to maintain acceptable levels of service and safety. Besides that, the
improvement in the system would create positive benefits to the environment by avoiding a larger
shift to less efficient transport modes. The project would also increase accessibility of poorer
populations to opportunities and contribute to the reduction of poverty.

2. Factors that affected implementation
The state has implemented in the last years several improvements in the system that allowed for a
greater coverage of the system, a greater usage of the system by low-income population. However,
the success of the system has also generated crowdedness, which affects the level of services
offered.

The list bellow summarizes the status of the main project contracts:

   •   The 40 new trains for CPTM were delivered and are fully operational;
   •   The 09 new trains from the additional financing for Line 11 were delivered and are fully
       operational;
   •   The contract for CPTM signaling, telecommunications and supplies has a physical progress
       of 57% and is currently paralyzed;
   •   Contracts for permanent way and overhead cables have physical progress ranging from
       57% to 72%, and contract for Lot 1 is currently paralyzed;
   •   Diagnosis and Mapping of the Environmental Information and an Environmental
       Management has just started and is ongoing;
   •   Supervision of trains manufacture and assembly was concluded;
   •   The 17 new trains for Metro were delivered and are fully operational;

                                                41
   •   The contract for Metro systems has a current financial progress of 61% is ongoing;
   •   The analysis and supervision of detailed design was concluded and the safety analysis of
       the modernization of systems has physical progress of 94 %;
   •   The analysis of detailed design of the 17 trains was concluded.

The sustainability of the project will depend on the (i) the continuity of the priority of the transport
sector by the State, (ii) the implementation and financing of additional improvements to renovate
and maintain the infrastructure, (iii) the maintenance of integrated fares. The State has
demonstrated to maintain ownership of the project in the last years, even if at some points the
implementation and financing has been challenged by fiscal restrictions.

3. Achievement of PDO Objectives and Ratings
The achievement of objectives was considered satisfactory. The delays in the delivery of trains
were related to the manufacturer delays in resolving pending quality issues and lack of planning
from the manufacturer side, but these issues were largely overcome. The financial management of
the Project can also be considered satisfactory, and the funds were provided by government during
the implementation. The main benefits from the project raised by the beneficiaries are:

   •   Easier access to/integration of commercial centers and medical facilities;
   •   The constitution of a metro-rail system;
   •   Improved access of low-income population to commercial centers, health centers,
       education and leisure;
   •   Reductions in travel time between origin and destination pairs, integration with Metro and
       other modes of transportation.

An important institutional component related to the PITU was fully achieved. The work developed
is a step towards the development of a new strategic plan, which is a continuous planning process
that in the next steps should include new planned bus corridors, the Arco do Futuro project,
amongst others. One important achievement is that now the PITU includes both the aggregate
demand transport planning but spatially disaggregated with an EMME model and a more spatially
aggregated but demand disaggregated with a TRANUS model. The TRANUS model evidenced
the need to include in the set of actions measures to contain demand for car use, since that even
with massive investments in mass transit there is a strong tendency of shift to private modes. The
urban operations and transit-oriented developments alike should then be strongly pursued.

4. Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned are:

   •   Long term financial mechanisms and institutional body are necessary to allow for the
       sustainability of projects, including the financial sustainability of the urban transport
       system of São Paulo;
   •   The Project monitoring using performance indicators allow for project supervision of the
       improvement of public transport systems and accessibility of low-income population
       related with the measurement of the generalized cost of travel.



                                                  42
   •   The implementation on brownfield has proven to be extremely complex, since works have
       to occur without interrupting operations, so the schedules have become longer than
       expected.
   •   The Metro Signaling System has reached its limit, but very few systems in the world are
       capable of delivering these headways given the level of transported demand. This situation
       is possible due to the performance of the operations team of Metro, who has been working
       to improve products purchased from signaling companies.
   •   The technology provided by the vendor has not proven sufficient results yet. Technical
       analyses from around the world confirmed that the future technology is CBTC and the
       vendor has signed a contract confirming the intention to deliver the stringent requirements.
       However, it is possible that a phased approach of this new technology would have been a
       better option.
   •   The payment flows in contracts had to respond to the difficulties, since signed contracts
       had a large payment towards delivery of equipment and components, minding the financial
       equilibrium of contracts. However, it became clear that installation is the critical part, and
       vendors were less interested in developing this phase.
   •   PITU and transport models that support policies are important instruments in planning new
       infrastructure, since they allow for an overall view of the challenges and opportunities of a
       Metropolitan Region. The dynamics of population along the territory, especially
       considering the low-income populations to opportunities were incorporated to the
       metropolitan plans and new and important policies, like densification around metro
       stations, were proposed based on those models. Accessibility and sustainability are crucial
       aspects, and physical integration has been pursued and achieved in some situations.

5. Performance of Bank, Borrower and Implementing Agencies
The Bank has provided financial resources according to projected cash-flow and the task team had
active participation with regular missions.

The State of Sao Paulo, as the Borrower, represented by its Secretaries, has performed with agility
in the provision of loan funds and counterpart funds.

CPTM and Metrô, as the implementing agencies, had a decisive role in the implementation of the
Project, providing high performance teams for monitoring the contracts, reacting promptly for the
solution of pending issues.

Annex 9. Impact assessment of Sao Paulo Trains and Signaling Project on traffic
volumes, travel times and emissions

After the implementation of the project, 1.35 million new users were added to the rail system (96%
of the 1.4 million target), of which more than 51% come from the lowest income groups (monthly
income of 4 or less minimum salaries). Average speeds of the urban rail system increased from
19.7km/h and 29.3 km/h to 25.9km/h and 37.7 km/h for metro and rail respectively 8. Although it
is not possible to determine exact prior mobility patterns of these new users, this analysis provide
different counterfactuals in order to assess the range of project impacts.

1. Methodology
In order to calculate the impacts of the project, differences between the current scenario and the
counterfactual regarding traffic volumes (V), travel times (T) and CO2 emissions (E) were
calculated. The number of trips, the average trip length, and the average speed define scenarios for
each of the transport modes.

                 Project impacts|V,T,E = Current Scenario|V,T,E – Counterfactual|V,T,E

Traffic volumes [veh-km/day] are calculated multiplying daily trips and the average trip distance,
and dividing by the occupancy rate or IPK (Index Passenger-Km), depending on the case. Values
and sources for occupancy rates and IPKs are presented in the table below. Travel times [pax-
hour/day] are calculated multiplying number of trips and the average trip time per mode. Finally,
CO2 emissions [ton/day] are calculated multiplying the traffic volume and the Emission Factors
by transport mode provided by the Urban Mobility Observatory of the Development Bank for Latin
America, - CAF 9- database for Sao Paulo 2007 (for car, moto and bus). For trains and subway,
emissions are calculated based on energy efficiency indicators and Brazil’s electricity generation
efficiency.

To define the current scenario, information from the Mobility Survey of 2012, data from the CAF
database for Sao Paulo, and specific information from the project implementation were used. The

3. Counterfactual general assumptions
To define the counterfactual some general assumptions were taken into account:

       •    1.35 million users (passengers) per day have been added to the system of which more than
            51% are from the lowest income groups;
       •    52.5% of the new users are metro users and 47.5% of new users are train users 10;
       •    The average trip length of the current urban rail systems is 16.9 km 11.
       •    The average speeds considered for the counterfactual scenario would be the same as for
            the current scenario, except for the metro and train modes, that would be the ones existing
            before the implementation of the project (19.7 km/h for metro and 29.3 km/h for train).
            Since speeds would be expected to decrease when adding trips and not modifying capacity,
            we can consider this a conservative assumption.

The objective of this analysis is to know what would have happened if the 1.35M new passengers,
instead of travelling by metro or train, were travelling by other transport modes. Taking into
account that the average trip distance for rail modes is overlong for biking or walking modes, it is
unlikely that the average users of the urban rail system would have been non-motorized travelers
if the project had not existed. Therefore, we consider that new users would have been users of

other motorized transport modes (car, moto and bus). Besides, we consider that the average trip
length of the 1.35M users would have been the same regardless of the transport mode used before
the implementation of the project.

          for comparison.

4. Sensitivity analysis
In order to assess the impact of the project on emissions it is necessary to consider the whole
transportation system (including autos and motos), not only bus and railway system. Therefore, in
this section, we analyze different hypothesis for the counterfactuals considering the whole
transportation system. The first three counterfactuals stablish the most and the less conservative
scenarios. The last three counterfactuals consider the modal split previous to the project
implementation in different ways and the fact that 51% of the new users come for the lowest
income groups.

     •   C1: all the new users of the train system would had been BUS users, if the project had
         never been implemented.
     •   C2: all the new users of the train system would had been CAR users, if the project had
         never been implemented.
     •   C3: all the new users of the train system would had been MOTORCYCLE users, if the
         project had never been implemented.
     •   C4: new users would have been users of other motorized transport modes (car, moto and
         bus) preserving the modal split provided by the 2007 Mobility Survey and taking into
         account income. In this case low income is considered below R$2,488 12.
     •   C5: new users would have been users of other motorized transport modes (car, moto and
         bus) preserving the modal split provided by the 2007 Mobility Survey and taking into
         account income. In this case low income is considered below R$1,244.
     •   C6: new users would have been users of all the motorized transport modes (car, moto, bus,
         train and metro) preserving the modal split provided by the 2007 Mobility Survey and
         taking into account income. In this case low income is considered below R$1,244.

   2012 Mobility Survey of Sao Paulo provides information about the number of trips disaggregated by family rent in
five categories: till R$1,244; between R$1,244 and R$2,488; between R$2,488 and R$4,976; between R$4,976 and
R$9,330 and more than R$9,330. C4 ,C5 and C6 calculate modal split for low income and other income trips
considering low income below R$2,488 and R$1,244 respectively.

5. Results
The table below shows the results of the impacts on traffic volume, emissions and travel times
of the São Paulo Trains and Signaling Project for the different counterfactual options.
Highest reductions in traffic volume occur if, without project implementation, the new users of
the urban rail system would have been motorcycle drivers and the lowest if they would have been
bus users. In terms of CO2 emissions and travel times savings, the highest savings occur if all the
new urban rail system passengers would have been car drivers.

For intermediate scenarios, which are the more realistic since they modify the counterfactual
modal split but taking into account the before project modal shares (C4, C5 and C6), savings are
lower and similar for the three counterfactuals, but still significant.

Considering C6 the most probable one, where the 1.35M users are distributed among bus (43%),
car (42%) and moto (3%), metro (9%) and train (3%), we can estimate that the project have reduced
8% of traffic volume. Specifically for road transport, the reduction in traffic volume (veh-km)
accounts for 12% for moto, 12% for car and 5% for buses. It has also provided an 8% reduction in
CO2 emissions and another 8% reduction in passenger travel times.

All the counterfactuals considered bring about savings in CO2 emissions: between 3% reduction
for the scenario without project with all new passengers in BUS and 14% for the scenario with all
passengers in CAR. Regarding traffic volumes, savings vary from a virtual 0% for the BUS option
to a 21% for the MOTO option. Finally, travel time savings is the indicator with less variability
among counterfactuals, it ranges from a 5% for the MOTO option to a 9% reduction for the CAR.
