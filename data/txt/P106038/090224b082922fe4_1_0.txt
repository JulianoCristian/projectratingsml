Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The proposed development objective is to: a) improve the level-of-service provided to the urban rail transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan
 Region in a safe and cost-efficient manner by increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines A and F of the Companhia Paulista
 de Trens Metropolitanos(CPTM) and Lines 1, 2 and 3 of the São Paulo Metro Company (Metro); and b) continuethe strengthening of the transport
 management and policy framework in the SPMR.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project objectives have been partially to mostly achieved thus far as nearly all new trains are in operation (17 for Metro, 40 for CPTM + 9 additional
 trains by early 2015). However, there has been significant delays with the remaining signaling contracts for CPTM and METRO and track improvement
 contracts for CPTM. This is in part due to the complexity of implementing these systems on lines in operation with high demand (such is the case for
 Lines 1, 2, 3, 7 and 12). Outcome indicators and overall project ratings will be updated before project closing (currently set for April 2015).

         Actual (Current): Target has not been achieved due to problems with CBTC signaling system. Also, original trains that operated in this line
         are undergoing renovation therefore they are not operating with full fleet as was planned.
