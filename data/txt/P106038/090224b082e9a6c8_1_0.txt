Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The proposed development objective is to: a) improve the level-of-service provided to the urban rail transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan
 Region in a safe and cost-efficient manner by increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines A and F of the Companhia Paulista
 de Trens Metropolitanos(CPTM) and Lines 1, 2 and 3 of the São Paulo Metro Company (Metro); and b) continuethe strengthening of the transport
 management and policy framework in the SPMR.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project objectives have been partially to mostly achieved thus far as all new trains are in operation (17 for Metro, 40 for CPTM + 9 additional
 trains). However, there has been significant delays with the signaling contracts for CPTM and METRO and track improvement contracts for CPTM.
 This is in part due to the complexity of implementing these systems for lines in daily operation with high demands (such is the case for Lines 1, 2, 3, 7
 and 12). Project objetives for Line 11 have been fully met. The remaining lines have partially achieved the project objectives mainly because of the
 delays in the signalling systems upgrades and the need to renew the old fleet, which resulted in a smaller than projected availability of the operational
 fleet.

         Comments
         For Lines 1, 2 and 3, the indicators for availability of trains show no improvement because the inital older fleet is undergoing renovations, so
         the new trains and part of the new trains were redistributed to optimize the service in the three lines, based on demand. Even if the whole
         fleet were fully operational, the non-conclusion of the signalling systems would have prevented the achievement of this indicator. One
         additional problem is that the renovated fleet has only CBTC on-board equipment. If Metro decides to cancel the CBTC project, which can
         occur in they consider it unfeasible, these trains will have to suffer yet another adaptation, by installing ATC equipment on board.

         Comments
         The indicators for Lines 1 and 2 have changed for better even with the frequency of trains going down. Metro's justification was that with the
         start of operation in Line 4 changed the profile for these lines and eased the crowdeness. An additional explanation is that there was a
         flatenning of the peak hour, i.e., the peak hour demand has been redistributed to a larger period, which means less concentration of
         passengers in the 15minute peak of the peak period. For Line 3, there was a slight decrease in this indicator because of the small increase
         in frequency of trains (from 35 to 33).

         The indicator was 93% met. This can be attributed to a general increase in average income in the metropolitan region of São Paulo but also
         the effect of the increase in Metro usage by higher income-levels tiers with the start of operation of Line 4.
