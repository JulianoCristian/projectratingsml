                         The proposed development objective is to: a) improve the level-of-service provided to the urban rail transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in a safe and
                         cost-efficient manner by increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines A and F of the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos(CPTM) and Lines
                         1, 2 and 3 of the São Paulo Metro Company (Metro); and b) continuethe strengthening of the transport management and policy framework in the SPMR.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There is steady progress on the delivery of new trains for Line 11, but the signaling and track contracts continue to be delayed because of the complexity of developing and
                         implementing these works and system on lines in operation (Lines 1, 2, 3, 7 and 12).
