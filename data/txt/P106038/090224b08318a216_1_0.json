and\n            Signaling Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project included upgrading the\n            existing signaling systems and civil works for railway lines\n            under operation. These lines carried more than 1 million\n            passengers daily, so an interruption in operations was not a\n            feasible option. It is important for all parties in future\n            projects of this type to carefully analyze all the detailed\n            ramifications of implementing upgrades while systems remain\n            under operation and to translate these assessments into\n            realistic time frames, with contingencies. One of the\n            problems that arose during implementation was that the\n            systems contracts specified large payments for the delivery\n            of equipment and components. This decision was based on the\n            fact that these expensive components have a large weight in\n            the financial proposal, so the logical decision was to set\n            the schedule of payments accordingly. However, in terms of\n            complexity of the activities involved, installation can be\n            the critical part. Since providers were paid a large\n            percentage of the contract value towards components\u2019\n            deliveries, the installation phase might have become less\n            attractive, especially when considering the low availability\n            of labor force during times of heated economic. The solution\n            is to design payment schedules that incentivize successful\n            installation, not just equipment provision."}, "docdt": "2015-10-29T22:19:02Z"}
