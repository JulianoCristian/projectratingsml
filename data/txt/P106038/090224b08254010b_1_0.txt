                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed development objective is to: a) improve the level-of-service provided to the urban rail transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in a safe and
                         cost-efficient manner by increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines A and F of the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos(CPTM) and Lines
                         1, 2 and 3 of the São Paulo Metro Company (Metro); and b) continuethe strengthening of the transport management and policy framework in the SPMR.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although the PDO has been partially achieved with new trains in operation (40 for CPTM and 17 for Metro), there has been little implementation progress in the past 6 months on the
                         remaining signaling and track improvement contracts. This is in part due to the complexity of developing and implementing these systems on lines in operation (Lines 1, 2, 3, 7 and
                         12) with high demand.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The implementation progress has been downgraded because of new and lingering problems with the remaining signaling and track improvement contracts for METRO and CPTM.
                         This rating will be re-evaluated considering progress in the next 6 months.
