As the signaling and track\n            upgrade components of the Project are significantly delayed,\n            the target indicator values for level-of-service (number of\n            trains and average trip duration) originally expected in\n            2012 and 2013 will only be achieved in 2014 and 2015\n            considering the most recent schedule presented by the\n            Borrower. The tables in the annex of this paper reflect the\n            new target dates for the indicators which otherwise remain\n            unchanged. Throughout project implementation, the\n            implementing agencies (METRO and CPTM) and the Borrower\n            represented by the Metropolitan Transport Secretariat have\n            given appropriate attention to fiduciary (financial\n            management and procurement) and safeguards (social and\n            environmental) requirements as per Bank policies and\n            guidelines. There are no outstanding audits. In addition,\n            neither the loan in particular, nor the country in general\n            is subject to an ongoing suspension of loan disbursements."}, "docdt": "2012-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
