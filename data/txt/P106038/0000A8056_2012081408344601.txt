                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed development objective is to: a) improve the level-of-service provided to the urban rail transport users in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in a safe and
                         cost-efficient manner by increasing the peak-hour and off-peak carrying capacity of Lines A and F of the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos(CPTM) and Lines
                         1, 2 and 3 of the São Paulo Metro Company (Metro); and b) continuethe strengthening of the transport management and policy framework in the SPMR.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         While significant implementation has been achieved to date, progress remains slower than expected due to delays of more than one year to the signaling and track contracts. The
                         problems are being addressed by CPTM, Metro and the Secretariat of Metropolitan Transport and the Bank is monitoring these critical contracts closely. The delays will affect the
                         achievement of some PDO targets within the project’s currently closing date and the Borrower has requested a time extension.
