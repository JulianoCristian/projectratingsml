Transport Project's\n            outcome was rated as satisfactory. Overall, the project was\n            well- designed and performed. The roads constructed showed\n            high and robust economic returns, and overall objectives are\n            likely to be achieved. The project revealed key limitations\n            of the project approach, as opposed to the program approach,\n            thus underscoring the need to place urban transport\n            development in an integrated context. Key lessons learned\n            from this project include: a) Future urban projects should\n            increase interaction with beneficiary communities to educate\n            them on the limits of projects and their respective roles.\n            b) Advance publicity and education campaign is necessary to\n            prepare the public for new concepts such as non-motorist\n            transport. Operation of the facilities requires the\n            definition of a role for law enforcement agencies. c)\n            Relocation of utility services prior to the main contract\n            reduced delays and minimized costs. d) Future consideration\n            for terminal rehabilitation should ensure that there is\n            enough evidence that the recipient assemblies control the\n            terminals and have power and commitment to introduce cost\n            recovery measures. e) An urban public transport policy\n            should be developed with inputs from stakeholders to ensure\n            effective usage of the roadway thus reducing congestion and\n            other disadvantages. f) Levels of governments matching funds\n            for projects must be released timely to reduce unnecessary\n            costs associated with delayed payments for contracts."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
