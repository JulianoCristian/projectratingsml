transport\n            services, make their delivery more equitable, and to sustain\n            the improved levels of service.  The project will strive to\n            achieve this by rehabilitating roads and transport\n            facilities, improving access to low income areas, and\n            building capacity in the institutions responsible for the\n            policy development and planning of urban transport and the\n            maintenance of its related infrastructure.  There are five\n            main components: (a) road rehabilitation in Accra and\n            Sekondi/Takoradi; (b) traffic management improvements; (c)\n            lorry park and bus terminal rehabilitation; (d) construction\n            of non-motorized transport facilities and access roads to\n            low-income areas; and (e) technical assistance to central\n            and local government agencies for policy development,\n            project preparation and implementation, and institutional\n            development.  The road rehabilitation works will focus on\n            Accra and Sekondi/Takoradi, where the problems are most\n            acute, while the traffic management and public transport\n            terminal improvements will be carried out in all five\n            cities.  The policy and institutional aspects will benefit\n            the whole country."}, "docdt": "1993-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
