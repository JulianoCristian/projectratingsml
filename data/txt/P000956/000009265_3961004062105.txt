MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR TE  E URBAN TRANSPORT PROlECT
I.    I submit for your approval the following report ard recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Ghana (GOG) for SDR 55 million, the equivalent of US$76.2
million, to help finance the Urban Transport Project (UTP). The credit would be on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years.
2.    Backgmrond One of the major socio-economic problems facing Ghana is the growing
inadequacy of its urban infrastructure and services in the face of a fast growing urban
population. About one-third of Ghana's population of 16 million lives in urban areas, with
about 20% concentrated in the five main cities of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi/Takoradi, Tema
and Tamale. The cities have about 1,864 kilometers of roads, of which 1,115 kilometers are
paved. Serious traffic congestion occurs in the centers of Accra and SekondVTakoradi as a
result of deteriorated road surfaces, vehicle/pedestrian conflict over road space and inadequate
junction design and signalling.
3.    Public transport offers low levels of service. Vehicles are generally old and poorly
maintained and operators are deterred from investing in newer vehicles because of the poor
road conditions and congestion, which limits their earning capacity. Public transport
terminals (commonly referred to as lorry parks in Ghana) are mostly unpaved, unhygienic and
offer few amenities. Low-income earners are particularly disadvantaged because the
secondary and tertiary roads providing access to their residential areas are in bad condition
and often become impassable when it rains. Virtually no provision is made for the users of
non-motorized vehicles, mainly bicycles and handcarts, which could offer a low-cost
alternative to public transport for many. Enquiries show that 62% of households in low-
income areas in Accra already own at least one bicycle, but their use is mainly restricted to
local roads, where motor traffic is light. Road safety is a serious problem with around 700
persors killed and around 7000 injured each year. About half these accidents occur in cities
aud a very high percentage involve pedestrians.
4.    Many agencies both at the central and local government levels are involved in urban
transport. Coordination of planning and policy development has been weak in the past but
Government has established an inter-ministerial committee structure served by a secretariat,
the Urban Transport Unit (UTU), based in the Ministry of Tranmport amd Communications
(MOTC) to address this issue.
5.    Proect Objetv    Commerce, industry and services will continue to grow rapidly as
the Ghanaian economy expands and much of the growth in these sectors will be in the cities.
If cities lack the necessary infrastructure and services, the expansion of the urban economy,
which is becoming an increasing part of the national economy, will be constrained. Urban
transport is one of the most important services to be considered. This project will: (a)
increase the quality of urban transport services; (b) improve the efficiency with which they
are produced (especially by reducing the cost and time lost in travel); (c) ensure that
improvements in urban transport services are sustained, especially through institutional
reform, cost recovery and maintenance; and (d) make access to urban transport services more
equitable, by ensuring that the urban poor benefit from services. The project will also: (a)



2
improve sector policy development and planning, by establishing formal coordination between
the various organizations involved; (b) increase safety, particularly for pedestrians and the
users of non-motorized transport; and (c) reduce fuel consumption and air pollution in the
cities.
6. Project Description The project has five main componients: (a) road rehabilitation
(50% of total project cost); (b) traffic management improvements (11%); (c) relabilitation of
lorry parks and bus terminals (9%); (d) a pilot program of non-motorized transport facilities,
and access improvements to low-income areas (15%); and (e) the strengthening of central and
local government agencies (15%). Aecra will be the main focus of the infrastructure
rehabilitation effort because it has the highest population, most traffic and greatest congestion.
Rehabilitation works will also be carried out in the central business district of
Sekondi/Takoradi, which suffers from localized congestion. Lorry parks and bus tenninals
wi'. be rehabilitated, and traffic management improved in all five of the project cities. The
non-motorized transport component is a pilot program to promote the use of bicycles in the
south of Ghana as an affordable means of transport for low and middle-income people. The
institutional strengthening effort will cover both central and local government and will
strengthen sector coordination, policy development and general management capabilities.
Schedule A gives the summary of estimated costs and financing plan. The amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, and the estimated disbursement schedule are given
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps of Ghana, Accra and
Sekondi/Takoradi, which identify the locaticns of project components are also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 11674-OH, dated April 20, 1993 is being distributed separately.
7.   ftjWet Financing The project cost is estimated at US$87.6 million equivalent of
which US$60.0 million is foreign costs. It is proposed that IDA finance US$76.2 million,
90% of total project costs excluding duties and taxes, and the Government of Ghana provide
the balance of US$11.4 million.
8.    Proj   Imlementati  The main implementation agencies will be the Urban
Transport Unit (UTU) within MOTC and the Deparment of Urban Roads (DUR) within the
Ministry of Roads and Highways. The UTU's primary objective will be to develop policy
and provide a focus for coordinating urban transport planning and development. DUR will be
responsible for managing and supervising construction of the infrastructure components. Staff
of both project units are familiar with Bank procedures and have been responsible for the
implemention of previous Bank projects. However, as this project will increase their
worldoad significantly, consultants will be commissioned to design and supervise virtually all
works and experienced specialists will be contracted to assist with the management of
contracts and policy development. Design and preparation of tender documents for the road
rehabilitation, traffic management and NMT components (around 65% by value of total
project costs) is being financed by a Japanese grant and is expected to be completed by May
1993.
9.    Project Sustainablity Government has agreed to increase the funding provided for
road maintenance from $7.2 million in 1994 to $11.9 million in 1998 in order to sustain the
benefits arising from the project. Eighty percent by value of maintenance is already carried
out by the private sector and Government has agreed to carry out a study to review the
implications of contracting out all maintenance, routine as well as periodic. The effectiveness
of maintenance operations will be increased by introducing a maintenance management



3
system. Government has also agreed to introduce measures to increase revenues from lorry
parks and bus terminals to fund maintenance. The capacity of the project units will be
increased through on-the-job training by the contracted specialists and programs which
emphasize practi-al training.
10.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement The Bank Group has supported four
highway projects, three transport projects, and three uriban projects with road components
since 1974. These projects supported Government's strategy to: (a) reduce costs and
maximize returns by concentrating on infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance rather than
on new construction; (b) make project investments and policy initiatives sustainable by
building capacity in key agencies and by improving resource mobilization systems through
taxes and user charges; and (c) focus much of the benefits on urban and rural poverty groups.
These objectives have generally been met though implementation, particularly in the earlier
projects, was slower than planned. This occurred because: (a) the institutional capacity of
project agencies was sometimes over-estimated, though this situation has improved in recent
years as the agencies gained experience with Bank projects and their staff benefitted from
project funded technical assistance and training; and (b) project agencies were unfamiliar with
the Bank's procurement procedures and Government's decision-making process for
procurement was over-centralized. Improvements are apparent in current projects as a result
of procurement training, greater delegation of authority and streamlining of the procurement
process.
11.   Rationale for IDA Involvement The problems arising from deteriorated roads and
traffic congestion in Accra and Ghana's other four main cities became apparent during the
preparation of the Accra District Rehabilitation Project in 1985 and studies were funded under
that project to identify means of overcoming them. It is the key recommendations of those
studies, which were subsequendy developed into detailed designs under Urban II, that are
being proposed for implementation in this project. The Bank with this past history of
involvement was able to play a unique role in assisting Government to develop the urban
transport sector strategy on which this project is founded. The project fits into our country
assistance strategy, which was discussed by the Board in December 1991 (an updated strategy
is scheduled to be presented in June 1993) by: (a) investing in high priority infrastructure; (b)
introducing sound maintenance practices to prevent the deterioration of the existing capital
stock of urban roads; and (c) promoting the private provision of public services (virtually all
urban transport services are Drivately owned and design, supervision, construction and at least
80% of the maintenance of the infrastructure components will be carried out by the private
sector. The project will also help to alleviate urban poverty and will have a beneficial effect
on the environment.
12.   Agreed Acnm  Government has already established the UTU, submitted
environmental assessment reports on the Accra and Sekondi/Takoradi road rehabilitation
components, and transmitted a Letter of Sector Policy Development to the Association.
During negotiations. Government agreed to: (a) provide counterpart funds quarterly with
allocations based on disbursement estimates agreed with the Bank annually, deposited into two
separate project accounts opened by DUR and MOTC; (b) increased funding of urban road
maintenance (see para 9); (c) implementation of a cost recovery plan agreed with the
Association for lorry parks as a precondition to signing rehabilitation contracts; (d) complete
studies and implement recommended action plans agreed with the Association by specified
dates on: (i) the organization and management of DUR including preparation of a training
program; (ii) regulatory options for improving the quality and quantity of public transport;



4
and (iii) improve accident reporting and analysis; (e) increase the professional staffing of
UTU by one per year over the project period to a total of six by 1997; (t) the design, which
will include an assessment of the Implications of contracting out all maintenance works
(including routine maintenance), and implementation of a road maintenance management
system by July 1995; (g) recruit an urban transport advisor to UTU and a municipal engineer
to DUR by January 1, 1994 and a road safety advisor to UTU by April 1, 1994; (h) design
and commence implementation by January 1995 of a road safety program aimed particularly
at pedestrians and cyclists; (i) provide detaited training programs for 1994 by March 31, 1994
and programs for subsequent years by December 1 of the preceding year; (j) continue to
contract out to the private sector at least 80% by value of all maintenance works; (k)
monitoring of implementation performance and project impact against agreed indicators; ()
carry out a mid-term review by April 1996 to evaluate and assess implementation progress,
performance of the Implementing agencies, the adequacy of counterpart and maintenance
funding, technical assistance and training inputs, and the need for restructuing and/or
redesign of major project components, DUR and MOTC to submit reports on these matters
two months before the review; (m) adopt Bank guidelines for selection of consultants and
Sample Bidding Documents, Letter of Invitation and Sample Consultant Contract, suitably
modified for engaging contractors and consultants; (n) DUR and MOTC to furnish quarterly
reports covering the status of counterpart and maintenance fimding, procurement, financial
commitments, disbursements and implementation progress; and (o) the submission of annual
audit reports on the special accounts, project accounts and statements of expense of the
project.
13.   Agreement was also reached on the following conditions of ceit effeiveness: (a)
payment of initial deposits of US$662,000 and US$13,000 equivalent into project accounts
established by DUR and MOTC, respectively, as Government's counterpart contribution to
the project for calendar year 1993; (b) recruitment of a Contract Management Specialist for
DUR; and (c) employment of utility contractors for the relocation of public utility services in
the roads to be rehabilitated in Accra and prequalification of contractors to bid for the road
rehabilitation works in Accra and Sel'ondilTakoradi. It was also agreed that diburment for
the rehabilitation of lorry parks and bus terminals would be conditional on the submission of
enviromnental assessment reports, for these components, that are satisfactory to the
Association.
14.   Environment Since most of the work will be rehabilitation of existng facilities, no
adverse environmental impact is foreseen. The project would have significant environmental
benefits by reducing traffic accidents and congestion, decreasing flooding, and improving
travel conditions for pedestrians and non-motorized transport. Organized inrduction of
bicycle transport in the cities will help reduce future pollution from increased motorization.
The contract documents will require contractors to suppress noise and dust during construction
and compliance will be monitored by consultants and EPC. Environmental assessment reports
of the Accra and Sekondi/Takoradi road rehabilitation component have been reviewed by the
Association and raise no major issues. Similar assessment reports for the remaining works
components will be carried out and sent to the Association for review when designs have been
completed. Adoption of necessary mitigation measures that are acceptable to the Association,
is a condition of disbursement for these components. The project is rated B.

15.   Proaram Objective Categories The project would help to reduce poverty generally,
by improving urban transport services for people and goods, and specifically, by providing
access roads to low-incomt areas and pilot bicycle paths as an alternative low cost means of
travel.
16.       et Benefits The project would reduce the cost of travel and increase the quality
of transport services by improving road surfaces and reducing congestion in Accra and
SekondilTakoradi and by improving transport terminals and selected junctions in all five
cities. Overall, it will increase the efficiency and productivity of the urban economy. The
composite ERR for the road rehabilitation and traffic management components in Accra and
SekondilTakoradi, which account for 56% by value of the project, is 29%. Sensitivity
analyses revealed that the project would remain economically viable (ERR greater than 12%)
if costs were to increase by up to 85%, or benefits decrease by as much as 50%. For the
other project components, while it has not been possible to quantify rates of return, significant
economic, social and environmental benefits will accrue. The mobility of the urban poor will
increase thereby improving access to job opportunities; roads will be safer for pedestrians and
the users of non-motorized transport; property values in the centers of Accra and
Sekondi/Takoradi will rise; vehicle pollution will decrease; and there will be greater
coordination within the urban transport sector.
17.   Risks The main risks relate to the timely allocation of counterpart and road
maintenance funding and delays in implementation. The risk on counterpart funding has been
minimized by sizing the project to suit the expected resources that will be available to
Government over the project period. In 1994 the funding requirement for this project
represents less than 3% of planned expenditure on all highways. On maintenance funding
Government agreed at negotiations to increases allocations from $7.2 million in 1994 to $11.9
million in 1998. Advance preparation of designs and tender documents for around 65% by
value of the works and strengthening of the Association's monitoring capacity at the Resident
Mission has minimized the risk of implementation delays.
18. Recommendaion I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

GHANA -IMIPLEMENTA1]ON ISSUES
While Ghana's overall disbursement performance condnues to compare favorably with other countries
in the Region, disbursements on investment lending have been declining since FY89. An increased focus on
implementation, complemented with actions to address generic as well as project issues, resulted in a reversal
of the trend in FY91. Key actions taken to improve performance included a Country implementation Review
in May 1991, which led to a breakthrough in the simplification of procurement procedures and the approval
process, and follow-on sector implementation reviews. The Resident Mission's supervision capacity was
strengthened, and its portfolio monitoring activities increased. Intensive supervision and mid-term reviews
were used to redesign slow-moving projects in accordance with Bank policy. Anticipated political changes,
along with uncertainty over possible shifts in personnel, led to a slow-down in actions to address
implementations problems, as reflected in lower disbursements in FY92. Nonetheless, contnuing eforts to
improve performance, including another CIR planned for early June 1993, are expected to bring activities
back on track after the settling-in period of the new government. The CIR will include discussions with
management of counterpart funds and practical aspects of strengthening implementing agencies. The status
of projects which are particularly slow-disbursing is discussed below.
Cocoa Rehabilitatin (FY88). To address the administrative problems that had led to slow
implementation, project administration has been tightened, clear working relationships between implementing
agencies have been established, and mechanisms have been put in place to monitor progress. However,
difficulties with procurement procedures and cost increases in the roads component have caused continued
delays in implementation. Following a mid-term review in March 1992, various components of the project
have been redesigned and action taken to re-allocate credit funds.
'minir Sector Rehabilitation (FY88). Te SGMC rehabilitation component has been lagging
substantially, owing to slow decision malkng on joint venturing and rehabilitation of the mines. A
cofinanciers' meeting was held in October 1992. The downsizing of SGMC represents significant progress
which will allow the preparation of plans to close the remaining mines. In November 1992, an agreement
was reached on the divestiture of SGMC's two major mines.
Foresty Resources Management (FY89).  Implementation problems included weak project
management, shortage of professional staff, and government uncertainty about the likely effectiveness of the
technical assistance program. Actions have been taken to enhance staff training, seek approval for an increase
in incentive packages, and restructure the technical assistance program. Project management has now
improved, implementation procedures have been simplified and action taken to reallocate proceeds.
Rur Finance (FY89). Disbursements have improved during the last twelve months. Recent changes
in the cost of funds to participating banks and the removal of subloan ceilings are expected to increase
disbursements.
Water Sector Rehabilitation (FY90). There has been significant progress in resolving financial issues
(tariff rates were increased in February 1992), and steps have been taken to address insttional problems.
The key issue of shortage of qualified senior management staff, however, remains unresolved; it will be taken
up with the new Government after the setding-in period. After long delays, physical implementation of the
project is now on track and disbursements are expected to pick up at the end of the engineering design stage
in May 1993 when the rehabilitation process begins.
