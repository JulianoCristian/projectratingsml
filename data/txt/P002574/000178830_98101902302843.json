in this region and expand support services\n            at ARC's new Khartoum headquarters.

The research programs would be directed from the\n            regional headquarters of ARC at Nyala. The project would\n            finance the building and equipping of four research\n            stations, with laboratories, offices and staff housing;\n            seven mobile research units, vehicles, and aircraft and\n            other equipment; purchase of a new ARC headquarters\n            building; operating costs for the research programs for six\n            years, including staff salary costs for both Sudanese and\n            non-Sudanese staff; and various consultancies, fellowships,\n            training and contract research work."}, "docdt": "1978-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
