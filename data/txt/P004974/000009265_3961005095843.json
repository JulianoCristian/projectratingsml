Sewerage\n            Rehabilitation project seeks to restructure the urban water\n            supply sector by contracting out a number of its operations,\n            such as leak detection and repair, otpimization of meter\n            reading and billing, and network recalibration and mapping,\n            with private entrepreneurs. It advocates the creation of\n            self-financing water utilities that would operate under\n            concession agreements with the Government. To promote water\n            conservation, the report recommends charging the true\n            economic cost of the services to consumers. Until now, a\n            national tariff structure has been applied for water\n            services, with no provision for capital consumption and\n            expansion. The project proposes changing this policy by\n            levying regional tariffs that would cover both operating and\n            maintenance costs, and the concession fees. The Government\n            will use these fees to finance asset renewal and expansion.\n            As large volumes of water produced are now unaccounted for,\n            the project includes a network rehabilitation program aiming\n            at reducing water losses. Most wastewater treatment plants\n            in Algeria are currently inoperative. As a result, water\n            pollution is spreading around the large urban\n            agglomerations, damaging the natural environment. To\n            mitigate these damages, the project proposes the\n            rehabilitation of a number of existing wastewater treatment plants."}, "docdt": "1994-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
