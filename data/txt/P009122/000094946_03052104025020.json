Lack of experience in\n            implementation of donor financed projects was the major\n            reason behind delays during the first two years of the\n            project. Some project activities got stuck into numerous\n            disagreements between international and domestic norms,\n            regulations on accounting, remuneration of consultants,\n            taxation, civil construction permits, approvals and\n            certification of works and imported goods. The lessons\n            learned indicated that project design should have minimized\n            the number of project executing agencies to maintain the\n            integrity of financial control and direct responsibility of\n            the project implementing agency over execution of the agreed\n            program. Although, the planned sector reforms were not\n            implemented, the CSIP achieved its operational goals."}, "docdt": "2003-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
