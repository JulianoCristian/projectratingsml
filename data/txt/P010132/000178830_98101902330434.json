Extension Project\n            is designed to support the reorganization and strengthening\n            of the agricultural extension services in all of the 12\n            rural districts of Sind. It provides in five districts for\n            an increase in the number of extension staff and suitable\n            housing and vehicles for them. In the remaining seven\n            districts, existing staff will be provided with suitable\n            vehicles. The project will also establish four adaptive\n            research farms, two soil testing laboratories and pest\n            scouting services on a pilot scale in one district. The main\n            project benefit will be an increase in production,\n            particularly foodgrains, as a consequence of the impact of\n            the new extension and research system on agricultural\n            yields. Marginal and small farmers, now living close to or\n            below the poverty line, will be the primary beneficiaries of\n            the new system and of the project's emphasis on\n            efficient use of exisiting resources."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
