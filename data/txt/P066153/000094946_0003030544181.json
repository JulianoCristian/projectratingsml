supports Latvia's reform program.\n            It is envisaged that over the three-year period of the\n            reform program, there could be up to three single or two\n            tranche PSALs to support its implementation. The reform\n            program will help Latvia return to a macroeconomic framework\n            conducive to growth and improve its public sector\n            performance by 1) correcting macro-economic imbalances, 2)\n            strengthening the credibility of the public sector, 3)\n            improving institutional capacity to deliver public services,\n            and 4) encouraging private sector development through\n            finalizing the privatization process and defining a clear\n            and transparent regulatory framework. Latvia expects to\n            achieve these objectives by implementing specific reforms\n            supported by the World Bank in the areas of pensions, public\n            sector management, human resource management, public\n            expenditure management, privatization and regulation of\n            public utilities and private business. The PSAL will also\n            put in place measures to assist the government's\n            anti-corruption effort and to streamline business\n            regulation. The reforms will enhance Latvia's prospects\n            for timely European Union accession; and provide a positive\n            signal to international institutions and investors regarding\n            the government's commitment to reform and the\n            transition to a full-fledged market economy."}, "docdt": "2000-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
