It is important to note that, public\n            governance issues under structural adjustment operations\n            will be both, difficult to implement and to evaluate,\n            because change is only expected to occur in small steps, and\n            over a number of years; benefits are rarely noticeable in\n            the short-run; and, formal achievement of benchmarks is\n            meaningless, unless embodied in deep-rooted, and lasting\n            institutional changes. However, some lessons learned seem\n            reasonable: 1) the choice of a programmatic structural\n            adjustment instrument proved beneficial, in that it allowed\n            a medium-term framework to be developed, with several\n            activity phases, programmed over a period of time. This\n            presents the advantage that, given the Government's\n            commitments, potential resentments over tranche release\n            exchanges, are less likely to occur. Furthermore, the close\n            collaboration between Latvia, and Bank officials immediately\n            following the Russia crisis, contributed to the\n            precipitated, and exceptional financial assistance."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
