The ODS Projects have\n            several objectives: (a) to support the Government's\n            actions to reduce ODS consumption; (b) to establish a\n            project implementation mechanism through local institutions;\n            (c) to implement cost-effective, priority subprojects; and\n            (d) to support the adoption and commercialization of 50\n            percent reduced ODS foam applications. The objective of the\n            projects to phase out ODS consumption of the 14 subprojects\n            has been largely achieved. Compliance with project covenants\n            by the enterprises was largely achieved. The following\n            valuable lessons were drawn: (a) Policy enforcement is\n            beyond subproject implementation scope. National\n            Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) plays a very\n            important role in ensuring that complementary policy\n            enforcement is in place; (b) More accurate ODS estimates are\n            needed during project preparation and appraisal; (c) Project\n            Implementation Schedule shows that although the projects\n            were ultimately implemented correctly many inconveniences\n            and extra work could have been avoided; (d) Suppliers must\n            be carefully selected; (e) Clear and concise data at project\n            preparation will help in project implementation and supervision."}, "docdt": "1998-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
