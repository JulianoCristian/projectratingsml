MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
DIRECTOR OF THE CHINA AND MONGOLIA DEPARTMIENT
TO THE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT
EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC REGION
1.                I submit for your approval the following memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed Ozone Projects Trust Fund Grant to the People's Republic
of China for $4.865 million to help finance a project to meet China's medium term target
of maintaining 1996 ozone depleting substances (ODS) consumption at the 1991 level as
required by its obligations under the Montreal Protocol. The total Grant funding for the
Project is $5.465 million, including $0.6 million 1/ for the ODS II Project Preparation
Advance (PPF02927) approved in August 1992.
Background
2.          China is the developing world's largest consumer and producer of ozone
depleting substances (ODS). In 1991, China's ODS consumption was about 50,000 tons
and production was about 30,000 tons. ODS consumption has been growing at an average
rate of about 11 percent per year which, if unconstrained, would push consumption to
84,000 tons by 1996. The Government has agreed to reduce ODS consumption by 1996
to 50,000 tons, the 1991 level, and cap consumption at that level thereafter. China has
initiated work to meet this commitment, but its efforts are hampered by lack of funds and
access to technology.
3.          The Govemment ratified the Montreal Protocol (MP) in June 1991 and is
eligible for financing from the MP Multilateral Fund, which was created to provide support
to eligible developing countries to meet their MP obligations. The Multilateral Fund is
managed by an Executive Committee (MPEC) and implemented by the Bank, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP), and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). Bank
projects are channelled through its Ozone Projects Trust Fund (OTF) Agreement with
MPEC, with the Bank acting as Trustee. The Chinese agency responsible for the ODS
phaseout program is the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), the head of
the Leading Group for Ozone Layer Protection.  NEPA has established a Project
Management Office (PMO), which will be assisted by eight Leading Group member
ministries and the China Investment Bank (CIB), to manage the ODS phaseout program.
4.          With the help of the MP, China has launched a 15-year program to introduce
new technology and phase out all ODS production and consumption by 2005-10. China's
Country Program for the phaseout of ODS under the MP inclbdes policy, strategy, costs
/    'The total approved amount of the Project Preparation Advance is $1.5 million, of which $0.9 million
is estimated for project preparation of the ODS I Project approved in October 1993 and $0.6 million
is for project preparation of this proposed project (ODS II).



-2-
and an action plan to achieve ODS phaseout; external funding and technology support are
required, however. It was prepared with UNDP support using MPEC-approved funds and
Bank assistance and was approved by MPEC in March 1993.
5.          China's ODS Country Program (summary in Annex 1) will cap rapid
increases in ODS consumption while introducing ODS replacement technologies through
a centrally administered regulatory policy approach. Policy initiatives, including regulation
of supply (import and local production), controls or bans in certain subsectors, price
changes, taxes and other incentives and penalties, are being developed and implemented.
China has already banned new ODS-based production facilities in the fire protection and
aerosol sectors (1990 and 1991, respectively) and complete bans on ODS use in these
sectors are planned to coincide with the adoption of substitute technologies by local
industries.
6.          Compared with 1991 consumption, ODS phaseout targets are as follows:
1996-100 percent or less; 2000-50 percent or less; 2005-25 percent or less; and by
2010 complete elimination. Five industrial sectors account for most of China's ODS
usage: foams (37 percent), refrigeration and air conditioning (27 percent), aerosols (18
percent), solvent cleaning (10 percent) and fire protection (8 percent).  Rapid ODS
phaseouts are planned for sectors where substitute technologies are widely available. Use
in other sectors, including refrigeration and air conditioning, will be phased out more
slowly.  Production would be phased out on a schedule consistent with domestic
consumption needs, to be completed by 2010.
7.         In response to the need for a fast start on China's ODS phaseout program,
the Bank approved the first ODS Phaseout Project in October 1993. This second Project
was approved by MPEC in June 1993. Preparation of a third, larger project has already
started. UNDP is providing technical assistance through institutional strengthening of the
Project Management Office (PMO), demonstration ODS phaseout projects in solvent
cleaning, foams and revision of fire codes and standards to support halon phaseout.
UNIDO is assisting in the financing of projects in tobacco processing. UNEP is in the
early stages of its involvement in funding ODS reduction subprojects. In addition, the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is providing assistance to
develop a national halon recycling program and will have 150 units in operation by the end
of 1994. Canada is providing bilateral support for development of a project in the
commercial refrigeration subsector in Sichuan Province.
8.          This program is part of a larger Bank effort to help the Chinese reverse the
environmental degradation stemming from rapid industrialization based upon obsolete
technologies and a pricing system applied under central economic planning. Substantial
progress has been made in creating a regulatory framework and in promoting
environmental protection while pursuing sustainable development. The Bank has been
actively involved in assisting China in developing its overall environmental policies and
actions, and an environmental strategy paper has been prepared and discussed with the
Government.  A number of Bank-assisted environmental operations, such as the
Environmental Technical Assistance Project, the Southern Jiangsu Environmental



-3-
Protection Project and the Beijing Environmental Protection Project, are currently under
implementation. Several additional environmental projects are now being prepared.
Project Objectives
9.          The Project is designed to (a) support the adoption and commercialization
of 50 percent reduced ODS foam applications through the implementation of cost-effective
priority projects; and (b) further develop the project implementation mechanism through
local institutions.
Project Description, Costs and Financing
10.         The Project will finance the incremental costs of ten priority subprojects to
support adoption and commercialization of 50 percent reduced ODS foam technology,
which are consistent with China's ODS Country Program. OTF financing is provided for
technology transfers, equipment purchase, training, trial runs and recurring incremental
chemical costs for the ten project beneficiaries. The Project will continue to provide
assistance in strengthening the PMO's project management capabilities and will also
provide technical assistance to build up CIB's capability in project appraisal and
supervision of ODS subprojects.  Subprojects are based on commercially proven
technology, including appropriate transfer arrangements. The 10 subprojects consist of
support to one institute to supply foam technology, three enterprises to supply raw
materials (one of which will also convert its foam manufacturing operations) and six foam
producing enterprises to convert their manufacturing processes to reduced ODS
formulations. Annex 2 provides a detailed description of subprojects.
11.         Total project costs, including capital costs and four years discounted
recurring incremental costs, are estimated at $6.432 million, of which capital costs are
estimated at $4.270 million, including $1.825 million in foreign exchanke. Incremental
costs for China are defined as total capital costs for each subproject plus net present value
of incremental recurrent costs in constant domestic prices for four years, discounted at 12
percent per annum, taking into account savings and benefits.
12.         Project financing includes an OTF Grant of $5.465 million, including $0.6
million from the Project Preparation Advance already approved, to cover (1) $5.346
million as eligible incremental costs for the ten subprojects (details in Schedule A); (2)
$61,000 as technical assistance to NEPA and CIB; and (3) $58,000 as the financial agent
fee to CIB. Grants equal to the subprojects' recurrent incremental costs will be channeled
from the OTF to participating enterprises through CIB. The balance of capital costs
required would be from enterprises' own resources ($0.967 million). Appropriate
financing plans confirmed in subproject appraisal reports must be found acceptable by the
Trustee prior to subgrant approvals. Providing recurrent incremental costs as grants to
enterprises will give sufficient incentive for enterprises to proceed with the reduced-ODS
foam application. Project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that funds for incremental
costs will be channeled to the participating enterprises as grants through CIB and that



- 4 -
financing plans for the balance of project costs will be confinned by CIB during its
appraisal of the subprojects.
Subproject Selection and Eligibility Criteria
13.         The Project finances ten subprojects. Technical appraisals (including
determination of incremental costs, technology selection and compliance to ODS reduction
objectives, based on MPEC criteria) have been completed. Eligible incremental costs for
individual subprojects for grant financing were endorsed by NEPA and approved by MPEC
in June 1993.  CIB will appraise the financial viability of the subprojects and the
participating enterprises according to the Trustee criteria. The subprojects are consistent
with the ODS Country Program and confirmed by NEPA as essential to the Country
Program objectives. Subprojects included in the Country Program should meet the
following criteria: (a) have a direct and demonstrable result in reducing ODS consumption
in the country; (b) be cost effective and take into account the country's national industrial
policy; and (c) be based on environmentally sound technologies, or on substitutes for the
substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol.
14.         Criteria for financial appraisal include determinations that (a) the OTF grant
does not exceed the subproject's eligible incremental costs; (b) the beneficiaries' revenues
would be sufficient to cover any operating costs not provided for by the Grant, and the
greater of depreciation or debt service requirements; and (c) the beneficiary is financially
viable, as measured by a projected debt service coverage of not less than 1.2 times upon
completion of the subproject and attainment of full production capacity. The criteria for
technical appraisal include an assessment of the impact of the proposed subprojects on ODS
reduction and compliance with national and local environmental regulations. Appraisal
reports for subprojects less than $500,000 in grant support would be prepared in a
simplified subproject format as agreed with the Trustee.
Project Implementation
15.         NEPA is the local coordinating agency for the Project. It has established
a Project Management Office (PMO) in October 1992 to manage the ODS phaseout
projects and to coordinate ODS phaseout activities with all other relevant agencies and
enterprises. The PMO is currently staffed with eight people, five of them full time, for
the ODS operations. To manage the ODS phaseout projects and China's overall ODS
phaseout program efficiently, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that NEPA will maintain the PMO, with adequate staffing, and with functions
and responsibilities satisfactory to the Trustee.  Relevant ministries will coordinate
technical assistance components of the subprojects. Participating enterprises, assisted by
design institutes, will be responsible for subproject implementation. CIB, the financial
agent for the OTF Grant, is completing the appraisal of each subproject, with technical
support from the Economic Information Center (EIC), a unit in the Ministry of Chemical
Industry, to confirm the World Bank's technical appraisal. CIB will receive from the
Grant funds a fee equal to $58,000 for subproject appraisals, supervision and Grant
administration services.  CIB would receive three fourths of the fee (0.75 percent)



-5-
following approval of all subproject appraisal reports by the Trustee; of this, CIB will pay
$13,400 to the EIC for its work in technical appraisal analysis. CIB would receive the
remaining one fourth (0.25 percent) upon final disbursement of grants to all subprojects.
The MPEC has previously approved $450,000 in institutional strengthening funds through
UNDP for NEPA to establish a clearing house and to build up the overall capabilities of
the PMO to manage and coordinate the country's ODS phaseout program and the overall
coordination of the ODS phaseout projects. Under this Project, NEPA will receive about
$11,000 additional in technical assistance to strengthen operation of the PMO, including
training of staff in project management and equipment as required and agreed with the
Trustee. In addition, CIB will receive $50,000 in technical assistance for training of its
branch staff in appraising and supervising ODS subprojects. Subproject appraisal reports
(including environmental impact assessment summaries) will be approved by the Trustee
prior to disbursing grants for each subproject. Institutional arrangements, including the
respective roles of NEPA, CIB, the ministries and enterprises, have been agreed.
16.         The Grant Agreement between the Government and the Trustee, the Fund
Management Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and NEPA, the Financial Agency
Agreement between NEPA and CIB, and the subgrant agreements between CIB and the
participating enterprises will describe the responsibilities of each party.
17.         The subgrant agreement for each subproject will, inter alia, require each
participating enterprise to complete the subproject satisfactorily and to maintain satisfactory
financial viability using indicators as agreed with the Trustee. Signing of the Fund
Management and Financial Agency Agreements, satisfactory to the Trustee, are conditions
of effectiveness. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that
subgrant agreements with each participating enterprise will follow a model subgrant
agreement acceptable to the Trustee. The model subgrant agreement will be the same used
under the ODS I Project.
18.         The Trustee will supervise the Project, including approval of each subproject
and monitoring NEPA, PMO and CIB's activities, as required under its Trustee
obligations. The PMO/CIB will prepare semi-annual reports for submission to the Trustee.
Subproject completions reports, approved by NEPA, will be furnished to the Trustee
promptly upon completion of subprojects. Operation reports for subprojects receiving
funds for recurring operations expenditures, also approved by NEPA, will be furnished to
the Trustee one and two years after subproject completions. Audit reports on the Grant
will be prepared according to standard OTF requirements. Procurement of goods will be
on the basis of local competitive bidding for contracts over $250,000. Prudent shopping
will apply for procurement packages of less than $250,000. Prior reviews of procurement
contracts are not required and it is expected that all procurement packages will be below
$250,000. However the choice of local or international shopping will be subject to the
Trustee's approval as part of subproject approval.  The MPEC approved up to
$2.043 million for incremental recurrent costs to cover additional costs of chemicals
associated with application of the reduced ODS foam technology. Funds were approved
based on projections of future production levels for the seven foam producers over the first
four years of subproject operation.  To facilitate grant administration, funds for



-6-
incremental recurring costs would be disbursed in tranches over the first two years of
subproject operation based on actual production of reduced ODS units. The operating and
implementation mechanisms for funds transfers are detailed in Annex 3. Project funds are
expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1997. Procurement procedures and the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. The timetable for processing the Project
is given in Schedule C.
Project Sustainability
19.         The proposed Second ODS Phaseout Project will be implemented within the
institutional and policy framework described in China's ODS Country Program, and is
considered sustainable. China is committed to the phaseout of ODS as required in its
obligations under the MP. By adopting the comprehensive phaseout strategy laid out in
its ODS Country Program-including establishment of a formal ODS phase out institutional
implementation framework and gradual bans on all ODS use-China has demonstrated its
commitment to those obligations. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the
Government that NEPA will monitor implementation of the ODS Country Program and
inforn the Trustee from time to time about such implementation. This second Project
provides the necessary funding and technology for implementation of high priority
operations identified in the ODS Country Program action plan. At the enterprise level, all
participating firms must maintain financial viability as indicated by a debt service coverage
of not less than 1.2 times when the project is completed.
Environmental Aspects
20.         The main objective of the Project is ozone layer protection.  The
technologies to be adopted for reducing ODS content in foam production are
environmentally benign. In accordance with the Trustee's guidelines, satisfactory safety
and environmental precautions have been incorporated into subproject design. Each
subproject will be subject to an environmental impact assessment according to local
regulations, summaries of which will be transmitted to the Trustee for approval as part of
the subproject appraisal report.
Project Benefits
21.         The foam sector is the largest ODS user in China, accounting for 37 percent
of total consumption. There are about one hundred small and medium sized foam
manufacturers. The Project represents an important demonstration for the entire sector to
show that 50 percent reduced ODS foam application is technically and commercially
viable, and will be replicated in many of the remaining foam enterprises. The Project will
also assist in transferring the technology development to local firms. Specifically, the
Project will directly contribute to phasing out 400 tons of ODS annually. The Project will
assist the Government in meeting its medium term target of maintaining 1996 ODS
consumption at 1991 levels.



-7-
Project Risks
22.         Risks are reasonable. Subprojects are based on technology commercially
proven outside China, and substantial technical support is being provided under the Project.
Providing incremental costs as grants will ensure that enterprises will have a financial
incentive to initiate action. Satisfactory subproject financing plans will be confirmed prior
to subproject approvals. NEPA's PMO will be strengthened by both UNDP's Institutional
Strengthening Project and the technical assistance component under this Project. The Bank
has also provided continuous assistance in improving CIB's subproject appraisal capability.
Lessons from Previous Bank Experience
23.         Projects utilizing OTF resources are under simultaneous development in
most Regions, including projects in Indonesia, Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines,
Turkey and Venezuela. No OTF project has so far been completed, but work to date
indicates the needs for flexibility in project design, for well prepared and documented
components at the preappraisal stage, and for training and institutional strengthening
support. The experience gained thus far under the First ODS Project in China indicates
that training is imperative to familiarize CIB branch level staff with the concepts of ODS
reduction objectives, the Montreal Protocol, and the ODS Project processing procedures
and to train them for efficient supervision.
Rationale for Funding from the Montreal Protocol Interim Multilateral Fund
24.          The Project is consistent with the Implementation Guidelines and Criteria
for OTF funding established by the MPEC.
Agreed Actions
25.          At negotiations, assurances from the Government were obtained that:
(a)   funds for incremental costs will be channeled to participating enterprises as
grants through CIB, and financing plans for the balance of project costs will
be confirmed by CIB during its subproject appraisals (para. 12);
(b)   NEPA will maintain the PMO, with adequate staffing and with functions,
and responsibilities satisfactory to the Trustee (para. 15);
(c)   subgrant agreements with each participating enterprise will follow a model
subgrant agreement acceptable to the Trustee (para. 17); and
(d)   NEPA will monitor implementation of the ODS Country Program and
inform the Trustee from time to time about such implementation (para. 19).
26.         The following will be conditions of effectiveness of the Grant:



- 8 -
(a)   signing of a Fund Management Agreement satisfactory to the Trustee
between the Ministry of Finance and NEPA that describes the
responsibilities of NEPA and its PMO under the Grant Agreement (para.
17); and
(b)   signing of a Financial Agency Agreement satisfactory to the Trustee
between NEPA and CIB that describes the responsibilities of CIB under the
Grant Agreement (para. 17).
Recommendation
27.         I am satisfied that the proposed Grant would comply with the relevant
provisions of the Ozone Projects Trust Fund in Resolution 91-5 of the Executive Directors,
and I recommend that the Regional Vice President approve it.

CHINA
SECOND ODS PHASEOUT PROJECT
SUMMARY OF CHINA COUNTRY PROGRAM
FOR THE PHASEOUT OF OZONE DEPLETING
SUBSTANCES UNDER THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL
Strategy
1.          The Government of China will strictly adhere to the provisions of the
Montreal Protocol and undertake necessary measures for the phaseout of ozone depleting
substances (ODS) production and consumption in China by the year 2010, provided that
sufficient funds are made available and needed technologies are transferred in accordance
with the provisions of the Protocol. China will speed up its ODS phaseout once cost-
effective substitute technologies and sufficient financial assistance for implementing the
technical changeover are obtained.
ODS Situation in China
2.           China's ODS consumption in 1991 was 48,239 metric tons (MT), of which
63 percent was produced domestically and 37 percent was imported. Seven types of ODS
controlled by the Montreal Protocol are commonly produced and used in China: CFC-11,
12 and 113; halon-1211 and 1301; carbon tetrachloride (CTC); and methyl chloroform
(TCE). The four substances accounting for most of the total ODS in 1991 were CFC-12
(48 percent), CFC-11 (34 percent), Halon-1211 (8 percent), and CFC-113 (8 percent).
3.          In terms of ODS, the foams sector is the largest user in China, accounting
for 37 percent of total consumption, followed by the refrigeration and air conditioning
sector with 27 percent, aerosols with 18 percent, solvents with 10 percent, and fire
extinguishing (halons) with 8 percent. Although halon usage is relatively small, halons
have significant impact due to their greater weighted ozone depletion potential, and
therefore merit special attention.
Forecast of Unconstrained ODS Demand to the Year 2010
4.           China's economy is growing rapidly, and ODS consumption is expected to
increase at about 11 percent annually. ODS consumption, if not controlled, is expected
to reach 84,000 MT by 1996, 116,900 MT by 2000, 173,700 MT by 2005, and 255,600
MT by 2010. Projected ODS consumption in 2010 can be broken down as follows:



- 13 -                           ANNEX 1
- CFC-11:            35,500 MT           - Halon-1211:         19,200 MT
- CFC-12:           138,500 MT           - Halon-1301:        900 MT
- CFC-113:          45,600 MT           |- CTC:               3,100 MT
- TCE:              12,900 MT           I
5.           Projected increases in ODS demand will span all sectors. Demand for rigid
polyurethane (PU) foams used in domestic refrigeration is expected to increase at an annual
rate of 8 percent until 1995 and at a rate of 3 percent after 1995. Demand for other foams
should increase at a rate of 6 percent per year. Industrial refrigeration and air conditioning
are expected to increase steadily at 8 percent per year, while commercial refrigeration is
projected to grow at 18 percent per year up to the year 2000 and 15 percent per year
thereafter. Mobile air conditioning (MAC) demands are expected to grow at an annual rate
of 20 percent before 2000 and 10-12 percent after 2000.
6.           Demand for Halon-121 1 fire extinguisher is expected to grow by 11 percent
before 1997 and by 7 percent after 1997, and for extinguishing systems by 14 percent until
1997 and by 12 percent per year thereafter. Demand for Halon 1301 systems is expected
to grow by 20 percent before 1997 and by 15 percent after 1997.
7.           Demand for aerosols is expected to increase at 30 percent per year until
1995, at 9 percent during 1996-2000, and at 6 percent during 2001-10. Solvents used in
electronics cleaning are expected to experience a demand growth rate of 11-16 percent
through the year 2010.
Institutional Framework
8.           The Government of China has established a formal national institutional
framework for ozone layer protection and for implementation of the Montreal Protocol.
Within this framework, the Leading Group for Ozone Layer Protection is responsible
for the implementation of Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol provisions, the review
of various implementation options, and strategic decision-making. The Leading Group
comprises the National Environmental Protection Agency (Leader), the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, State Planning Commission, State Science and Technology Commission, and
Ministry of Finance (vice-leaders), and eight current members (seven ministries 1/ and
the General Administration of Customs).
1/    Members of the Leading Group on Ozone Layer Protection include the Ministry of Commerce
(MOC), National Council of Light Industry (NCLI), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), Ministry
of Aerospace Industry (MAI), Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI), Ministry of Machinery and
Building Industry (MMBI), and Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
The Ministry of Agriculture is also proposed as a member.



- 14-                           ANNEX 1
9.          Three other entities report to the Leading Group: the Coordinating Group
for Ozone Layer Protection, eight technical Sectoral Working Groups, and the Center
for Environmental Sciences at Beijing University. The Coordinating Group has been
entrusted with the following tasks:
(a)   concrete implementation of the Convention and the Protocol;
(b)   coordination of the production, import, export and consumption of
controlled substances and their products;
(c)   financial analysis of the domestic and external funding needed for
implementation of the Protocol;
(d)   proposing various options to the Leading Group; and
(e)   handling other affairs related to the Convention and the Protocol.
10.         The Sectoral Working Groups formulate sectoral components of the Country
Program as well as specific projects. The Working Groups represent aerosols, chemical
substitutes, foams, halons, ODS recycling and recovery, refrigeration/AC/MACs,
refrigerator manufacture, and solvents. The Center for Environmental Sciences at Beijing
University is responsible for updating the Country Program.
11.         Other institutions involved include the State Administration of Commodity
Prices, which manages the prices of controlled substances and substitute technologies, and
local environmental protection agencies, which are responsible for the implementation of
environmental regulations at the local level.
Policy Framework
12.         China's policy framework to phase out ODS and encourage the use of
substitute technologies consists of the following ten specific policies:
(a)   Production Management. A permit and quota system will be used to
manage ODS production. Government permission will be required for ODS
manufacture, based on environmental impact assessments. Enterprises must
follow the ODS phaseout schedule in the Country Program.
(b)   Imports. Imports of ODS and their products will be restricted in order to
promote local production of ODS substitutes.
(c)   Prices.  Prices of ODS and ODS substitutes will be adjusted when
appropriate to ensure a smooth transition.
(d)   Sales. Government will be the exclusive supplier for sales of ODS.



-15 -                                       ANNEX 1
(e)     Taxation.  Tax  rates on  ODS  and  their products will be controlled  or
increased. Tax reductions/exemptions will apply to ODS substitutes and
ODS recovery.
(f)     Investment.   The  government will encourage  investment policies that
promote ozone protection.
(g)     Incentives.  The government encourages the development of technologies
for ozone protection applicable to China, and will establish a fund for
outstanding contributors to ODS phaseout.
(h)     Public Awareness.  Public media resources will be used to raise public
awareness of ozone issues. Technical training courses will increase skills
of technicians and managers involved with ODS.
(i)     Green Labels.  "Green labels" will be issued to products made with non-
ODS and ODS substitutes.
(j)     Legal Policy.  Regulations for managing ODS and ODS substitutes will be
enhanced and finalized.
Government and Industry Responses to the Protocol
13.              China has already issued bans on new ODS-based production facilities in the
fire protection and aerosol sectors (1990 and 1991, respectively). Other government and
industry responses to the Protocol to date include the establishment of a state-level
institutional framework and Ministry-level administrative institutions; the elaboration of
industrial management systems for compliance; research into substitution technologies; the
mobilization of funding  for loans; the establishment of an assessment center for CFC
substitution; various activities for the exchange of technical and policy information; and
the publishing of various papers to raise public understanding.

ODS Phaseout Costs
15.         The current least-cost option for phasing out ODS in China by 2010 is
estimated to have a direct net incremental cost of about $1.4 billion (not yet endorsed by
the MPEC).  Other incremental costs have not yet been calculated.  The net
administrative/management costs for implementation of the Government's Action Plan to
implement the proposed strategy is $500,000 per year.

CHINA
SECOND ODS PHASEOUT PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF THE TEN SUBPROJECTS UNDER THE
PROPOSED PROJECT
1.          The ODS II Project is a 50 percent reduced ODS foam project with 10
subprojects. The project comprises one technology supplier; two polyol/polyol blend
suppliers; and seven foam producers, one of which also manufactures polyol/polyol blend.
The Liming Chemical Research Institute (LCRI)-
($457,000-the estimated project incremental cost)
2.          The LCRI is a technology supplier.  The use of reduced ODS foam
formulations in China is impeded by a lack of domestic raw material suppliers.
Specifically, reduced ODS compatible polyols are only available from pilot-scale
manufacturers. LCRI has successfully developed polyols compatible with low ODS foam
formulations, including laboratory scale production and blending processes which have
produced finished polyurethane (PU) foams that meet national standards. This project will
further demonstrate the new technology on the pilot level and facilitate the expansion of
polyol production and blending processes to industrial capacity. The training component
included in this project consists of on-site direction from foreign chemical suppliers, and
technical exchange with domestic experts.
3.          LCRI is a comprehensive PU foams research institute under the Ministry of
Chemical Industry (MCI). The Department of Polyurethane Development was established
to enhance China's domestic production of PU foam feedstocks and has consistently
produced products comparable to those from developed countries. This project consists
of the following eight stages:
(a)   LCRI will refine synthesis techniques for polyols and blended polyols
compatible with reduced ODS foams. Synthesis techniques compatible with
industrial manufacturing processes will be developed.
(b)   LCRI will establish 200 MT capacity pilot plants for the manufacture of
polyether polyols compatible with reduced ODS foam formulation and the
blending of these polyols. Trial production will begin.
(c)   LCRI will optimize polyol formulation and adjust the polyol blending
process so that foaming characteristics, finished foam properties,
repeatability of production and blending processes, and blended polyol shelf



- 18 -                         ANNEX 2
life will achieve 50 percent reduced ODS formulations currently
manufactured in developed countries. Finished rigid PU foam products will
also be tested for quality.
(d)   LCRI will cooperate with Shenyang Petrochemical Factory (SPF) to perform
trial runs on SPF's production equipment.
(e)   Foreign and local experts will be brought to LCRI to further optimize
industrial scale production methods and assist in training SPF's staff for the
trial runs.
(f)   LCRI will begin work on manufacture of polyols and blended polyols
compatible with reduced ODS foam for use in cold storage, ice cupboards,
and panel insulation.
(g)   LCRI will conduct life test research on foam products manufactured with the
reduced ODS compatible polyol and blended polyol. Formulations will be
adjusted to achieve product quality in developed countries.
(h)   LCRI will expand development of ODS-free foam technologies, focussing
on industrial scale manufacturing techniques for non-ODS blowing agents.
The Shenyang Petrochemical Factory (SPF)
($152,000-the estimated project incremental cost)
4.          SPF is a polyol/blended polyol producer. For this project, it will retool
existing operations to establish a 2,000 MT facility for production of polyol and blended
polyol feedstocks compatible with 50 percent reduced ODS foam. The blended polyol will
be sold to household refrigerator and insulation panel producers.
5.          SPF produces over 200 chemical products and is one of the primary
commercial polyol producers in China. SPF's production line has an annual polyol
production capacity of 15,000 MT, including a 10,000 MT facility imported from
Germany. The factory also oversees the Shenyang Polyurethane Research Institute which
has successfully developed industrially feasible production techniques for a variety of
commercially significant feedstock polyols. Liming Chemical Research Institute will
provide low ODS technology to SPF, and the conversion, including worker training, trial
runs, and scale up to full production, will take place over 1994-96. The new technology
requires the use of alternative raw materials, and new storage facilities will be needed to
streamline blended polyol operations.
The Wuxi KZ Foam Factory (WKZ)
($264,000-the estimated project incremental cost)
6.          WKZ is a polyol/blended polyol producer. This project will convert a
5,000-MT facility for the production of blended polyol feedstocks compatible with



-19-                           ANNEX 2
50 percent reduced ODS foam. WKZ produces rigid polyurethane foam materials for
household refrigeration, panel insulation, and in-situ spraying and is one of the primary
commercial blended polyol producers in China. WKZ's production line has an annual
production capacity of 5,000 MT with current production of 700 MT. The blended polyol
will be sold to domestic household refrigerator producers. In 1992, WKZ entered into a
cooperative agreement with the 510 Research Institute (510) to transfer 510's patented
reduced ODS foam technology to WKZ and scale up production from pilot to full scale.
WKZ and 510 agreed on a licensing fee to cover the costs of technology transfer and WKZ
produced 150 MT of low ODS compatible blended polyol in 1992 and an estimated 250
MT in 1993. The new blend has been tested with satisfactory results by over 10
refrigerator manufacturers including batch production of 800 units by the Shuangyan
General Refrigeration Factory. In addition, the WKZ's formulation has been tested by two
panel manufacturers; and the Shanghai Refrigeration Equipment Factory now uses its
reduced ODS formulation in all production.
7.          For this project, WKZ will scale up low ODS compatible technology for
industrial scale synthesis of polyether polyols and the blending of these polyols. WKZ will
build a new preblend reactor facility and renovate their existing line for production of the
new blended polyols. The preblend reactor is required as the new process includes
addition of viscosity reducing additives. Equipment retrofitting will improve control over
50 percent compatible feedstocks. After the conversion, which will take place over 1994-
97, production capacity of the facility will be equal to the 5,000 MT existing capacity.
The training included in this project consists of on-site direction from domestic experts,
as well as training throughout China.
The Chengde Conunercial Machinery Company (CCMC)
($163,000-the estimated project incremental cost)
8.          CCMC is an insulation foam producer. This project will phase out about
30 MT of CFC- 11 annually by converting in-situ spray and a 160,000 m2 capacity rigid
PU insulation panel operations to the use of 50 percent reduced ODS foaming techniques.
CCMC is an enterprise under the Ministry of Commerce and its 1992 foam production
totaled 180,000 m2 (consuming about 45 tons CFC-11) up from 100,000 m2 in 1991.
CCMC exports products to countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. CCMC's rigid PU
insulating panel production line was imported from Finland and West Germany. Standard
techniques are used for production of sandwich panels and spray foam operations. Cold
storage facilities are the most common end-use.  Customers select spray or panel
application depending on individual requirements. Project conversion costs include new
foaming equipment, testing instruments, trial runs, and training. However, OTF financing
requests are limited to trial production, testing and training costs. CCMC will use
domestic raw materials to demonstrate their performance. This project includes on-site
training from foreign chemical suppliers and experts. CCMC's production line and in-situ
foaming operations will be converted over the period 1994-97, resulting in annual ODS
