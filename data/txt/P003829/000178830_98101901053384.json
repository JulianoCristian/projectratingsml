"The Second Swamp Reclamation Project,\n            the second Bank-assisted swamp reclamation project, focuses\n            on strengthening institutions implementing the Government of\n            Indonesia's (GOI's) program of swamp development.\n            The project also aims to help finance a six-year time slice\n            of an eight-year program of reclaiming and developing about\n            30,000 ha of swamp lands in South Sumatra and settling about\n            11,500 families in the newly developed area. Project works\n            will comprise the entire primary and secondary drainage\n            infrastructure, about 60% of tertiaries, about 40% of\n            on-farm works in the 30,000 ha development, and all houses\n            and settlement. GOI will complete the remaining reclamation\n            works by end-1991. In addition, master plans will be\n            prepared for future swamp reclamation schemes and\n            feasibility studies and detailed designs will be prepared\n            for upgrading some older schemes developed to minimum\n            standards by GOI, a selected number of which will be\n            upgraded. Technical assistance will be provided to agencies\n            engaged in project preparation and implementation.\n            Agricultural research for swamp development will be expanded\n            in South Sumatra and South Kalimantan and extension services\n            will be improved, especially in pest control."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
