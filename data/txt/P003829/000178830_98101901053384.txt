SECOND SWAMP RECLAMATION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:       Republic of Indonesia
Amount:          $65.0 million (including capitalized front end fee)
Terms:          Repayable in 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variable rate.
Project
Description: The proposed project, the second Bank-assisted swamp
reclamation project, focusses on strengthening institutions
implementing the Government of Indonesia's (GOI's) program
of swamp development. The project will also help finance a
six-year time slice of an eight-year program of reclaiming
and developing about 30,000 ha of swamplands in South Sumatra
and settling about 11,500 families in the newly developed
area. Project works will comprise the entire primary and
secondary drainage infrastructure, about 60% of tertiaries,
about 40% of on-farm works in the 30,000 ha development, and
all houses and settlement. GOI will complete the remaining
reclamation works by end-1991. In addition, master plans
will be prepared for future swamp reclamation schemes and
feasibility studies and detailed designs will be prepared for
upgrading some older schemes developed to minimum standards
by GOI, a selected number of which will be upgraded. Tech-
nical assistance will be provided to agencies engaged in
project preparation and implementation. Agricultural
research for swamp development will be expanded in South
Sumatra and South Kalimantan and extension services will be
improved, especially in pest control. The development of
30,000 ha will benefit directly 11,500 mostly-landless
families from Java and Bali to be settled there /1 and
increase paddy production by about 58,000 tons a year at full
development. The main risks in swamp reclamation schemes are
slow start up, slow implementation and delayed agricultural
development. Project formulation reflects the experience
gained in the first Bank-assisted swamp reclamation project
(FSRP, Loan 1958-IND) in improving the quality of works and
increasing implementation efficiency, and the experience
gained in ongoing GOI schemes on land and agricultural
development. The rate of farm development assumed in project
analysis is conservative, derived from achievements in the
ongoing program.
/1 Up to 15% could be local families wishing to settle in the project
area.

SECOND SWAMP RECLAMATION PROJECT (SSRP)
I. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested Bank Group
assistance to implement a second swamp reclamation project (SSRP)/I which
will strengthen implementing agencies, reclaim and develop about 30,000 ha
of swamps in South Sumatra (Sumatera Selatan) and settle about 11,500 mostly
transmigrant families. Master plans, feasibility studies and detailed
designs will be prepared for (a) future swamp reclamation schemes, and (b)
upgrading some older schemes which were developed to minimum standards by
GOI. Agricultural research for swamp development will be continued and
expanded in Sumatra and Kalimantan; and agricultural extension services will
be improved, especially in pest control.  The project has been prepared on
the basis of reconnaissance and master plan studies (1977/1978), feasibility
studies (1981), surveys and detailed design (1983) completed by the Project
Unit for Tidal Swamp Reclamation (P3S) of the Directorate General of Water
Resources Development (DGWRD) Ministry of Public Works, and their consult-
ants NEDECO-EUROCONSULT, Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) and the
Institute of Technology at Bandung (ITB) with Bank assistance (Irrigation
Projects VII and XII; Loans 1268-IND and 1645-IND).
The Agricultural and Rural Sector
1.02      GOI's major objectives for the agricultural sector are to (a) create
productive employment to raise incomes of the rural poor; (b) increase
domestic food supply to keep pace with rising demands; (c) expand agricultural
exports, particularly of smallholder tree crops; and (d) ensure productive,
sustainable use of Indonesia's varied land, water, and other natural
resources.
1.03      Agriculture provides more than half of Indonesia's employment and
about 30% of its GDP, and remains of paramount importance to nearly 80% of the
population living in rural areas where agriculture is, and will remain, the
major source of employment and income. In the 1980s, increases in
agricultural production are expected from intensified land use, yield
increases, and development of new land, mostly in the Other Islands. Rice has
traditionally been the nation's basic staple and will remain so for the
foreseeable future. Self-sufficiency in rice, almost reached in 1981, is
susceptible to adverse climatic conditions, and continued production increases
are required to offset increasing demand. Irrigation, accompanied by the use
/1 The First Swamp Reclamation Project (FSRP) is supported through Loan
1958-IND which became effective in July 1981.



of high yielding rice varieties, and swamp reclamation have been key factors
in increasing rice production. The GOI investment program in irrigation and
swamp reclamation and the strategy and role of the Bank have been explained
in recent appraisal reports (see for example Irrigation XVI, Loan 2118-IND)
and in a sector review completed in October 1982./2
Transmigration
1.04      Nearly 97 million of Indonesia's 150 million people (1983) live on
Java (Jawa), on 7% of the land area (45% of its cropped area) at an average
density of over 2,100 people/sq km of cropped land. With practically all
arable land iin Java, Bali and Lombok already under cultivation, there is
tremendous population pressure on land resources. Destruction of hillside
forests, and the resulting soil erosion, exacerbates already serious floods
and associated damage in coastal areas, and causes heavy silting of
irrigation systems. Meanwhile, potentially arable areas, though of low
fertility, lie unutilized or underutilized, in Other Islands. Organized
efforts to move people to Other Islands began some 75 years ago and today,
as a result cf officially sponsored transmigration, spontaneous migration,
and internal growth, an estimated two and a half million transmigrants are
living in Other Island settlements.
1.05      Government attaches high priority to transmigration to promote
regional development, create employment, reduce population pressures and
increase production of food and export crops. Before the mid-1970s both the
size and quality of the transmigration program were limited by a shortage of
funds. In 1978, however, with improved resources, and faced by shortfalls
in rice production and increasing landlessness, Government accelerated the
transmigration program. To achieve this, GOI transferred implementation
responsibility from the Directorate General of Transmigration (DGT) to
various ministries /3 and established the Office of Junior Minister for
Transmigration (JMT) as coordinator. In 1983 GOI changed this policy and
centralized nearly all responsibilities in a reorganized Ministry of
Transmigration (para. 4.02). The Repelita III (1979-83) program began
slowly but accelerated considerably in subsequent years. By the end of 1983
about 250,000 families (1,250,000 people) /4 have been moved voluntarily
in little over four years to Other Islands and there are long waiting lists
for transmigration in various parts of Java and Bali. This will make the
Indonesian transmigration program one of the largest resettlement schemes in
the world.

Swamp Reclamation and Development
1.06      Introduction.  Indonesia's estimated 35 million ha of inland and
coastal swamps are nearly equally divided amongst Sumatra, Kalimantan and
Irian Jaya. About 6 million ha of coastal swamps (1 million ha in Sumatra,
1 million ha in Kalimantan and about 4 million ha in Irian Jaya) have
agricultural potential, especially for rice production, although conservation
of primary forests, soil constraints and land rights may reduce the area which
can be developed. Coastal swamps occupy broad, flat, and poorly drained zones
that are partially inundated during rainy seasons by high tides or floods in
adjacent rivers. Recent marine or fluvio-marine clays are dominant soil types
overlain by peat layers of various depth and at various stages of
decomposition. At, or near, mangrove belts, intercalated iron sulfide layers
are common which can, upon drying and oxidizing, become toxic to crops.
Nevertheless these soils can be agriculturally productive as long as they are
kept in a wet state or well leached. Rice is a suitable crop for such
conditions./5
1.07      First to develop coastal swamps for rice and coconut cultivation
were Banjarese and Buginese./6 There was little Government sponsored
reclamation prior to World War II, and six substantial reclamation pilot
projects were started by GOI only in the late 1960s, comprising nearly 30,000
ha for settlement of about 8,000 families. By 1978 nearly half a million ha
of swamps had been reclaimed: half of it by GOI (Table 1.1), the remainder by
Banjarese and Buginese. The rate of settlement in the early 1970s, however,
did not keep up with the rate of reclamation. Consequently by 1978 there were
large reclaimed but unsettled areas, particularly in Riau and Jambi (Table
1.1). This situation has changed as a result of accelerated settlement in
Repelita III (1979-1983) and by 1983 most reclaimed areas had been settled.
During Repelita IV (1984-1988) GOI aims at reclaiming half a million hectares
and settling over 140,000 families (or about 20% of all transmigrants) in
reclaimed swamps.

growing rice and coconuts.

1.08      GOI Implementation Policy.  GOI has adopted a multi-stage imple-
mentation strategy for swamp development. The initial stage comprises a basic
drainage infrastructure for subsistence (rice-based) agriculture; in
following stages the infrastructure is to be upgraded, inputs and, where
feasible, irrigation, are to be provided to increase production./7 The
first stage infrastructure includes navigation canals (equivalent to trunk
roads in dry land developments) and open surface drainage systems. A limited
number of bridges are built across canals, and drains are left open to
surrounding rivers without structures to control the movement of water
(para. 1.15). After canals are constructed and the land is sufficiently
drained to allow access, it is subdivided into individual holdings of about
2.25 ha per family of which 0.25 ha is designated as a houselot and the
remainder is usually divided into two separate farm plots, one close to

upgrading older systems.



the houselot, and one within 5 km./8 One or more years later, houselots and
one farm plot (1 ha) are cleared, houses are constructed and settlement
starts. Mostly because of its relatively better soil, South Sumatra has been
a major focal point in GOI's Swamp reclamation program and over half of all
reclaimed swamps are located in this province. Reclamation works started in
the late 1960s, and even though agricultural development is slow (para. 1.16)
and essentially confined to a single, wet season rice crop, it has succeeded
in most cases in creating at least a subsistence base for settled trans-
migrants./9 In 1983 prices it cost GOI an estimated $6,000 to reclaim a net
area of 2.25 ha of swamp land and settle one family./10
1.09      Challenges.  In the past, development plans were prepared by four
local universities (IPB, ITB, Universities of Gajah Mada and North Sumatra)
which have accumulated expertise in swamp reclamation design; the expanded
Repelita IV program exceeds their capacity and project preparation will also
be assigned to consultants not as experienced as the universities and hence
requiring closer supervision. P3S which is entrusted with this responsibility
requires technical assistance for this task.
1.10      In the past, poor cooperation between line agencies engaged in
swamp reclamation and development resulted in delayed implementation and
idle investments, although recently inter-agency cooperation has improved and
major settlement delays have been reduced. A reorganization of the Ministry
of Transmigration (MOT) in March 1983 (which absorbed transmigration planning,
part of DITADA,/11 and land preparation, PLP (previously PLPT), but leaving
the responsibility for preparation and construction of infrastructure with
Public Works) should improve implementation. Further improvement will require
closer coordination between executing agencies (P3S, formerly P4S, PLP and the
Directorates General of Settlement Preparation (DGSP) and Mobilization and
Guidance (DGMP) in MOT) and supporting agencies (para. 4.03).
1.11      Construction quality in GOI projects has sometimes been proved sub-
standard; navigation canals and drains are not always constructed to specifi-
cations, and lands are not properly cleared, partly because of poor scheduling
but mostly due to inadequate supervision. Infrastructure is not adequately
maintained and P3S, which has no funds for this, has been unable to transfer

abandoned after potential acid sulfate top soils were allowed to dry, but
not leached, which resulted in their acidity, toxicity and loss of
productivity.

settlement (including Engineering, Admin. and Physical Contingencies)

responsibility to provincial Public Works who, by law, are responsible but
lack capacity. Land and agricultural development has been generally slow and
settlers find it particularly difficult to control pests. Lack of adequate
potable water has been a serious problem during dry seasons in many reclaimed
swamp settlements. The FSRP started to address these problems, and the SSRP
has been designed to provide further assistance.
1.12      Bank Objectives and Strategy.  The Bank concurs with GOI on its
multi-stage development strategy though the process can be improved and
made more cost effective through better site selection, construction stan-
dards, agricultural research and development and pest control. Additionally,
a reliable drinking water supply has to be ensured and the environment has to
be protected. The Bank can assist GOI in addressing these issues through a
policy dialogue made possible through involvement in physical developments
formulated to demonstrate innovative procedures, and through institutional
assistance to GOI's program. Bank assistance for swamp reclamation began in
1975 when, upon GOI request, representatives of the Bank, GOI, FAO, and the
Government of Netherlands reviewed hydrological and pedological aspects of
developing tidal lands and defined criteria for the selection of suitable
areas for development./12 In 1976, the Bank provided assistance for surveys
and studies of specific projects in South Sumatra and Jambi,/13 and in 1979,
for detailed design (Karang Agung) and feasibility studies to develop about
350,000 ha in South Sumatra and Kalimantan./14
1.13      The First Swamp Reclamation Project (FSRP).  In 1981 the Bank
approved a small, 9,000 ha reclamation and settlement project (at Karang
Agung, South Sumatra), studies, and institutional support./15 The project,
designed to demonstrate improved implementation through better supervision,
and improvements in crop production through better water management,/16
started only in January 1982, about six months behind the appraisal schedule
and about a year after bid opening./17 During the first year of construction,

the contractor completed only about 60% of targeted civil works,/18 mostly
because of inadequate equipment but as a result of strict supervision the
quality of work was good.  By March 1983 about 220 ha of houselots had been
cleared,/19 about 500 houses built, and by end-1983, 500 families had been
settled.  The arrival of additional equipment in the summer of 1983
accelerated progress of civil works which should be completed by the end of
1984, about six months behind schedule. Following GOI procedures, land
clearing and housing construction has been executed for 1983 settlers, and
other contracts are to be signed for land clearing and housing for settlers
scheduled for 1984. All studies under the project (with the exception of an
impact study scheduled to commence in 1982/1983) have started and progress is
satisfactory. By the end of September 1983 a total of about $5.6 million, or
75% of scheduled amounts had been disbursed for consultants ($4.0 million) and
civil works ($1.5 million). The main lessons already learned from this
project are: (a) a need to improve prequalification of civil works con-
tractors; (b) a need to streamline administrative procurement procedures,
particularly of evaluating bids and awarding contracts; /20 (c) project
management procedures such as those implemented in the FSRP result in quality
improvement; and (d) land clearing can be improved by improved specifications
and supervision./21
Project Formulation and Design
1.14      Staged implementation policy emphasizing pest control, drinking
water supply and agricultural research and development is reflected in project
formulation and design. Similarly, experience from the ongoing FSRP, (whose
impact upon agricultural development will be quantifiable only in the 1990s,
several years after completion) as itemized in para. 1.13, is incorporated in
implementation plans. The SSRP will be of a much larger scale than the FSRP.
Located closer to the sea, and covered by considerably denser and heavier
forests, it will complement and expand the experience from the first project.
The dialogue on improving the reclamation program under the FSRP, will be
continued and broadened by institutional and technical assistance. The thrust
of the SSRP is expected to improve the quality of program preparation (site
selection and design); implementation standards; and to provide adequate
/18 Navigation, primary and secondary canals.
/19 Final clearing was carried out by settlers who were compensated
for their work.
/20 This subject is currently under discussion between the Bank and GOI.
/21 E.g., contractors should be required to cut trunks into shorter than
5 m segments as done presently in order to facilitate settlers windrowing
of trunks and finishing clearing of fields.

drinking water and agricultural support. This would be achieved through (a)
demonstration and training in improved implementation and supervision
procedures; (b) technical assistance in planning and preparation; and (c)
strengthened agricultural research and development.
1.15      For replicability, physical works have been designed in accordance
with GOI criteria./22 Project plans provide for low-cost drainage infra-
structure, and for optional, second stage, irrigation facilities which are not
included in present cost estimates. In the past there were some differences
of opinion between the Bank and GOI on the timing for constructing water
control structures./23 These have been resolved by providing paddy-field
bunds and plans for structures but deferring their construction until
agricultural development has advanced to dry season cropping (requiring water
control structures) or, otherwise, if monitored soil reaction (a drop in pH
values) indicates acidity formation. In parts of the project where frequent
salinity intrusion is probable, secondary control structures will be built
initially to prevent sea water intrusion (para. 2.06).
1.16      In most GOI projects it has taken settlers up to seven years to
fully develop the entire farm area. To remove a constraint posed by two
separate plots and facilitate faster land development, the FSRP and the SSRP
call for a single, 1.75 ha farm plot per family instead of two, smaller,
separate farm plots presently provided in GOI projects (para. 1.08). As in
other GOI projects, only half of each farm plot will be cleared. (Equiva-
lently, the entire plot may be partially cleared.) While more extensive
clearing at the Project's expense could have accelerated land development,
GOI's procedures have been followed to avoid developing costlier
/22 With minor exceptions concerning water control structures and farm plot
layout.
/23 The need for these structures, including tertiary gates that are primarily
designed to maintain high water tables in fields to prevent toxicity in
potential acid sulfate subsoils was never questioned by GOI, though the
timing of construction was. Bank staff favored early construction to slow
down the rate of subsidence of peat top soils which cover potential acid
sulfate subsoils, prevent acidification of exposed subsoils, and
facilitate better water management and better cropping during wet and dry
seasons. GOI, which for budgetary reasons postponed construction to
future upgrading phases cited the experience in Indonesia's reclaimed
swamps where even after 10-15 years following reclamation, no irreversible
acidification has occurred (probably because most developments avoided
areas where potential acid sulfate soils were at the surface) and
seasonal increases in soil acidity, in few locations, usually disappear
after the first rain.

and nonreplicable Bank assisted projects. However, procedures, supervision,
and scheduling will be improved to enhance quality and increase cost
effectiveness (para. 3.06). Furthermore farmers will be assisted through
Community organizers to cooperate in clearing their entire farm land and
develop it (para. 3.19).
1.17      In addition to site specific activities, the SSRP will provide wider
support for the GOI swamp reclamation program. Site managers of other govern-
ment projects will be trained in construction supervision and management at
the 30,000 ha development and at neighboring reclamation projects; contact
between field, regional and headquarters offices of executing agencies will be
systematized; and assistance will be provided to headquarters staff selecting
and preparing projects. The SSRP will assist DGFCA to extend plant protection
activities, and will provide technical assistance to MOT aimed at increasing
the pace of land development in swamp reclamation areas.
1.18      The SSRP will upgrade selected infrastructural works in a number of
GOI's earlier swamp reclamation schemes, following completion of detailed
design and approval by the Bank./24 Drinking water supply, particularly acute
during dry seasons when river water is too saline for drinking, has been
addressed in the FSRP by providing seven barrels (or equivalent) per family to
collect and store rainwater, and ground water investigations are in progress
for supplementary water supplies. The SSRP will expand ground water investi-
gations to a larger area and investigate alternative sources for potable water
supply (e.g. treated and stored surface water).
1.19      The environmental impact of the SSRP is minor but the situation may
be different when large, nearly contiguous areas are reclaimed. Consequently
monitoring and evaluation of environmental changes is included in the SSRP
which will expand a similar study initiated at the site of the FSRP, examine
changes in chemical characteristics, fauna and flora, in rivers adjacent to
large, reclaimed areas in South Sumatra and South Kalimantan and examine
physical and chemical changes in soils.
1.20      Other studies begun under the FSRP will be continued and expanded
including (a) a nationwide inventory of potentially reclaimable coastal and
near-coastal swamps (which identified Irian Jaya as the major reserve of such
swamps) will be followed by reconnaissance and master plan studies; and (b)
feasibility studies for upgrading additional systems, will be followed by
detailed designs.
/24 This will entail rehabilitation of canals, bridges, jetties and con-
struction of water management control structures, where required, for
which a sum of $5 million has been allocated. Studies to determine these
needs are currently in progress under the FSRP.



- 10 -
1.21      The SSRP will support a three-year time slice of an agricultural
research and development program, executed by AARD, specifically aimed at
increasing production in reclaimed swamps (para. 4.07). The research
component is limited in scope and supported by consultants, and will not
interfere with AARD's ongoing research commitments. Due to the lead time
required to produce tangible results, activities will start under this project
and continue under the national research program (para. 4.08).
1.22      The SSRP will provide institutional support to the provincial public
works services (PPW) in South Sumatra to operate and maintain the
infrastructure in the FSRP, the SSRP and neighboring GOI projects to be
selected. Thi;s will include technical assistance, training of PPW staff and a
limited quantity of equipment (para. 4.10).
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01     The project area is in the district of Musibanyuasin, South Sumatra,
about 45 km from the coast and 80 km northwest of the provincial capital,
Palembang./25 It forms part of a flat, low-lying plain intersected in an
east-west direction by the tidally influenced Lalang river. Most of the
project area lies along and to the north of the Lalang river; beyond its
western boundary is a peat dome, unsuitable for agriculture; the northern
boundary is the year-round saline Sembilang river, and the eastern boundary is
the Karang Agung Hilir project, a GOI swamp reclamation project (para. 2.18).
Climate
2.02      The climate of the area is typically tropical, hot and humid year
round, with an average annual rainfall of about 2,600 mm. The wet season
generally lasts from October to mid-May with average monthly rainfall ranging
between 200 and 300 mm, for 15 days per month. The dry season extends from
the second half of May through September with average monthly rainfall of
about 140 mm spread out over 7 to 10 days. July is normally the driest month.
Weather patterns appear to be cyclic with droughts occurring every four to
/25 Palembang is the largest city in South Sumatra with a population
exceeding one million. It is the center of Indonesia's oil refining and
fertilizer industries and an important timber processing and shipping
port. See Maps IBRD 17328 and 17329.

five years. Rainfall data shown in Annex 1 are from stations located within
the catchment of the Lalang River, about 50 to 90 km distance but are
thought to be representative. Temperatures, relative humidities and
potential evapotranspiration (recorded at Palembang) are fairly constant
throughout the year.
Topography and Soils
2.03      The project area is flat, above mean water levels (in surrounding
rivers) with elevations ranging between +3.00 m and +4.00 m./26 In the
absence of internal waterways and pronounced gradients, drainage is poor and
portions of the area are inundated during the rainy season as a result of
local rainfall and high tides. Some low areas are inundated also during the
dry season.
2.04      A semi-detailed soil survey and soil classification (IPB, 1980)
shows that over 70% of project area is covered by organic soils of 15 cm or
less underlain by poorly drained, nearly ripe, clays,/27 classified as
Tropaquents, with sulfidic material at depths in excess of 70 cm. These
soils are classified as suitable for rice, conditionally for secondary crops
and for tree crops. About 25% of the project area is composed of peat top
soils varying in depth between 40-70 cm with sulfidic material underneath.
These soils are also suitable for rice and other crops but production is
more sensitive to adequate water management than that of the previous class.
Soils have been classified unsuitable for rice and other crops where peat
layers exceed 90 cm (for nutrient deficiencies, low water holding capacity
and poor anchorage for tree crops), or where saline soils or potential acid -
sulfate surface soils have been encountered (see Map 17329). In general,
peat thickness and soil reaction would be regularly monitored throughout the
life of the project and timely measures (e.g. construction of water control
structures) taken to prevent drying and toxicity formation in potential acid
sulfate subsoils (para. 4.14).
Hydrology and Hydrometry
2.05      Water supply, drainage and water quality in the project area are
primarily affected by the Lalang river, and to a lesser degree by the Calik
river. The saline Sembilang river has pronounced influence on water quality.
The Lalang river, with a catchment of 8,000 sq km, is nearly 500 m wide and
6 m deep at its confluence with the Calik river, but decreases in width to
/26  Elevations are project reference elevations, 3.448 m below benchmark
PUTL118 (El. +3.448) located on the Calik river 37 km upstream of the
confluence of the Lalang.

ness. Unripe soils are high in water content, low in bulk density and
very soft.



- 12 -
in width to 180 m, 60 km upstream./28 Its depth increases over the same
distance from 6 m to 18 m, its cross section decreases from 2,600 sq m to
2,000 m, while the catchment area decreases only 7%.  These characteristics
indicate higher velocities in upstream reaches which enhance flushing of
intruded salinity during flood stages.
2.06      Salinity intrusion is particularly pronounced during dry season
spring tides when salinity of 1,000 ppm TDS (total dissolved solids)
intrudes 40 km upstream from the mouth of the Lalang and salinity of
5,000 ppm intrudes about 30 km. During a severe drought (such as occurred
in 1980), salinity of 5,000 ppm was recorded at a distance of 47 km and
1,000 ppm at 63 km./29 These data infer that protection in part of the
project area may be required against sea water intrusion from the Sembilang,
Lalang and Calik rivers (para 3.05).
2.07      Mathematical modeling, discharge measurements in the Lalang
upstream of tidal influences, and water balance studies indicate a mean
annual flow in the river of 300 cms (cubic meters per second), a mean dry
season flow of 125 cms; and a mean driest month flow of 100 cms./30 Mean
water levels range between +1.70 m and +2.10 m (PRL) /31 at the mouth of
the Lalang River and between +1.70 m and +2.40 m (PRL) at the upstream
border of the project area. At the same location, high water levels during
spring tides range between +3.10 and +3.80 m (PRL) and +3.10 and +3.70 m
(PRL) respectively. The highest observed water level at the river mouth was
+3.94 m (PRL) and at the upstream border +3.77 m (PRL). Design flood stages
for embankment design have been considered as 15 cm and 25 cm respectively
above these levels.
Forest Cover
2.08      There is no primary forest cover in the project area.  Nearly half
of the area is covered by bush and small diameter gelam trees (Melaleuca
leucadendron) and the other half by secondary swamp forest (Macaranga,
Lophopetalum, Dyera, etc.) with an average stand of 550 trees/ha and an

distance of 30 km upstream.
/29 Water containing total dissolved solids in excess of 1,000 ppm is not
suitable for drinking. An excess of 5,000 ppm renders water unsuitable
for rice.

average diameter of 50 cm./32 As the area is relatively close to main
rivers it has been intensively logged and remaining trees are of limited
economic value.
Current Land Use
2.09      The project area is uninhabited and there is no agricultural
activity. There is, however limited agricultural activity along the
bordering Lalang river consisting of a single wet season crop of rice and
coconuts grown on raised banks and on higher ground (para. 5.01).
Population
2.10      Existing Population.  There are two settlements bordering the pro-
ject area, Sungai Sembiring (with about 10 families) and Sungai Dua (with
about 33 families). Teluk Bayur, also on the Lalang river has about
31 families. Sungai Dua and Teluk Bayur are mainly Buginese settlements.
Panuguan the biggest village in this area on the Calik river (Map 17329),
has about 309 families and has become an important trading and service
center. In addition, several hundred spontaneous settlers have reclaimed a
relatively narrow strip of land along the Calik river, by digging short
canals perpendicular to it. More than half of these families settled in the
past decade. Boundaries for the SSRP were drawn up so as not to interfere
with existing settlements.
2.11      Characteristics of Transmigrant Families.  A recent survey of
Government-sponsored transmigrants in nearby Delta Upang shows a typical
family consists of five persons; a husband and wife aged 35 and 29 years
respectively, and three children aged about 10, 7 and 3 years. Within ten
years, a typical family has one more child. This implies a family labor
force of 1.7 adults in the year of settlement, increasing slowly to about 3
in the thirteenth year after settlement. The development of a typical
settler family labor force is shown in Annex 2, Table 8.
2.12      Migratory Labor.  Migratory laborers arrive annually to harvest
traditionally large holdings of Malays and Buginese (who are heavily engaged
in fishing and forestry). They supply up to one-third of the total labor
demand of larger farms.
/32 In contrast, the FSRP project area is mostly covered by small gelam
trees.

Land Tenure
2.13      Traditional community organizations (Margas) control resources in
Sumatra, and grant land ownership rights to members for nominal payments and
land use rights to non-Marga settlers. They control the planting of
coconuts and other perennial crops on land to which ownership rights have
not been assigned, and auction each year the exploitation rights of valuable
common resourcies, such as fishing grounds and nipah palm areas. Timber
concessions, which cover most of the primary forests in the region, are
granted by Government in coordination with the Margas. They are terminated
within one year following designation of an area for transmigration. The
Government's swamp reclamation program has not caused serious conflicts with
the local population,/33 because construction provides labor opportunities
while public services (health centers, markets, schools) also serve local
residents. Land tenure is not a development constraint since 1,500 sq km of
Karang Agung, including the project area, has been declared a transmigration
area /34 from which already settled land along the rivers has been excluded.
Access, Services and Existing Developments
2.14      Access.  The project area is accessible from Palembang by road to
the Tungkal river some 75 km south of the project area, and from there by
river, or, alternatively by the year round navigable Musi, Telang and Calik
rivers and connecting canals. The river and canal system has sufficient
draft during low tide for the heaviest locally used barges.
2.15      Supporting Services.  Commercial facilities in Panuguan are
adequate to serve the project area in the early years. In addition to a
small daily market and a larger market one day each week, Panuguan has a
cooperative rice mill. Two private rice mills and rice hullers are located
at nearby Sungai Dua and at Teluk Bayur. There are cooperative marketing
and agricultural input supply centers (BUUD/KUD) at Panuguan. Agricultural
extension services for nearly 6,700 settlers in nearby Pulau Rimau and
Karang Agung Hilir are provided by DGFCA's field extension workers (PPL)/35
who visit the area once a fortnight most of the year, and who stay in the
area during the rice planting season. There are primary schools in
Panuguan, Pulau Rimau and a number of schools under construction at Karang
Agung Hilir.  The nearest secondary school is in Upang.  Panuguan and Karang
Agung Hilir have small health clinics (sub Puskesmas) staffed by paramedics
while Pulau Rimau and Sungsang each have a clinic (Puskesmas).
/33 Conflicts have, however, occasionally broken out between spontaneous
settlers andl local communities.

Reclamation Schemes near the Project Area
2.16      Delta Upang.  The development of Delta Upang, 60 km downstream
from Palembang on an estuary of the Musi River, began in 1969. After
initial difficulties, over 8,000 ha have been reclaimed and over 2,000
transmigrant families settled, while several hundred spontaneous Javanese,
Buginese and local people settled near the project area. Upang now has a
market town, Makartijaya, and a full complement of social, agricultural and
commercial infrastructure.
2.17      Delta Telang.  The Telang schemes, comprising Telang I with a net
area of about 15,000 ha and Telang II with about 8,000 ha (net), are located
some 50 km east of the SSRP project area. Development of Telang I, situated
between the Musi and the Telang rivers, started in the mid-1970s with
settlement commencing in 1978. About 5,000 families are now settled in
Telang I. Land development is proceeding satisfactorily except in a small
area where deep peats were encountered after the area had been opened
up./36 Development of Telang II, further to the west on a peninsula between
the Telang and Banyuasin rivers, started in 1976 and nearly 3,800 families
have been settled.
2.18      Saleh, Sugihan, Pulau Rimau and Karang Agung Hilir.  The
development of Saleh and Sugihan, schemes to the east of the Upang river,
started in 1977/78. By March 1, 1983, about 19,000 ha had been reclaimed at
Saleh, 50,000 ha at Saleh-Sugihan and 31,000 ha at Sugihan. During the same
period some 5,000, 12,000 and 9,000 families, respectively, had been
settled. At Saleh many settlers developed land under the guidance of
resident MOT leaders and managers, and within two years cleared about 1.5 ha
per family for rice planting. The area has a daily market for farm produce,
and village shops are stocked with basic consumer goods. Pulau Rimau, on
the east bank of the Calik river between the FSRP and the Lalang river,
whose development started in 1980, comprises a net reclaimed area of nearly
23,000 ha. Contract land clearing work and house construction commenced in
1981 and by the end of 1982 about 370 resident families were engaged in
follow-up land clearing operations. Reclamation of Karang Agung Hilir, a
20,000 ha development on the eastern border of the project area, began in
1981 and a net area of about 5,000 ha has been reclaimed to date. The first
128 families arrived in March/April 1983.
/36 To avoid similar occurrences, P3S site selection and project preparation
capability will be upgraded under this project.

III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The major objective of the project is to support GOI's Swamp Recla-
mation and Settlement program which will expand considerably during the 1984-
1988 Five Year Plan (Repelita (IV). The project's main thrust is to improve
the quality and efficiency of the program without increasing its costs. The
project has two principal components: (a) Reclamation of about 30,000 ha of
coastal swamps near Karang Agung, South Sumatra and settlement of about
11,500 families; and (b) Institutional support to the Ministry of Public Works
(DOS, Provincial PW), Ministry of Transmigration (DGSP, DGMG and PLP), and
the Ministry of Agriculture (DGFCA, AARD) in implementation, research and
related activities.
General
3.02      Reclamation and Settlement activities comprise a six year time slice
of an eight year implementation schedule of draining, clearing and developing
a gross area of about 30,000 ha and settling about 11,500 families. Works
include construction of a drainage infrastructure, land clearing, construction
of houses, village facilities and settlement of transmigrants. The six year
time slice covers all main civil works and settlement, about 60% of all
tertiaries, about 67% of clearing of farm plots, and about 40% of paddy-field
bunds. Remaining works, estimated at $12.3 million (in current terms) will be
completed by GOI by 1991 (para. 3.29).
3.03      Institutional Support includes technical assistance to line agencies
in project preparation, implementation management, drinking water investiga-
tion, planning upgrading of older schemes, planning of new development,
assistance in O&M, land preparation, agricultural research, monitoring and
evaluation.
3.04      Components of the project and agencies executing them are summarized
in Table 3.1.
Detailed Features of Reclamation
3.05      Hydraulic Infrastructure./37  The hydraulic infrastructure, shown on
Map 17329, comprises 14 primary drains, spaced about 4 km and each about 8 km
long connecting to surrounding rivers; about 150 km of secondaries and
collector draiins; about 800 km of tertiaries and about 1,600 km of hamlet
drains. Up to 180 gated secondary controls will be built where required to
/37 Unless indicated otherwise, the works described are those included in the
Bank-financed six-year time slice.

prevent seawater intrusion./38 Larger drains will be excavated mechanically,
preferably by draglines (which are considered cost effective for larger and
deeper canals) while tertiaries will be excavated by small hydraulic
excavators, or manually. Shaping of embankments will take place after initial
subsidence, and all embankments will be at least 50 cm above high water
levels.
3.06      Land Clearing.  Although 7,500 ha of houselots and village areas
will be cleared by contractors before settlers arrive, farm plots will be
cleared possibly with settler participation as paid laborers./39 Based on
current land clearing at the FSRP, and trials to be carried out under the SSRP
(during strip clearing for drainage works) specifications may be modified and
project management will decide to either clear half of each farm plot, (or
about 7,600 ha) or alternatively, to partially clear entire farm plots. In
either case, land clearing costs will be the same as in other GOI projects
with similar vegetative cover. Paid participation of settlers, better
scheduling and stricter supervision are expected to improve the quality of
land clearing.
3.07      Subdivision and housing.  Following strip clearing for tertiaries,
the land will be subdivided into rectangular 1.75 ha farmplots and 0.5 ha
houselots./40 A typical transmigration standard wooden house of 34 sq. m will
be built on each houselot equipped with 7 barrels or equivalent, for the
collection of rainwater for drinking. To reduce the number of tertiaries (and
associated control structures) a rectangular grid employed in the FSRP has
been modified to a triple pronged fork system with short secondaries and
longer tertiaries. A typical tertiary block will comprise 24.5 ha (14 farm
plots of 1.75 ha each, with a maximum distance of 2 km from house to farm
plot), and a secondary block will comprise six tertiary blocks. A typical
hamlet of 28 houses, an equal number of house lots and farmplots, will have
two tertiary blocks (Map 17329).
3.08      Paddy-Field Bunds.  Clay bunds of about 50 cm height will be
constructed with settlers' participation along the perimeter of farm plots
(and at intermediate intervals where necessary) to reduce soil water depletion
(by horizontal movement) and facilitate water management.
/38 Locations will be identified after at least one year of weekly salinity
measurements, to be initiated at project inception and concluded not
later than beginning of 1987.
/39 This, an FSRP innovation, is becoming standard practice in the GOI
program.
/40 Divided into two, nearly adjacent, 0.25 ha sublots. The lot on which the
house is located will be drained and used for other than rice crops while
the second, or extended, houselot will be used for paddy.

Detailed Features of Settlement
3.09      Transmigration Procedures.  The project will follow established GOI
procedures for recruitment of transmigrants transport, subsistence supplies,
assistance and guidance during and after settling. Transmigrants will be
recruited amongst waitlisted people in Java and Bali with priority given to:
(a) ecologically threatened areas; (b) areas in which population density
exceeds 1,000 persons/sq km; (c) nonarable areas; (d) areas subject to
recurring disasters; (e) areas made uninhabitable by development projects
(e.g. reservoirs); and (f) the poorest Kecamatans /41 of each Kabupaten./42
Transmigration is voluntary and there are long waiting lists for transmig-
ration in Java and Bali. Amongst transmigrants to the SSRP at least 5% will
be Balinese whose special aptitude in hunting wild boars is expected to help
in controlling crop damage.
3.10      Rate of Settlement.  Settlers will start arriving in the project in
the spring of 1986 and by summer 1989 all 11,500 families are expected to be
settled in houses provided by the project. A peak settlement rate (of about
500 families/month) /43 is expected during the months of March-June as
settlers arriving during these months would have adequate time during the
first year to settle in, prepare and cultivate houselots and also part of
their farm plots. A projected schedule of land clearing, housing, and
settlement is given in Annex 2, Table 9.
3.11      Provision.  Prior to arrival, each family will be given mosquito
netting, sleeping mats and cooking utensils, and after arrival, will receive
agricultural implements, axes and saws, and the first of 18 monthly subsis-
tence rations, containing essential foods and kerosene./44 A monthly ration
per family will consist of 50 kg of rice, 5 kg of dried fish, 8 liters of
kerosene, 3 kg of sugar, 2 kg of salt and 1 kg of soap.
3.12      Orientation.  Settlers will be briefed by MOT staff and PPLs on the
environment of their settlement, appropriate technologies, particularly soil
and water management, community activities in land clearing, development,
pest control, O&M, marketing, use of local resources, health and education.
3.13      Community Development.  MOT staff will coordinate and promote
community development including. (a) registration and settlement of new
arrivals; (b) dissemination of economic and social information to settlers;
(c) group activities in land development, crop husbandry and O&M (para. 3.19);
/41  Kecamatan:  Subdistrict.
/42  Kabupaten:  District.
/43 Conservatively estimated with due regard to transportation and transit
constraints.
/44 The duration of the subsistence may be extended under adverse conditions
such as crop failure, etc.



- 20 -
(d) record keeping; and (e) preparation for the transfer of settled
communities to the provincial administration.
3.14      Land Rights.  MOT, in cooperation with the Directorate General of
Agraria (DGA), will provide each family with a "right of use" title (hak
pakai) to their houselot, extended houselot and farmplot within one year of
arrival; and provide land ownership titles (hak milik) for the entire holding,
provided it is farmed, within five years of arrival. In accordance with
existing regulations, transmigrants will be prohibited from transferring or
selling land until after ten years of occupancy.
3.15      Health.  Health services will provide anti-malaria protection to new
settlers and others living in the area; establish basic health infrastructure;
and ensure utilization of services. Health care facilities will be provided
at clinics and subcenters. Health services will focus on immunization,
nutrition, health education, family planning and environmental sanitation.
Construction of a clinic (PUSKESMAS) at each of the project's two secondary
centers will be in accordance with INPRES standards and include a building of
80 sq m; 70 sq m for doctors' quarters and two staff buildings of 50 sq m
each. Each clinic will be provided with three speedboats. In each village
center, the project would establish a subhealth center (sub PUSKESMAS)
comprising one room for examination (30 sq m) and one staff building
(50 sq m). Malaria control campaigns will be conducted including spraying of
houses, the detection of passive cases and treatment. Houses will be sprayed
before settlement and at six-month intervals by hired teams. Spraying may be
discontinued if malaria prevalence is less than 2%, provided:
(a) malaria surveillance and treatment through passive detection and
regular malariametric survey is maintained;
(b) effective maintenance ensures that the canals are generally free
from vegetation and silt at all times; and
(c)  land excavation does not create mosquito breeding sites.
Passive case detection and treatment will be carried out at clinics. Techni-
cal supervision of the campaign wiil rest with the malaria staff at the dis-
trict level, administered by the provincial health service.
3.16      Education.  The project includes construction of primary schools
(grades 1 to 6) in each village center, and a lower secondary school (SMP,
grades 7 to 9) in each secondary village.
3.17      Agricultural Development.  The agricultural development plan is
based on rainfed, wet-season, paddy cultivation which will progressively cover
all extended house lots and farm plots. Early maturing paddy varieties will
be introduced gradually in order to cultivate a second paddy crop or food
crop, such as maize or soybean, during the off-season in extended house lots
(para. 5.06). Houselots will be developed with a mixture of perennial crops,
especially coconuts, fruit trees, bananas and pineapples, vegetables or other
annual crops. During the first year of settlement, DGFCA will provide sett-
lers with a package of seeds, planting materials and agrochemicals. Provision



- 21 -
will be made for supplementary or replacement supplies during a second year in
the event of crop failure or breakage of tools under normal usage (para. 4.05).
3.18      Three Rural Extension Centers (RECs) will be established in the
project area as focal points for agricultural extension activities which will
be provided by DGFCA on the basis of one PPL per 500 families with
supervisory/technical guidance support of PPM staff from the time of settler
arrival onwards (para. 4.04). Additional specialized technical support will
be provided by regional subject matter specialists (PPS's) in swampland rice
agronomy, pest control, and water/soil management. Two Plant Protection
Brigades will be established, one in South Sumatra and another in South
Kalimantan (para. 4.06).
3.19      MOT and DGFCA resident staff, assisted by community organizers, will
assist settlers to organize hamlet based working groups within three months of
arrival. These groups, instructed by PPLs, will work jointly (gotong royong)
on land clearing; on-farm development (paddy-field bunds etc.); pest control;
and water management. Satisfactory joint action will qualify the group for
participation in an intensification program./45
Institutional Support
3.20      Technical Assistance.  The project will provide technical assistance
to the following executing agencies in the 30,000 ha scheme and in a number of
non-Bank financed schemes (Annex 6):
(a)  DOS construction supervision staff assigned to ongoing projects in
South Sumatra in implementation management: scheduling, selecting
cost-effective construction methods, supervision and coordination;
and PPW staff in establishing effective O&M of drainage infrastruc-
ture in South Sumatra's reclaimed swamps (para. 4.10).
(b)  PLP, HQ and field staff in implementation management and improving
land clearing methods, specifications, scheduling of various opera-
tions (with due regard to seasonal constraints), supervision and
optimal participation of settlers (which would ensure them of imme-
diate financial benefits but would not appreciably slow down land
development);
(c)  MOT's resident field staff in South Sumatra in organizing community
efforts in land clearing (of areas not cleared under the project),
and final land preparation;
/45 INSUS, one of the intensification programs, is an input package
consisting of fertilizers, seeds, pesticide and cash offered on favorable
credit terms to groups of farmers growing food crops in accordance with
DGFCA's recommendations. In 1982 this program covered about 5,000 ha of
reclaimed swamps in South Sumatra.



- 22 -
(d)  AARD in continuing and expanding agricultural research and
development for reclaimed swamps (para. 4.08); and
(e)  DOS, DGFCA and MOT in monitoring and evaluating swamp developments
(para. 4.14).
3.21      Investigations.  The project will continue and expand the investiga-
tions for potable water supply started in the 9,000 ha project area of the
FSRP. Geophysical investigations for water bearing zones supplemented, where
indicated, by about 10 test borings will be carried out in the 30,000 ha area
and at a number of other sites where acute drinking water problems exist.
Viable treatment and storage methods of surface water of alternative sources
during dry seasons will be investigated.
3.22      Studies.  Nationwide reconnaissance studies, started under the FSRP,
will be followed up under this project and some older schemes will be upgraded
under the SSRP. Studies will include:
(a)  master plans and feasibility studies for reclamation of about
200,000 ha of coastal lands in Irian Jaya identified in the
Nationwide Study, and
(b)  feasibility studies for upgrading the hydraulic infrastructure
(rehabilitation of canals and construction of control structures) of
about 35,000 ha of older GOI and spontaneous schemes, and detail
design of about 15,000 ha.
3.23      Upgrading Works.  A study under the FSRP of 12 existing Government
and spontaneous swamp reclamation schemes in South Sumatra and South
Kalimantan analyzed physical, agricultural, and socio-economic conditions and
development constraints. Three selected schemes have been studied in greater
detail with respect to the feasibility of upgrading the drainage and communi-
cation infrastructure (canals, bridges, jetties) and provide water management
control structures (mostly small tertiary headgates). Upgrading of infra-
structure serving about 5,000 ha will proceed after review of the studies by
the Bank, with funds provided under the SSRP. An assurance was obtained at
negotiations that GOI would operate and maintain these works satisfactorily
(para. 8.01).
Status of Field Data, Planning and Design
3.24      Field Data.  Topographic maps used in planning and design were based
on 1:20,000 aerial photos and ground controls (1976), surveys along a 1,000 m
spaced grid (1978) and strip surveys checked within allowable altimetric and
closure tolerances. Working maps are to a scale of 1:10,000 with 25 cm
contours. Detailed soil surveys and soil classification prepared in 1976/1978
focussed on the proximity to the surface of potential acid sulfate soil and
depth of peats. Areas in which potential acid sulfate soils were near the
surface or in which peats were deeper than 90 cm were excluded (para. 2.04).
Hydrometric data were derived from automatic recording gauging stations at the
mouth of the Lalang River (CAL 1) and some 60 km and 120 km upstream; a

salinity measurements were carried out at spring tides in the dry and wet
seasons and will be repeated during implementation. Soil mechanic tests were
carried out along proposed alignments of canals before designing the canal
network.
3.25      Plans and Design.  Master plans for a total area of 200,000 ha,
including the SSRP project area, were prepared in 1976-1978, and an area of
110,000 ha was identified as suitable for development. The FSRP is located
near the southern border of the study area; the proposed SSRP is located in
its center bordering on Karang Agung Hilir, a GOI financed development in the
northeastern quadrant. Detailed designs for the primary and secondary
hydraulic network of the project areas were completed in March 1983. Prequal-
ification of civil works contractors and preparation of contract documents for
main civil works under the guidance of consultants (financed under the FSRP)
has been completed.
Implementation Schedule
3.26      Bidding by prequalified contractors for main civil works started in
March 1984. Bids will be opened in May 1984 and evaluated by August 1984.
Under current procedures, main contracts will be awarded by November 1984 and
construction should start in April 1985. As the hydraulic network is composed
of 19 separate systems, works may be constructed in parallel under one or two
main contracts and completed by mid-1990. These contracts will include mecha-
nically constructed primary and secondary canals, ancillary structures and
base camp. As soon as the first primary systems are completed, other contrac-
tors will start land clearing for houselots and settlements, and houses will
be constructed continuously at a rate of about 325/month (Annex 2, Table 9).
Both operations are scheduled to continue year-round for four years but final
land clearing operations will take place mostly in the dry season. The first
groups of settlers, of about 500 families, will arrive in April through June
1986. Subsequent groups will arrive during the following three years
(Annex 2, Table 9). About 85 man-days are estimated for land clearing of one
ha in this area and about 100 man-days for tertiary construction. Settlers
could provide up to 65% of this labor requirement without slowing the pace of
developing and cultivating their own land (para. 3.06). An assurance was
obtained at negotiations that GOI would construct project works and carry out
settlement activities in accordance with an implementation schedule
(Table 8.1) agreed with the Bank (para. 8.01).
Consulting Services
3.27      Consulting services for institutional support (Annex 6) will be
provided by local consultants, supplemented by expatriates in specialized
fields. Services will be rendered in construction supervision, implementation
management and O&M, project preparation, upgrading of older developments,
agricultural research, land clearing, final land preparation through Community
Action and monitoring and evaluation, as shown in Table 3.2. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that consultants, whose qualifications, experience,
terms and conditions of employment are acceptable to the Bank, would be
engaged not later than indicated in the Implementation Schedule (Table 8.1) by
DOS, AARD, DGFCA and MOT (para. 8.01).

Cost Estimates
3.28      Total costs are estimated at $108.5 million (including a front-end
fee of about $0.2 million and taxes on civil works of about $1.3 million) of
which $42.5 million (or 39.2%) will be foreign exchange. Project costs are
expressed in end 1983 prices, and an exchange rate of Rp 1,000 = US$1.00 is
used in this report.  Unit prices for civil works are based on contracted
costs of the FSRP and other GOI projects in the area. Land clearing costs are
based on GOI's recent contracts, adjusted for medium to dense forest cover.
Quantities of primary and secondary canal systems have been derived from
detailed plans, and those of tertiaries from quantities based on average
ground levels. Costs of houses, community facilities, transport and support
to transmigrants are all based on current GOI contracts. Costs of agricul-
tural research and support are based on recent AARD and DGFCA data. A 15%
allowance has been included for physical contingencies except land clearing
for which an allowance of 30% has been included. Price contingencies are
based on local inflation of 12% in 1984, 10% in 1985-1987, 9% in 1988, 7% in
1989 and 6% thereafter; and on foreign cost inflation of 3% in 1984, 7.5% in
1985, 9% in 1986-1988, 7% in 1989 and 6% thereafter. Details of project costs
are given in Annex 1, Tables 1, 2, and 5 and summarized in Table 3.3. Total
costs of the overall 8-year development are estimated at $120.8 million
(Annex 1, Table IA).
Financing
3.29      The proposed Bank loan of $65.0 million will finance foreign
exchange costs of about $42.50 million and $22.5 million of local costs. This
represents about 60% of total project costs exclusive of taxes. GOI will
finance the balance of project costs of $43.5 million (Table 3.4), and another
$12.3 million to complete the program beyond the six-year time slice financed
by the Bank. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that GOI would com-
plete the balance of this development program not financed under the project
in a timely and efficient manner, not later than December 1991 as set out in
the Implementation Schedule (para. 8.01). GOI will furnish support and
supplies to all settlers for 18 months following settlement.

Procurement
3.30      Construction of primary and secondary canals and structures has been
grouped in two schedules (one will include construction of the base camp) of
about $7.5 million each /46 which are being procured under ICB in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Other civil works will be highly labor intensive, and
not attractive for international bidders. These works will be grouped in
appropriate packages (ranging between $0.8-$1.5 million) procured in
accordance with LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank and will include:
(a)  clearing of houselots, extended houselots and villages under no more
than four contracts;
(b)  construction of houses and village facilities under not more than
twelve contracts;/47 and
(c)  clearing of farm plots and construction of tertiaries under not more
than seven and six contracts respectively.
Equipment including draglines, and workshop equipment (about $1.6 million or
30% of equipment acquisitions) will be procured through ICB, other lab, field
surveying, boats and radio equipment (about $2.6 million or 55% of equipment
acquisitions), which will be procured in small packages, not suitable for ICB
will be procured through LCB. About $800,000 worth of special lab and survey
equipment will be procured on the basis of three quotations. Civil works and
equipment will be procured by DGWRD's executing agency; land clearing and
housing by MOT's executing agencies (PLP and DGSP); and consultant services
will be procured by DOS, AARD, DGFCA and MOT (para. 3.27), using contract
documents approved by the Bank. DGFCA will procure seeds, planting materials,
agrochemicals and furnish plant protection brigades and demonstration plots.
Paddy-field bunds will be constructed by settlers under a DGFCA sponsored rice
land formation program.
3.31      Review of Procurement.  Procurement is reviewed by the secretariat
of each ministry and for contracts larger than $500,000, clearance must also
be obtained from SEKNEG - the State Secretariat Procurement Control Unit. The
Bank supervises contracts through RSI (Resident Staff, Indonesia) which works
closely with these agencies on procurement matters. The Bank will review
prior to tendering all contracts in excess of $1 million including ICBs,
larger LCBs (about 50% of all civil works) consultant contracts and contracts
for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $200,000 or more, and review
smaller contracts, after award on a sample basis. Other contracts will be
/46 October 1983, baseline costs and price contingencies.
/47 Experience in the construction of the FSRP showed it to be more economic
to clear land and construct houses under separate contracts. In the
SSRP, four contractors may be engaged simultaneously in housing
construction.

controlled by GOI's procurement control units, and reviewed by the Bank on a
sample basis after award. Table 3.5 summarizes procurement arrangements.
Disbursements
3.32      Disbu;rsement for works and equipment will be made at the following
rates:
Category                                    Disbursement rate (%)
(a)  Major civil works - ICB contracts;                        100
(b) Minor civil works (tertiaries, hamlet drains,
paddy--field bunds, small structures, land clearing,
upgrading and housing construction);                       60
(c)  Imported equipment and materials;                         100  (of foreign
exchange)
(d)  Imported equipment and materials procured locally;         60
(e)  Locally manufactured goods;                                95  (ex factory)
(f) Local and expatriate consultant services, travel
costs and per diems for training;                         100
(g)  Water well drilling and testing                           100
Disbursement will be made against contracts, but construction costs of hamlet
drains, paddy-f'ield bunds, and training, will be disbursed based on statements
of expenditure (Annex 5).
3.33      Annex 1, Table 3 gives estimated disbursements compared with a
profile of disbursements for Transmigration Projects I and II (Loans 1318-IND
and 1707-IND). Though the hydraulic infrastructure of the SSRP is more
complex than that of upland developments in Transmigration Projects I and II,
it can be constructed at a similar rate with proper equipment and under proper
management which the SSRP is expected to demonstrate. Disbursements during
initial years reflect relatively fast disbursing consulting services. They
are expected to continue about 6 months beyond completion as experienced in
transmigration projects disbursing for similar works.
Accounts and Audits
3.34      Assurances were obtained from GOI that:
(a) implementing agencies and directorates participating in the project
would maintain separate records and accounts related to the project;
(b) accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank; and

gratLon projects who would submit them to the Bank in a summarized
form together with the auditor's comments and opinions not later
than ten months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 8.01).
Environmental Effects
3.35      The environmental impact of the SSRP will be minor.  Mangroves, the
source of food for coastal fish and shrimp, will be preserved and the use of
pesticides will be controlled to prevent toxicity in drainage effluents.
Environmental impact studies begun under the FSRP (para. 1.19) will be
expanded to collect data on the impact of larger-scale swamp developments in
South Sumatra and South Kalimantan on water and soils quality, fish, shrimp,
pests, insects, and diseases (para. 4.14).
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Executing Agencies and Coordination
4.01      Background.  Between 1978 and 1983 all transmigration projects,
including swamp reclamation, were implemented by line agencies from different
ministries in accordance with Presidential Decree 26/78. Under this decree,
the Ministry of Public Works was responsible for site selection, surveys and
investigations, construction of the infrastructure and land clearing; the
Directorate General of Transmigration was responsible for settlement support
of new settlers and community development; the Directorate General of Food
Crops Agriculture provided agricultural support services, inputs and
extension; and the Directorate General Agraria (Ministry of Interior) was
responsible for cadastral surveys and registration of land titles. The Office
of the Junior Minister for Transmigration coordinated implementation
schedules, budgets, externally assisted projects and identified policy issues
for discussion within BAKOPTRANS./48
4.02      In March 1983 the Ministry of Transmigration (MOT) was reorganized
(para. 1.10), assumed the coordination function of the Junior Ministry, and
absorbed PLPT (now PLP) and Transmigration Planning (DITADA) from the Ministry
of Public Works. MOT has now two Directorate Generals. The DG of Settlement
Planning (DGSP) is responsible for planning and executing physical works and
settlement, and the DG Mobilization and Guidance (DGMG), is responsible for
the support of settlers until about five years after settlement when adminis-
trative responsibility is transferred to local government. Transmigration IV
(Loan 2288-IND) provides a Special Coordinating Unit in MOT for Bank Group
assisted transmigration and swamp reclamation projects (Figure 4.1), and the
FSRP (Loan 1958-IND) provides additional consultant assistance (during 1983-
1986) to coordinate implementation in swamp reclamation projects.

4.03      Implementation of the SSRP.  The overall responsibility for coordi-
nating implemention of the SSRP rests with MOT. The Ministry of Public Works
will be responsible only for the infrastructure while MOT will be responsible
for land clearing, housing, settlement, guidance and support. DGFCA will be
responsible for an input package and support agricultural development, while
social services to newly created communities will be provided by respective
ministries, coordinated during initial years by the Ministry of Transmi-
gration. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that MOT would appoint a
qualified resident project manager and post him by July 1985 (para. 8.01). He
will be backed by MOT's provincial director (KAKANWIL) and by the sub-
coordinator for Bank-financed projects. Construction contracts will be
managed by respective line agencies (Table 3.1) through site managers
supported by each agency's provincial and HQ offices and assisted by consul-
tants. To synchronize activities site managers will attend monthly meetings
chaired by MOT's KAKANWIL, reporting progress of activities and adjusting
schedules and attend monthly technical meetings chaired by MOT's project
manager. Executives of line agencies will attend these meetings if
required. Information from the field will be routinely transmitted to MOT's
subcoordinator for Bank assisted projects who will monitor overall progress of
works; intervene with agencies as necessary; liaise with the Bank; and submit
quarterly, semi-annual and annual consolidated progress reports.
Agricultural Support
4.04      Agricultural Extension.  Two middle-level extension workers (PPMs)
and about ten field extension workers (PPLs) and one pest observer will be
appointed to each of the three rural extension centers (RECs) to provide
extension services that will focus on selection of varieties, cultural prac-
tices and pest control. Three subject matter specialists (PPSs) in rice
agronomy, soil and water management and plant protection, stationed in South
Sumatra, will visit each REC fortnightly to provide in-service training and
technical guidance to the PPM/PPL. PPSs and field extension staff will
cooperate with AARD research officers in planning and supervising extension
trials on farmers' fields.
4.05      Farm Supplies.  DGFCA will be responsible for supplying planting
materials and pesticides to each settler family (Table 4.1). Seeds and
planting materials will be for first season planting of houselots and farm
plots, with additional supplies of seeds and pesticides the second year.
DGFCA will assist in procuring paddy seed of suitable local varieties until
land development has advanced sufficiently to introduce high yielding
varieties and a crop intensification program. An assurance was obtained at
negotiations that MOA would extend an intensification program to the project
area in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to the Bank (para. 8.01).
Improved paddy varieties will be supplied initially from DGFCA's seed farm at
Upang; at a later stage (from about year 5 or 6 after settlement) DGFCA will
supervise the ,production of extension seed by selected farmers participating
in the INSUS program. At full development the quantity of paddy seed
(assuming seed replacement every fourth season) amounts to about 150 tons.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that MOT in cooperation with DGFCA
and the Ministry of Cooperatives (MOC) would cause depots or kiosks to be
established in the second year of the project in the project area and cause

them to be stocked with farm supplies, pesticides, fertilizers, tools and
equipment spare parts for sale to settlers (para. 8.01). The MOT site manager
will monitor demand in individual villages and advise MOC staff who, in
consultation with DGFCA project staff, will order supplies.
4.06      Pest Control.  DGFCA will establish two plant protection brigades
for pest control in coastal swamp areas of South Sumatra and South Kalimantan
and an assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations (para. 8.01).
These brigades will operate under DGFCA's regional crop protection centers at
Palembang and Banjarmasin /49 and will provide equipment and supplies to
support settlers to combat crop pest and disease outbreaks, which settlers are
unable to control on their own. These units will also assist in formulating
and implementing community campaigns against rats, wild boars and insect
pests, such as the rice bug and stem borer. Pest observers, attached to RECs
will be responsible for monitoring and early warning of pests and diseases;
assessing crop damage; providing technical recommendations and guidance to
PPM/PPLs and alerting pest brigades on timing and on required action.
4.07      Agricultural Research.  AARD, supported by consultants, will conduct
research aimed at improving agricultural development of coastal swamps through
crop intensification and diversification. This will entail research into
farming systems; plant protection; field water management; soils and plant
nutrition; varietal testing; livestock; industrial crops and aquaculture.
Research activities will be conducted mainly at three test farms, namely,
Tamban Luar (Central Kalimantan); Alabio, (South Kalimantan), and Upang,
(South Sumatra). In addition, studies and trials will be undertaken on
farmers' fields.
4.08      AARD will be responsible for preparing detailed annual plans, sche-
dules, and budgets and setting up a Project Coordination Unit for coordinating
research, management of test farms, procurement, supervision of consultants,
and reporting. Each research component will be headed by an AARD team leader,
advised by part-time AARD specialists, carried out by a team of about nine to
twelve full-time AARD technicians.  Expatriate and local consultants (Table 3.2)
will be assigned to assist research, especially during initial years. Technical
and institutional support to test farms will be given by the Central Research
Institute ror Food Crops (BARIF) at Banjarmasin, and other specialized
research institutes./50 The SSRP will finance a three year time-slice which
will enable AARD to undertake important research activities in a timely manner
at the start of Repelita IV (1984-88), and to integrate this into a longer
term, national program of multi-disciplinary research. An assurance to
continue research beyond the three year Bank-assisted time slice was obtained
at negotiations (para. 8.01).

Lampung, South Sumatra and Bengkulu; the Banjarmasin center for the
provinces of Kalimantan.

Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
4.09      Background.  During the past years of rapid development of drainage-
reclamation works GOI gave priority to opening up new areas; this involved
construction of nearly 2,000 km of large navigation and primary drainage
canals and a similar length of smaller drains. However little attention was
paid to maintaining this vast network except for emergency works when naviga-
tion canals became impassable at low tides. Generally, drainage systems in
tidal areas are not subject to heavy siltation as are most irrigation systems,
but canal banks have to be regularly shaped, and rapidly growing vegetation
has to be periodically removed, particularly from canals which are dry part of
the time. These requirements, as well as operation of gated control struc-
tures to be built, will have to be met in the future.
4.10      Responsibility.  O&M of drainage systems in reclaimed swamps would
be executed in the same manner as O&M of irrigation systems: Government,
through the Provincial Public Works Services is expected to operate and main-
tain navigation canals, primary and secondary drains; and settlers, through
existing hamlet groups, will operate and maintain tertiary systems. In prac-
tice, however, the responsibility for O&M of main and secondary systems has
not been transferred from the executing agency (formerly P4S now P3S) to
provincial public works (PPW) in any GOI swamp reclamation project as PPW has
not been given, in the past, the mandate, manpower and funds. In fiscal
1984/85 however GOI provided about Rp 2 billion ($2 million) to initiate O&M
of drainage infrastructure in reclaimed swamps of which about Rp 700 million
($0.7 million) is earmarked for South Sumatra and the SSRP will assist PPW in
establishing an O&M unit for reclaimed swamps in the province. Technical
assistance will be provided to define maintenance and operation equipment
requirements, specifications, organizational arrangements, job descriptions,
procedures, preparation of plans of operation, schedules of activities, and
preparation of budgets for an expanding program. Assistance will also be
provided for procurement of equipment for start-up operations, demonstration
and training in a number of GOI projects in South Sumatra (para. 3.20).
4.11      As in irrigation systems, tertiaries will be maintained by settlers.
This will not impose undue physical or organizational burdens. In planned
swamp developments tertiaries serve only one hamlet (of about 14-18 families)
and each family would have to spend only about a day a month clearing vegeta-
tion and debris. MOT's group leaders (accompanying settlers during initial
years) will stress the importance of this to settlers at orientation
(para. 3.12) and assist them in organizing hamlet groups. Operation and
maintenance of tertiary control gates requires basic technical skills and
organizational arrangements which will be provided by PPW. P3S would assume
this responsibility in cases where tertiary (or secondary) structures are
constructed before projects are officially turned over to PPW. Annual
maintenance costs are estimated as $17.50/ha.
4.12      Public facilities such as schools, health centers, religious insti-
tutions and police stations will be operated and maintained by appropriate
ministries as in all transmigration schemes. Agricultural support will be
provided by DGFCA and village cooperatives will be initially supported by MOT
and transferred to DGC when they become financially viable. An assurance was



- 36 -
obtained at negotiations that GOI would allocate adequate funds to operate
properly and maintain all infrastructure and public facilities constructed
under the project, and ensure timely release of funds (para. 8.01).
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
4.13      Project Implementation.  During implementation, physical progress
and expenditures will be monitored by MOT's project coordinator and his staff
(para. 4.03), assisted by a consultant provided under the FSRP (Loan
1958-IND)
4.14      Environmental and Socio-Economic Impact Evaluation.  Continued
improvement of swamp development requires systematic monitoring and evaluation
of physical and socio-economic conditions in older as well as more recent
developments. Thus while focussing on critical and readily assessable
features such as soil conditions (peat subsidence, pH), water quality, crop--
ping and yields in the development areas, attention will also be given to
changes in water quality and fishlife in the vicinity. For this purpose the
program will include monitoring (a) of the Calik and Lalang rivers in South
Sumatra and the Barito and Kapuas rivers in Kalimantan, and (b) of soil,
water, and socio-economic conditions at the site of the SSRP and three other
sites to be selected. The program, which will be coordinated by MOT, will be
carried out by appropriate line agencies, assisted by consultants. To
establish base line references, operations will commence in May 1986 and
continue throughout the project. MOT will (a) be responsible for preparing
and submitting a benchmark report by December 31, 1986 and starting May 1988
and thereafter by May 1, annual summary evaluations which will be assessed by
GOI and the Bank, (b) cause relevant agencies to take remedial actions to
protect soils and environment, (c) take steps to provide feedback in planning
new developments, and improving subsequent M&E. An assurance was obtained at
negotiations that MOT would carry out these tasks (para. 8.01). Activities
will, inter alia monitor:
(a)  Physical changes:  soils (DGFCA); river water quality (DPMA); con-
dition of infrastructure (stability and shape of sections - P3S);
flooding in project areas (P3S); water quality in drains (P3S);
fishlife in the rivers (AARD);
(b)  Agriculture:  Land development (DGFCA); crops and yields (DGFCA);
pest and disease problems (DGFCA); and
(c)  Socio-Economy:  Settlers' family labor employment; on and off-farm
employment (MOT); farm budgets (MOT); regional labor markets (MOT);
and institutional development (MOT).

5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Agriculture in Neighboring Areas
5.01      Narrow strips of land near the project area along the Lalang River
and in the villages of Sungai Dua and Teluk Bayur have been cleared by sponta-
neous settlers and are partly under rice. The bank of the Calik river, near
the village of Panuguan is under rice and coconuts. Land holdings range in
size from house lots of less than 0.2 ha, to holdings of more than 6 ha with
an average holding of about 2.5 ha. Of this, about 1.9 ha is under paddy, 0.5
ha under coconuts and about 0.1 ha is under other food and tree crops,
especially bananas. Land preparation for a single wet season paddy crop
consists of cutting and burning of bushes and grasses with minimum tillage,
and there is extensive weed growth. Rice varieties are locally adapted types
with a 7 to 8 month maturation period which includes a two-stage nursery of
2-1/2 to 3 months duration. Double transplanting enables development of large
seedlings which are resistant to floods. Pests (especially wild boars and
rats) and weeds are major problems. No fertilizers are used and yields
generally do not exceed 2 tons dry paddy per ha.
5.02      Coconuts are often planted on 50 cm to 1 m high mounds with paddy
grown as an intercrop until overshaded by the palms. If drainage is adequate,
coconuts become the sole crop. A full stand of coconuts consists of about 160
palms per ha and good yielding local varieties on better drained river bank
soils produce about 7,000 to 8,000 nuts/ha/year at maturity. Bananas, a
popular perennial crop, are mostly planted near houses or other well drained
sites. Houselots may also contain some maize, cassava or vegetables, such as
long bean, sweet potato and chillies.
Farm Development Patterns
5.03      The basic cropping pattern of the SSRP will follow that of the FSRP
focussing on establishing as quickly as possible the house lot garden with a
wide variety of annual and perennial food crops,/51 together with a progres-
sively increasing paddy crop. In later years some settlers may opt for more
tree crops, especially coconuts, which will be planted on higher parts of the
farm or on bunds (the "surjan" system).  Some farms may be more suitable than
others (by location, drainage or soil characteristics) for growing secondary
food crops (palawija) such as corn, groundnuts, or soybeans, which will be
exploited once basic farm development is completed. The expected cropping
patterns and monthly rainfall distribution are shown in Annex 2, Figure 1.
/51  Including coconuts, bananas, cassava, taro, corn, rice, pineapple,
peanuts, various fruits and vegetables. To simplify the agricultural and
economic analysis, it is assumed that the houselot (0.25 ha) will be used
for building (0.05 ha), coconuts (0.1 ha), bananas (0.1 ha) and inter-
cropped with secondary crops (corn).

Land Development and Cropping
5.04      Upon arrival, each settler family is given a cleared house lot, an
'extended houselot', and a partly cleared farm plot of 1.75 ha (para. 3.07).
Experience shows that settlers develop and cultivate houselots within two to
three months after arrival. Thus settlers arriving in the spring (March-June)
will have time to participate in clearing farm plots and cultivate a part of
each farm plot in their first settlement year. Settlers arriving over the
rest of the year will be able to start cultivating farm plots only in the
following year. Land preparation methods will emphasize minimum disturbance
of top soil and technical advice will be given to farmers by PPLs.
5.05      Felling and cutting of trees will be carried out by contractors
using power tools and specialized crews, while settlers will be able to
participate in all other clearing activities (windrowing, burning, final
clearing, final burning) (para. 3.06). Activities not financed under the
project, which have taken up to seven years in other projects, will be
completed in about three years with assistance from MOT group leaders and
consultants. Satisfactory performance by settler groups will enable them to
participate in INSUS or similar type credit program (para. 3.19).
5.06      In early years, locally adapted longer maturing paddy varieties will
be grown until fields are cleared of stumps. Improved shorter-term paddy
varieties with fertilizer inputs will then be introduced, together with dry
season cropping with secondary food crops in extended houselots. Traditional
paddy varieties take about 220 days from nursery sowing to harvest. Sowing
will take place in October/November; transplanting in December/January; and
harvesting in May/June. When improved short-term varieties (about 135 days)
are introduced, land preparation will consist of slashing weed growth and
burning at the beginning of September. Sowing will start about mid-September
and transplanting in October. This will enhance crop growth during the rainy
months of November/December and enable harvesting to take place in February.
Thereafter, land preparation and planting of other annual crops, such as corn,
may take place in mid-April in extended houselots and may also be extended by
entrepreneurial farmers to farm plots. However, this may be an exception
rather than the rule, and hence dry season cropping farm plots has not been
considered in the economic analysis.
Yields
5.07      Projected initial and target crop yields and estimated development
periods are suimmarized in Table 5.1. These are based on experience in neigh-
boring areas where agricultural development has been ongoing for about 13
years. In some localities with strong extension support, and incentives such
as the INSUS credit program, paddy yields in excess of 3 t/ha are being
attained, though on average, present yields are about 2 t/ha. A projected
average yield of 2.5 t/ha within 7 years is considered realistic.

Crop Production
5.08      Crop production and family consumption at full development (1998)
are summarized in Table 5.2. By the late 1990s, farmers in the project area
are expected to produce a marketable surplus of about 46,000 tons of paddy (or
about 30,000 tons of milled rice), 1,600 tons of corn or other secondary food
crops, and the equivalent of 1.5 million fresh coconuts, 240 tons of coconut
oil and 450,000 bunches of bananas.

/a   Coconuts are expected to be consumed equally fresh and as oil.
Pest Control
5.09      Extension staff will guide farmers in zinc phosphide baiting against
rodents when land preparation commences and through the nursery stage. Inten-
sive baiting with anticoagulant poisons will be carried out at least twice
during the early growth stages, and fumigation of burrows will be undertaken
during the grain ripening period through harvest when poison baiting is not



- 40 -
effective. Further baiting with anticoagulant poisons will be done during the
fallow period between wet and dry season plantings. The extension service
will receive practical training in poison baiting and fumigation methods /52
and will be responsible for training and organizing farmers to conduct
sustained community pest control operations.
Drying, Storage and Processing
5.10      Most settlers will be experienced paddy producers accustomed to sun-
dry paddy on mats, and storing dry paddy for home consumption. The BUUDs/KUDs
will be equipped with concrete drying floors, and private millers or traders,
who are expected to move into the area, will also provide paddy drying and
milling facilities.
Livestock and Fisheries
5.11      Chickens and ducks are the most popular livestock in swampland
settlements. Based on past experience each family will acquire chicks with
their own resources and raise 20-30 birds fed with farm by-products. Poultry
products are easy to sell on local markets, and will provide settlers an
estimated yearly net income of about Rp 24,000 per family. Cattle, sheep and
goats are less popular in these settlements, especially since cattle cannot be
used for cultivating soft swampy soils.
5.12      Fishing in rivers, estuaries and mangroves (leased from margas at
annual auctions, para. 2.13) will be an important off-farm activity.for about
30% of transmigration families, particularly children./53 Research aimed at
increasing returns from fishing are included in AARD's activities
(para. 4.07).
VI. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Rice, the major crop to be produced under the project, has good
market prospects, especially in the south Sumatra region which has an annual
deficit of about 100,000 tons, and no nearby surplus production areas.
6.02      Palembang will be the major market for surplus produce including
rice, corn, coconuts, bananas, and poultry. There are no major difficulties
anticipated inI marketing output as transportation facilities by waterways are
adequate. In addition to well established private market channels, settlers
have access to government price support systems under which village cooper-
atives (BUUD/KUD) maintain a floor price for paddy and other food crops.

- 41 -
DOLOG, the provincial branch of BULOG, will arrange the transport of paddy
purchased by cooperatives in the project area to its warehouses in Palembang.
Prices
6.03      Farm inputs and outputs are valued in constant end 1983 prices in
farm budgets and economic analyses. Economic prices for rice, corn, coconut
oil, and fertilizer are based on July 1983 world market price forecasts for
1985, 1990 and 1995 by the Bank's Commodities and Export Projections Division,
adjusted for transportation, processing, and handling costs to the farm gate
level as shown in Annex 2, Tables 1 and 2. Financial prices for all
commodities and economic prices for fresh coconuts, bananas, and others not
traded on international markets, have been updated from actual farm gate
prices. In the project analysis, projected economic and financial prices for
1985, 1990 and 1995 represent prices during the periods of 1985-1989, 1990-
1994, and 1995 onwards respectively.
6.04      In the past, GOI maintained consumer food prices at a low level by
selling imported rice below cost and by keeping domestic floor prices low. To
offset an adverse impact on producers, GOI subsidized fertilizer and pesticide
prices. In recent years, however, GOI has considerably raised paddy floor
prices to encourage rice production. Before the March 1983 Rupiah devaluation
the floor price for paddy of Rp 145/kg (US$207/t) was actually higher than the
economic price of US$197/t while the current floor price of Rp 150/kg ($150/t)
is about 24% lower than the economic price. For project analysis, financial
prices of paddy, corn and coconut oil have been assumed to converge with
economic prices, equaling them by 1995. To reduce subsidies and discourage
excessive use of fertilizers, GOI raised the price of urea and TSP in early
1983 from Rp 70/kg (unchanged since 1977) to Rp 90/kg. Even after this rise
the domestic price is still considerably below the border price and is
expected to remain low in the 1990s.
Family Incomes
6.05      Family income of settlers will be derived mainly from paddy, and
partly from produce grown on houselots, small livestock, and off-farm
activities. In calculating incomes, settlers are represented by two groups
reflecting their time of arrival (para. 5.04): group A settlers arriving in
the spring of each year (March-June), and group B settlers arriving in other
months.
6.06      Detailed year-by-year physical inputs and output tables (Annex 2,
Tables 3 and 4) have been prepared for group A and group B in accordance with
the cropping pattern and agricultural development described in Chapter 5.
Income from small livestock is expected to be about $24 per family per year
(para. 5.11). Off-farm incomes (mainly from logging, fishing and construction
activities) are expected to be about $20 per year in the fifth year after
arrival and up to $100 from the ninth year. Expenses for hired labor are
expected to be minimal since there is sufficient family labor available to



- 42 -
meet farming requirements even during peak family seasons (Annex 2, Table 7
and 8 and Fig. 2)./54
6.07      Table 6.1 summarizes average incomes for group A and B settlers
detailed in Anniex 2, Tables 5 and 6. Settler incomes during the initial
18 month period reflect the subsistence provided by MOT /55 and off-farm
income from land clearing in the project area. Annual incomes of group A
families rise sharply after project year 5, or the third year after arrival
and stabilize at $1,575 per family (or about $315 per capita) in project
year 17./56 Incomes of families of group B are low during their first year
(project year 3) since they arrive in the rainy season, too late to grow a
crop that year. In subsequent years incomes improve gradually, and with some
savings from year 4, settlers will not be exposed to undue financial stress
during years 5 and 6. From year 7 and on incomes rise sharply until they
stabilize in year 17.
Project Charges
6.08      IPEDA and Other Contributions.  Farmers in Indonesia pay a national
land tax (IPEDA) assessed as a percentage of crop production. Transmigrants,
however, pay IPEDA only when land is fully developed and the project is trans-
ferred to the jurisdiction of provincial government, not earlier than five
years after settlement. IPEDA is collected by village heads and turned over
to the local and provincial administration for financing local development.
At full development, IPEDA is expected to reach an estimated Rp 10,000/ha
($10/ha) or Rp 22,500 ($22.50) per settler farm. In addition, a settler
family will contribute about 10 man-days, the equivalent of Rp 12,000 ($12)
per year to operate and maintain collector, tertiary and hamlet drains
(para. 4.11).
/54  Labor surplus is expected to develop in the dry seasons from year 7 on,
when paddy fields are fully developed, but dry season crops are not
grown.
/55  Valued at $336 per family per year.
/56  Incomes during project year 5 are lower than those during preceding years
as subsidies are terminated, on-farm incomes are still low, yet farm
labor requirements are high. The situation is not critical as settlers
will be self-sufficient in food and should have savings from disposable
incomes during preceding years. An income of $315 per capita at full
development is satisfactory compared to a projected per capita income of
the lower 40% of the rural population of about $107. Incomes will
continue to increase as GOI implements additional investments aimed at
upgrading swamp development (para. 1.08).

6.09      Cost and Rent Recovery.  The cost recovery index, estimated at 7%,
is the ratio of the present value of incremental direct government revenue
(IPEDA and other contributions) to the present value of incremental financial
costs of the project in constant (1983) terms. Financial costs in this calcu-
lation include infrastructure, land development, settlement and support,
administration, and physical contingencies./57 Costs of nonproject-specific
items, such as technical assistance, and studies, are excluded. The rent
recovery index, which is the ratio of the total present value of incremental
direct government revenues to the total present value of net financial project
benefits (rent), is estimated at 8% (Table 6.2). These rates are in line with
those in similar recent projects in Indonesia (FSRP and Transmigration II).
GOI does not contemplate recovery of the capital cost of basic drainage
infrastructure and land clearing in transmigration projects, given relatively
low projected incomes, personal hardships and risks endured by settlers.
/57 Costs are in constant (1983) currency and no price increases are
included.

VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Project Benefits and Beneficiaries
7.01      The proposed project will increase food crop production; enhance
employment and income opportunities; contribute to regional development and
reduce foreign exchange expenditures for rice imports. At full development,
about 58,000 tons of paddy and about 5,000 tons of corn will be produced
annually which will save GOI foreign exchange of about US$14 million each year
in reduced rice imports. About 11,500 families will benefit directly, while
about 1,500 families will benefit indirectly through associated services such
as transportation, marketing and processing. Civil works will generate some
10 million man-days of construction labor, and the project will create about
5.8 million man-days of farm labor each year equivalent to about 18,000
additional full time jobs. All project beneficiaries are either rural or
urban poor who are underemployed or engaged in marginally productive
activities in their areas of origin in Java or Bali. Their transmigration to
South Sumatra will contribute to reducing pressure on land in overpopulated
areas of origin.
7.02      The proposed project will continue and expand Bank assistance to
GOI's swamp reclamation program started by the FSRP (Loan 1958-IND). It will
address the quality of the program; demonstrate cost effective implementation
procedures, supervision and implementation management, train executing agen-
cies in project preparation and implementation and assist agricultural
research and development. These considerations, though not quantifiable are
important justifications for the project.
Major Assumptions used in Economic Analysis
7.03      Direct Benefits.  Direct benefits are mainly derived from incre-
mental production of rice, corn, coconuts, and bananas. Benefits are valued
in economic prices (in end 1983 constant dollars) net of incremental produc-
tion costs. Settler incomes from off-farm activities such as fishing and



- 45 -
logging are considered because they are directly attributable to the settlers
transmigration to South Sumatra which provided opportunities absent in the
areas of origin. No deductions have been made for foregone land production
'without project' as unreclaimed swamp lands in the project area have
negligible economic value (para. 2.08). A detailed year-by-year analysis of
production and economic benefits is shown in Annex 2, Table 10. About 75% of
project benefits are attributable to paddy production; 15% to corn and
houselot produce; and about 10% to livestock and off-farm activities.
7.04      Economic Cost of Labor.  There are two sources of labor supply -
settler families and a small number of local residents. The economic cost of
settler labor is the opportunity cost of removing their labor from points of
origin. Since there are no direct estimates of such opportunity cost or
marginal returns to labor two approaches have been used: (a) from estimates of
total family expenditures; and (b) from wage rates in Java or Bali.
7.05      Estimated family expenditures of potential transmigrants average
those of the bottom 40% of Javanese households./58 However, these figures
may overstate marginal returns to labor and have been reduced by 15%. The
implicit economic cost of family labor is thus about $350 p.a. in the early
1990s. This is in line with an accounting ratio of 50% for conversion of peak
season wages in rice cultivation to annual average marginal returns to
labor./59
7.06      As the labor market in the project area is competitive, the economic
cost of daily hired labor for farming and construction is assumed to be equal
to the prevailing market wage of about Rp 1,200 per day in end 1983 prices.
7.07      Foreign Exchange.  The exchange rate of US$1.00 = Rp 1,000 is
considered to reflect the value to the economy of the foreign exchange used in
the project. A standard conversion factor of 1.0 has therefore been adopted.
7.08      Economic Life.  The project's economic life is assumed to be 35
years, based on the expected life of project works.
7.09      Economic Costs.  Total project costs have been adjusted to economic
costs by eliminating discrepancies between financial prices and real opportu-
nity costs. The following have been excluded:
(a) expected price increases and taxes;
(b) investment costs for education, health, cooperative and community
services, and basic subsistence packages, which would have been
provided by the government or by farmers themselves in the "without
project" situation; and
/58 According to the Indonesia Households Expenditure Survey 1980, average
expenditure of the bottom 40% in rural Java is Rp 3470 per capita per
month or about $67 per capita per year.

Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
7.10      With these assumptions, the economic rate of return of the 30,000 ha
swamp reclamation and development scheme is about 12.5%, in line with other
transmigration schemes in the Other Islands. Detailed year by year economic
costs and benefits and their present values are summarized in Annex 2,
Table 12.
Sensitivity Analysis
7.11      Crossover values /61 for a 10% discount rate were calculated for a
number of variables crucial to the success of the project. Table 7.2
summarizes differences between the crossover and appraisal values for a number
of critical variables.
Table 7.2: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Appraisal           Crossover         %
Key factors                     value               value        Change
(A)                 (B)
(a)  Total economic investment cost   $51 million         $70 million    +34
(b)  Paddy yield at full development    2.5 tons/ha         1.7 tons/ha  -33
(c)  Projected Paddy price (1995)       $267/ton          $179/ton        -33
(d)  Present value of benefits (PV)   $49.6 million    $37.2 million  -25
(e)  Implementation period                8 years          12 years       +50
7.12      The project can stand a reasonable degree of cost overruns and
reduced benefits and a 34% increase in total investment costs would be
required to reduce the ERR to 10%. The project will remain economically
viable even if rice yields should decline (as a result of poor soil, water
management and poor crop husbandry) to about 1.7 ton/ha. A 33% reduction in
benefits from paddy or a 25% reduction in total benefits would render the
project marginal. Similarly, an extension of implementation for the entire
development (including all on-farm works) from 8 to 12 years due to delays in
years 3, 4, and 5 would reduce the ERR to 10%. A 10% decrease in costs or an
equal increase in benefits will raise the ERR to about 13.4%.
/61 The crossover value is the value of the variable tested for which the
project's net present value calculated at 10% discount rate is zero, or
equivalently the value beyond which the ERR would be below 10%.

Risks
7.13      The main risks associated with the 30,000 ha swamp reclamation and
development scheme are slow implementation and delayed agricultural develop-
ment (para. 7.12). The following steps have been taken to reduce such and
other risks: (a) technical assistance will be provided to strengthen the
implementing agencies improve coordination and assure timely development;
(b) farm plots will consist of a single plot per family to facilitate faster
land development and cultivation; (c) pest control will be improved, thereby
increasing incentives to land development and crop intensification;
(d) environmental risks (particularly increasing soil acidity) have been
reduced by excluding nonsuitable soils, by providing paddy-field bunds, by
monitoring soil acidity, and by designing small water control structures which
can be quickly installed, where needed, to prevent acidification; and
(e) risks of sea water intrusion have been reduced by providing control struc-
tures. Potential risks of endemic diseases (particularly malaria, typhoid,
and cholera) are low as a result of planned health care and drinking water
facilities.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations agreements were reached on the following points:
(a) GOI will allocate adequate funds to properly operate and maintain
all infrastructure and public facilities constructed under the
project and will ensure timely release of funds (paras. 3.23 and
4.12);
(b) GOI will construct project works and carry out settlement activities
in accordance with an Implementation Schedule (Table 8.1) agreed
with the Bank (para. 3.26);
(c) ConsuLltants whose qualifications, experience, terms and conditions
of employment are acceptable to the Bank will be engaged by DOS,
DGFCA and MOT, not later than at dates given in the Implementation
Schedule (Table 8.1) (para. 3.27);
(d) GOI will complete the balance of the development program of
30,000 ha, about 40% of tertiaries, 60% of paddy-field bunds, and
clearing of about 33% of farm plots, not financed under the project
in a timely and efficient manner, not later than December 1991 as
set out in the Implementation Schedule (para. 3.29);
(e)  Separate project accounts will be maintained by each executing
agency which will be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and together with copies of Statements of
Expenditure (SOE) submitted to the Bank within nine months of the
close of each fiscal year. A summary of audited reports will be
submitted to the Bank by MOT's coordinator of Bank financed



- 49 -
transmigration projects not later than ten months after the end of
each fiscal year (para. 3.34);
(f) MOT will appoint a qualified resident project manager and post him
by July 1985 (para. 4.03);
(g) MOT in cooperation with DGFCA and the Ministry of Cooperatives will
cause depots or kiosks to be established in the second year of the
project in the project area and cause them to be stocked with farm
supplies, pesticides, fertilizers, tools and equipment spare parts
for sale to settlers (para. 4.05);
(h) MOA will extend an intensification program to the project area in
accordance with a schedule satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.05);
(i) DGFCA will establish two plant protection brigades for pest control
in coastal swamp areas of South Kalimantan and South Sumatra
(para. 4.06);
(j) GOI will continue the coastal swamp agricultural research program
beyond the three-year time slice (para. 4.08); and
(k) MOT, through line agencies, will be responsible throughout the
project's life to coordinate monitoring and evaluation of the
environmental impact (particularly soil and water) of development at
the SSRP and at three other sites to be selected, and in the Calik,
Lalang, Barito and Kapuas rivers. MOT will (a) prepare and submit
to the Bank a benchmark report by December 31, 1986 and annual
summarized evaluations beginning by May 1, 1988, (b) shall cause
re'levant agencies to take remedial action to protect soil and
environment, (c) take steps to provide feedback for planning new
developments and improve subsequent M&E (para. 4.14).
Recommendation
8.02      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for a Bank
loan of US$65.0 million with a 20-year maturity including a grace period of
five years. The Borrower would be the Republic of Indonesia.

/a  All world prices are based on Bank projections with adjustment to mid-1983 constant dollars by
indexes (MUV) of 100, 100.5 and 107.0% for 1981, 1982 and 1983 respectively.
/b  90% of world price based on spot checks and regressions.  See paper IBRD/AEPIA 1979.
7W  Source:  BULOG.  The breakdown of these costs is as follows (Rp/ton):
Port costs                    =  2,800
Transport to warehouse        =  2,900
Spraying & fumigation         =    400
Unloading                     =  3,700
Warehouse rent                =  1,000
Total          10,800 (US$17)
Losses at unloading 0.5% and 1.0% at warehouse = 5,000 (US$8).
/d  Converted at an estimated exchange rate of Rp 1,000 = US$1.00
7e  Assuming Indonesia is a net exporter of corn, the export price (f.o.b. Indonesia) is estimated
at world market price plus a US$15 transport premium for Asian markets.
/f  Converted at a rate of 1 ton coconut oil = 1.61 ton copra = 6452 coconuts.
7g  Financial prices of 1983 are actual prices collected in the field by the mission; prices of
1985, 1990 and 1995 are adjusted by the mission to reflect anticipated changes in the relative
prices of tradables and nontradables subsequent to the devaluation of March 30, 1983.
