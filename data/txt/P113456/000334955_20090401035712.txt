                           irregular recordkeeping, billing and payment practices.
                           Cotton: Producers' share of the international price for the 2009-2010 crop
                           season is 60.5 percent if production is below 50,000 tons, 61.5 percent if
                           production is between 50,000 and 60,000 tons, and 62.5 percent if
                           production is above 60,000 tons. Baseline: 58.6 percent (2008-09 crop

                       The grant is closely coordinated with assistance provided to the
                       Government's reform program through the LICUS TF Grant for Economic
                       Recovery and International Reengagement (FYOS), the Financial Sector and

                       The proposed operation presents significant country and fiduciary risks. The
                       four principal risks are: (i)political risk stemming mainly from possible
                       political tensions that could slow the current reform momentum; (ii)
                       macroeconomic risks stemming from the vulnerability of the Togolese
                       economy to exogenous terms of trade and climatic shocks, and a prolonged
                       global downturn causedby the financial crisis; (iii)fiduciary risk arising from
                       failure to avoid corruption or failure of the government to make effective and
RisksandRisk           efficient use of the fiscal space made available by budget support and debt
Mitigation             relief; and (iv) implementation capacity risk, arising from an insufficient
                       number of professionalstaff ingovernment and weak institutional capacity and
                       coordination.

                       It is expected that frequent broad-based consultations with stakeholders to
                       strengthen the case for reforms and the Government's commitment to them,
                       including in the context of the ongoing full PRSP preparation, would help
                       mitigate thepolitical risk. Inaddition, the measures supported by the operation



                                                   vi

                focus on areas in which the Governmenthas demonstratedits commitment and
                ownership. Close coordination with the IMF, AfDB and bilateral donors and
                intensified sector dialogue will help ensure that top priority is given by the
                Governmentto the reformof these sectors.

                The macroeconomic risks are mitigated by ongoingclose economic monitoring
                and coordination by the Bank, the IMF and other donors, and Government's
                demonstrated commitment to advance the reform agenda and rapidly achieve
                the HIPC completionpoint. This is complemented by favorable HIPC interim
                relief terms by Togo's creditors, and timely response by the Bank and other
                donors through provision of financial and technical support to Togo. Strong,
                predictableand timely donor support will also be critical to mitigate possible
                external risks.

                The fiduciary risk is mitigated through the operation's focus on measures to
                improve public financial management, including procurement, and analytical
                work and capacitybuilding providedby the Bank and other donors inthis area.

                The implementation capacity risk is mitigated through the provision of
                extensive technical assistance by the Bank and other donors in the areas
                covered by the proposed operation, including through the recent Public
                ExpenditureManagementandFinancialAccountabilityReview(PEMFAR), an
                ongoing LICUS Trust Fund grant, the planned Financial Sector and

            SECONDECONOMIC RECOVERYAND GOVERNANCEGRANT

                                       1. INTRODUCTION

1.1     This program document proposes a Second Economic Recovery and Governance
Grant (ERGG-2) to the Republicof Togo inthe amount of SDR13.6million(US$20million
equivalent). This one-tranche Development Policy Grant supports the Government's efforts to
pursue the implementation o f governance reforms initiated under the ERGG approved by the
Board in May 2008. Specifically, the ERGG-2 focuses on continuing and deepening policy
reforms to improve public financial management (PFM) and governance o f key public
enterprises and banks. The operation would provide financial support to the Government whose
annual debt service to IDA will remain considerable until attainment o f the HIPC completion
point.' After this operation, a possible follow on development policy operation would be
considered to support the Government's follow-on reforms in these areas under the strategic
directions defined by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper currently under preparation. The
grant is an integral part of the Bank's Interim Strategy Note for Togo for the period FY08-10
presented to the IDA Board on May 29,2008 and complements the assistance provided to
support the program o f the Government's reforms through the Financial Sector and Governance
TA Project, the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, the AfDB budget support operation and the IMF
PRGF program. Since Togo is at highrisk o f debt distress, IDA resources are provided on grant
terms, per the stipulations o f the grant allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 15
period (FY09-FY 11).

1.2     Togo has emerged from a socio-political crisis, marked by a period of heightened
tension and instability. Following the installation and subsequent election of Mr. Faure
Gnassingbe in 2005, upon the death o f President Eyadema Gnassingbe, concerns emerged about
the overall political situation in Togo. These concerns have subsided as political and economic
reforms have been progressively implemented in the wake o f the fair and transparent legislative
elections held on October 14,2007 that ledto an inclusive reform-orientedcabinet.

1.3     Given the complex governance and transparencyissues facing the government, the
proposed grant would assist Togo in continuing its economic and social recovery. The
proposed grant supports government-owned reforms to improve governance, transparency and
efficiency in public financial management as well as advance structural reforms aimed at
strengthening governance and transparency in the key sectors o f the economy (phosphates,
cotton, energy and financial sectors). These reforms would lead over time to strengthened fiscal
sustainability, improved economic governance and enhanced transparency o f State institutions
andprocesses+ritical     elements for the country's economic and social recovery.

              2. TOGO'S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGESAND PROSPECTS

                                           BACKGROUND

2.1     Togo, a small-sizedcountrywith a populationof 6.6 millionin2007, is a member of
the West AfricanEconomicand MonetaryUnion(WAEMU).'Its population is growing at 2.7
percent annually and likely to double in 25 years. Income per capita (US$360 in 2007 as per the
Bank's Atlas methodology) i s low compared to Sub-Saharan Africa (US$952) and Low Income
Countries (US$578) averages. Togo's highest export earning sector is cement and clinker,
produced from Togo's limestone, iron ore and other deposits by private companies. Togo's next
important exports are phosphate and cotton, which are processed and marketed by public
enterprises. Togo produces other cash crops, mainly groundnuts, coffee and cocoa, and has a
considerable agricultural potential due to favorable climatic conditions in a large part o f the
country. As a small country, Togo's successful development lies also inits ability to capitalize on
greater integrationwith its neighbors, notably through further development o f its deep water port
(the only one in the region) as a shipping hub, taking into account neighboring country port
development activities. Togo also has the potential to recapture its former position as a regional
financial hub, by appropriate framing and implementation o f its financial sector reforms,
attracting private strategic investors and staying ahead o f reforms inneighboring countries.

2.2     The long-lastingsocio-politicalcrisis, economic mismanagementand withdrawal of
donor supporttook a tollon Togo's economy, infrastructureandinstitutions.Togo's growth
performance has been among the weakest in sub-Saharan Africa, with per capita income
declining by an average o f one percent a year since the early 1980s. Furthermore, traditional
export sectors suffered from adverse terms o f trade and mismanagement o f state-owned
enterprises. Governance problems and banking sector difficulties inhibitedprivate investment. A
heavy external debt burdenand weak fiscal management ledto the rapid accumulation o f arrears.

2.3     Togo's long crisis also had a significant impact on social indicators, many of which
lag behind those of neighboring countries. The period o f political instability, economic
mismanagement and the related withdrawal o f donor support resultedinan econo.mic decline that
reduced living standards for a large segment o f the population. Weak public finance
management, inparticular due to weak management o f key state-owned companies whose losses
have been financed by the public treasury, eroded resources for vital public services. As a result,
expenditureson health, education and public investment are far below regional averages. Also,
government budgets favored urban rather than rural areas; infrastructure investmentin the rural
areas has been very limited, and there is high unemployment inthe urban areas. Togo's Human
Development Index failed to improve in recent years and stood at 0.512 for 2007-2008, in
contrast with a gradual improvement experienced in Sub-Saharan Africa. A household survey
carried out in 20062 found that the incidence o f poverty nationally was 62 percent, with rural
areas accounting for the majority o f the poor (74 percent versus 37 percent inurbanareas). There
were also significant variances among regions, with a relatively low level in the LomC area
(about 25 percent) and a very high incidence inthe northern region of Savanes (over 90 percent).


  The survey was conductedby the Togo Government's General Statistics Department, funded in part by IDA and
other donors (UNDP, UNICEFandUNFPA).


                                                  2

While some progress has been achieved toward reaching the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), notably for the goal of universal primary education and promoting gender equality,
most o f the goals are unlikely to be met by 2015.3 Specifically, Togo will not be able to achieve
the goals of halving extremepoverty and hunger, nor the goals of access to improved water and
sanitation facilities and reduced maternal and infant mortality. Progress on reducing prevalence
o f diseases was unclear: while the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among the adult population was
estimated at 3.2 percent in 2005 (down from its 1999 level), evaluation o f progress on other
diseases, notably malaria and tuberculosis, was difficult due to inadequate data.

2.4     Togo reached a major milestone with considered free and fair legislative elections
held in October 2007. After the death in 2005 o f PresidentEyadCmaGnassingbC, who led Togo
for 38 years, Togo undertook a national reconciliation process that culminated in multiparty
parliamentary elections on October 14, 2007. International observers considered the elections,
which led to the formation o f a new government, to have been free and transparent. InSeptember
2008, a new Prime Ministerwas appointed and the cabinet was reshuffled. The new cabinet, like
its predecessor, is reform-oriented and politically inclusive, including Ministers from opposition
parties and civil society.

2.5     In 2006, the Togolese authorities launched an ambitious economic reform program,
initially supported by an IMF Staff-Monitored Program. Performance under the SMP was
good: all quantitative targets were comfortably met and progress was made on governance-
related structural reforms. Administrative reforms initiated by the new tax and customs directors
appointed inMay 2006 helpedbroaden the tax base and recover arrears, boosting fiscal revenues
from 15%percent o f GDP in 2005 to 17percent in 2007. Despite election pressures and new
outlays to address the energy crisis, expenditures were kept somewhat below the target. As a
result, the primary fiscal position for 2007 was broadly balanced, compared to a 2006 primary
deficit o f 1percent o f GDP, allowing a net reduction indomestic arrears.

2.6     Togo's progress toward political stability and improved economic performance
paved the way for reengagement with the international community. Togo has so far cleared
or reached understandings on the clearance o f 96 percent o f its external arrears, including with
IDA, the African Development Bank, the European Union, the European Investment Bank, and
the Paris Club. Inmid-April2008, the IMFBoardapproved the PRGF-supported programwhose
implementation commenced on January 1, 2008. During a Roundtable meeting in Brussels on
September 18 and 19, 2008, donors pledgedto step up their assistance significantly to help Togo
implement its I-PRSP and forthcoming PRSP (expected in the first half o f 2009) and address
urgent spendingpriorities.

2.7     Significant progress has been made in strengthening governance under the IMF-
and IDA-supported programs during 2006-08. The Togolese authorities have implemented a
wide range o fpublic financial management reforms, including the phasing out of payment orders
without budget line identification. A new mechanism for monthly monitoring o f budget


  The assessment was undertakenby the Government of Togo with support of the UNDP. The report, titled "Suivi
des Object$ du Millenaire pour le Developpement au Togo- Deuxieme Rapport - Octobre 2008" ("Monitoring o f
the MDGsinTogo-SecondReport-October 2008"), was validatedbythe government inDecember2008.

execution has been made fully operational, significantly shortening the time lag for analyzing
fiscal data and providing policymakers with the ability to make timely and informed spending
decisions. A new General Inspectorate o f Finance has beenset up to conduct ex-post inspections
o f agencies that handle public resources. Following an external audit o f Togo's large domestic
arrears, the authorities are finalizing a strategy for clearing these arrears. Also, an action plan for
public procurement reforms i s under preparation. Two financial audits o f the state-owned cotton
company, a strategic audit o f the sector, clearance o f the cotton company's arrears to farmers as
well as strengthened internal controls and cost savings, have strengthened the cotton sector
management and paved the way for broader sector reform. The authorities have prepared a
strategy to strengthen Togo's fragile state-owned banks and placed the largest bank under new
management and oversight. The authorities have also established a Board o f Directors for the
electricity utility, adopted new statutes harmonized with WAEMU corporate law and appointed a
new general manager. It is too early to assess the outcome of some of these actions against the
targeted outcomes o f the ERGG since some o f the data i s not yet a~ailable.~For data that are
available, the envisioned outcomes have been achieved in two instances-Togo                        no longer
accumulates arrears to multilateral creditors, and the net worths o f two banks are at the WAEMU
8 percent prudential norm. A third outcome, the level o f cotton seed production during 2008-09
was not achieved due to climatic shocks (late rains in some regions, severe flooding in others)
that reduced production to half the target amount. In absence o f the climatic shocks, cotton
productionwould have surpassedthe target indicated inthe ERGGProgram Document.

2.8      Despite the progress achieved, Togo continues to face daunting institutional and
economic challenges. Togo's economic growth record is among the worst in the region,
reflecting a combination o f factors including: (i)poor governance and low administrative
capacity, after a long period o f sociopolitical conflict, mismanagement o f public resources, and
lack o f foreign assistance; (ii)excessive external public debt and domestic arrears; (iii)
undercapitalized state-owned banks, with the highest nonperforming loan ratio inthe WAEMU
area; (iv) a severe energy crisis, resultinginfrequent power outages; (v) loss-making state-owned
cotton and phosphate enterprises; (vi) a poor business environment; and (vii) deteriorated social
conditions. Having reached its HIPC decision point in November 2008, Togo i s now on a path
toward reducing its debt burden and freeing up fiscal space over time. The HIPC process would
enable Togo's external public debt to decline from 396 percent o f revenues in2007 to 65 percent
after the completion point. The decision point also opens the door to new multilateral and
bilateral resources, critical to finance Togo's poverty reduction strategy. To revive the economy
and reduce poverty, the Togolese authorities are seeking to consolidate macroeconomic stability
and advance priority structural reforms, while securing stepped-up technical and financial
assistancefrom development partners.


                                   RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

2.9      Togo's economy has been severely affected by the surge in global food and fuel
prices as well as heavy flooding in the summer of 2008. As a result, the economic recovery
underway since 2006, slowed in 2007 and 2008. Real GDP grew by about 4 percent in 2006 (up

from an average 1.8 percent annually during 2004-5) (see Table 2.1). A buoyant services sector
benefiting from growing regional trade and a moderate increase inphosphate exports (owing to
the international phosphate price boom) offset the dramatic decline (by over 50 percent) in the
export of cotton fiber. The recovery continued in 2007, thanks to an improved political climate
and a modest rebound in cotton production, but flooding inthe North of the country during the
fall of 2007 hurt local agriculture and electricity supply shortages constrained overall economic
activity, resulting in a slowing o f GDP growth to about 2 percent in 2007. Export growth was
sluggishin 2007 partly reflecting the energy situation, while imports increased due to higher oil
prices. This resulted in an external current account deficit (including grants) o f 6.4 in2007, from
6.6 percent o f GDP in 2006. In 2008, due to continued increases in food and fuel prices
combined with severe disruptions caused by heavy flooding in early August 20085, real GDP
growth i s projected to bejust 0.8 percent, while the current account deficit is projected to widen
slightly to 7 percent o f GDP. Indeed, Togo was among the economies most adversely affected by
the global price shocks (whose impact on the balance of payments i s estimated at nearly 6
percent o f GDP) reflecting its high fuel imports owing to its role as a regional transport hub,
reliance on diesel-based electricity generation and the high energy intensity o f its phosphate
industry. This impact was compounded by the August flooding which alone resulted in an
estimatedexport loss o f 3 percent o f GDP.

2.10     Prudent regional monetary policies muted inflationin 2007 but were overtakenin
importancein 2008 by the effects of globalprice shocks. Togo's monetary policy, set by the
regional monetary authority, i s consistent with its fiscal policies and with maintaining monetary
and price stability. Following broad money growth o f 22.1 percent in2006 spurred by a surge in
remittances and trade-related capital inflows inthe wake o f the improved political climate, broad
money grew by 18.2 percent in 2007. While these inflows boosted net foreign assets in the
bankingsystem, they translated only marginallyinto higher domestic credit. As a result, inflation
was subdued, falling to 1 percent in 2007 from 6.8 percent in 2005 and 2.2 percent in 2006, as
food prices moderated due to improved agricultural supply conditions in neighboring countries.
In2008, broad money growth is projectedto be only 10percent; nonetheless, due to higher food
and fuel prices and the highfuel import cost component of Togo's transport, industry, andpower
sectors, inflation inTogo i s projectedto reach 8.4 percent in2008.

2.11     The Government's policy response to the global price shocks has focused on
mitigating their economic and social impact. While Togo is nearly self-sufficient in food
production, surging food prices created social tensions in the first half o f 2008 and severely
eroded real incomes, particularly for urban dwellers. The government response has been to clear
wage and pension arrears, introduce temporary wage supplementsto public employees, increase
the minimum wage, sell grain reserves, and introduce a modest fertilizer subsidy while
eschewing price controls andtax exemptions.

shocks, inlinewith itsaimto maintaina balancedprimaryfiscal position.The primaryfiscal

position in 2007 attained a slight surplus o f 0.2 percent o f GDP, following a 1.1percent o f GDP
deficit in 2006 (Table 2.2). Togo maintained a good revenue performance into 2007, with tax
revenues estimated at 17 percent. Expenditure management was prudent in 2007 despite pre-
election pressures: expenditures were somewhat lower than the program target, continuing the
trend in the second half o f 2006 of tightened expenditures resulting from a curtailment of off-
budget operations. For the first halfo f2008, the Togolese authorities kepta tight lidon spending,
due to emphasis on fiscal discipline, sharply reduced recourse to accelerated spending
procedures, and slow implementation o f domestic investment projects. This resulted in a large
primary fiscal surplus in the first half of the year, exceeding the target by a wide margin, and
substantial accumulation o f government deposits. The price and flood shocks are projected to
reduce tax revenues by about ?4percent o f GDP in 2008 and require additional spending o f 1%
percent o f GDP, largely due to emergency flood repairs but also reflecting the economic and
social measures (paragraph 2.11). The modest fiscal loosening is estimated not to have affected
inflation significantly, as wages remained contained, spending was partly on imports, and
economic activity was well below capacity. The projectedresulting outcome was a primary fiscal
balance for 2008 o f 0.5 percent o f GDP, while the overall balance (payment order basis) is
projectedto be minus 1.3 percent o f GDP.

2.13     As a result of the broadly satisfactory economic performance despite a difficult
international environment and exogenous shocks in 2008, in September 2008 the IMF Board

                    MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                                        OUTLOOK

2.14    The medium-termmacroeconomicoutlookis based on the assumption of a recovery
after several years of political and economic crisis as donors reengage and confidence
returns, but the ongoing global financial crisis and slowdown pose significantnew risks to
macroeconomic stability and growth. A modest rebound in 2009-10 following several
international and domestic shocks in 2008 would be facilitated by a large terms o f trade gain in
2009 (over 20 percent) but will also depend critically on a quick resumption o f donor-financed
public investment offsetting the drag on growth expected from the global slowdown. The impact
o f global economic conditions i s uncertain and poses the risk o f further hampering recovery: so
far, the global financial crisis has reduced Togo's real GDP growth from the original projection
under the PRGF o f 4 percent to the current 2 percent projection. A further economic revival will
require improved business confidence, growing regional trade, and a rebound in cotton and
phosphate production after the collapse o f recent years. Over the medium-term, growth would be
sustained by higher foreign direct investment (e.g. in banking, telecoms and phosphate sectors,
and the port), improved financial intermediationand upgrades to public infrastructure, especially
electricity which would alleviate bottlenecks that previously stymied private sector growth.
Togo's medium-term growth potential largely relies on its comparative advantage as a transit
corridor to neighboring countries and its deep port facilities at LomC, its past reputation as a
strong regional financial center and its potential to further develop services around these
activities.

2.15    Despite the recent price shocks, inflation is expected to be contained, if not
restrained, over the medium term, anchored in the WAEMU currency union and fiscal
prudence consistent with the regional monetary policy stance. The regional monetary-
exchange arrangement is expected to ensure monetary and price stability (with inflation at about
2-3 percent in the medium-term). Nonetheless, inflation could be erratic in case o f unfavorable
weather conditions (droughts or the recent heavy floods) or further volatility in world food and
oil prices.

2.16    Externalconditions are likely to remainvery challengingin the medium-term. The
first-round impact o f the global financial crisis i s expected to be moderate. Lower oil prices are
projected to offset, by a wide margin, weaker export prices and demand. Furthermore, Togo's
banks are not directly exposed to risk o f global contagion, and may not face significant risk o f
reduction in interest from potential strategic partners given that the latter are regional banks
which have been relatively less affected by the financial crisis. Nonetheless, Togo's current
account deficit i s expected to remain high, with imports projected to increase as foreign aid i s
absorbed and FDI picks up. The balance o f payments will stay vulnerable to terms o f trade
shocks (in particular from oil prices), further exchange rate volatility o f the Euro (to which
Togo's currency value i s fixed) vis-&vis the U S dollar and confidence shocks that could lower
remittances and FDI. Export revenues are expected to increase over the medium term despite
weaker global growth and demand, largely on account o f the expected recovery o f Togo's
phosphate sector from its current low base. The recent rise in the value o f the US dollar also
contributes to the increase in export revenues, offsetting any declines in export commodity
prices. Long-term export growth will remain somewhat constrained by limited competitiveness
and Togo's poor business environment. External financing is expected to come primarily from


                                                  9

debt relief and a recovery in FDI flows. However, heightened risk aversion and tightening
liquidity inthe West African Economic andMonetary Union as a result ofthe financial crisis and
global slowdown could reduce the scope for raising funds regionally, particularly for the budget.
Also, possible reductions in aid budgets inmajor developed economies would have a significant
fiscal impact, and a deep and protracted global slowdown would likely reduce foreign direct and
portfolio investment - the effects are difficult to quantify but, for example, the prospects for
bringingstrategic investors inthe phosphates and cotton sectorsmay diminish.

2.17      As the global financial crisis is set to impact the real economy, the 2009 budget may
make room for a slightly more expansionary fiscal stance. This results both from lower than
previously anticipated revenues collection and higher capital spendingto catch-up with delays in
projects, while implementing a reallocation o f spending to priority sectors and the domestic
 arrears clearance strategy. Togo's fiscal policy aims to be consistent the WAEMU monetary and
 exchange rate policies, and i s projected to contribute to price stability. The envisaged small
primary fiscal deficit would be a step toward a sustainable medium-term fiscal position in which
 domestic revenues broadly ,cover domestic spending and arrears clearance. The tax to GDP ratio
 i s projected to be % o f a percentage point o f GDP higher compared to 2008, as corporate tax
 losses (resulting from the economic downturn and the reduction inthe profit tax rate) are more
than offset by ongoing administrationreforms, reduction ofexemptions, and increases inalcohol
and tobacco excise taxes. A reduction o f untargeted nonwage spending will create room for
higher social and flood-related infrastructure spending, bank and enterprise restructuring and
domestic arrears clearance. The budget includes higher foreign-financed project spending as
Togo resumes full cooperation with development partnersand implements the I-PRSP. The wage
bill, though projected to rise modestly after a decade-long salary freeze, should remain in line
withthe WAEMUconvergence criterion6.

2.18       The total external financing needs for 2009-2010 are projected to widen due to the
 price and flood shocks, by about 2.7 percentage points o f GDP in 2009 compared to initial
projections. The gap i s expected to be covered by a drawdown in reserves, higher transfers and
additional external support from creditors and donors. As indicated above, inview o f the sizable
resources needed in 2009, the IMF Board approved an augmentation o f the PRGF o f SDR 18.34
 (equivalent to 25 percent o f quota, US$30.1 million, and 0.5 percent o f GDP), disbursable in
equal tranches at conclusion o fthe first (September 2008) and second reviews (April 2009).7

2.19      The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed
operation. The government has generally demonstrated a satisfactory track record inmaintaining
prudent macroeconomic policies that are sustainable over the medium term. The framework is
supported by an IMF PRGF program which has been on-track since the three-year arrangement
was approved inApril 2008. The second review o f the program i s expected to be presented to the
Fund's Board inApril 2009.




~         ~~




   The convergencecriterion is that the wage bill shouldbe less than or equalto 35 percentof fiscal revenues.
   The original PRGFamount was SDR 66.06 million (US$108.4 millionequivalent), approvedby the IMF Board in
mid-April 2008.

2.20     Togo is in debt distress with large external arrears and an unsustaina
debt, as indicated by the large proportion of its debt that was recently inarrears8Togo's external
public and publicly guaranteed debt including arrears, at the end of 2007, was estimated at
US$2.2 billion innominal terms, or 79.2 percent of GDP at end-2007. Ofthis, the bulk was owed
to IDA and Paris Club creditors, about US$0.8 billion and US$O.9billion, respectively. Togo's
debt to other creditors was relatively modest incomparison: US$149millionto the ADB Group,
US$214 million to other multilateral creditors and US$116 million to non-Paris Club creditors
(Figure 2.1). External arrears were US$O.8 billion, or about 32 percent of GDP at end-2007. At
that point, arrears to Paris Club creditors were 24 percent of GDP, to IDA 8 percent of GDP, and
to the AfDB Group 0.5 percent of GDP. Togo had no arrearsto the IMF and arrears to non-Paris
Club creditors accountedfor only a very small share. The most recent estimate of Togo's debt to
commercial creditors as of end-2007 is US$33 million.

2.21     Togo reached its HIPC decision point on November 25, 2008 after establishing a six
month track record of reform under the PRGF andreaching agreement with Bank and Fund staffs
on completion point triggers. Directors agreedthat Togo qualifies for debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative's "fiscal window" based on end-2007 data; the common reduction factor is an




*This assessment is based on the data that has been reconciled in collaboration with the IMF in preparation for the
HIPC Decision Point Document (IDA Board Document No. IDA/R2008-0302), submittedto the Boards of the IMF
and World Bank inNovember 2008.

estimated 19 percent.' After full application o f traditional debt relief mechanisms, Togo's NPV
of debt is estimated at 309 percent of fiscal revenues, which is above the HIPC Initiative
threshold." The required debt relief needed to bring this ratio down to the 250 percent HIPC
threshold is estimated at US$270 million inend-2007 NPV terms. Based on proportional burden
sharing, multilateral assistance would amount to US$150 million, and bilateral and commercial
assistance to US$120 million (both inNPV terms).

2.22     So far, 47 percent of HIPC debt relief has been delivered through multilateral
arrears clearance and the cancellation of loans by China. IDA and ADB have already
deliveredtheir full share o fHIPC assistancethrough arrears clearance operations inMay and July
2008, respectively. Overall, creditors amounting to around 90 percent o f total HIPC debt relief to
be provided inNPV terms have indicatedtheir willingnessto provide debt relief under the HIPC
initiative to Togo. Because Togo was not servicing its debt to most o f its creditors inthe recent
past, HIPC relief would not immediately create additional fiscal space. However, the resolution
o f arrears gives Togo access to additional development assistance, helping it make progress
towards the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs).Uponreaching its HIPC completion point,
Togo would access Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) relief o f about US$404 million in
NPV terms, reflecting cancellation o f pre-2003 debt to IDA and pre-2004 debt to the African
Development Fund. MDRI i s expected to reduce debt to well below the HIPC threshold, mainly
reflecting cancelation o f debt to IDA.


                         3. THE GOVERNMENT'SREFORMPROGRAM

3.1      The GovernmentadopteditsInterimPovertyReductionStrategyPaper (I-PRSP) in
March 2008." The I-PRSP was prepared in two phases which were both inclusive, involving
government and civil society organizations. Donors engaged at the beginningo fthe second phase
(August 2006) during which they played an important role in advising the Togolese authorities
and helpingto carry out a number o f quantitative and qualitative poverty surveys. Inthe second
phase o f preparing the I-PRSP, emphasis was placed on identifyingpriority measures, notably in
the areas o fpublic financial management andgovernance ofkeypublic enterprises andbanks.

3.2      The I-PRSP sets out an ambitious poverty reduction strategy to revive economic
growth and improve basic living conditions. It is defined along three strategic pillars:
(i) strengtheningpolitical and economic governance, with a focus on institutional reforms and
fiscal   governance; (ii)promoting economic recovery and sustainable development, with


  InApril 1997, the fiscal revenues/openness criterion was establishedto allow for the possibility that, for countries
with a high export base, reachingthe debt-to-export criteria targets may still leave the country with a large external
debt burdenrelative to fiscal revenues. Inorder to qualify for debt relief under the revenuewindow, a country must
have its NPV/revenueratio above 250 percent. In addition, to be eligible to access under this window, the country
must have an export-to-GDP ratio of at least 30 percent, and a fiscal revenues-to-GDPratio of at least 15 percent,
using an average of the last three years of actual data (see "Modifications to the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative", July 23, 1999 IDA/SecM99-475 and EBS/99/138). For 2005-2007, Togo's average export-to-
GDPratio was 42 percentand its averagerevenueto GDP ratio was 17 percent.
lo Togo does not qualify for the export window of the HIPC initiative since its NPV of debt-to-exports ratio as of
end-2007was 149percent.
I' The I-PRSPandthe Joint IMF-WorldBank StaffAdvisory Note were discussedby the IDA Board inMay 2008.

measures to reform state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, improve the business
environment,     strengthen regional integration and trade, revive agricultural production,
rehabilitate infrastructure, and improve management o f natural resources and the environment;
and (iii) developing social sectors, humanresources and employment, with a focus on improving
accessto and the quality o f basic education and health services. The I-PRSP presents the ongoing
policy reforms, which remain a priority inthe near term, and outlines an expanded reform agenda
going forward.

3.3     The authoritiesare preparing the full PRSP, to be available inthe first half of2009,
in order to update the strategy to address the country's development needs and challenges. The
PRSP is being preparedwith broad stakeholder participation and clear prioritization o f reforms.
Given Togo's capacity and financing constraints, a critical challenge will be to secure sufficient
support from development partners for its implementation o fthe PRSP.

3.4     All three phases of preparation of the full PRSP (planning, diagnostic and strategy
finalization phases) are open to participation by all stakeholders. First for the planning
phase, four consultations were organized at the national level (the first with public servants, the
second with the private sector, the third with civil society and the fourth with the donors), and
consultations were held in each o f the five regions comprising all stakeholders including local
government representative. These national and regional consultations provided inputs for the
revised planning document reviewed and adopted at the National Forum to launch the
preparation o f the full PRSP. Second, for the diagnostic phase, thematic groups to oversee
drafting o f respective sections o f the PRSP were established with participation open to all
stakeholders. Additionally, civil society and the private sector were requested to prepare
independent think pieces comprising their concerns andproposed solutions, with the civil society
contribution to take into account feedback from community level groups as well as regional
specificities. Third, for the strategy finalization phase, upon availability o f the draft full PRSP
prepared by a core team, regional consultations will be held to discuss the draft strategy and
obtain feedback from the stakeholders to finalize the document, to ensure that the final strategy
truly reflects the aspirations o fthe population.

3.5     The Government has identified economic governance and transparency reforms as
critical elements for the country's economic and social recovery and for stability and
stronger growth in the sub-region. The previous section presented the Government's
objectives and planned actions to restore fiscal and debt sustainability. Under the second I-PRSP
pillar,the Government intendsto advance reforms to improve budgetformulation, execution and
controls, and public procurement. The third pillar includes reforms inthe key phosphate, cotton,
financial and energy sectors to restore economic activity to existing capacity levels. The next
paragraphs highlight the salient features o f the current situation in these areas o f reform as well
as the Government's main areas o f policy efforts and specific measures supported by the
proposed grant. The Government's Letter o f Development Policy attached in Annex 2 and its
policy matrix in Annex 3 detail the authorities' program o f reforms with specific activities in
eachreform area.

                                 PUBLIC FINANCIALMANAGEMENT

Currentissues

3.6     Building on recent public expenditure management reforms will be important to
improveefficiency and transparency of expenditures and support policy fundamentals for
economic recovery.Togo has established a track record on fiscal management and accounting
reforms since mid-2006 under the IMF Staff Monitored Program, the IMF Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility, and the IDA-financed Economic Recovery and Governance Grant. As a result,
Togo's public expenditure management has improved significantly from a situation o f distorted
budget cycle, expenditure execution problems, inadequate Treasury management, and poor
internal and external budget controls. Recent achievements include: (i)     timely submission o f the
draft 2008 budget; (ii)  introduction o f a monthly dashboard for monitoringbudgetexecution; (iii)
introduction in the 2008 budget o f a line item to cover force majeure expenditures (national
catastrophe, etc.) to enhance transparency o f public expenditures; (iv) elimination o f the use o f
exceptional payment authorizations without ex-ante budget line identification (ordres de
paiement sans te'le'gramme lettre), except for the servicing o f external debt; (v) clearance o f
arrears with IDA and the African Development Bank; and (vi) adoption o f an action plan for
public procurement reforms based on the 2003 CPAR.

3.7     Continued strengthening of public expenditure management is                   one of the
Government's key priorities. The Government recognizes the importance o f addressing the
outstanding public expenditure management challenges noted in the recently completed draft
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR). These
include the need to: (i)achieve full compliance with the statutory budget calendar to ensure
sufficient review o f the budget by the National Assembly prior to its approval; (ii)  integrate the
investment and operating budgets; (iii) align the composition of expenditures with the
                                            better
initially approved budgets and with the priorities o f the country's poverty reduction strategy; (iv)
increase the share o f spending o f priority sectors; (v) improve the budget information
management system through computerization; (vi) disseminate information on the budget and its
execution, as well as improve the quality and coverage o f such information; (vii) reduce the level
o ftransfers and subsidies to internationally comparable norms, inorder to expand the fiscal space
available for priority expenditures; (viii) make operational the Court o f Accounts by appointing
judges and providing the training, equipment and materials requiredto perform their duties; and
(ix) strengthen the internalaudit andinspectionunit.

3.8     Inthe area of public procurement,the major weaknesses identifiedby the PEMFAR
are as follows: (i) legal and regulatory framework in force does not permit strict observance
                    the
o f the fundamental principles o f transparency, equity o f treatment, and economy applicable to
public procurement, andmore specifically encourages the use o fnon-competitive and sole source
methods; (ii)  the current institutional framework is ineffective and the national tender board
(CNM) has too broad a role, combining the regulatory and control functions, and inadequate
capacity; and (iii)the audits, internal and external controls, and anti-corruption measures are non-
existent or ineffective, and none o fthe procurement related informationi s disseminated.

The Government'sreformprogram

3.9     In response to the above weaknesses, the Government has had public expenditure
management reforms under implementation since 2006 targeting a return to the normal
budget cycle, improvements inthe execution of expenditures, and the strengtheningo f financial
management practices and regularpreparation o fbudgetexecution reports. The following actions
illustratethe scope o frecent actions taken or ongoing by the authorities:

    e   the Government has satisfactorily implemented the 2008 budget and ensured a normal
        budgetary cycle with the submission o f a draft 2009 budget to the National Assembly
        before the end o f the 2008 fiscal year;

    e   adopted and i s implementing for the 2009 budget afunctional classification of public
        expenditures,which also allows for monitoring o fpoverty reduction expenditures;

    e   inadditionto the monthly instrument(dashboard) to monitoring of budget execution,the
        Government has initiated reports on budgetexecution that are disseminated to the press;

    e   the SIGFIP integrated budget execution information system is being implemented in
        the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, to enhance efficacy and transparency o f budget
        execution;

    e   strengthened treasury and cash management by re-organizing and strengthening the
         Treasury in line with the WAEMU Directive, including the creation o f a General
        Payments Office (Paierie ge'ne'rale),a General Revenue Office (Recette ge'ne'rale)and a
        Treasury Central Accounting Agency (TCAA) and nomination o f their respective
        directors inDecember 2008, as well as introducing short-term treasury bill auctions;

    0   the Government created and staffed a newinternal audit and inspection unit (Inspection
        Gkne'raledes Finances, General Finance Inspectorate) under the direct responsibility o f
        the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, and nominated the Inspector General in August
        2008;

    e   to restore supplier confidence, the authorities adopted in December 2008 a strategy to
        clear the Government's domestic arrears covering all overdue claims by private
        suppliersthat have beenverified by the 2007 KPMG audit and its subsequent update, and
        validated by the government. The arrears amountingto less thanCFAF 5 million are to be
        paid in 2009, while other arrears will be converted into tradable government securities,
        withpayments startingin2009.

3.10    In addition to the above measures, the Government is taking steps for addressing
urgent issues in the procurement system. In May 2008, it re-established the National
Committee for Coordination and Monitoring o f Procurement Reforms (CNCS), which includes
the representatives from the private and the public sectors and the civil society; inJune 2008 the
authorities adopted a communication for updating, with the technical and financial support o f
external partners, the CPAR action planthrough a re-assessment (the ongoing 2008 PEMFAR) o f
the procurement system using (i)the OECDDAC Baseline Indicators (BLI) Methodology and

(ii) WAEMU's ProcurementDirectives.l2Theauthoritiesalsostartedsensitizingalltheline
   the
ministries about the need to comply with the current procurement code by submittingany draft
contracts to the committee responsible for clearing these documents (CERPM). This will allow
the CERPM to ensure quality and conformity o f contracts, and also to publish accurate and
comprehensive information about contract awards. Furthermore, the following steps have been
taken by the authorities:

       transmittal to the National Assembly o f the draft procurement law drafted in conformity
       withthe WAEMUProcurement Directives;

   e    submittal for the approval o f Council o f Ministers a draft decree for revisingthe threshold
        for shopping from US$200,000 to US$50,000 and confirming the national competitive
       biddingthreshold at US$50,000;

   e    agreement to publish the list o f contracts awarded in the bi-weekly gazette (Le Secteur
       Prive? o fthe Chamber o f Commerce and Industryo f Togo (CCIT).

3.11 During 2009-10, the Government plans to adopt additional actions to further strengthen
public financial management, notably:

       beginimplementinga mechanism to track public expenditures for poverty reduction on
       the basis o f a functional expenditure classification and publication o f reports on these
        expenditures;

        develop a medium term expenditure framework during 2009 in priority ministries
        (Education and Health) to accompany the draft 2010 budget so as to ensure that priorities
        inthe PRSPinthese sectorsare adequately reflectedinthe budget;

        extend to the Treasury the implementation o f the accounting module of the SIGFIP
        integrated budget execution information system, to strengthen the efficacy and
       transparency o fbudget execution;

       provide training for internal control staff on risk-based financial control procedures,
        adopt and implement a procedures manual for the General Finance Inspectorate and
        implement programmedmissions inits work program;

       render operational the Court of Accounts by appointing its judges intime for the review

        under a single unit charged with all public debt and publication o f annual reports
        providing accurate and complete data on external and domestic public debt.

3.12    During 2009-10, the Government also plans to adopt additional actions to further
strengthen the public procurement system. Duringthe preparation o fthe PEMFAR report, the
Government agreed to base the procurement reform on a medium and long term vision which
will contribute to improve transparency and efficiency o f the system in line with the WAEMU
Procurement Directives and international good practices. The strategy will be articulated around
the following agenda: (i)  establishment o f a new legal and regulatory procurement framework
(Law and Code) to achieve the agreed international standards and comply with regional
obligations (WAEMU); (ii)     establishment o f the new institutional procurement framework, for
ensuring effective independent and internal controls; (iii) development and implementation o f a
capacity development strategy o f all the key actors from the public and private sectors and civil
society, for ensuring the efficiency o f procurement transactions (this will include training,
information system for management, monitoring & evaluation o f procurement transactions); and
(iv) implementation of regular procurement audits, public dissemination o f the audit findings,
and enforcement o f sanctions against fraudulent and corrupt procurement behavior. Specific
actions plannedby the Government include:


    0   a roadmap to implement the Information Management System for Public Procurement
        (SIGMAP) and connect it to the SIGFIP systembeing established;

    0   an updated action plan for public procurement reform, designed in conformity with the
        OECD/DAC benchmarks and the WAEMUProcurement Directives;

    0   dissemination, no later than March 2009, o f the conclusions and recommendations o f the
        PEMFAR update report, including the updated action plan for public procurement
        reform, through a national workshop scheduled inMarch 2009;

        Procurement Regulatory Authority) for the regulation and oversight o f public
        procurement, appoint its key officials, and approve its operating budget (by June 2009);

    0   publication o f the texts on the establishment and organization o f the entity (Public

3.13     The above efforts are complemented by Government measures to increase revenue
collection. The Government's recent reforms have yielded additional revenues increases.
Building on the gains achieved since 2006, the Government is planning a broad set o f
administrative reforms, including better targeting o f inspections and simplified procedures for
taxpayers. The authorities are also considering further tax harmonization with the other WAEMU
countries, and they have stepped up tax audits to control the abuse o f tax exemptions. Over the
medium term, the authorities plan to (i)strengthen human resources through training and
recruitment o f qualified personnel; (ii)      further computerize the tax administration; (iii)        move
toward more selective, risk-based ex-ante and ex-post tax audits; (iv) strengthen control o f the
Export Processing Zone by activating the SYDONIA++ module recording goods and services in
and out from the Zone and,updating the law regulating the Zone to provide the audit unit o f the
tax and customs administrations with the authority to perform inspections; (v) update the tax
code to streamline and reduce tax and customs exemptions as well as increase alcohol and
tobacco excises; (vi) update the customs code; and (vii) introduce a computerized, double
accounting system at all levels o frevenueadministration.


Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-2 and follow-up reforms

3.14     The proposed ERGG-2 would support five policy actions critical to deepening PFM
reforms and aimed at facilitating the normal budget cycle, improving budget execution and
strengtheningaudit and control functions. The first is makingpublic the 2008 budget execution
report, and submission o f a draft 2009 budget to the National Assembly before the end o f the
2008 fiscal year in line with the I-PRSP priorities. The second is the finalization o f the
organization o f the Treasury inline with the WAEMU Directive, as evidenced by the creation o f
a General Payment Office (Paierie g&n&raZe),a General Revenue Office (Recettege`ne`rale) and a
Treasury Central Accounting Agency (TCAA). The third set o f measures i s to create and staff the
General Finance Inspectorate under the direct responsibility o f the Minister o f Economy and
Finance, and nominate the Inspector General. The proposed ERGG-2 would also support two
policy actions critical to deepening public procurement reforms. The first is the transmittal to the
National Assembly o f the draft procurement law consistent with the WAEMU Directives. The
second is the publication o f a summary o f procurement contracts for 2008 in the bi-weekly
journal "L'Entrepreneur" publishedby the Togo Chamber o f Commerce and Industry.

3.15     After this operation, a possible follow on DPO could support the next stage in the
Government's PFM reform program. Policy measures that will be considered for this follow
on operation would be: (i)     makingpublic quarterlyreports on execution of the 2009 budget, and
submitting a draft 2010 budget to the National Assembly with a medium term expenditure
framework (MTEF) for two priority ministries (education and health); l3 making      (ii) available75
percent o f the credit line for poverty reduction activities, upon authorization o f expendituresfor
the priority ministries o f education, health, agriculture, water supply, infrastructure and public
works, 90 percent by mid-year, and the final 10 percent by end year subject to verification that
the budget is fully financed; (iii)extending implementation o f the accounting phase o f the

SIGFIP information system to the Treasury Department; (iv) adopting and implementing a
procedures manual for the Court o f Accounts, and adopting and implementing a procedures
manual for the General Finance Inspectorate; (v) establish a General Procurement Department
and make it operational as evidenced by appointment o f key staff and provision o f adequate
budget; and (vi) establish, staff and provide adequate budget for ex-post procurement audit
departments (Sewice de contr6le des marche's publics - SCMP) in at least five (5) priority
ministries and the Lome municipal office.

3.16    Other critical PFM actions have been identified as HIPC completion triggers, aimed
at further enhancing transparency in budget formulation and budget controls, including on
poverty-reducing expenditures. Specifically, these are: (i)adoption o f a mechanism to track
public expenditures for poverty reduction on the basis o f a functional expenditure classification
and publication of at least two quarterly reports on these expenditures covering a period of at
least two consecutive quarters precedingthe completion point; (ii)   appointment ofjudges for the
Court o f Accounts, provided with work space, equipment and materials, and submission o f the
draft Budget Execution law and draft General Treasury Balance to the Court of Accounts and
Parliament for at least one fiscal year preceding the completion point; (iii)adoption o f a decree
creating the Procurement Regulatory Authority in conformity with the WAEMU Procurement
Directives, nomination of its managerial staff, and providing them with an adequate budget; and
monthlypublication in a public procurement gazette or on a government website of a summary
of all signed contracts, including sole source contracts and concessions, for at least six months
immediately preceding the completion point; (iv) consolidation o f external and domestic debt
data under a single unit charged with all public debt; and (v) publication of an annual report
providing accurate and complete data on external and domestic public debt, within six months
after the end o fthe year for at least one year immediately preceding the completion point.

                                       THEPHOSPHATE    SECTOR

Current issues
3.17    The phosphate sector faces related problems of weak sector governance resulting in
reduction in operating capacity and weak sector performance. Togo i s amongthe five largest
producers o fphosphates inAfrica. The exploitation o fphosphate i s an importanteconomic sector
for Togo. There are two phosphate deposits under current exploitation by the single phosphate
mining company, the state owned Socie'te' Nouvelle des Phosphates du Togo (SNPT). These are
located respectively at Hahotoe (north site) and Kpogamk (south site), some 40 km from Lome.
Once mined, the mineral is transported by train on a 46km railway system owned by SNPT to the
ore treatment plant located in Kpeme. In 1991, the plant was operating at a capacity of 10,000-
12,000 metric tons a day (tpd). The daily production o f phosphate decreased to 3,000 tons in
2008. Most striking with the phosphate industry o f Togo is the state of the equipment, which i s
fairly old, dating as far back as the 1960s. The mineral port inKpCmC, whose location is adjacent
to the plant, i s also ageing. The sector's weaknesses have led to a drop in the sector's share in
GDP, from 3 percent in2001 to 2 percent in2007, as well as inits share o f export earnings, from
13 percent in2001 to 5 percent in2007. Production was at its highest at 2.7 million metric tons
in 1996 and declined to about 1.2 million metric tons in 2006, and 0.75 million metric tons in
2007. Since the early 199Os, mine and plant output have continuously declined mainly due to the



                                                  19

lack o f adequate (modern) equipment, electricity shortages and weak management. This situation
also reflects the absence o f a clear vision, which i s needed for the efficient development o f the
sector. This i s deemed more necessary now thanever as the current operational context continues
to reflect rapid depletion o f easily accessible phosphate reserves in addition to changing
international market conditions. A more efficient management o f Togo's still significant reserve
potential (with its carbonated deposits that are expected to last another 100 years) would help
reverse this downward trend in the future. However, such mineral exploitation will require
significant investmentina different type o ftechnology.

3.18     A deepeningof institutionalchanges is required in order to strengthenthe sector's
management and development prospects. The 100 percent state-owned SNPT was created in
May 2007 in place o f the International Fertilizer Group Togo (IFG-TG), a 50-50 joint venture
between the Government and the French-Tunisian company Brifco, which was put in place in
2001 to replace the state-owned OfJice Togolais des Phosphates (OTP). The joint venture was
terminated in May 2007 following failure o f the international investor to meet its contractual
obligations in terms o f provision o f a strategic vision for the sector's development, technical
expertise or financial resources. IFG-TGaccumulated substantial losses due to weak governance
including absence o f financial records for several years. Inthe course o f liquidating IFG-TG, the
litigation to redress the breach o f contract was concluded. SNPT has since demonstrated a much
clearer vision and greatly improved management. Although it i s still too early to assess the extent
o f all positive effects, the sector experienced a slight increase in production to almost 850,000
tons in2008, up from the 750,000 tons o fphosphate rock levels recorded in2007.

The Government's reformprogram

3.19     Togo's phosphate sector potentialis still quite high and could be a major factor in
the country's short and medium-term economic recovery.The current phosphate production
originates from deposits which have been exploited for over 40 years. SNPT's medium term
program is to increase production levels to 3 million metric tons a year (tpa), a level on par with
experience in the 1960s. However, further increases in production levels would require
significant improvements in managerial, technological and technical capability. It would also
require that the Government place greater emphasis on strengthening social and humanresources
as well as environmental management skills to be able to compete effectively inan international
market in which major actors are few and technology is concentrated in the hands o f big
producers. Inthe short to mediumterm, a procedures manual i s planned for SNPT's operations
and an internal control system, based on recently completed organizational audits. The
Government also aims to modernize the sector's operational equipment in order to be able to
restore full production capacity o f 3 million tons and enhance competiti~eness.'~The
Government is pursuingdiscussions with several international companies that could facilitate the



l4 With the objective ofmodernizingthe sector, the Government fist opted for a Euro45 million infunding fiom the
Islamic Development bank (IsDB) for the purchase of equipment for SNPT. The IsDB-fundedproject would have
beenimplementedwith the technical assistanceof an experiencedstrategic partner who was also expectedto provide
additionalfmancing for the sector. However, the IsDB projecthas recently been dropped since the loanterms were
non-concessional.The Government is continuing discussions with IsDB to renegotiation the terms to concessional
levels.

sector's modernization, and intends to select a strategic partner in the medium term using
competitive biddingprocedures.

3.20    Over the medium to long-term, further development of the phosphate sector is
required for it to renew its potential as a growth pole for Togo. At Togo's target annual
production levels o f 3 millionmetric tons, depletion o fthe siliceous rock deposits would occur in
the next 7 years. Several studies have identified significant reserves o f carbonate deposits that
could last for another 100 years at the currently envisaged extraction rate. As with other major
African producers, Togo desires to add value to its phosphate production by moving into
downstream production activities. Indeed, the Government has made economic diversification a
key objective o f its mid-termeconomic recovery program. The production o f phosphoric acid, a
major intermediate fertilizer for agricultural use, would be beneficial to Togo, if tackled
efficiently. International prices for these derived products are remarkably much higher, and the
sales o f such products could derive substantive revenues for Togo. It would also offer an
opportunity for large-scale private investment inthe sector.

3.21    Restoration of good governance and development of a strategic vision will be
important for meeting the Government's sector objectives. To this end, the Government is
commissioning a strategic and financial audit o f operations in the phosphate sector expected to
be completed in May 2009. The audit, financed by the LICUS TF grant to Togo for Economic
Recovery and International Reengagement, will examine the strategic aspects o f the phosphate
sector inthe context o f the broader mining sector framework, the organization of the company,
the organization o f work and the state o f the facilities. The audit will also examine the economic,
technical, financial, social and environmental aspects o f the phosphate industry in Togo and
provide recommendations for a clear long-term strategy to promote sustainable development o f
the sector. The ultimate goal i s to improve internal controls, reduce production costs, establish as
well as enforce rules o f good governance and attract strategic investors. The Government aims to
adopt a phosphate sector strategy based on the recommendations o f the strategic and financial
audit.

3.22    To enhance sector transparency and governance, the Government also intends to
publishthe results of an audit of revenues generated from phosphate sales, reconciled with
revenues received by the public Treasury, consistent with EITI criteria. The audit exercise,
to commence with publication o f 2007'payments and revenues inearly 2009, will continue on an
annual basis covering data from successive years. The Government has taken initial steps for
membership in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), by attending a meeting in
Conakry, Guinea, on February 11-12 2008, which focused on the harmonization o f legal and tax
systems in the mining sector in West Africa. The Government i s also exploring partnership
linkages with other West African countries on a harmonized mining sector reform strategy.
Discussions have begun on the full adoption by Togo o f EITI principles, with aim for the
Government to commence the adherence process during 2009. This i s timely since several
prospectors have recently expressed interest and exploration permit acquisition is on the rise.
Adoption o f the EITI is deemed necessary to enable a well managed increase in private sector
activity inTogo's miningsector.

Prior actions underthe proposedERGG-2andfollow-up reforms

3.23     The proposed ERGG-2 would support one policy action judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the phosphate sector, namely (i)                  the publication o f the results of a
reconciliation o f the 2007 revenues generated from phosphate sales, with revenues received by
the public Treasury that year.

3.24     A possible follow on DPO could support the next stage in the Government's
phosphatesector reformprogram.Policy measuresthat will be considered for the DPO would
be: (i) establishment o f the institutional and legal framework for actual EITI implementation
        the
with the view to seek Candidate Status, as evidenced by (a) the creation of one or more
committees at the national level having a balanced representation o f sector stakeholders
(Extractive Industry, Government and Civil Society) and (b) the designation of a national
implementation coordinator; (ii)the adoption and publication o f a detailed and budgetized
Action Plan for activities to be undertakenin the context o f EITI-Togo; and (iii)           the publication
of the results o f a reconciliation of the 2008 revenues generated from phosphate sales, with
revenues received by the public Treasury that year.

 3.25    An additionalphosphate sector measure has been identifiedas a HIPC completion
 point trigger aimed at ensuringtransparency on financial flows inthe sector: implementationof
regular public reporting o f payments to, and revenues received by, the government for the
phosphates sector in line with this aspect o f the EITI criteria, with a recent annual report during
 at least the year immediately preceding the year inwhich the completionpoint is reached.

                                          THECOTTON        SECTOR
 Currentissues


 3.26    The cotton sector's share in the economy has fallen in recent years due to weak
 sector governance and performance.Cotton is the country's main cash crop: its share in GDP
was 4 percent in 2001 but declined to under 5 percent in 2007. The sector accounted for 17.5
percent of export earnings in 2001, but declined to 3.6 percent in 2007. Cotton is an important
 source o f income for about 200,000 people, or half of the rural labor force. The decline in cotton
productionwas the result of weak management and governance inthe sector, inaddition to lower
cotton international prices and reduced producer prices which were also affected by the
 appreciation o f the Euro (to which the CFAF i s pegged) to the U S dollar. The weak management
and governance of SOTOCO's (Socie`te` Togolaise de Coton), the state-owned cotton company,
reduced its efficiency relative to its competitors. In2004-05, for example, SOTOCO's costs were
25 CFAFkg higher than in Mali, Burkina Faso and Cameroun. Another major factor for the
decline in production was accumulation o f arrears by SOTOCO to the farmers during 2003-04
and 2004-05, which were only paidin2007. SOTOCO is the mainbuyer inthe market15and has
been in financial difficulties for several years. As with the phosphate sector, the cotton sector's
financial losses are a drain on the public treasury, and its non-performing loans to the banking

sector restrain the role o f the financial sector in Togo's economic growth. SOTOCO has
previously beena candidate for privatization, but no buyers offered to acquire it.

3.27    The first major challengethat the Governmenthasbegunto address is to restorethe
confidence of farmers and creditors in the sector by taking measures to improve its
management, improve its governance structure, and ensure that farmers participate in the
decision making process. While cotton production may not be a major source o f growth in the
medium to long-term, it will still be an important activity for poverty reduction. The challenge
therefore would be for the Government to have a program that would considerably reduce cotton
production costs and increase the farmers' share o f the world market price. A system o f full
farmer and private sector participation in the sector's management would help to achieve these
objectives. This would involve: (i)in the short-term, liquidating the current company and
creating a new one with farmer participation inthe capital (40 percent) and management; and (ii)
inthe medium-termseekingstrategic investors inthe company.

The Government'sreformprogram

3.28    The Governmentcompletedtwo financialaudits of SOTOCO and a strategic audit.
The findings of the financial audits highlighted pervasive commercial and financial
mismanagement across all layers of the company, which led to large financial losses and
mounting debts, including arrears to cotton farmers. The authorities have initiated efforts to
strengthen financial controls following the replacement o f SOTOCO's senior management in
2005, and to define and implement a medium-term cotton sector reform program based on the
results o f the audits. On the basis o f the two financial audits and strategic audit following the
outcome o f a stakeholder workshop, the Government decided in early 2008 to liquidate
SOTOCO and establish a new company (to be established in the first half o f 2009) which will
operate under a strengthened governance and transparency framework. At the same time, reforms
are ongoing to strengthen the sector's operations until the new company is created. Recent
actions taken or ongoing include:


    0   a BillingVerification Task Force (Mission de VeriJication) was established to review
       the cases of potential over billing identified inthe audit (regarding inputs, supplies and
        shortfalls in fiber revenues) and clarify which ones require follow up. The report o f the
       verification mission confirmed some instances o f overbilling but was unable to confirm
       others due to unavailability o f adequate company records. The Ministry o f Finance has
       requested the Ministry o f Justice to take the required action under the law to pursue
       recovery o fthe overbilled amounts.


    0   for the new cotton company, ongoing development and application o f a reliable
       management information and cost accounting system to reinforce the financial
       management; this system i s expected to be inplace by September 2009. The management
       information system and the financial control procedures incorporated in the manual of
       procedures that was adopted and put in application in SOTOCO will need to be updated
       upon creation o fthe new company.

       to ensure that the price SOTOCO pays for harvestedcotton enables it to be efficient and
       profitable in view o f conditions in the international market in which SOTOCO's cotton
       fiber output is sold (completed inearly February2009).

       responsibilities and obligations o f sector stakeholders in a new environment potentially
        comprising private ginning companies.


Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-2 and follow-up reforms

3.29    The proposed ERGG-2 would support two policy actions judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the cotton sector, namely the taking o f measures to recover the over billed
amounts to SOTOCO which have been confirmed by the Billing Verification Task Force
(Mission de Verzfzcation) and the adoption o f a new producer price mechanism that reflects
changes ininternationalprices.

3.30    A possible follow on DPO would support the next stage in the Government's cotton
sector reform program. Policy measuresthat will be considered for the operation would be: (i)
the establishment o f a reliable management information and cost accounting system in the new
cotton company; and (ii)the adoption o f a regulatory framework for the cotton sector that
specifies the roles, responsibilities and obligations o f sector stakeholders in a new environment
potentially comprising private ginningcompanies.

                       FINANCIAL   SECTORSOUNDNESSAND TRANSPARENCY

Current issues
3.3 1 Togo's financial sector performance declined sharply since the 1990s as governance
and economic performance deteriorated. Difficulties were most severe in three banks under
state control-Union      Togolaise de Banque (UTB), Banque Togolaise pour le Commerce et
I'Industrie (BTCI), and Banque Internationale pour I'Aj?ique (BIA).16 These three banks,
accounting for 56 percent o f the Togolese banking market, had large negative equity, failed to
comply with the prudential standards, and had highnon-performing loans. These banks required
restructuring, including recapitalizationinadditionto comprehensive internal reforms (notably to
improve corporate governance, lower operating costs, strengthen loan procedures and internal
controls and develop management information systems).

3.32    Weak governance of the banking sector in addition to the sector's high exposure to
the public sector constituted an unhealthy concentration of risks that crowded out
financing for the private sector. The large stock o f domestic arrears o f the Government to the
local private sector was severely constraining the ability o f private enterprises to service their


l6 BIA became a state ownedbank with the withdrawal ofBelgolaiseinJune 2008.


                                                    24

debts to the banking system. In addition to the three banks mentioned above, the Caisse
d'Epargne du Togo (CET), which was recapitalized by a public offering and which has received
a commercial bank license (under the name Banque Populairepour I 'Epargneet le Cre`dit),also
requires an operational restructuring.

3.33     Weaknesses of the financial sector extend to the pension sector: two social security
institutions have accumulated losses over the years, and the civil service pension system requires
significant annual subsidies from the Government. Micro-finance institutions are also weak, with
a limited range o f service and outreach, and fragile financial positions. Inadequate professional
capacity and weak supervision hamper an appropriate development o fthe micro-finance sector.

3.34     The Government's program comprises restructuring of the ailing state-owned
banks, a critical measure for macroeconomic stability and effective financial
intermediation. Given the existing situation, the Government's short-term priority is to
restructure the banking sector and formulate a financial sector development strategy. The
Government initiated the process, usingits own resources, by strengthening bankmonitoring and
developing a bank restructuring strategy based on the recommendations o f the WAEMUBanking
Commission and technical advice provided by the IMF and World Bank. The Government
eliminated a portion o f the negative equity and increased the cash flow o f UTB and BTCI by
providing them a subsidy to be paid over seven years in exchange for some fully provisioned
loans. The Government carried out a similar operation with the Caisse d'Epargne du Togo,
including the closure o f 20 branches and a downsizing by 239 employees. It obtained a
contribution o f 24 million Euros from a departing shareholder, Belgolaise, in mid 2008 for the
absorption o f accumulated losses in BIA. The Government also appointed an interim
administrator for BTCI. These actions were insufficient giventhe extent o f the financial distress
andpoor governance ofthe three banks.

3.35     Under the ERGG-2, the Government has committed to proceed with a complete
financial as well as internal restructuring of the commercial banks. The latter, further
discussed below (paragraph 3.38), is to ensure that the internal difficulties that have led to the
financial problems will not repeat themselves.

3.36     For the three bankswith negative net worth, the immediatefinancialrestructuring
comprises two components: absorption of past losses; followed by a recapitalization to
prudential norms. To absorb past losses: (i)all non performing loans would be completely
provisioned, resulting in negative net worth; and (ii)   the negative net worth would be brought
back to a level yielding a solvency ratio o f 8 percent inconformity with the BCEAO's prudential
norm, by substituting Government bonds against fully provisioned nonperforming assets. Cotton
and phosphate non performing debt in a private bank would also be securitized. The exercise
would result in the issuing o f Government bonds o f about of CFAF 88.1 billion. The
Government bonds issued would bear a market rate o f 6 percent so they could be resold easily.
To avoid that these securities create too much rigidity inthe management o f the banks' assets, a
request was presented to BCEAO to allow these bonds to be used as collateral for commercial
banks refinancing at the central bank. In addition, it was proposed that a very lean structure
organize and maintain a secondary market inthese bonds and a lean loan recovery agency be set


                                                 25

up to proceed with the recovery of non-performing assets (this agency could be the structure in
charge o f developing the secondary market for the Government bonds). Two other options that
were considered at length-the       closing o f the banks or moving the NPLs into to-be-created "bad
banks"-were       both rejected in view o f their likely strong adverse effect on depositors and on
Togo's economy.

3.37      Good progress has been realized in the financial restructuring of the three banks.
The bonds have been issued. The three banks post solvency ratios above 8 percent. The Council
o f Ministers o f the BCEAO has accepted that the bonds be used as collateral for central bank
refinancing. The IDA-financed Financial Sector and Governance (FSG) TA project proposed for
consideration by the IDA Board on March 31, 2009 will fund the establishment o f the loan
recovery structure. Inaddition, the Government has accepted that proceeds from loan recoveries
andprivatizationofbanks be usedto retire domestic debt.

3.38      With respect to internal restructuring and improvement in governance, the
following actionswill be taken:

     0    initiating immediately the process to cede the Government's shares in the banks to
          private strategic partners. With the assistance o f the Financial Sector and Governance
          (FSG) TA project, the hiring o f a privatization adviser will be launched in Q2 2009. The
          Government has included the Banque Togolaise de De`veloppement(BTD), a public bank
          insatisfactory financial condition, among the banksto beprivatized. Several banks, from
          Western Africa, Nigeria and Morocco have expressed interest in investing in Togolese
          banks17.


     0    Internal restructuring will involve developing internal procedures, strengthening
          internal controls and lending processes, elaborating procedure manuals, with the
          assistance o f the FSG TA project. In addition, top management will be controlled by a
          supervisory committee (including representatives from the central bank) until
          privatization is completed. These measures, as well as the ongoing monitoring o f sector
          developments by Bank and Fund teams working on the ERGG-2, the FSG TA project,
          andthe Fund's PRGF, would support efforts to improve governance.

3.39      Inother areas, the Government short termreformprogramincludes;

     0    launching o f actuarial studies for both the public and private pensionsystems. Based
          on these studies, parametric reforms (for contributions and benefits) will be implemented
          after consultations with stakeholders. This will be accompanied by the necessary
          revisions inthe regulatory framework for these two institutions.


     0    strengthening o f governance o f microfinance institutions and their management
          information systems, encouraging them to join networks, and strengthening their
          supervision through the dedicated MEF department called Cellule d'Appui et de Soutien
          aux Institutions Mutualistes d'Epargneet de Cre`dit(CAS-IMEC).

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-2 and follow-up reforms

3.40     The proposed ERGG-2 supports one policy action judged to be critical to advance
reforms in the financial sector, namely raising the net worth o f the three banks under
restructuring (BTCI, BIA and UTB) to the WAMU prudential ratio (Cooke ratio o f 8 percent) by
exchanging the banks' non-performing loans with government-issued bonds.

3.41     A possible follow on DPO could support the next phase actions inthe Government's
financial sector reform program. Policy measures that will be considered for the operation
would be the launching o f the call for bids for the sale o f government shares in the four state-
owned banks (BTCI, BIA, UTB and BTD). The participation o f private banks will strengthen
governance in the banking sector thereby mitigating the risk o f recurrence o f the banking
difficulties Togo has recently experienced.

                                             THEENERGY          SECTOR
Current issues
3.42     Due to its high dependence on imported fuel and electricity, Togo's energy supply
remains vulnerable to international oil price fluctuations and periodic regional energy
sector crises as a result of low hydrology. Togo imports 100 percent o f its petroleum needs
(much o f which usedto generate electricity) and about 85 percent o f the electricity it consumes.
Imported electricity i s provided by Communaute' Electrique du Benin (CEB), a joint venture
between Benin and Togo. In 2006-07, Togo experienced a drought-induced energy crisis
characterized by depletion o f the water available for CEB's hydroelectric power plant in Togo
and hydropower stations inGhana that supply power to Togo, the highcost of alternative power
sources (for example the 25 MW jet-fuel fired gas turbine owned by CEB) and generally rising
prices o f petroleum products. Faced with the constraints o f neighboring countries to provide
more electricity to Togo and the need to find a rapid solution to the crisis, the Government
ordered new diesel generators o f a capacity for about 20 megawatts (MW) in early 2008 to
minimize power outages and mitigate the negative impact on industrial production and economic
growth. The new generators helped the Compagnie d'Energie Electrique du Togo (CEET) to
close the demand-supplygap for electricity duringpeak periods.

3.43     CEB, Togo's supplier, is currently negotiating a new contract for the purchase of
electricity with the Volta River Authority (VRA) of Ghana, for larger amounts than in the
past and at a somewhat higher price, given that those additional amounts would be generated
from thermal energy and not hydropower. The production cost o f the electricity for Togo will be
mitigated somewhat by the arrival o f natural gas in LomC in 2010 under contract with the West
African Gas Pipeline Company'8, to power CEB's two 25 MW gas-fired plants in Benin and
Togo.

3.44     CEET has been in charge of retail distribution and sale of electricity in Togo since
the early 1970s. CEET provides access to electricity to about 13 percent o f Togo's population,

'* The  company is a consortium comprising the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (25 percent), Chevron
Nigeria Ltd (36.3 percent), Shell Nigeria (18 percent), Socie'te'beninoise de gas (2 percent), Socie'te'togolaise de gas
(2 percent), andthe Volta River Authority o f Ghana (16 percent).


                                                         27

corresponding to about 124,000 customers. This i s significantly lower than the Sub-Saharan
African average o f 25 percent, and reflects the fact that extension o f electricity access inthe past
ten years has lagged behind demand. Following a period in which CEET was under private
management from 2000-2006, the old public utility structure was reestablished. In March 2008
permanent structures were established, comprising a Board o f Directors, appointment o f a
General Manager, and adoption o f regulations for CEET consistent with those o f the
Organizationfor the Harmonization o f Business Law inAfrica (OHADA).

3.45    Both the CEET and the CEB are in a difficult financial situation, a reflection of
broader structural deficiencies in addition to price considerations. The current electricity
rates inTogo do not allow CEET to cover its additional costs resulting from a decision to end the
power outages with high cost thermal power. There i s a need to develop financial scenarios to
determine CEET's budget requirements and whether an increase in the electricity rates is
warranted. However, a sole focus on increasing tariffs is narrow inview o f Togo's current high
tariff level (Togo's average end-user tariffs in 2007 were about 22 U S cents per kilowatt hour,
among the highest inthe sub-region). Other issues that affect the sector's financial sustainability
must also be addressed, such as the lower-than-desired bill recovery ratio, the low recovery o f
government payment to the utility for delivery o f electricity services, and the very old age o f
some o f the equipment (dating to the 50s and 60s) which renders the electricity system inefficient
and unreliable. A comprehensive approach is required to adequately pursue the supply,
managerial efficiency and financial sustainability objectives.

The Government's reformprogram

3.46    In the short term, the Government aims to increase supply while strengthening
efficiencyinthe sector. Recent actions taken or ongoing include:

    0   co-sponsoring, as a member o fthe West African Power Pool (WAPP)", the development
        o f a 330kV transmission backbone to enhance power trade across countries in the sub-
        region;

    0   development o f domestic power resources to enhance energy sector resilience-recent
        plans include the construction of a 100MW thermal power plant and a hydropower plant
        at Adjarala;

    0   adoption o f a performance contract for the period o f 2009-2013 for CEET in order to
        improve management and efficiency inthe utility; and

    0   a planned commissioning of a sector strategic review financed by the LICUS TF grant for
        Economic Recovery and International Reengagement. On the basis o f the review, an
        electricity sector strategy will be elaborated and adopted.

3.47    Over the mediumterm, the Governmentplansto implementactions to: (i)                  strengthen
private participation in the development o f energy generation capacity; (ii)       intensify regional
cooperation in the production, purchase, sale and transport o f energy; (iii)create a rural


l9The WAPP falls within the framework ofthe ECOWAS EnergyProtocol which establishesthird-party access, and
the WAPP Master Planwhich defines regional priority projects.


                                                     28

electrification fund; (iv) establish a financing mechanism for the sector including participation o f
external donors and the domestic financial system; and (v) undertakean awareness campaign for
the efficient use of all forms of energy. While the Government's pro-activity inthe energy sector
is generally commendable, there i s scope for more longer term planning in the development o f
the sector inorder to ensure that customers are supplied at least cost.

Prior actionsunderthe proposedERGG-2 and follow-upreforms

3.48    The proposed ERGGi2 would support one policy action judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the energy sector, namely the development and adoption o f a 5 year
performance contract between the State and CEET.

3.49    A possible follow on DPO would support next phase actions in the Government's
energy sector reform program. A policy measure that will be considered for the operation
would be the adoption o f an automated tariff mechanism consistent with an energy sector
strategy to be developed as part o fthe sector strategic review.


          4. BANKGROUP'S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

                              LINKTOTHEINTERIMSTRATEGYNOTE

4.1      The Interim Strategy Note (ISN), discussed by the Board on May 29, 2008, sets out
the Bank Group's support to the Government's reform program for the period FY08-
FY10. The ISN is closely aligned with the Government's I-PRSP and has the following three
mainpillars:

         (i) improve governance and transparency, through a focus on public finance
              management and key sectors of the economy (phosphates, energy, cotton and
              financial sectors);

         (ii)promote economic recovery and sustainable development by helping the
              Government rehabilitate critical infrastructure and restore productive capacity inthe
              phosphate and cotton sectors. The Bank will also support the Government in
              addressing the challenges and obstacles to, and potential entry points for, private
              sector investmentas a catalyst for growth inTogo; and

         (iii)address urgent social needs, through expanding the community-driven
              development approach implemented through LICUS TF grants since 2004, to
              provide quality public services and income-generating opportunities to the residents
              o fpoorest communities inTogo, especially inrural areas.

4.2     The proposedERGG-2 is an integralpart of the ISN.Itdirectly supports the first I S N
pillar and provides financing for budgeted fiscal needs during 2009 and financial support to the
Government whose annual debt service to IDA will remain considerable until attainment o f the
HIPC completion point. The focus o f the ERGG-2 i s specifically on improving public finance
management as well as advancing structural reforms aimed at strengthening governance and


                                                 29

transparency inthe key sectors o f the economy (phosphates, cotton, financial and energy sectors).
The proposed reforms are essential to the Government's ability to use public resources efficiency
and effectively to support the country's economic and social recovery. These actions will be
followed by a more comprehensive program o f reforms that the Government i s developing in its
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper currently under preparation, which it plans to finalize by end-
March 2009. The reforms could be supported by a follow-on DPO focusing on continuing and
further deepening reforms inthe areas covered by the proposed ERGG-2. The ERGG-2 amount
has been recently increased from a planned US$12 million in the I S N to US$20 million to
frontload IDA 15 resources inFY09 to help Togo weather the impact o f the 2008 terms o f trade
and flood shocks, as well as the impact o f the global financial crisis which has reduced Togo's
real GDP growth prospects from the original projection under the PRGF o f 4 percent to the
current 2 percent projection. Despite the increase in the amount of the ERGG-2 financing, the
overall resources made available to Togo are expected to stay withinthe IDA allocation, which is
currently considerably higher thanthe amount indicated inthe ISN.


                  COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANKGROUP              ACTIVITIES

4.3     The proposed ERGG-2 is closely coordinated with and complements several Bank's
ongoing or planned operations and advisory services in the areas of its focus. The
Government's program o f reforms in the procurement, phosphate, cotton and energy sectors i s
supported by IDA under a LICUS grant (US$1.6 million approved in FY08) which lays the
ground for economic recovery. A recently completed PEMFAR i s providing input to developing
the Government's public finance management reformprogram (see para. 4.9). A Financial Sector
and Governance TA Project (FY09, US$12 million) i s planned to support banking, social
security and microfinance institutions restructuring and recovery, as well as capacity building o f
the Permanent Secretariat for monitoring the economic reform and financial sector programs. A
plannedEmergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Energyproject (FY09, US$25 million) will
enable upgrading o f roads and sanitation systems in selected urban areas, and an energy sector
GEF project will provide energy-efficient light bulbs to Togo's population. IDA also plans a
Support to Growth-inducing Sectors Project (FY10, US$lO million) which would focus on
improving agricultural productivity and diversification and transport infrastructure, by
reinforcing the capacity o f the Lome port. A Sources o f Growth Study (FY10) would include a
review o f potential drivers o f growth in the medium-term. In the energy sector, the ERGG-2
complements the ongoing dialogue and advisory assistance provided by the Bank to the
authorities inthe context o f support to the West Africa Regional Power Pool.

4.4     Other complementary support i s provided by IDA through various instruments.
Three LICUS Trust Fund grants (total o f US$3.5 million, approved in FY08) are providing
financial and technical assistance to: (i)extendcommunity-driven development activities through
the Emergency Program for Poverty Reduction (EPPR; US$1.4 million) to the remaining three
(of five) administrative regions; (ii) support immediate to short term measures to minimize the
threat posed by the avian flu (US$0.6 million); and (iii)increase access to infrastructure and




                                                30

urban services inthe capital city Lome (US$1.5 million).*' A Community Development Project
approved inJune 2008 enables the scale up the LICUS TF-fundedEPPR to address urgent social
needs, particularly inthe rural areas. InOctober 2008, IDA approved an additional US$7 million
grant under the Global Food Crisis Response Program to complement the Community Development
Project, to support Togo's efforts to managethe global food price shocks.


             COMPLEMENTARITYWITHOTHERDEVELOPMENT                         PARTNERPROGRAMS

4.5     The proposed ERGG-2 complements or leverages the support of other development
partners. The specific areas o f IDA support have been identifiedin close collaboration with the
IMF and in consultation with other development partners, in aiming for synergy with their
respective interventions and building on IDA'S comparative advantage in these areas. It i s
expected that these institutions will continue to collaborate closely during implementation o f the
program supported by the proposed ERGG-2, especially through joint dialogue with the
authorities, andjoint missions and analytical work. Ongoing donor assistance includes repair by
China o f the flood-damaged bridge on Togo's main north-south highway, EU assistance on
roads, IDA assistance on critical urban road and sanitation works, and the IDA-financed
Financial Sector and Governance TA project.

4.6     IMFand IDA staffs have coordinated closely on the identification of the respective
institutions' areas of focus and are working together on the HIPC process. The Bank andthe
IMF conducted a joint mission in AugustBeptember 2008; during the mission, the IMF staff
undertook a first review o f progress achieved under the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF), and IDA staff advanced discussions on the proposed operation. IMF and IDA
staffs have coordinated closely their advice on governance and other economic issues and
reforms, and worked on the HIPC process culminating in a joint preliminary HIPC document in
discussed at the institutions' Executive Boards in September 2008 and a joint decision point
document presented to the two Boards in November 2008. Responsibility for public financial
management (excluding procurement) i s shared between the two institutions, with sharing o f
analytical work and coordinated provision o f technical assistance to the country. The two
institutions work closely together on the restructuring o fthe bankingsector, with the Bank taking
the lead on the technical discussions. The two institutions endeavor to avoid duplication o f policy
measures where feasible. Both institutions have also supported the preparation o f the
Government's Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy. In addition, the IMF is providing technical
assistance inhelpingthe authorities set up a simple mechanism for monitoring budget execution,
and implementinga functional budget classification that also, with World Bank assistance, will
enable tracking o fpoverty reducing expenditures.

4.7     The AfDB, EU and IDA staffs are coordinating closely on supporting the
Government's public financial management reform program, including procurement.
Specifically, the three institutions have jointly prepared a draft PEMFAR, which also draws on
the ratings of an EC-financed Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA). The


2oThe package follows the approval of a grant for the launchingphase ofthe Togo EPPR in FY04 (inthe amount of
US$l.l million), and a grant for the EPPR consolidationphase inFY07 (inthe amount of US$1.7 million), both o f
which focused ontwo of Togo's five administrativeregions.


                                                        31

AfDB is providing assistancefor strengthening of Government capacity inthe area ofgovernance
and public management reforms. The IDA and AfDB staffs have collaborated closely in their
dialogue with the Government on governance reforms and are monitoring the implementation o f
the actions inthe same matrix which is presentedinAnnex 3.

4.8     Bilateral donors are supporting various elements of the authorities' efforts towards
economic recovery. The EUand France are supporting the governance andtransparency agenda.
The EUis also supporting the cotton sector reform program (about US$1.8 millionequivalent) to
pay the capital share (40 percent) of the National Federation o f Cotton Producer Groups in the
new cotton company created on January 23, 2009. Other support includes US$6.6 million
equivalent for the rehabilitation o f the cotton-coffee-cocoa roads and US$3.2 million for village
hydraulic.


                                   ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

4.9     The design of the ERGG-2 has benefited from recent or ongoing analytical Bank
reports, as well as close policy dialogue on the key sectors covered by the operation. These
include a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) preparedat end-2003 and a recently
completed PEMFAR conducted in close cooperation with the Government and development
partnersother than the EUand AfDB, notably France and the UNDP. The PEMFARprovides (i)
a diagnostic analysis o f the current strengths and weaknesses in the country's public financial
management system and practices; (ii)     input for the design and preparation o f the next phase o f
the PFM reform strategy, including a time-bound sequenced action plan o f priority reforms; and
(iii)benchmarks enabling the assessment o f future progress o f PFM reforms. It also provided
specific input into the identificationo fkey reforms to be supported by the proposed grant.

4.10    Analytical policy papers prepared during 2004-07 for the private, financial, urban
and agriculture sectors provide the basis for the support to the Government's reform
program. A Development Policy Note Review (DPNR), presented to the authorities in January
2008, includes a structural and macroeconomic assessment o f the situation in Togo, with the
objective o f providing input to develop sectoral strategies for the country's development. In
addition, a Financial Sector Review prepared at end 2006 identifiedthe public enterprises as the
major source o f the problems faced by the banking sector. It also found that the microfinance
sector was in precarious situation, the insurance sector was far from reaching its potential, the
social security institutions were experiencing large deficits, and Togo's financial sector posed a
serious challenge to achieving macroeconomic stability, economic recovery and growth, and
private sector development.

4.11    Inaddition, Bank's recent analysis and dialoguewith the authorities on trade issues
and on the phosphates, cotton, financial and energy sectors as part of recent missions have
further advanced the structural policy dialogue inthese sectors and laidthe basis for the proposed
grant, as well as restarted regular reporting o f key sector data to the Bank.*l The country's
macroeconomic performance and planned policies have also been assessed in the context o f a
joint mission o f the Bank and the IMF in September 2008 and another in March 2008 that

'' SeeAide-MemoireofIDA's EconomicmissionofAugust 29 - September 9,2008.


                                                 32

undertook a reconciliation o f Togo's external debt data. Specifically, the recent LIC-DSA (see
paragraph 2.20 above) analyzed the country's debt situation and concluded that Togo i s in debt
distress and its situation can only be resolved by a combination o f improved fiscal and structural
policies, debt relief and additional concessional financing. Underlying this exercise is a shared
Bank and IMF understanding of recent economic performance and growth prospects following
the socio-political crisis.

4.12    The Bank has also assisted the Government in updating its knowledge of the status
of growth, poverty and the social sectors in the country in order to strengthen the poverty
reduction strategy. In 2006, the Bank assisted the Government to conduct and analyze a
household survey as input to updating o f Togo's InterimPRSP. A Bank mission (November 28-
December 12, 2007) reviewed with the Government the situation o f health, education and
welfare, on the basis o f the documentation produced during preparation o f the I-PRSP and the
sectoral strategy papers prepared by the Government. Recently the Bank, joint with the UNDP,
conducted a background study on the sources o f growth as input to preparation o f the full PRSP.


                                         LESSONSLEARNED

4.13      The design o f this operation has benefited from the guidance provided from OPCS,
lessons from other development policy operations as well as the specific lessons from the
previous Economic Recovery and Governance Grant. These lessons are discussed in detail
below:


  0   In the first ERGG the policy reforms including the prior actions were embedded in the
      government's own reform agenda articulated in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy.
      There was therefore strong ownership o f the reforms from the onset. This proposed
      operation has adopted a similar approach. Given the government's good track record o f
      reforms to date, this will help to ensure the implementation o f the reforms supported by this
      operation.

  0   Given the generally limited capacity within the public sector in fragile countries such as
      Togo, it i s important to be selective inthe choice o f policy and institutional reforms to be
      undertaken at this particular stage inthe country's transition. Operations that are simple in
      design and have fewer actions that have significant positive "knock-on" or leverage effect
      are likely to be more effective than operations that attempt broad coverage. The design o f
      this operation reflects this lesson through its attempt to focus on selected prior actions in
      the country's critical sectors that are deemed essential for keeping the overall governance
      reformprogram on track as well as positively influencingthe investment climate.


  0   It is important to carefully choose prior actions that are likely to open the door for other
      important policy and institutional reforms. For example, the adoption o f the procurement
      law and associated code is a critical step to begin the procurement reform program that in
      turn is a key component of the government's overall reform program to strengthen public
      finance management and governance.




                                                 33

  0  An important lesson for this operation drawn from the implementation o f other
      development policy operations i s the need to assess the key risks to individual policy and
      institutional reform measures to be undertaken and to be proactive in the application of
     mitigating measures. This i s particularly important in fragile countries where capacity and
     political economy risks are non-trivial. This operation has not only benefited from an
     upfront assessment o f the key risks but has also identified mitigating measures that are
     being, or needto be, applied to address these risks.


  a   The effectiveness o f Bank-supported development policy operations can be enhanced by its
      complementarities with other Bank-financed operation and the efforts o f other active
      donors inthe reform areas. The design o f this proposed operation reflects this lesson inthe
      choice o f prior actions, which are closely coordinated with policy reforms supported by the
      IDA-financed Financial Sector and Governance TA project, AfDB through a budget
      support operation, the IMF PRGFand the HIPC completion point triggers.


     5. THE PROPOSEDECONOMICRECOVERYAND GOVERNANCEGRANT

                                 DESCRIPTION OFTHE OPERATION

5.1     The Government's broad economic recovery program is outlined above in Section 3.
This program constitutes the reference framework- behind the Government's Letter of
Development Policy (LDP) (Annex 2) and its policy matrix (Annex 3). Through its LDP, the
Government has requested that IDA continue supporting, through the proposed ERGG-2, critical
reforms outlined inits strategy, primarily inthe economic governance and transparency area.

5.2     Given the complex governance and transparencyissues facing the Government, the
key objective of the ERGG-2 is to support government-ownedreforms to improve public
financial management and restore performance of key public enterprises and banks.
Specifically, the ERGG-2 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated by the
Government under the ERGG (approved in May 2008) to strengthen budget preparation,
execution, controls and public procurement. It would also contribute to creating the conditions
for increased private sector confidence through measures to improve governance and
transparency in the phosphate, cotton, financial and energy sectors. The inclusion o f actions to
improve management in selected public enterprises is highly relevant to the operation, as this i s
likely to provide quick wins interms o f additional fiscal space and investments inthose sectors.
This would lead over time to strengthened fiscal sustainability, improved economic governance
and growth, and enhanced transparency o f State institutions and processes. The resources made
available by this grant will provide financial support to the Government (whose annual debt
service to IDA will remain considerable until attainment o f the HIPC completion point) to
implement activities that would otherwise be beyond its fiscal capabilities, including financing
the provision o f basic public services.

                            PRIORACTIONSFORTHE PROPOSEDGRANT

5.3    The proposed grant would support selected reforms in the Government's program
described in Section 3 and inits LDP that are deemed essential for its successful implementation.
Table 5.1 below details these prior actions and their implementation status. The rationale for their
selection has been discussed in the Section 3, namely their importance to the program and
expressed government commitment and feasibility. The prior actions for ERGG-2 are derived
from indicative policy measures that were identified during preparation o f first ERGG. There
have been some limited adjustments to take into account exogenous factors not hlly under the
control o f the Government (notably delays inrecruitment process for a consultant to develop and
establish the cotton company's cost accounting system), the dropping o f the measure regarding
satisfactory implementation o f the 2008 budget which i s closely monitored under the IMF PRGF
and the proposed operation and determined to have been broadly achieved despite challenging
domestic and international circumstances, the dropping o fthe measure to adopt a strategy to clear
domestic arrears which overlaps with an IMF-supported PRGF performance criterion (the
measure was implemented at end 2008), and the dropping o f the measure to prepare a formal
financial sector strategy since ongoing sector measures already reflect implementation o f a sector
strategy. The cotton sector measure regardingthe cost accounting system is also dropped from
the ERGG-2 butwill bepickedup ina possible follow onDPO. It should also benotedthat these
prior actions are part o f a well integrated and sequenced series o f reforms whose implementation
would continue to be supported by the Economic Recovery and International Reengagement TF
Grant, the proposed Financial Sector and Governance TA project, a possible follow on DPO, the
HIPC Initiative and the IMF three-year PRGF program. Compliance with these prior actions as
defined in the Financing Agreement forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the proposed
operation. Annex 3 details a fuller set o f measures under the Government's reform program in
the area o f governance, includingthe prior actions inthe table below.


                     FURTHER    ACTIONSFORTHE SUCCESSOFTHE PROGRAM

5.4    In addition to the actions taken prior to provision of the proposed grant, further
policy measures will be considered, and the results evaluated, for possible future budget
support from IDA through a possible follow on DPO. These measures, which further
strengthen governance and transparency in public financial management as well as in the key
sectors o f the economy (cotton, energy, phosphates and financial sectors), include those
presented in Table 5.2. Inresponse to the challenges discussed inthe ISN, these policy measures
continue the process o f strengthening the foundation for robust economic performance over the
mediumterm by further improving public financial management and addressing weaknesses in
key productive sectors.

                        Box 5.1: Good PracticePrincipleson Conditionality

 Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership
 This ERGG-2 is fully aligned with the government's reform program focusing on improving public expenditure
 management and strengthening governance and transparency in the key phosphates, cotton, energy, and financial
 sectors. This broad program of reforms underlies the policy dialogue with the Bank, IMF, and the AfDB, which
 closely coordinate their programs of support to Togo. The unit responsible for the ERGG-2 program within the
 Government is the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which has championed these reforms over the past years. In
 order to reinforce ownership at the sectorallevel, the Ministry of Economy and Financehas coordinatedthe dialogue
 with working groups and teams including other governmentagencies and organizations (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture,
 Ministry of Mines and Energy, BCEAO).

 Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
 The Government's reform program supported by ERGG-2 is summarizedinthe policy matrix inAnnex 3. The core of
 the program was developed during intensive policy dialogue with the authorities during 2007-08 and builds on the
 findings ofthe PEMFAR, Financial Sector Review, CPAR, LICUS grants, the IMFArticle I V Consultation and PRGF,
 as well as IDA'SDevelopmentPolicy Needs Review. The program has been closely coordinatedwith and supported
 by other development partners such as the IMF, AfDB and bilateral donors. The expected results of the program
 supportedby the proposedgrant are detailedinparagraph5.5.

 Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalitiesof Bank support to country circumstances
 The policy matrix is customized to the country circumstances. Elements of its reform program are included in the
 Government's InterimPRSP. The focus is on governance inthe public and private sectors, through a series of actions
 aimed at improving public financial management and governance and transparency incritical sectors for the economy
 (namely, phosphates, cotton, energy, and financial).

 Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achievingresults as conditionsfor disbursement
 The policy matrix uses a limited set of ten prior actions for Board presentation and disbursement of the proposed
 ERGG-2. The chosenpolicy measures were identifiedjointly with the Governmentand inclose consultationwith other
 development partners (notably the IMF). Conditionality is focused only on key actions which are critical to move the
 Government's agenda forward. The conditionality of ERGG-2 is also coordinatedwith and is complementary to the
 Governmentreform programsupportedby the IMF PRGF.

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
 support
 The Bank has worked in close coordination with the IMF, AfDB, EC and bilateral donors in supporting the
 Government's reform program. Going forward, the Bank will continueto coordinate closely with these institutions to
 support and monitor program implementation to contribute to more predictable and performance based financial
 support inthe future.

                                       COUNTRYOWNERSHIP

6.1     The proposed operation is supported and owned by the authorities,as indicated in
the Government's Letter of Development Policy (Annex 2). The specific reforms it supports
are critical elements o f the Government's strategy to re-launch growth and enhance governance
and transparency in public resource management. These reforms were designed with the broad
involvement o fthe Government's relevant ministries and agencies under the championship o f the
Minister o f Economy and Finance. The I-PRSP process has also provided an opportunity to
foster national consensus across the Togolese society and among Government representatives on
this reform agenda; the forthcoming PRSP will provide an additional opportunity to further
broaden and deepen such consensus.


                                       FIDUCIARY     ASPECTS

6.2       StrengtheningGovernment systems. The fiduciary standards in Togo have suffered
from the crisis and country budgetary and financial management systems will have to be
upgraded. The improvement in fiduciary standards is a central objective o f the proposed
operation and the Government has made encouraging progress in implementing measures to
enhance public resource management and transparency. These early measuresprovide a platform
for deeper reforms inthe context o fthe proposed operation andpossible future budget support.

6.3       As detailed above in the section on the Government's program and the ERGG-2
design, severalmeasureshave alreadybeenimplementedto strengthenthe country's public
financial management system, including: the full reinstatement and application of normal
budget preparation and execution procedures; the adoption and implementation o f an instrument
(a dashboard) for monthly monitoring o f budget execution; a significant reduction inthe use o f
advances for execution o f expenditures by forbidding (by ministerial decision) the use o f
payment orders not supported by ex-ante budget line identification except for the servicing o f
external debt; introduction o f a budget line, starting with the 2008 budget, to coverforce majeure
expenditures (natural disasters, etc) to increase budget transparency o f exceptional expenditures;
the implementation in the 2009 budget of a functional classification of public expenditure;
implementation in the MEF o f the SIGFIP integrated budget execution information system; re-
organization and strengthening o f the Treasury in line with the WAEMU Directive; and creation
o f an audit and inspection unit. The Government plans to adopt additional actions in 2009-10 to
further strengthenthe PFM system as detailed insection 3. These measures are accompanied by
ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and efficiency in: (i)the cotton sector, notably
implementing measures to recover the amounts for which SOTOCO was over billed for inputs
and shortfalls in fiber revenues; and (ii) phosphate sector, through a strategic and financial
                                            the
audit.

6.4       In 2005, the IMF staff carried out an on-site safeguards assessment of the Central
Bank of the West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank o f the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), which includes Togo. The assessment found that



                                                 42

progress has been made in strengtheningthe BCEAO's safeguards framework since 2002 when
the last safeguard assessment was undertaken. The BCEAO now publishes a full set o f audited
financial statements and improvements have been made to move financial reporting closer to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has
been put in place, and mechanisms for improving risk management and risk prevention have
been established and follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations has been
strengthened. The new assessment identified a number o f areas where further steps would help
solidify the progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external
audit process (including the adoption o f a formal rotation policy), further enhancement o f the
transparency o f the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening o f the
effectiveness o f the internal audit function. The status report o f the implementation o f
recommendations, received from the central bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress
was achieved.

6.5       Technical Assistance. Durable gains in transparency, effectiveness o f the financial
management systems, and accountability will require sustained and coordinated engagement o f
Togo's international partners in support o f the Government's reform process. The IMF, through
West Africa AFRITAC, is providing technical assistance inpublic financial management and tax
administration to the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. The recent PEMFAR has identified
areas in particular need o f remedial action, and the preparation o f a comprehensive Action Plan
jointly with the Government will address those needs. Establishment o f a baseline o f current
procurement practices using the OECD/DAC guidelines, which was done as part o f the
PEMFAR, will also enable evidence-based monitoring o f improvements in the near future. As a
result of the PEMFAR, priority technical assistanceto strengthenpublic financial management is
beingidentifiedfor additional coordinated donor support. IDA is providing strong support to this
process through a LICUS Trust Fund grant and a plannedFinancial Sector and Governance TA
Project. Donor assistancewill help the Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards
are applied to provide reasonable assurance that government resources are used for the intended
purposes. An important objective i s to achieve compliance with international standards o f
financial management, such as those agreed in the context o f the OECD/DAC guidance on
quality and performance o f national procurement systems.

management system, in a manner acceptable to IDA. Based on previous experience, the
execution o f such transaction from the Central Bank to the Treasury (Ministry o f Economy and
Finance) does not require more than four days. The Recipient will report to IDA on the amounts
deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the budget
management system. Assuming that the withdrawal request i s inEuro, the equivalent amount in
CFAF reported in the budgetary system will be based on the market rate at the date o f the
transfer. The Recipient will promptly notify the Bank by fax or email that such transfer has taken
place, and that proceeds have been credited ina manner satisfactory to IDA.

6.8     Auditing. IDA reserves the right to request an audit of the dedicated deposit account, on
terms o freference acceptable to IDA. If,after being deposited inthis account, the proceeds o f the
Grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined inthe Financing Agreement, IDA will require
the recipient to either: (a) apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refundthe
amount directly to IDA.

                                     ENVIRONMENTAL      ASPECTS

6.10    The reforms supported by the proposed development policy grant represent a first
round o f a broader program o f actions to promote the recovery o f key sectors, notably cotton,
phosphates and energy, in addition to strengtheningpublic financial management and reforming
the financial sector. These reforms, dealing mainly with economicgovernanceand institutional
issues,are not likely to havesignificant negativeimpactson the country's environmentand
natural resources. This applies also with respect to the actions in the three sensitive sectors:
first, as regards the cotton sector, the new cotton producer price mechanism merely introduces a
market signal to guide the sector's activities, with no predetermined effect on increasing the
producer price nor on production levels; second, the phosphate sector measure to publish
information on the sector's financial contributionto the economy promotes transparency with no
direct or indirect effect on production levels; and third, as regards the energy sector, the adoption
o f the performance contract aims for improved managerial and technical efficiency which could
potentially have positive environmental effects.

6.11    One must acknowledge nonetheless, that the country's prolonged political turmoil and
governance shortfalls that contributed to poor economic performance over the last sixteen years
have had adverse effects on its environment and on natural resources. As the highly centralized
public administration system crumbled in the wake o f civil unrest, so did the environmental
management systems that relied heavily on command-and-control tools. These systems became
ineffective in assuring adequate protection o f the environment and in promoting the sustainable
exploitation o f the natural resources. In recent years, the Government has shown firm
commitment to upgrade the environmentalmanagement systems, but muchremains to be done in
this area.

6.12    Inorder to address the country'senvironmentalchallenges, the Bankis assistingthe
Government in the preparation of a Country EnvironmentalAnalysis (CEA). This CEA



                                                 44

  aims to help the Government to mainstream environmental and sustainability aspects into
  development policy formulation as it embarks on the implementation o f its first poverty
  reduction strategy. More specifically, the CEA will: (i)undertake a rapid assessment o f the
  country's key environmental issues and trends in order to set the baseline for predicting and
   analyzing the potential environmental effects o f planned development policies, programs and
   investments; (ii)  examine the potential environmental risks associated with three key sectors o f
  the economic recovery programs, Le., cotton, mining, and energy; and (iii)        assess the technical
   and institutional capacity of the country's environmental management systems. These tasks will
   allow the CEA to identify the key development-environment-poverty linkages, and to propose
  management tools and capacity development measures that will help the Government to
  minimize negative impacts, optimize positive ones, and compensate as much as possible for the
   loss o f valuable assets and benefits associated with the implementation o f the economic recovery
   and poverty reduction programs. The effective use of these tools and implementation of these
. measures will help the Government to proactively integrate environmental and sustainability
   aspects into its poverty reduction strategy, thereby promoting the economic growth and
   sustainable development objective o f this strategy (I-PRSP pillar 2). Relevant findings o f the
   CEA could be incorporated in a possible follow-on operation by the Bank and provide the
   underpinningfor possible support of other donors.


                                    POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

   6.13     T h e proposed ERGG I1i s expected to have significant positive distributional effects
   from the improved public financial management and key reforms supported by the
   proposed operation in the cotton, phosphates, energy and financial sectors. Specifically,
  efforts to improve the capacity o f the State to implement its budget priorities and strengthen
  public financial management would enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability inpublic
  resource use, and increase the country's absorption capacity for external resources allocated to
  priority poverty expenditures. Continued strengthening o f governance in the cotton sector
  through measures to improve transparency inthe setting o f the producer price (including through
  the setting of a floor price and clarity of factors affecting price definition) is expected to further
   increase confidence o f farmers inthe sector and thereby facilitate a rebound incotton production
  in the short term, thereby improving the livelihood of a large sector of the population (about
  300,000) which relies on this cash crop as a dominant source o f earnings. Improving governance
  inthe energy sector through a 5 year performance contract between the State and CEET should
  contribute to improving electricity services and the easing o f electricity constraints to economic
  growth. Restructuring o f the loss-making banks would help strengthentheir financial positions
  thereby enabling resumption inlending. This would inturn contribute to macroeconomic stability
  and help re-launch economic activities which have been severely constrained by the banking
  crisis. The grant would also help fund the provision o f basic public services during 2009 with a
  high beneficial impact on the poor, in complement to implementation of the Togo Community
  Development Project (approved inFY08) and the additional financing (approved inFY09) under
  the Global FoodCrisis ResponseProgram.

                                 MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                 AND

6.14     The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall
implementation of the proposed ERGG-2. Day-to-day monitoring and evaluation o f the
program will be the responsibility o f a monitoring committee, which will coordinate the
implementation o f the program o f reforms supported by the ERGG-2 and will comprise: (i)
within the MEF, the Permanent Secretary for monitoring implementation o f policies reforms and
financial sector programs, the Economy Director, the BudgetDirector, the Treasury Director, and
the Financial Controls Director; and (ii) the Secretary of the CNCS for procurement as well
                                            with
as the line ministriesinvolved, the Ministryo f Agriculture and the Ministry o f Mines and Energy.
This arrangement was dictated by the strength and continuity o f the economic team and the
dialogue on policies carried by them. The Government will provide progress reports on
implementation o fthe reforms, including on agreed performance indicators.

6.15    The MEF economic team will also be responsible for monitoring the program and
its results as detailed in paragraph 5.5. The Government will provide quarterly reports to IDA
on implementation progress measured against the established timetables and the agreed
performance indicators. The overall reform effort will be reviewed by the Government in close
coordination with regular Bank missions to ensure continued implementation o f the program
within anadequatemacroeconomic policy framework.


                                  R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

6.16    In the current environment of a country emerging from a socio-political crisis, the
proposed operation presents significant country and fiduciary risks.

6.17    Political risk. Reform efforts aimed at improving governance o f the public sector, public
enterprises and banks could falter under the weight o f the significant challenges each of these
faces, or inthe event o fpossible political tensions that could slow the current reform momentum.
Itis expected that frequent broad-based consultations with stakeholders to strengthenthe case for
reforms and reaffirm the Government's commitment to them would helpmitigate this risk. Inthe
Letter o f Development Policy and through the actions it has already implemented, the
Government has expressed its strong commitment to pursue and deepen the reforms already
launched. To reduce vested interests' resistance to reform in critical sectors and to enhance
governance, steps are being taken to set the stage for more transparent and accountable practices
in the phosphates, energy, cotton and financial sectors. In addition, the proposed prior actions
focus on areas in which the Government has already demonstrated its commitment and
ownership. Close coordination with the IMF, AfDB and bilateral donors and intensified sector
dialogue will help ensure that top priority is given by the Government to the reform o f these
sectors. The forthcoming PRSP process also provides an opportunity to foster national consensus
across the Togolese society and among Government representatives on a medium-termreform
agenda.

6.18    Macroeconomic risks to the economic recovery could stem from the vulnerability o f the
Togolese economy to exogenous shocks (such as the recent increases ininternational food and oil
prices, or the severe domestic floods), or from a possibly prolonged global downturn caused by


                                                 46

the global economic slowdown. The global slowdown could depress export demand, remittances,
and FDI. Fragile banks could jeopardize macroeconomic stability and weakened public
enterprises inkey sectors could hamper growth. Other possible shocks include euro appreciation,
a worsening regional energy crisis, bad weather affecting agriculture, and loss o f confidence that
could cause capital outflows. Delays in rebuilding the transport infrastructure destroyed by the
recent flooding could also hinder the economic recovery. These shocks could result in, among
others, a risk o f falling back into arrears or exacerbating the already precarious financial situation
o f several banks, with a possible adverse spillover to the region. Togo still depends heavily on
electricity imports, resulting in frequent energy shortages, Furthermore, given Togo's role as a
hub for regional trade and its financial linkages across the WAEMU, shocks in neighboring
countries could hurt Togo's economic prospects.

6.19    To mitigate the macroeconomic risks, the IMB and IDA will continue to closely monitor
Togo's macroeconomic performance, including providing ongoing advisory assistance to the
financial sector reform program through a planned Bank-financed Financial Reform and
Governance Project in FY09. Bank support to address rising food prices in Togo includes the
Community Driven Project (CDP, approved in June 2008) which contains some targeted
measures to support food production, and additional financing under the Global Food Crisis
Response Program to complement the CDP and support Togo's efforts to manage the global food
price shocks. Furthermore, Togo's main creditors have offered financing and agreed to debt relief
arrangements that maximize overall positive resource flows to Togo, as reflected in the fiscal
framework supported under the PRGF. This includes: planned IDA budget support to Togo
through annual development policy operations to support ongoing reforms; the Paris Club
agreement on a moratorium period with no debt service payments between 1st April 2008 and 31
March 2011 (provided that Togo continues to satisfactorily implement the PRGF-supported
program); and expected similar treatment from other bilateral creditors. IDA is also providing
assistance to strengthen debt management capacity; implementation o f the recommendations o f
IDA'Sassessment o f Togo's debt management system will be supported by IDA and other
donors. Strong, predictable and timely donor support will also be critical to mitigate possible
external risks, and the Government i s committed to a rapid attainment of the HIPC decision and
completion points.

6.20    Fiduciary risk. Despite recent reforms, financial controls remain weak and fiduciary risk
remains from failure to avoid corruption or failure o f the Government to make effective and
efficient use o f the fiscal space made available by arrears clearance, budget support and debt
relief. Weaknesses inTogo's procurement system, noted above inparagraph 3.8, correspond with
a highrisk rating for the country. The improvement infiduciary standards i s a central objective o f
the proposed operation through measuresto improve public financial management, including the
foundations o f a robust procurement system through a new procurement law. As regards
procurement, the major risk duringthe next twelve months i s an improper application o f the new
procurement law stemming from an inadequate dissemination to, and familiarization by, users.
The risk will be mitigated by the establishment o f the General Procurement Department, which
would disseminate the new procurement law and promote its application for public procurement,
especially inthe key Ministries (notably public works, health and education) and inmajor public




                                                   47

enterprise^^^. The recent PEMFAR and technical assistance provided by IDA, the IMF and other
donors are expected to facilitate the further improvement o f fiduciary standards. Inaddition, the
proceeds o f the budget support component would be disbursedby IDA in a dedicated account o f
the Government, which couldbe audited onterms ofreference acceptable to IDA.

6.21   Implementation capacity risk arises from the lack o f sufficient professional staff and
weak institutional capacity and coordination in the wake o f the long recent history o f socio-
political instability and suspended foreign assistance. As noted in the ISN, this risk i s mitigated
during the ISN period through the provision o f technical assistance (for ERGG-2 governance
reform areas) under IDA projects or TF grants. This includes the ongoing LICUS grant for
Economic Recovery and International Reengagement (FY08) that provides support to reforms in
public procurement, cotton, coffee, cocoa, energy and port sectors. A proposed TF grant under
the State and Peace BuildingFacility to provide support to debt management, public procurement
and public financial reforms is under preparation. Analytical work will be undertakento identify
capacity building needs to be supported in the medium term under a future CAS. Other donors
(AfDB, EC andFrance) are supporting, or planto, capacity buildingefforts invarious sectors.

6.22    In IDA's assessment, the potentialbenefits of the proposed operation outweighthe
residualrisks andwarrant IDA's assistancefor implementingcritical reforms andpolicy actions
ina coordinated fashionwith other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability ofthe reform agenda.

DearMr.Zoellick,


1. This Letter of Development Policy (LDP) reports on progress made and describes the current
trend o f Togo's socio-economic situation and its prospects for 2009 to 2011. It sets out the
specific objectives and policies that the authorities intend to implement in the context o f the
budget support program started in 2008 which seeks to strengthen economic growth and reduce
poverty. The authorities continue to seek the support o f the international community in general
and of the World Bank in particular through the Second Economic Recovery and Governance
Grant (ERGG-2).

I. PoliticalandSocio-economic Context

2. The signature o f a Comprehensive Political Agreement (APG) between the main political
parties in August 2006 marked the real beginning o f Togo's emergence from a long socio-
political crisis. This agreement paved the way for early legislative elections on October 14, 2007,
withthe participation of all political parties.

3. The political stability achieved following these elections enabled the Government to enter
negotiations with its development partners for a full returnto cooperation.

4. The Government intends to consolidate political stability as a way o f ensuring harmonious
economic development. In February 2009, the Permanent Framework for Dialogue and
Consultation (CPDC) was reactivated under the APG, bringing together the political parties
represented inthe National Assembly and the Government.

5. Since 2006, satisfactory reforms have been undertaken inthe fkamework o f the Government's
strategy. The economic recovery and poverty reduction program seeks to reestablish
macroeconomic stability, restructure public finances and re-launch economic growth to raise
living standards among the population. This program i s laid out inthe InterimPoverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), the implementation o f which remains our highest priority.


                                                50

6. An IMF Staff Monitored Program, largely implementedbetween October 2006 and June 2007,
led to improved management o f public finances and more transparent management o f public
institutions. The successful implementation o f the Staff Monitored Program led to the
establishment o f a three-year program (2008-2010), through the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF), which has reached its second review. This program produced satisfactory
results, despite external and internal shocks such as the spike in food and oil prices around the
world, serious flooding inAugust 2008 and the global economic crisis. Infact, the framework o f
the program helped attenuate the effects of these shocks on public finances and improved the
macroeconomic situation. The State's financial situation has been significantly strengthened. The
program has also made it possible to normalize relations with our external creditors and to reach
the decision point in the HIPC initiative in November 2008. We hope to reach the completion
point in2010. The program is now ina phase that puts more emphasis on accelerated growth and
poverty reduction.

7. Despite concerted efforts to implementthe measurescontained inthe government program, the
results have been limited in terms o f growth. Furthermore, the downturn in the global economy
could further delay the returnto economic growth that the Togolese population i s expecting.

8. Recent economic conditions are difficult both internationally and nationally. Economic
recovery has not materialized as expected, with growth near 0.8 percent in 2008, below the
average for the past five years. This weak result can be attributedmainly to the damage caused by
the floods and to the spike in world food and energy prices. As a result o f these shocks, year-
over-year inflation peaked at 15.9 percent in August 2008 before falling back to 10.3 percent at
the end o f the year, thanks to lower prices on world markets. A rate o f 8.4 percent i s estimated
for 2008. These deteriorating economic conditions are reflected in a general drop in purchasing
power among the population.

9. The Government has committed itself to continuing its efforts to improve economic
conditions. Following clearance o f the external debt, we adopted a plan to clear domestic debt,
which alone represents one quarter o f GDP.

11.The 2009-2010 Program

General objectives

10. The Government's economic recovery program will be strengthened through 2009-2010 by
continuing the economic reforms begun in previous years. The Government remains committed
to carrying out the reforms needed to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework that favors
sustainable economic growth aimed at improving living conditions for the population. The goals
for 2009 are to: (i)continue the economic reform program focused on improving transparency by
fighting against fraud and corruption; (ii)improve public finance management and the
governance o f State-owned banks and the main public enterprises (phosphates and cotton); (iii)
implementthe budget in strict compliance with conventional financial practice; and (iv) respect
the commitments made with international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank and African
Development Bank, inparticular) and bilateral donors in order to strengthenrelations with them.


                                                51

The measuresplannedto increase agriculturalproductivity, clear domestic debt and improve both
absorptive capacity and the expenditure level on public investments, will help achieve real GDP
growth o f around 2.0 percent in2009 and will improve growth levels inthe coming years.

11. The Government's medium-term reform program is contained in the Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper for Togo. This strategy includes major reforms aimed mainly at
continuing to: (i) strengthenpublic finances; (ii)   restructure State-owned enterprises, especially
inthe cotton and phosphate sectors; (iii)   overhaul the energy sector and highway infrastructure;
(iv) restructure the financial sector; (v) improve the investmentclimate to promote private sector
growth; and (vi) improve access to health and education.

Governanceand StructuralReforms

12. The Government i s determined to put good governance inpublic resource management at the
center o f its economic program. It expressed this determinationduringthe recent IMF mission to
Lom6, in February 2009, in the context of the second review under the PRGF and Article 4
consultations. It i s committed to continue fighting corruption and fraud, and to reestablish
economic and regulatory conditions conducive to economic activity. The Government adopted
and executed a realistic budget for 2008, and did so rigorously, transparently and efficiently,
without accumulating arrears in domestic and external payments, and without recourse to
exceptional use o f public funds, in particular Payment Orders without ex-ante budget line
identification. The satisfactory execution o f the 2008 budget contributed to the good performance
under the IMF PRGF program since April 2008. The 2009 draft budget was adopted by the
Council o f Ministers and approved by the National Assembly on December 17, 2008. The 2009
budgetgives priority to spending on education, health, infrastructure renewal, agriculture, energy,
bank restructuring and public enterprises, and clearance o fthe domestic debt.

13. Major reforms were carried out under the Economic Recovery and Governance Grant
(ERGG), the Staff Monitored Program and the PRGF program inthe first year (2008). In2009,
the Government will continue or even accelerate reform projects under the PRGF program in
order to create the conditions for stronger and longer-lasting economic growth. The accent will
be on the triggers for quickly reaching the HIPC initiative completion point in2010, inparticular:
(i) preparation and satisfactory implementation o f a full PRSP; (ii)  maintaining macroeconomic
stability through the satisfactory execution o f a PRGF program; (iii)  adoption o f a mechanism to
monitor public expenditures aimed at poverty reduction based on a functional classification
system and the publication of quarterly expenditure reports; (iv) appointment o f judges to the
Court o f Accounts and submission to this Court and to Parliament o f a draft budget execution
law (Loi de r8gZement) and a draft General Treasury Balance (Balance Ge'ne'raZedu Trksor); (v)
creation o f an authority regulating government procurement and the monthly publication o f all
contracts signed by the State; (vi) greater transparency in the management o f key public
enterprises, in particular rhe New Phosphates Company o f Togo and the New Cotton Company
o f Togo; (vii) publication o f data on external and domestic public debt; (viii) adoption of a
national health development plan inthe medium term; and (ix) implementation o f a national plan
for the education sector.




                                                 52

14. In addition to these measures, the Government plans to: (i) operational the new
                                                                       make
Treasury structure in compliance with WAEMU Directives; (ii)      implement the domestic arrears
clearance strategy and securitize arrears with suppliers; (iii)
                                                              maintain the viability o f public debt
by favoring grants or loans with highly concessional conditions; (iv) adopt an action plan to
strengthen short-term capacity to quickly and efficiently execute projects; (v) continue reforming
the public procurement system; and (vi) finalize reforms ofpublic enterprises, with World Bank
support: a reliable information management system as well as cost accounting must be
established for the new cotton company; a strategic and financial audit of the sector i s needed for
the new phosphate company; and a review of the financial situation of the national electricity
utility i s planned. The Government has taken steps in the area o f public finances, the financial
sector, the phosphate sector, the cotton sector, the energy sector, the transport sector and the
social sectors. The rest o f this letter describes the key actions we have taken in each sector
mentioned above andthe measuresplannedfor 2009-2010.

ReestablishingBudgetaryOrthodoxy

15. Public expenditure management was considerably improved by: (i) end o f distortions in
                                                                           the
the budgetary cycle (preparing and voting on the 2009 budget on time) and extra-budgetary
execution procedures (good execution o f the 2008 budget); (ii)    effective implementation o f a
treasury and cash management plan that takes into account the monthly flow o f funds report on
budgetexecution; and (iii)strengthening internal oversight over budget execution. The
Government intends to continue public expenditure management reforms. To this end, it will
consolidate the return to a normal budgetary cycle, improve the execution o f expenditures,
strengthen cash flow management and public procurement procedures and regularly publish
budget execution reports. The Government's efforts inthe area o f public finances are illustrated
by these measures:

  The 2009 draft budget was submitted in November 2008 to the National Assembly, which
adopted it on December 17,2008;

  The status report on public finances is issued each quarter and sent to the Office o fthe Press in
Togo, to the World Bank and to the IMF, within a maximum o f two months following the period
under review. This information is also available at the website o f the Permanent Secretariat for
Monitoring ReformPolicies and Financial Programs;

  A monthly report on budget execution has been established and continues to be prepared and
sent every month to development partners. This report is an excellent decision-making tool for
the Treasury and Cash Management Plan Committee;

  The Government has put an end to extra-budgetary expenditures made by payment orders
without ex-ante budget line identification, i.e. without ex-ante budget line identification, and has
undertakento regularize expenditures for payments due for fiscal year 2008 in order to avoid
accumulations o f arrears. The second review under the PRGF has confirmed that this
commitment has been respected;




                                                 53

   Starting with the 2009 budget, the Government has established a budget line to cover
extraordinary, unforeseen expenditures (natural disasters, etc.), for greater transparency and
oversight o fpublic expenditure;

  The Office o fthe Inspector General o f Finance has been created and staffed under the Ministry
o f Finance in order to strengthen customary financial practice in the supervision, oversight and
transparency o f all bodies that manage public funds. The Inspector General o f Finance was
appointed inAugust 2008;

  The Government has reorganized and strengthened Treasury services in accordance with
WAEMU Directives, including the creation o f a General Payments Office, a General Revenue
Office and a Treasury Central Accounting Agency, as well as the appointment o f their respective
directors inDecember 2008. We have also begunissuingTreasury bills.

  A domestic debt clearance strategy has been adopted to restore supplier confidence and a
National Domestic Debt Clearance Commission has been established by government order. The
strategy involves the clearance of all arrears in domestic debt identified inthe audit by KPMG in
2007. The strategy will be updated for the following years and the audit will be validated by the
State.

  The Government has adopted an actionplanfor public procurement reforms, based on the 2003
CPAR.

  The integrated systemfor budget execution information(SIGFIP) is now beingimplemented by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance to improve the efficiency and transparency of
budget execution;

  The Government has also cleared its debt with IDA andAfDB.

16. In 2009-2010, Togolese authorities intend to implement additional measures to strengthen
public financial management.

The Government recognizes the importance o f addressing the outstanding public expenditure
management challenges noted in the recently completed draft Public Expenditure Management
and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR). These include the need to (i)achieve full
compliance with the statutory budget calendar to ensure sufficient review o f the budget by the
National Assembly prior to its approval; (ii)  integrate the investment and operating budgets; (iii)
better align the .composition o f expenditures with the initially approved budgets and with the
priorities o f the country's poverty reduction strategy; (iv) increase the share o f spending on
priority sectors; (v) improve the budget data management system through computerization; (vi)
disseminate information on the budget and its execution, as well as improve the quality and
coverage of such information; (vii) reduce the level o f transfers and subsidies to levels
comparable with international norms, in order to expand the fiscal space available for priority
expenditures; (viii) make operational the Court o f Accounts by appointing judges and providing




                                                 54

the training, equipment and materials required to perform their duties; and (ix) strengthen the
internal audit and inspection unit (IGF).

To accomplishthis, the Government intends to:

   submit the 2010 draft budget to the National Assembly within the regulatory periods
established by the Constitution. It also intends to continue correctly executing the 2009 budget
and disseminating quarterlybudgetexecution reports;

  finalize the implementation o f the accounting module in SIGFIP and ensure that this integrated
budget execution information system is effectively implementedinthe Ministry o f Economy and
Finance, to enhance efficacy and transparency o f budget execution;

  restore supplier confidence and stimulate the private sector by implementingthe domestic debt
clearance strategy. This strategy will deal with overdue claims by private suppliers. The arrears
amounting to less than CFAF 5 million are to be paid from resources earmarked in the 2009
budget, while other arrears will be converted into tradable government securities, with payments
starting in2009;

  implement the measuresplanned by the Inspector General o f Finance;

  strengthen the capacity o f the Treasury in order to improve oversight and supply o f reliable
information on national treasury revenues, expenditures and management, and to prevent the
accumulation o f arrears by finalizing the organization o f the Treasury in accordance with
WAEMUDirectives;

  strengthencontrol o f public expenditure management by continuing reforms o f the government
procurement system, for which a new draft law was submittedto the National Assembly in early
2009. A government procurement code will also be adopted by the Council o f Ministers. These
reforms are essential to ensure efficient public investmentexpenditures;

  continue tax and customs administration reforms aimed at improving revenue collection. These
reforms have already led to a significant increase in tax revenues. To support the increase in
revenues, the Government is planning to strengthen the capacities o f the tax authority by: (i)
training and recruiting qualified personnel; (ii)completing the computerization o f the tax
administration; (iii)broadening the tax base through new provisions included in the 2009 law
governing the tax treatment o f companies admitted to the Free Zone; and (iv) installing a
computerized double entry accounting system at all levels o f revenue administration;

  improve debt management capacity, in particular by strengthening the Directorate of Public
Debt to ensure that data management and payment procedures are fully adequate. The
Government has begun by enforcing the WAEMU Directive that the Minister o f Economy and
Finance has the sole authority to contract or guarantee external debt. Accordingly, a National
Public Debt Committee (CNDP) has been created to prepare, coordinate and monitor the
implementationo fthe national public debt policy and debt management policy.



                                                  55

Also, interms o f completion point triggers, the Government plansto:

  adopt a mechanism to monitor public expenditures related to poverty reduction, based on a
functional classification o f expenditures and publish at least two quarterly expenditure reports
duringat least the two consecutive quarters preceding the completion point;

  make operational the Court o f Accounts by appointing and installingjudges. The execution o f
the 2007 budget will be submitted to the Court for examination in 2009, and the Court will also
prepare procedures manuals. At the same time, the authorities intendto prepare the draft 2008
budget execution lawto be submitted to the NationalAssembly in2010;

   issue a decree creating the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority in compliance with
WAEMUDirectives onpublic procurement, appoint its personnel andprovide it with a sufficient
budget; and publish each month, in a government procurement periodical or at a government
website, a summary o f all contracts signed, including private contracts and public concessions,
duringat least the six final months immediately precedingthe completionpoint.

  bringtogether all data on external and domestic public debt under a single service incharge o f
the management o f all public debt.

  publish an annual report at a government website providing accurate and complete data on
external and domestic public debt, including information on debt stocks, real debt service and
new loans, for a six-month period after the end o f the year, during at least the year immediately
preceding the completion point.

Financial Sector Reforms

17. The performance o f Togo's financial sector has deteriorated seriously since the early 1990s,
due to the economic difficulties associated withthe country's socio-political crisis. In2007, three
banks (all o f these State-owned: BTCI, BIA and UTB) representing over 56% o f the Togolese
bank market, failed to comply with prudential norms, had highly negative net worth and had a
large portfolio o f non-performing loans. These banks require a comprehensive restructuring.
Three other lending institutions (SNI-FA, SIAB and CET), which faced serious difficulties, have
beenpartially or totally restructured.

18. SNI was restructured (split-up/liquidation) after Financial Bank obtained permission to take
over its operations. SIAB was recapitalized by its foreign majority shareholder. CET, which was
put under temporary administration, finally obtained authorization to operate as a commercial
bank in 2007, under the name People's Bank for Savings and Loans (BPEC); however, its
financial restructuring mustbe accompanied by institutional restructuring.

19. UTB was partially restructured in2004 andreceived a balancing subsidy. The bank must still
make additional provisions demanded by the BankingCommission.




                                                56

20. BTCI was also partially restructured in late 2005. The Government has strengthenedBTCI's
corporate governance by establishing a Temporary Administrator and a Monitoring Committee.


21. As for BIA, the Government obtained 24 million euros from Belgolaise, a shareholder that
withdrew inmid-2008, inorder to absorb the bank's accumulated losses.


22. Despite these restructuring operations since 2007, the restructuring o f the banking sector i s
not yet complete.

23. The goal o f the Government, through the banking sector reform program, i s to complete the
total restructuring o f all publicly held banks in difficulty and to withdraw from this sector. The
Government has therefore decided to undertake both the financial and institutional restructuring
o f these publicly heldbanks indifficulty to ensure that the institutional problems that ledto their
financial difficulties will not be repeated.

24. The three banks with negative net worth -BTCI, UTB and BIA (a private bank turned over
to the State in2008) -must be recapitalized to bringtheir solvency ratio to the prudential norm
o f 8 percent. To accomplish this, in October 2008 the Government replaced the non-performing
loans with 88 billion CFAF in government securities. These securities were included in the
Central Bank refinancing to ensure the liquidity o f the banking system. The Government chose
this option because apossible closure ofthese banks or the relegationo fnon-performing loans to
a "bad bank" would have disastrous consequences on depositors and on the entire economy.

25. Institutionalrestructuring includes the development o f internal procedures, the strengthening
o f internal controls and lending procedures, and the development o f procedures manuals.
Furthermore, a new supervisory committee will oversee bank management measures with the
support o f the Central Bank until the privatization process is completed. These measures,
complemented by monitoring and assessment by Bank and Fund staff through ERGG-2, the
technical assistanceproject on governance, and through the PRGF, should improve governance.

26. As soon as financial restructuring is complete and good governance i s reestablished, the
Government i s determined to search actively on behalf o f BIA, BTCI, BTD and UTB for
strategic partners with solid financial profiles and recognized expertise to undertake
privatization. Revenue from the transfer o f the State's shares inthe banks and from the collection
o f non-performing loans will be used to clear the domestic debt. If any balance remains after
clearing the commercial and financial debt, this balance will be used for the retraction o f
securities issued inthe process o f bank restructuring. This operation will be particularly helpful
to relaunch the private sector and the financial sector.

27. The Government's medium-term goal i s to have completely restructured banks that once
again help finance the economy.

28. The microfinance sector in Togo has seen strong growth over the past decade. It has played
an important role by offering financial services to low-income urbanand rural people who do not




                                                 57

have access to the banking sector. The Government's goal, therefore, i s to avoid crises by
ensuring the stability o fthis sector.

29. Finally, the Togolese pension system has accumulated losses over the past several years. The
public service retirement pension system i s also supported by State subsidies. This situation
means that reforms are needed so that the stability of the pension system i s not at long-term risk.

30. Restoring balance to the financial system i s one o f the priorities of the government program
for 2009-2010. This goal will be achieved with a specific strategy for each component o f the
financial sector: the bankingsector, the pension system andthe microfinance sector.

Phosphate Sector Reform

31. The continued decline inphosphate production is due mainly to lack o f investment to replace
ageing equipment, repeated power cuts and problems o f governance, leaving the company unable
to take full advantage o fthe upturninworld markets in2008.

32. The need for a viable institutional and technical framework for the recovery o f the sector's
phosphate production led to the dissolution o f the non-performing companies IFG and OTP and
the creation o f a new company: the New Phosphates Company o f Togo (SNPT).                      The
Government aims to establish a procedures manual for this new institutional framework and an
internal control system. It also aims to restructure SNPT staffing. Also, a social plan i s being
implementedto adapt stafflevels to the realneeds ofthe company.

33. The restoration o f good governance supported by a strong strategic vision for the
development o f the phosphate sector i s the Government's key objective. In January 2009, with
the financial support of the World Bank, the Government launched an audit o f the phosphate
sector. The audit covers strategic aspects o f SNPT, such as the organization o f the company and
its production, and the condition o f its production assets. It also covers the economic, financial,
social and environmental aspects o f the phosphate industry in Togo. The final report could be
available in late April 2009. This strategic audit will provide details for a comprehensive
restructuring o f the sector and will facilitate the search for a strategic partner. The Government
intends to implement the audit recommendations and prepare a development strategy for the
phosphate sector based on the strategic audit.

34. To enhance transparency, it has begun disseminating the results o f reconciliation o f income
from sales o f the phosphates sector, with royalties and taxes paid by this sector to the Treasury,
for 2008.

35. The Government plans to step up the process o f accession to the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI) by: (i)creating an institutional and legal framework for the
effective implementation o f the EITI with a view to achieving Candidate Country Status, which
must include: (a) the creation of one or more committees at the national level having a balanced
representation o f the extractive industry, civil society and government; and (b) the designation of




                                                  58

a national coordinator; as well as (ii) adoption and publication o f a detailed and budgetized
                                       the
Action Plan for activities to be undertaken inthe context o f EITI-Togo.

36. Interms o f HIPC completion point triggers, we are also committed to ensuring transparency
on financial flows in the sector, in particular through the reconciliation and public reporting o f
payments to, and revenues received by the Government for the phosphates sector inline with this
aspect o f the EITI criteria. The latest report will be made available during at least the year
immediately preceding the year inwhich the completion point i s reached.

Cotton Sector Reform

37. Cotton production has declined in recent years as a result o f poor governance o f this sector,
lower world cotton sales prices, and low rainfall. This has ledto a decrease inthe efficiency and
profitability o f the Togolese Cotton Company (SOTOCO) and the reduction in prices for
producers. The Government i s determined to implement reforms aimed at raising production
levels and reorganizing the cotton production system to move gradually toward the privatization
o fthe sector.

38. To this end, in January 2009 the Government dissolved SOTOCO, created a new cotton
company o f Togo (NSCT), replaced the company's Board o f Directors and reactivated its
Oversight Committee. A series o f reforms is underway with World Bank support. These involve:
(i)hiring a firm to implement cost accounting with World Bank financial support; (ii)
establishing a reliable data management system and clear procedures for sales, debt, revenue and
procurement; and (iii)establishing a new cotton producer price mechanism linked to world
cotton prices, validated at a workshop on January 28,2009.

39. Other programs now beingexecuted inthe cotton sector involve:

 definingandimplementingthe cotton sector reform strategy, based on the strategic audit;
  strengthening of producer groups and consolidation o f unions of producer groups and their
umbrella organization;
 implementingdecisions to reduce productioncosts at all levels;
  funding o f research and rehabilitation o f rural roads in the cotton growing areas, cotton
warehouses and cotton ginneries;
 establishing an external audit for each fiscal year.

40. The ultimate goal is to achieve, as soon as possible, a sector consisting o f a private cotton
company with a minority stake heldby the State and producers.


Energy Sector Reforms

41. Togo remains highly dependent on foreign countries, including neighboring countries, for
fuel and electric energy. In 1998, then again in 2006-2007, the country suffered an energy crisis
characterized by long power cuts, which undermined economic growth and led to significant
losses in industrial production. Higher rainfall in Ghana in 2007 and a significant increase in



                                                 59

thermal production have ledto a partial returnto a balanced supply and demand for electricity in
2008.

42. Rehabilitated in 2006, the Electric Energy Company o f Togo (CEET) was entrusted with
distributing and selling electricity inTogo. Following the measures taken by the Government to
strengthen the company's governance, the Government has developed and adopted a 3 to 5 year
performance contract with CEET. It will also ensure clearance o f arrears o f public sector entities
toward CEET, and has budgeted a realistic amount for the entities' electricity consumption in
2009. Furthermore, the Government i s now commissioning a study o f financial conditions in
order to define the development strategy for the sector with World Bank financial support. This
strategy will eventually enable the adoption o f an automated tariff mechanism consistent with an
energy sector strategy to be developed as part o f the strategic review o f the sector. To strengthen
energy capacity, a contract has been signed with the company CONTOUR GLOBAL for the
production o f 100 MW o f thermal energy. Plans for the construction o f a hydroelectric power
plant at Adjarala are also under study. Also, the Government has equipped CEET with an
additional hydroelectric plant with 20 MGW power. Along with Benin and Ghana, Togo i s a
member o f the West African Power Pool (WAPP) for the development o f 330 KV aimed at
substantially increasing the supply o f electricity inthe countries o fthe sub-region.

43. The Government will carry out actions focusing mainly on: (i)strengtheningprivate sector
participation inthe development o f energy production; (ii)     intensifyingsub-regional cooperation
inthe production, purchase, sale and transportation of energy; (iii)     promoting and popularizing
the use of domestic gas (LPG); (iv) creating a fund for rural electrification; (v) establishing a
funding mechanism for the sector with the participation o f external donors and the national
financial system; (vi) raising awareness for the rational use o f all forms o f energy; (vii) seeking
financial sustainability for the sector by improving the collection rate, replacing certain
equipment and systematically paying the costs o f public consumption; and (viii) developing a
longer-term planfor the sector to ensure a supply o f lower-cost electricity to consumers.

Transport Sector Reforms

44. The Government's objectives for land transport are: (i) improve the competitiveness o f
                                                                  to
Togo's products in the domestic and foreign markets by reducing transport costs and providing
better quality services; (ii)to facilitate mobility o f people and goods; and (iii) contribute to
                                                                                     to
poverty reduction inurbanand rural areas through the elimination o f geographic isolation, access
to basic services, service to production areas and direct and indirect employment creation. In
order to enable the road transport sector to play its full role inthe development o fthe country, the
authorities have developed a transport sector strategy which i s currently under implementation.
However, the financial difficulties that the country has incurred inrecent years have not allowed
it to undertake investments at the level desired by the Government. Starting from 2005, the
Government has embarked on a revitalization o f road maintenance programs, in particular
through the Road Maintenance Fund (FER). Unfortunately, this structure has not met the
Government's expectations. As a result, FER was dissolved in 2008 and replaced by the Road
Fund (FR), the Autonomous Company for Tolls and Road Maintenance (CAPER) and the
National Road Council (CNR). The Government i s considering: (i)          building, rehabilitating and



                                                  60

maintaining rural and agricultural roads, urban roads, bridges, national and inter-State roads; (ii)
expanding or doubling sections on major access routes to the capital; (iii)     improving the core
routes o f the road network; (iv) supporting the private organization o f mass transport; and (v)
reviving the implementation o f common policies and regional projects within ECOWAS and
WAEMUinorder to improve the flow of goods andpeople. Followingthe flooding that occurred
in 2008, the Government undertook a large-scale emergency program to rehabilitate urban,
national and inter-State roads, andrebuilddestroyed bridges.

45. Under the maritime transport framework, important actions have been taken over the past
several years to improve the service quality at the Autonomous Port Authority o f Lome (PAL). In
this regard, port handling services were granted to three private companies, namely Manuport,
SE2M, and SE3M. Inaddition, the introduction o fthe Sydonia++ software to the customs post o f
the Port, has contributed to improving the efficiency and speed of port operations. Inthe short
term, there will be a preliminary evaluation to assess the performance o f the concessions and
implementmeasures to improve efficiency. Inthe mediumterm, additional efforts will be made
in the context of improving the competitiveness of PAL. In this perspective, the Port, in the
interest o f greater quality service for its customers, has developed a port development program
which includes the construction o f a third wharf and a basin to makethe Port o f Lome a hub for
the sub-region by increasing the capacity of the port, the development of several parking areas,
construction o f an inland dry port, the forthcoming establishment o f a one-stop window whose
main objective i s to facilitate and expedite the various formalities, and the establishment o f a
program to monitoring goods in transit. To enhance security, speed and efficiency o f port
operations, the port community established an association called the "Alliance for the Promotion
o f the Port o f Lome" (A2PL) whose main purpose i s to provide a framework for dialogue among
all players inTogo's maritimetransport network.

46. Inaddition, the Government intendsto establish a long-term vision for the development and
positioning o f PAL. To this end, a strategic study will be carried out inthe short term.

Social Sector Reforms

47. Social conditions continue to deteriorate. According to the United Nations Human
Development Index o f 2008, Togo ranks 152 out o f 177 countries. The health and education
services have deteriorated significantly, due to a decline in expenditures for these sectors, as
result o f budget difficulties. The Government is determined to reverse this trend by allocating a
greater share o f its budget resources to these sectors. This determination led to a substantial
allocation to these sectors inthe 2009 budget.

48. In the health sector, the Government i s finalizing a medium-termhealth development plan
(2008-2012). It also plans to submit a Health Code to the National Assembly for approval. Other
documents on hospital and pharmaceutical policies are being finalized. The Government also
plans to conduct an institutional audit o f the Health Ministry.In addition to these measures, the
Government will ensure that other actions are carried out, such as:            (i)strengthening of
infrastructure and equipment, strengtheningo f human resources, development o f a health map to
help more areas that are now poorly covered by the health system; (ii)   promotion o f maternal and



                                                  61

child health through access to preventive and curative services, implementation o f an Expanded
Program for Immunization (EPI), prevention o f sexually transmitted infections and the
implementation o f primary health care for infants and newborns; (iii) prevention and treatment o f
malaria through the supply and distribution of Mosquito Nets Impregnated with Insecticide
(MII), the reduction in prices of anti-malaria drugs and the implementation of a policy for
treating malaria; (iv) strengthening o f screening and treatment o f tuberculosis through increased
detection capabilities o f new cases o f Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TPM +) and improvement o f the
quality o f therapeutic care; and (v) prevention and treatment o f HIV/AIDS through awareness-
raising among youth and sex workers, distribution o f condoms, prevention o f STIs, blood safety,
counsel for voluntary and anonymous testing and capacity building for patient care. In this
framework, the Government decided in2008 to provide free antiretroviral drugs for the first time
to 4,000 HIV sero-positive persons.


49. To meet the completion point criteria for this sector, the Government will adopt the Medium-
term National Health Development Plan, including its HumanResources Management
component.

50. Inthe education sector, the Government aims to meet the challenges and solve institutional
problems faced by Togo's education system, with an emphasis on basic education. The main
specific objectives aim to reduce the contribution of families to the financing o f basic education,
to lower the school dropout rate and repetition rate. In 2008, the Government decided to make
pre-school and elementary school fiee o f cost. In2009, the Government intends to implement a
national education sector plan in which at least 500 newly hired teachers will be trained and at
least 4,000 experienced teachers will be retrained, and it plans to continue integrating volunteer
teachers and teachers' aides into the public service. The Government will also strive to: (i)
rehabilitate existing infrastructure, build new classrooms, and recruit and train trainers and
educators; (ii)encourage educational initiatives from non-governmental organizations, the
private sector and communities; (iii) the appropriateness and content ofthe programs; (iv)
                                      review
integrate inthe short-term all these actions into a sector program o f the Fast Track Initiative for
Education For All; (v) improve the conditions in technical education and vocational training to
ensure the recruitment, training and retraining o f teacherdtrainers; (vi) promote girl education
through the reduction o f tuition fees; (vii) improve quality and promote gender equity in higher
education; (viii) strengthen the facilities (suitable premises and equipment) to cope with the
increasingly large number o f students enrolled in universities inthe country; and (ix) update the
national literacy policy and review the content o fthe literacy programs.

51. The Government will begin implementing the National Education Sector Plan by training at
least 500 new teachers and retraining at least 4,000 experienced teachers, in compliance with the
completion point trigger for the sector.

52. Water and sanitation sectors: Access to safe water and sanitation facilities have been set as a
priority by the Government. To accomplish this, the Government intends to proceed with the
execution o f emergency sanitation work for rainwater for the city o f Lome and the development
o f sanitation master plans for cities other than LomC. The Government will set up a
comprehensive awareness program both at the household level for the use o f sanitation and



                                                 62

sewage facilities, and at the company level for the use o f appropriate sites for the dumping o f
sludge discharge andwastewater.

53. Supportfor community development: As part o f an urgent response to the needs of the poor,
the Government o f Togo and the World Bank are engaged in an emergency project for
community development. The main result o f the project will be to ensure that the country's poor
have greater access to quality public services and economic opportunities. Indeed, easy access to
improved services in health care, education, water supply and sanitation as well as transport
services and income-generating opportunities will solve some o f the more urgent problems o fthe
poorest communities o f Togo, especially inrural areas. The objective i s to ensure that after three
years, at the end o f the project, three hundred and fifty (350) sub-projects are completed. The
institutional mechanisms for the implementation o f this project include the establishment and
operation o f five regional community development funds and, at the central level, modest liaison
functions to facilitate coordination and relations with donors, and also to act on an advisory basis
infinancial management, disbursement andprocurement procedures.

111. OtherActivities

The PRSPandHIPCProcesses

54. The Government will have completed the preparation o f its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) by the first quarter o f 2009. The HIPC decision point was reached inNovember 2008 and
the Government is determinedto implementthe measures contained inthe full PRSP inorder to
reach the completion point in2010. To attain this goal, the Government i s determined to respect
its commitments to its partners.

MonitoringandEvaluation

55. The Ministry of Economy and Finance i s responsible for overall implementation o f the
program supported by the Second Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG-2). Day-
to-day monitoring and evaluation o f the program i s the responsibility o f the Permanent
Secretariat for Monitoring Reform Policies and Financial Programs (SP-SPRPF). This entity
coordinates the implementation o f the program within the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF), with the assistance of a committee for the monitoring of programs and reforms. The
Government will provide quarterly reports to the World Bank on implementation progress
measured against the agreed timetables and performance indicators.

56. The Government hopes that these economic and social policy reforms will help strengthen
financial cooperation with the World Bank and with all other bilateral and multilateral partners,
in order to mobilize the necessary resources to reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium
Development Goals by 2015.

Request for Funding

57. The Government is determined to rebuild the State by consolidating political stability,
strengtheningthe national reconciliation process and continuing the structural reforms begunto
promote sustained growth and sustainable economic and human development. To accomplish
this, the Government is determined to implement the program presented above and detailed in
the attached matrix. The Government therefore requests the World Bank's technical and financial
assistance to carry out its ambitious program through the Second Economic Recovery and
Governance Grant (ERGG-2).

This performance confirms a strong track record, starting from the beginning o f the program in
January 2008. On September 22,2008, the IMF Board concluded the first PRGF review,
welcoming government's resolve inmeetingthe quantitative targets and advancing structural
reforms, inparticular inthe area o fpublic financial management. To help Togo cope with the
impact o f the global price shocks and the consequences o fthe severe flooding that hitthe country
insummer 2008, the Boardalso augmentedthe PRGFarrangementbyanamount equivalent to
25% o f quota (SDR 18.35 million). Against this background, Togo's success inremaining on
track with its PRGF arrangementhas been commendable.

Fiscal performance was particularly strong in2008, althoughthe over-performance is partly due
to underspendingon emergency infrastructure repairs that highlights capacity limitations.
Revenue collection was strong, particularly for customs, reflecting improved administration and
enhanced computerization. Although the needs arising from the flooding were pressing, the
combination o f government prudence inproject spending and excessively complex procurement
procedures hamperedexpeditedstart-upof identified repair projects. As a result, the projected
domestic primary balance will be about +% percent o f GDP, compared with the program target o f
-?4 percent. The target on net domestic financing is expected to be met by a wide margin, with a
corresponding accumulation o f government deposits inthe bankingsystem.

Fundstaff supports the authorities' plansto shift the unspentpartofthe identified emergency
spending into early 2009, which will loosen the fiscal stance, with the understanding that
increased spendingwill focus on remaining repairs. The authorities are pursuingan action planto
enhance project spendingcapacity, consistent with adequate controls, through such means as
transparent and streamlinedprocurement rules. The limited capacity for managingprojects,
however, will continue to pose risks to full execution o fthe budget in2009. The authorities
concur that there are risks to growth and revenue due to the global slowdown, and Fundstaff are

advising a prudent approach to budget execution inthe first halfo f 2009, with close monitoring
o f revenue performance.

The global financial crisis posesthe most serious risks for Togo's economic revival andthe
programthat supports it. The PRGF-supported program should continue to provide a sound and
flexible framework to help the country cope with shocks. Inthe near term the program aims to
mitigate macroeconomic risks and lay the groundwork for broader reforms. Inthe mediumterm it
seeks to create the preconditions for a revival o f economic growth and external and fiscal
sustainability. While the program designremains substantially valid for fulfilling these goals
undercurrent circumstances, the global financial crisis may delay key elements o f an economic
revival, especially finding strategic investors for restructuring state owned banksand enterprises.
Inthe current global environment, the projectedmodest rebound inthe economic activity in2009
depends on realization o f increaseddonor support and addressing Togo's capacity constraints in
project identification and execution.

Growth-enhancingstructuralreforms

Reforms implemented duringthe preceding Staff Monitored Program and the first year o fthe
PRGF-arrangement are showing positive results interms o fpublic financial management
governance and effectiveness, and going forward the focus o fthe PRGF arrangement will
broaden to include reforms to restore the conditions for faster growth and poverty reduction. To
achieve this, strong actions are neededto reform the ailing state-owned banks and enterprises and
to improve the overall business environment, consistent with the country's Poverty Reduction
Strategy.

Withthe implementation o fplannedgrowth-enhancing reforms, the economy could achieve real
GDP growth o f about 4 percent annually by 2011, with a gradually improving fiscal position. The
fiscal stance in2009 will not harmlong-term debt indicators, given its temporary nature andpro-
growth focus. Assumingfull HIPC debt relief in2010, the primary domestic balance i s projected
to revert to a sustainable 1percent o f GDP surplus by 2011. Inflationary pressures are projected
to be moderate over the mediumterm. The medium-termreform strategy to support this scenario
would have two central elements: (i)   fiscal reforms to makeroom for growth-oriented spending
and strengthenfiscal and external sustainability; and (ii)  economic reforms aimed at raising
growth potential and external competitiveness, particularly steps to reform state-owned banks
and enterprises. As highlighted inthe LIC DSA conducted for HIPC decisionpoint (November
2008), positive debt dynamics dependon this acceleration ingrowth and fiscal strengthening,
evenwith full HIPC relief. Satisfactory performance under the PRGF will be an essential element
inreachingthe HIPCcompletionpoint.

We therefore believethat the PRGF supported program will provide a sound macroeconomic
framework to guide the reform efforts. Staff will continue to conduct biannual missions to
monitor performance and maintain close coordination with donors.
