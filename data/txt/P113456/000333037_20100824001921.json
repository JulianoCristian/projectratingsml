for the Second Economic Recovery\n            and Governance Grant Project for Togo were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            seeking synergies between prior actions and follow-up\n            measures can help amplify their effect, for example, the\n            publication of phosphate revenues, together with the\n            recapitalization of the banks and the referral of\n            irregularities in the cotton sector to the Minister of\n            Justice can be considered to have had a cumulative impact on\n            the re-building of public confidence in government, a major\n            underlying goal of reforms to promote transparency and\n            better governance. The continuity of Bank staff is important\n            as it helps create an institutional memory. Staff has been\n            stable since 2005 in the case of financial sector reform, as\n            well as continuity and growing experience of key Government\n            officials in both the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)\n            and concerned line ministries. The importance of\n            arrangements for ensuring responsive technical assistance to\n            fill knowledge gaps or fine tune reform measures, the\n            Low-Income Country Under Stress (LICUS) trust fund and\n            ongoing operations such as the financial sector and\n            governance project are examples."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
