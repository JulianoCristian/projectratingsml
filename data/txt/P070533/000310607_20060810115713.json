The\n            Agricultural Rehabilitation Project had the following\n            ratings: moderately satisfactory outcome, unlikely\n            sustainability, modest institutional development impact,\n            satisfactory Bank performance, and not rated Grantee\n            performance.

Experience with these\n            projects highlights the following lessons: 1) With its\n            global outreach and the expertise and experience of its\n            staff the Bank is well positioned to make a substantial\n            contribution to post-conflict reconstruction and\n            development.  However, the experience of the three community\n            empowerment and the two agriculture rehabilitation projects\n            shows that careful thought to suitability of design and\n            strategies to country conditions is paramount, especially\n            where country capacity is weak; 2) even in the case of\n            post-conflict Timor-Leste, where sophisticated monitoring\n            and evaluation was impractical, there was a need to have a\n            system to track project inputs, outputs, and outcomes and\n            provide information about the adaptations needed in project\n            design to ensure that the project objectives and activities\n            are in keeping with the emerging institutional context and\n            the absorptive capacity of the country; 3) particularly in\n            post-conflict environments, an approach to capacity building\n            that considers the underlying capacity in the country as\n            well as how it would be promoted by the various donors is\n            critical; and 4) the experience of Timor-Leste highlights\n            the critical importance of coordinating multi-agency\n            reconstruction efforts more effectively in a newly\n            independent post-conflict country."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
