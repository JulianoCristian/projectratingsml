Boosting Self-Reliance in East Timor                                                                        July 1, 2002
                       The birth of the world's newest independent nation, East Timor, came at tremendous cost to its people.
                       The violence of 1999 destroyed much of East Timor's rural sector, with farms destroyed, processing
                       machinery smashed, tools stolen and farm animals killed.  Food and seed stocks were looted.  Overall,
                       economic production dropped by 49 percent in 1999 from the year before.

                        Through the First Agriculture Rehabilitation Project, the World Bank-administered Trust Fund for East
                        Timor has helped communities get farm animals and farm tools, repaired small irrigation schemes and
                        roads, and trained agriculture staff.  A second phase of this initiative, approved in June 2001, aims to
build on the successful community-based activities of the first project by improving food security for farm families and
increasing agricultural production.

So far, the project has helped vaccinate more than 100,000 cattle and buffalo, and nearly 250,000 pigs.  In addition, more
than 71,000 chickens have been given to farmers and poor women of  some 14,000 families.  More than 3,000 Bali cattle and
buffalo have also been provided to farmers who lost their livestock during the violence in 1999.

The First Agriculture Rehabilitation Project helped to establish three agricultural service centers to boost rice and coffee
production and marketing, and has supported the processing of candle-nut into tung oil.  The project has provided community
grants for the rehabilitation of 7,742 hectares of small irrigation fields and 109 kilometers of rural access roads.  More than a
thousand radios have been given away to people living in 14 separate communities to ensure they can stay in touch with the
issues facing their
new nation.
