Through the first agriculture rehabilitation\n            project, the World Bank-administered trust fund for east\n            Timor has helped communities get farm animals and farm\n            tools, repaired small irrigation schemes and roads, and\n            trained agriculture staff. A second phase of this\n            initiative, approved in June 2001, aims to build on the\n            successful community-based activities of the first project\n            by improving food security for farm families and increasing\n            agricultural production. More than a thousand radios have\n            been given away to people living in 14 separate communities\n            to ensure they can stay in touch with the issues facing\n            their new nation."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
