Because the trust fund for East Timor\n            does not have all the necessary project funding at this\n            stage, project financing will be divided into two grants.\n            The first grant finance priority activities to be carried\n            out during the initial 12 months of the project. The\n            components that will be financed under this grant include:\n            a) priority productive asset restoration which will conduct\n            national vaccination campaigns to immunize cattle, small\n            ruminants, and pigs, etc; b) irrigation and rural\n            infrastructure studies, rehabilitation, and maintenance,\n            which will cover community rehabilitation and maintenance of\n            irrigation infrastructure and agriculture access roads,\n            procurement of equipment, and feasibility and engineering\n            studies to identify feasible irrigation improvements and\n            selecting the schemes where rehabilitation would be most\n            viable; and c) pilot agriculture services centers, to\n            provide farming communities with farm inputs, mechanization\n            services, etc;.
