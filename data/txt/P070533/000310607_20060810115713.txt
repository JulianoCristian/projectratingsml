    IEG Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence inevaluation.


 About this Report
      The IndependentEvaluationGroup (IEG)assessesthe programs and activitiesof the World Bankfor two
 purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank`s self-evaluationprocessand to verifythat the Bank`s work is
 producingthe expected results,and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough
 the disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEG annuallyassesses about 25 percentof
 the Bank's lendingoperations. Inselecting operationsfor assessment,preferenceis given to thosethat are
 innovative,large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcoming studies or countryevaluations;thosefor which
 ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;andthosethat are likelyto generate
 importantlessons.The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluation
 studies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a review of the ImplementationCompletion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conducted by IEG. To prepare
 PPARs, IEGstaff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowingcountry for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
 validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interestto broader
 IEG studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and IEG management approval. Once cleared internally,the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank departmentand amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank`s
 Board of Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.
About the IEG Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEG are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
 methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluationcriterion (more information is available on the IEGwebsite:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project'sobjectives are consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressedin Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
accounttheir relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Susfainabilify: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      InstitutionalDevelopment Impact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignmentof the mission and capacity of an organizationwith its mandate, which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project`s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expectedto be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (includingensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regularoperation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparationand implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievementof development objectives and sustainability. Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

The purpose o fthis report i s to assess individualproject performance as well as to informan
Independent EvaluationGroup-World Bank (IEGWB)study on Low-Income Countries under
Stress (LICUS). Hence, the report goes beyondindividual project assessmentsto examine relevant
cross-project issues inpost-conflict reconstruction. The report consists o f five Project Performance
Assessments, complementedby a review o f opportunities and challenges inpost-conflict Timor-
Leste. The projects assessedwere supported under a multidonor Trust Fundfor East Timor
(TFET) andimplementedbythe WorldBank. The projects assessedare as follows:
     Community and Local Governance Project (Project IDP069762), for which a US$7.00
    millionTFET grant and a US$1.55 millionJapanese grant were signed inFebruary 2000. The
    project closedon June 30,2002.
     Second Community Empowerment Project (Project IDP072356), for which a grant o f
    US$8.50 millionwas signed on May 21,2001. The project closed on March 31,2004.
    ThirdCommunity Empowerment and LocalGovernance Project (Project IDP075342), for
    which a grant of US$1.50 millionwas signed on July 1,2002. The project closed on March
     31,2004. A combined completion report was produced for the three Community
    Empowerment projects and submitted on May 9,2005.
    Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Project IDP070533), for which a grant o f US$6.8 million
    was signed on June 21,2000. The project closed inSeptember 2002, three months behind
    schedule. An Implementation Completion Report was submitted on March 25,2003.
    Second Agriculture RehabilitationProject (Project IDPO7391l),          for which a grant o f US$8
    millionwas signed on October 29,2001, The project became effective inDecember 2001,
    The project closed on June 15,2005, a year and a halfbehind schedule. An Implementation
    Completion Report was submitted on June 27,2005.
The report has beenprepared by IEGWBbasedonthe Implementation CompletionReports,
Project Appraisal Documents, Grant Agreements, as well as a review o f Bank files, joint donor
mission andTFET reports, and a survey o f the literature. An IEGmission traveled to Timor-Leste
inOctober 2005 anddiscussedtheprojectswithBankstaff, government officials, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), beneficiaries, donors, and consultants. Discussions were also heldwithBank
staffbasedinWashington. The cooperation and assistanceof all stakeholders and government
officials i s gratefully acknowledged, as isthe support of the staff o fthe WorldBank Country Office
inDili.The report also benefitedconsiderably from aEuropeanUnioninterimevaluationofthe
TFETprogram.
While the findingso f the project assessments served as a springboard for the section on cross-
project challenges inpost-conflict Timor-Leste, the discussion inthis section o fthe report goes
beyondthe evidence contained inthe project assessments andbuildsonthe considerable literature
available on the post-conflict experience o f Timor-Leste.
Following standard IEGprocedures, the draft report was sent to the Grantee for comments before
beingfinalized. No comments were received.

 Summary

 Seventy-nine percent o f the people o f East Timor voted for independencefrom.Indonesiaina
 1999referendum. Inthe two weeks following the referendum, members o f the pro-integration
 faction destroyed mucho f the new country's infrastructure as well as many o f its meager
 productive assets-its    farms and markets. The 1997 Asian financial crisis had already devastated
 East Timor, so the violence further undermined an already poor and weakened economy.

 The international community responded swiftly.The UnitedNations Transitional Administration
 inEast Timor (UNTAET)was established inlate October with amandateto ensure stability and
 establish a transitional government. It was also charged with oversight of the country's
reconstruction, development o f Timorese capacity, and ultimately, transfer o f all functions to a
 Timorese administration. InDecember 1999 donors met inTokyo, pledgedmore than $500
 millioninassistance over three years, and endorsed the creation of the ConsolidatedFundfor
 East Timor (CFET) to be managed by UNTAETand the Trust Fundfor East Timor (TFET) under
 the trusteeship ofthe WorldBankwith the AsianDevelopmentBank(ADB)as co-implementer.
 CFETresources were to beusedto establish public administration, rehabilitate administrative
buildings, andbuildcapacity, technical systems, and ajudicial system. TFET resources were to
 support sector reconstructionprograms implemented as IDA or ADB projects. InMay 2002,
UNTAETtransferredcontrolto the government of anindependent Timor-Leste, which was
 accepted into the UnitedNations on September 27,2002.

The five projects assessedinthisreport were supported from TFET and accountedfor 21percent
o f the total TEFT grants. The overall objective o f the three Community Empowerment Projects
(CEPs) was to strengthen local capacity to buildinstitutions that reduce poverty and support
inclusive patterns o f growth. The projects followed a community-driven development (CDD)
model and attemptedto builda structure o f local governance by supporting the creation o f
democratically elected village development councils. Boththe Agriculture Rehabilitation Projects
(ARP Iand 11)focused on improvingfood security and agricultural production and onpromoting
rural growth. While ARP Iwas an emergency recovery operation, ARP I1was meant to address
longer-term development challenges inthe agriculture sector.
Underthe unusual circumstances of Timor-Leste at the time, with the UNacting as government,
and the World Bank assigned a major part o f the responsibility for managingresources for
reconstruction, the Bank had a very highlevel o fresponsibility for the design and implementation
o f these five projects. As it was an emergency situation, Bank procedures were streamlined to
accelerate project preparation and the projects were approved at the vice presidential levelrather
than by the Board. While this hastenedthe delivery o f assistance andproject implementation, it
also hada cost.
The five projects successfully ensuredthat funds were quickly made available to ruralcommunities
andremote areas andprovided for the constructiono f considerable physical infiastructure (although
the recordo f detailed outputs i s incomplete). However, the hasty delivery also ledto weaknesses in
project design andimplementation andtoo little attentionto the political, social, andeconomic
context inwhich the projects were to be implemented. Inconsequence, the quickresults ultimately
achieved were not the most appropriate ones for long-run sustainable development. Withthe benefit
o fhindsight, it is easy to see why this happened: the needs o f the people of Timor-Leste were great
and internationalpressure to achieve early results was high.

The three CEPs were highly visible, created temporary employment for many people, and built a
large amount o f community infrastructure. However, the quality o f the infrastructure constructed
was underminedby lack o f familiarity at the local levelwith standards and procedures. Moreover,

                                                   xii


the distribution o f funds was not always transparent, resulting inwidely-reported cases o f elite
 capture. The village development councils createdby the project bypassed traditional leaders and
 failed to become the foundation o f a local governance structure. Instead, the councils were
primarily seenby beneficiaries as conduits for channeling the donor money and were unable to
 assume the role of development agents intheir communities. Nor is there any evidence that they
 are capable o f supporting inclusive patterns of growth leading to poverty reduction. Neither were
the projects able to meetmost o fthe reconstructionneedsvisualized inthe immediate aftermath
 o f the conflict. The experience o fthe CEPs shows that when aproject usinga community demand-
 drivenapproachis implementedundertremendous timepressure, actual results maynotreflect
genuine community needsnor the goals o freconstruction. Project efficiency was also modest.
Basedonthe modest relevance, efficacy, and efficiency o f the projects, their outcome is rated
unsatisfactory.Basedon the failure ofthe village development councils and the projects'
inability to effectively buildcapacity, institutionaldevelopmentimpact i s rated modest and
 sustainabilityi s rated unlikely. Inthe light o fthe significant shortcomings inproject designand
implementation supervision Bankperformancei s rated unsatisfactory.Project implementation
was largely driven by the pressure to deliver funds, rather than the need for development results.
Too little attention was given to the level o f capacity inthe communities to identify needs and
prepare developmentproposals. Management oversight o f fiduciary compliance was also weak.

While bothARPs met several quantitative targets for vaccination o f livestock, constructiono f
irrigation schemes, and rehabilitationo froads, the quality o fthose achievements i s questionable.
The contributiono fthe projects to long-termfood security was limited as most activities they
supported are unsustainable andthe projects didnot address some issues critical for the promotion
o f food security (such as issuesrelevant to the cultivation o fthe main staple crops maize and
cassava) andthe enhancement o f agricultural production (such as the cost o f inputs).ARP Iwas an
emergency operation butARP 11was meant to be movingtoward tackling the long-term
development challenges inagriculture and shouldhave takenthese issues into account. The
outcomeofARP Iisratedmoderatelysatisfactorywhereasthat o fARP 11i s ratedmoderately
unsatisfactory.As community commitment o frehabilitationactivities andmaintenance i s low and
the government is strugglingto carry on with the vaccinationprogram, sustainabilityfor both
projectsis ratedunlikely.Bankperformanceis rated satisfactory for ARP I(albeit marginally so)
butunsatisfactoryfor ARP II. keepingwithits goal of addressing longer-termdevelopment
                                  In
challenges inthe sector, ARP 11shouldhave corrected for some o f the design weaknesses that were
present inARP I.    Inparticular, weaknessinmonitoringandevaluationandcapacitybuildingshould
have receivedmuchmore attention. As inthe CEPs, the pressure to achieve quickresults negatively
affected project design and implementation.As acknowledged by the Bank's own completion
report, a better understanding o f farming systems and livelihoodopportunities andthe most severe
pockets of food insecurity andits causes could have ledto an improved design o f ARP II's activities
andwouldhave improvedthe project's overall outcome.

The Bankhadthe primaryresponsibility for designing o fboththe CEP andthe agriculture
projects and where applicable Grantee performance i s rated on implementation only. The
assessmentdoes not rate Grantee performance for CEP Isince there was no national government
duringthe implementationperiodofthe project. Grantee performance is rated satisfactory for
CEP I1and I11on implementation. The project management unit staff, acting under Bank
supervision, did what they could to implement the projects, inspite o f design weaknesses. The
relations betweenthe project management unit and the government were not close and it is not
clear how well informedthe latter was about the overall CEP program. Further, formal
government structures were still getting strengthened duringthe implementation periodfor CEP
I1andI11as limitedcapacity was one ofthebiggestconstraints facedbythe government.For

                                                 xiii


ARP IGrantee performance i s notrated as there was nonational government for most o fthe
implementationperiod. For ARP 11,Grantee performance i s rated satisfactory.

The experience ofthe fiveprojects offers four lessons for the Bank's future involvement inpost-
conflict situations. Ingeneral, such interventions may require greater Bank management oversight
than usual since projects are prepared quickly and implemented under very difficult conditions.
IEG's 1998 review ofthe Bank's experience with post-conflictreconstruction hadnotedthe
importance o fproactive involvement by senior Bank management as arequirement for Bank
assistance ina post-conflict context.

        P Withits global outreach andthe expertise andexperience ofits stafftheBankis well-
             positioned to make a substantial contribution to post-conflict reconstructionand
             development. However, the experience of the three community empowerment and
             the two agriculture rehabilitation projects shows that careful thought to suitability o f
             design and strategies to country conditions i s paramount, especially where country
             capacity i s weak. Mistakes can be difficult and expensive to correct.
        P Eveninthe case ofpost-conflict Timor-Leste, where sophisticated M&Ewas
             impractical, there was a needto have a system to track project inputs, outputs, and
             outcomes and also provide information about the adaptations needed inproject
             designto ensure that the project objectives and activities are inkeepingwith the
             emerging institutional context and the absorptive capacity of the country. IEG's 1998
             Review o f the Bank's experience with post-conflict reconstruction hadnoted that a
             post-conflict context requires that operations receive more intensive monitoringto
             ensure their continuedrelevance, as well as effectiveness and efficiency.
        P Particularly inpost-conflict environments, anapproachto capacitybuildingthat
             considers the underlyingcapacity inthe country as well as how it would be promoted
             bythe various donors is critical. Itcannot be assumed that government capacity will
             get builtduringproject implementation through on-the-job transfer o f expertise fi-om
             international advisors andproject-supported training activities.
        P The experience ofTimor-Leste highlightsthe criticalimportanceofcoordinating
            multi-agency reconstruction efforts more effectively ina newly independent post-
            conflict country. While the international community was able to raise a large amount
            o f resources for development o f Timor-Leste, there was lack o f agreement between
            the major players on critical strategies, inparticular those dealing with promotiono f
            micro-credit and local governance. This worked bothto the detrimento f the donors
            and the country and ledto less effective and efficient utilizationo fresources.

 1.       Introduction
 1.1      Timor-Leste occupies the easternpart o f the island o f Timor, the easternmost o f the
Lesser Sunda Islands.' The Indonesianprovince o f Nusa Tenggara Timur i s on its west, the Savu
Sea and the Strait of Wetar lie to the north, and Australia i s to the south. The country has a land
area o f approximately 14,610 square kilometers, a coastline o f about 700 kilometers and a total
population o f 923,198 people (2004 estimate). The area hadbeena Portuguese colony from the
sixteenth century and was annexedby Indonesiain 1975. It gained independence in 1999.

 1.2      Evenbefore its independence Timor-Leste was poor-the         poorest part o f Indonesia.
Today, the world's newestnation i s also among its poorest, with bothlow income and poor social
indicators. Per capita income has been estimated at US$370 per year (UNDP 2006). Timor-Leste
ranks 158 out o f 177 countries according to the HumanDevelopmentIndex (2002), making it the
lowest ranked country outside o f Sub-Saharan Africa. About 60 percent o f the population lives
below less than dollar a day (UNWFP 2005) and a recent poverty assessment found 41 percent o f
the populationbelow the national poverty line (established at an equivalent o f US$0.55 per
personper day). Poverty incidence is higher inrural areas (46 percent) than inurban areas (26
percent) andthe poorest groups are inhouseholds that have small landholdings or are headedby
fishermen (National DevelopmentPlan2002). The non-poor are more likely to produce higher
paying crops such as coffee.

1.3       Timor-Leste had been devastated by the 1997 Asian financial crisis which hadhit
Indonesiahard. Evenbefore the financial crisis, however, East Timor hadnot been self-sufficient
instaple food production for the precedingthree decadesandrankedat the bottomofIndonesian
provinces interms o f food security and agricultural productivity in 1997 (Pedersen and Arneberg
1999). Foodinsecurity i s most prevalent inuplandrural areas. Ninety percent o f the population
suffers food shortage for at least one month inthe year and a large percentage experiences food
shortages from 3 to 5 months every year (WFP/FAO/Donor, 2003). Among the several causes o f
food insecurity are low yields, vulnerability to climate variability, natural disasters, highpost-
harvest losses, and limitedaccessto markets.


INDEPENDENCEAND ITS           AFTERMATH

1.4       The annexation o f East Timor byIndonesia was followed by two and a half decades o f
struggle for Timorese independence. A May 1999 agreement between Indonesia and Portugal
led to a referendumthat offered a choice between special autonomy for East Timor within
Indonesia or full independence. InAugust 1999, 79 percent o f the population voted for
independence. Inthe two weeks following the vote, members o f the pro-integration faction
destroyed over 80 percent o f Timor's houses and public buildings, includingmore than two-thirds
o f its health facilities and schools. More than 1,500 people were killed and about 250,000 were
displaced or forcibly movedto West Timor. About a thirdo f the displacedpeople returned within
six months to findtheir homes, crops, farming supplies, and other means o f livelihooddestroyed.

1.5      The violence exacerbated the problems o f an already poor and weakened economy. The
agricultural sector, the largest employer and contributor to the country's gross domestic product
(GDP), was badlyhit.Agricultural domestic product declinedby49 percent relative to the
previous year. Foodcrops, livestock, and fisheries suffered the most significant decline. Irrigation
structures deteriorated severely due to neglect and lack o f maintenance and over 85 percent o f the



1.Timor-Lestewas adoptedas the official nameofEast Timor inNovember2002.

                                                          2


 fishingvessels were reportedly destroyed. According to the 2001 Suco Survey,' 58 percent of
 goats, 48 percent o f cattle, and 47 percent o fpigswere destroyed. Inaddition, homes and markets
were burned, farming infrastructure and implements smashed, farm and food processing
machinery destroyed or stolen, and food stocks and seeds looted.

 1.6       The international community responded swiftly to the crisis. The UnitedNations
 Transitional Administration inEast Timor (UNTAET) was established on October 25, 1999,
 under a Security Council Resolution to ensure stability and establish a transitional government. In
 December 1999, donors met inTokyo and pledgedmore thanUS$500 millioninassistance to the
 country over the next three years and endorsed the creation o f two trust funds.

 1.7       UNTAETwas given a mandate to overseethe country's reconstruction, develop
 Timorese capacity, and implement a strategy to hand over functions to a Timorese administration.
 Peace was restoredquickly under a UnitedNations-led administration. InJuly 2000 the process
 of "Timorization" o f the government structure beganwith the formation o f the East Timor
 Transitional Administration (ETTA) and the appointment o f five Timorese Cabinet Ministers. An
 election was held inAugust 2001and a Council o fMinisters, ledby a ChiefMinister, was
 appointed along with a Constituent Assembly o f 88 members with a mandate to write the
 country's constitution. The economy recovered-GDP                that had declined by 34 percent in 1999
 grew by 15 percent in2000 and 18 percent in2001.By 2001the principal development
indicators were at or near their pre-crisis levels. On May 3,2002, the first National
Development Plan, that outlined a strategy for transition o f the country from reconstructionto
national development with a clear focus on growthandpoverty reduction, was published and 17
days later, on May 20, UNTAEThandedover control to the government o f an independent
Timor-Leste. The country was accepted into the UnitedNations on September 27, 2002.3


THEWORLD BANKIN EAST               TIMOR

 1.8      The Bankbecame involved inthe planning for East Timor's development before the 1999
ballot: InApril o fthat year it established a separate program for East Timor withinthe PNGPacific
Islands Country unit.The Bankwas notpart o fthepolitical deliberations that shapedthe post-
conflict arrangementsinTimor-Leste (Schiavo-Campo 2003). Butbefore the ballot, it didwork
withthe UNDepartment ofPoliticalAffairs oneconomic issuesfor the country. The Bankalso
participatedina Columbia University study of social and economic conditions inEast Timor. In
addition, as apart o fits assistanceto Indonesia, the Bankprovided support for activities inEast
Timor, among others, through the Kecamatan DevelopmentProject (KDP).

1.9       After the referendumin 1999, the Bank organizeda meeting o fthe Friends o f East Timor
at the time o f the Annual Meetings inWashington. Followingthe meeting the Bank organized a

(village) survey, a householdsurvey, and aparticipatorypotentialassessment.
3. OnMay 20,2002 the UnitedNationsMission of Support in EastTimor (UNMISET) replacedUNTAET. UNMISET
was given the mandateto assist key statebuilding efforts and provide interim law enforcement and security.UNMISET
handedover all policingand externalsecurityto the government on 20 May2004. The substantially reduced
UNMISETseized to functionon20 May2005.
4. Only since the mid-1990shas the Bankagainbegunto be activeinpost-conflictcountries.In1994the Bankwas
askedto administerthe multi-donorHolstFundfor West Bank and Gaza. The reconstructionprograminBosnia

January 2000, TFET was expanded into a multi-donor trust fund. CFET resources were to be used
for public administration, including recruitment andpayment o f civil servants, rehabilitation o f
administrative buildings,capacity-building, technical systems, and the justice sector. TFET
resources were to support sector reconstruction programs implemented as IDA or ADB projects.
The ADB was to administer TFETprojects inroads, ports, water facilities, telecommunications,
power and micro-finance, while the World Bank was responsible for TFET projects inhealth,
education, agriculture, private sector development, and economic capacity building.

2.       Timor's ReconstructionandDevelopment:Opportunities
         and Challenges
2.1      Several factors provided Timor-Leste with a unique opportunity to tackle its long-term
development after independence, though many challenges stood inthe way. This section first
discusses the opportunities and then the challenges.




5. The mission was ledby the World Bank, UNTAET,and several Timorese and had representation from major donors
and UNagencies. An IMFmission also accompanied the JAM.

  THEOPPORTUNITIES

  2.2      Three factors represented opportunities for the small islandnation. First, Timor-Leste,
  like several post-conflict counties inAfrica and southeastern Europe, had sufferedhighphysical
  destruction and the collapse o f state structures, but unlike those other countries, Timor-Leste did
  not experience aprolonged and divisive civil war. The root cause o f the conflict inTimor was
  foreign occupation; once that ended, so did the conflict. While incursions from pro-integrationist
  militias continued to impede reconstructioninthe western provinces for some time, overall peace
  came quickly after the violence providing a favorable climate for reconstruction.6Second, a large
  amount o f aid was mobilized following the conflict. TFET receivedUS$169 million for the
 reconstruction-on a per capita basis the highest amount o f aid ever mobilizedby the
  international community through multi-donor trust funds (Table 2.1). The World Bank was
  crucial inhelpingmobilize those resources. Third, since the Bank was the trustee and
  administrator o f TFET, the institution's international experience and expertise was available for
  helpingwithreconstruction and development. IEG's 1998 review ofthe Bank's experience with
 post-conflict reconstruction notes rebuildingphysical infrastructure as an area o f strength (World
  Bank 1998). TFET was designed to provide flexible grant funding, both quick disbursingaid and
  longer-term investment programs.

 THECHALLENGES

 2.3       Despite the favorable climate and the abundance o f aid, three circumstances made the
 reconstruction extremely challenging. The rest o f this section discussesthese.


 Ambiguous Role of the TransitionalGovernment

 2.4       No national government existedduringthe initial reconstructionperiod, so the UN
 transitional administration was made the legal government o f East Timor and had overall
 responsibility for administration of the territory and exercised all legislative and executive
 authority, including the administration o fjustice.' This created an ambiguous situation:' while the
 UNwas thelegalgoverningauthority, italso was amissionofthe UNandhencehadaroleinthe


 6. "The security factor istakenfor grantedandforgottenincases when orderhasbeenre-establishedquickly, butas Sierra
 LeoneandAfghanistanshow, insecurityisby far the most severeconstraintto reconstructionefforts" Schiavo-Campo2003.
 7. "A potential local partner did exist, inthe form oftheNational Council for TimoreseResistance(CNRT), the
 umbrella organizationofpro-independencegroup. However, UNTAET treated the CNRT as apolitical partlyrather
 than as proto-government,and kept its distance." Schiavo-Campo2003.
 8. Thus UNTAET was the legalgovernmentof Timor-Leste throughoutmost ofthe reconstructionperiod, which
 createdconsiderableconfusionover who constitutedlegitimate Timoreserepresentatives for decisionmaking.

 promotiono f the operations o f UNagencies. Inits governing capacityit was also the counterpart
 to UNagencies and other donors (Rohland and Cliffe 2002).

 2.5       At the time it seems that this ambiguous rolewas largely unrecognized, as the UNhad
 never played such a role before. Inother post-conflict countries inwhich ithadbeenpresent it
 hadresponsibility primarily to prevent the resurgence o f hostilities after the conflict hadended. In
 Timor, as the sovereign government, the UNhad the power to enact new laws andregulations and
 to amend, suspend, andrepeal existing ones. As the government, UNTAETwas also to establish
 fullgovernmental structures andprepare the territory for independence.

 2.6       Apart from the scale o f this responsibility, the effort was hindered by the U N ' s limited
 knowledge o f the country at the time. Project files for the five projects under review and the
 literature indicate that World Bank staff also were not clear about the role o f the UNand didnot
 consider it the sovereign government." However, Bank management began to realize as early as
 2000 that the ambiguous role o fthe UNwas creating confusion for project implementation, yet
 not much appears to have been done to provide clarity to Bank staff.


 Nonexistent Government Capacity and Professional Expertise

 2.7       The reconstructionand development needs o f post-conflict Timor-Leste were massive,
 butthere was no government capacity or professionalexpertise to meet those needs. The
 institutional and human capital o f the territory was heavily damaged by the violence (World Bank
 2000). Teachers, managers, administrators, engineers, accountants, doctors, nurses, plumbers,
 electricians, and other professionalswere inshort supply (World Bank 2005). With the departure
 o f the Indonesianresidents, Timor-Leste faced a complete brain drain." The majority o f
 government officials, includingstaff of the Ministryo f Agriculture at the senior levels were
 Indonesians who left the country. The JAMmission concluded that the Indonesianwithdrawal o f
 government staffhadresultedina localpower vacuum that hadto be filled quickly. However,
 analysts note that the JAM conclusion was based on anarrow focus on government institutions
 and didnot consider the informalpower structure, which was intact (Hohe 2004, Chopra and

 10.Itwas not clear what was the natureofthe relationshipwhichwas to bebetweenthe two organizations. "Relations

 Hohe 2004).'21l3Traditional institutions and traditional village structures, legitimizedby culture,
 had shown considerable resilience through both the Portuguese and Indonesianperiods and
 continued to operate duringthe crisis period (Annex B). While several Suco (village) chiefs were
 among the thousands of people inrefugee camps inWest Timor, these positions hadbeen quickly
 filled inaccordance with traditional practices.


 CoordinationAmong Activities of NumerousDonors Continued to Be a Challenge

 2.8       Post-conflict Timor-Leste receivedmore aidthan most recent post-conflict countries,
 whose experience hadhighlightedthe importance o f aid coordination. The JAM identified
 priority reconstructionobjectives across sectors and the TFET was seen as a means for
 coordination. The TFETbrought together contributions from several donors under one trust fund
 and hada comprehensive donor coordination mechanism. The Donor Council met twice a year to
 discuss and approve work programs (though these meetings were reduced to one a year after May
 2002), and the Bank, as administrator, ensured comprehensive reporting to donors and several
joint donor missions were heldinkey sectors. This potentially offered great scope for donor
 cooperation on reconstruction inTimor.

 2.9       However, about halfthe resources available to the country for reconstructionand
 development were provided outside the TFET by donors who usedtheir own policies and
 procedures (EU2004). Several o fthe major TFET donors (Portugal, AusAid, JICA) hadtheir
 own programs indifferent sectors outside TFET.USAID,which only made a small contribution
 to TFET, provided most o f its assistanceoutside the trust fund. Several o f these donors (AusAid,
 USAID)hadbeenprovidingsupport to Timor-Leste duringIndonesianperiod.I4

 2.10     The coordination challenge i s illustrated by the situationwith the Ministryo f Agricultural
 Affairs (later the Ministryo f Agriculture Forests and Fisheries, or MAFF).Inaddition to the ARP
projects supported by TFET, several donors had separateprojects and programs inthe agriculture
 sector. For example, AusAid supported a Seeds of Life program carried out incooperationwith
the Australian Centre for InternationalAgricultural Research. Some o f the separate projects were
 integrated into MAFFactivities, while others built parallel structures outside MAFFto overcome
capacity limitations (Republica Democratica de Timor-Leste 2004). Consequently, inaddition to
thejoint agricultural donor missions, there were multiple other donor missions which strainedthe
capacity o f the government. Coordination was also inadequate on ensuring that all issues relevant
to the agriculture sector were covered. For example, agriculture service delivery and land use
planning were included inseveral donor programs while other subsectors, such as watershed
management, received little support.

2.11      Tasks unrelated to projects were also a challenge. For example, Timor-Leste received
donations o f goods from other nations that needed to be distributed. Bank supervision missions


12."There is never avacuumofpower on the ground.Evenwhen there is the completeabsence of an identifiable state
government or any semblance of governinginstitutions-as was the case when Indonesianforces withdrew from East
Timor or when Somaliadisintegrated-traditional structures evolve, social organizationis redefined, andpeople
continueto survive, filling the space; ifit ever existedinthe first place." Chopraand Hohe2004.

existent or inadequate.Infact Timor-Lestehas manytraditional rural structures that havesurvived centuries of colonial

 note that the implementation o f the ARP Iproject was handicappedbecause staff were
 overburdenedby other non-project related tasks such as the distribution o f US$6.0 millionin
 agriculture inputsdonated by the Chinese government. Similarly, several agencies delivered
 humanitarian aid inthe emergency situation and there was little coordination o f their activitie~.'~



 3.        CommunityEmpowermentProjects(CEPs)
 3.1       This section and the next assess the three cornunity empowerment and the two agriculture
 projects. Though implemented over a period o f about four years, CEP was processed as three
 separate projects inthe Bank's database and accounting systems presumably because committed
 TFETresources became available at different times. However, they were reviewedas one project
 bythe completion report and this assessmentalso presentsa combinedreview o f all three
 projects.

 OVERVIEW       OF CEPS

 3.2      The overall objective o f the three Community Empowerment Projects (CEPs) was to
 strengthen local-level social capital to buildinstitutions that reduce poverty and support inclusive
 patterns o f growth.16Through the creation o f development councils the projects aimed to reduce
 poverty by strengthening the institutional capacity o f sub-districts and villages. The projects were
 also attempting to builda structure o f local governance as inthe longer term, the village
 development councils were expected to prepare and execute village development plans that would
 address localneeds invarious sectors, produce village codes o f conduct andresolve disputes,
 manage village funds, and relay priority development needs that couldnot be met through local
 efforts to sub-districts and districts.


 PROJECT DESIGN         AND IMPLEMENTATION

 3.3      The project design was based on the KecamatanDevelopment Project (KDP) in
 Indonesia. The largestcomponent o f CEP (component A) provided for elections at the lowest strata
 of society, inthe hamlets, for equal numbers o fmenand women to form village development
 councils. Next, the village councils were to elect equal numbers o f men andwomen to form sub-
 district councils. Grants were provideddirectly to the sub-district councils, which would then spend
the funds basedonproposals received from the villages. Itwas hopedthat this would introduce
local decision makinginreconstructionand reverse centuries o freporting upwardto authority, as
well as introduce accountability downward."



 15."There are manycases of overlapsand conflictingapproachesbetweendifferentprojects/organizationsincluding
manyexampleswhere two or moredifferent organizationsare working inthe same village." Oxfam2004a.
16. The objectiveasnotedabove was statedinthe appraisaldocument for the first CEP whichat that time was meant
to cover the time periodfor all the three projects.Subsequently, separateappraisaldocuments were producedfor CEP
I1and111.The appraisaldocument for CEP I1does not include an objective statement inthe maintext. The objective
statement inthe Annex ofthat reporthas the same formulationas that inthe appraisaldocumentfor CEP 111where the
project objectiveis statedto beto "reduce povertyand support inclusivepatternsofgrowthanddevelopment." The
completionreport for all the three CEP projectshowever notesthat the overallproject objectiveover all the three CEP
projectsremained "To strengthen local levelsocial capital to buildinstitutionsthat reducepovertyand support
inclusivepatterns of growth.  "

17. "Indeed, the project [CEP] deliberately aimed to reversethe historicaltendency of accountabilityupwards; each
layer ofadministration,rather than receivinginstructionsfromhigher authorities, wouldnowbe accountable
downwardsto a popular constituency." Chopra2002.

3.4       Grants under Component A were for construction andrehabilitation o fbasic
infrastructure. The village development councils (Conselho do Suco) hadresponsibility for
preparation o f development proposals on behalf o f their communities and for allocation and
management o f development funds providedby the project. UNTAETRegulationNo. 2000/13 on
the Establishment of Villageand Sub-district Councilsfor theDisbursement of Fundsfor
Development of Activities provided the legal framework for the establishment o f the councils.
While village chiefs couldnot be members o f these councils, they were expected to help guide
the processes. The rational for excluding the village chiefs and traditional leaders was to promote
a more horizontal and democratic systemand, hence, reduce elite capture and corruption.'* A
second financial window under the same component was earmarked for highly vulnerable groups
within each community identifiedthrough on-site participatory rural appraisals managedbythe
facilitator together with the communities. A credit subcomponent was also included to allow the

 project to provide support to individuals for income-generating activities. It was implemented as a
 revolving fund alongside community sub-grants.

 3.5      The cultural heritage program (Component B) was intendedto give voice to East Timor's
 cultural traditions and experiences and supportedtwo core activities: a small grant programto
 support community-based cultural developmentprograms, which couldinclude musical
 instruments,costumes, school sports equipment; and developmentofanationalheritage and
performance center. UNESCO was to supervise the design and reconstruction o f the national
heritage center.

 3.6      The civil society strengthening component (Component C) was to aid inthe development
 o f regional and localTimorese civil society groups such as national NGOs, student organizations,
 and church groups. This component was dropped inthe second and thirdprojects and was
replaced with a community radio component. This was identifiedby ajoint Timorese and donor
mission that reviewedprogress incommunity development in September 2000 and found that the
 destruction o f the communication infrastructure had a deeply negative impact on the ability o f
 communities to plan andrebuildtheir lives. Support for expanding coverage o f the national radio
 station and for the establishment o f community radio stations (including provisiono f training and
 equipment) inthe districts was expected to establish professional, sustainable television andradio
 systems inthe country andhelp strengthen local social capital while providing an important
communication tool for poor rural communities.

3.7       A Japanese grant for US$450,000 supportedproject preparation. The Grant Agreement
between TFET (represented by IDA) and UNTAETwas signed on February 21,2000, to establish
the first CEP. When CEP Ibecame effective, UNTAET didnot have the staff capacity or
operational facilities to manage the operation. Hence, a contract was issued to Community Aid
Abroad/Oxfam (CMO), an Australian International NGO, to work as the implementing agency.
InAugust2000, the ProjectManagementUnit(PMU) ofCEP was integratedintothe Department
o f Internal Administration. A monthlater, it was decided to transfer the general management o f
the project to Timorese staff once the contract with C M O ended. At the end o f 2000, the PMU
was runby Timorese, and about 200 facilitators were contractedto support field activities ranging
from organizing elections to technical verification o f the projects and disbursements o f the grants
(EU2004).

3.8      At this time there were no electedrepresentative bodiesat the district or sub-districtlevels
(Annex B).UNTAET appointed District Administrators, supportedby a DistrictDevelopment
Officer and anumber of support staff. The sub-district was managedby a field officer, initially UN
volunteers. By September 2000, CEP councils hadbeen elected in406 villages throughout East
Timor, well ahead o f schedule, and a standardamount o f US$15,000 hadbeen disbursed quickly
to 56 sub-districts as emergency funds to be divided equally among each village ina one-time
grant. This initial grant, referred to as the "emergency" cycle, was restrictedto a limitedpositive
list o fpriorities. Inthe subsequent two cycles, village council choices from an open menuwere
sent to the sub-district councils for consideration.

3.9      The projectwas launched well before systems were inplace for its implementation and
consequently faced several challenges. Bank supervisionmissionsand other reviews report
concerns about lack o funderstandingo fproject goals andprocedures among project staffand
communities, poor facilitation o f the democratic council formation process, quality and content of

 RATINGS

 Relevance

 3.11      The assessment o frelevanceconsiders the relevance o f the project objectives as well as
 their actualtranslation intothe project's design. Onbalance relevanceisratedmodest.When
 CEP was launched, East Timor was recovering from a humanitarian crisis and the project was
 intended to be a timely Bank response to the crisis. The project was expected to support IDA'S
 key objectives inthe country-to            repair the destruction caused by the violence, and to ensure that
 reconstruction activities occurred within a framework that strengthened participatory, transparent,
 and accountable institutions. While the project was consistent with the priority areas identified by
 the JAMmission, its endeavors to buildcapacity at the community level and set up a local
 governance structure were not inkeeping with the agreement made at the Tokyo meetingin
 whichthe donors entrusted UNTAET,andnot the WorldBank, withresponsibility for capacity
 building.**As notedbythe EUevaluation (footnote 22)' giventhe importance o fcapacity
 buildingthere shouldhavebeendiscussion and agreement betweenthe Bank andUNTAETto
 address the issuejointly.

 3.12      While the overall project design was innovative, the quick project preparation didnot
 allow for careful consideration o f the circumstances on the ground. The expectation that
 grassroots institutions established by the project would provide the foundation o f the future local
 governance structure inEast Timor after the immediatereconstructionperiodwas bothpremature
and unrealistic.

3.13      Itwaspremature becausethe CEP projectsproposedto buildthe foundation for the new
country's structure o f local governance within three years, when there was no national
government inthe country to buyinto the idea andno supporting legislation for local governance.
While UNTAETRegulation No. 2000/13 provided the legal framework for the establishment o f
the councils, the same regulation also stated that these councils "shall not exercise the legislative,

 executive orjudicial power o f government." The Transitional Administration never promulgated
 documents defining a formal local government structure for the Suco level. It was only after
 independence, with the approval o fthe Budget Law by the Parliament inJuly 2002, that the
 existence o f local government authorities below the sub-district level was formally recognized.
 (Republica Democratica de Timor-Leste 2003). Only now i s the government o f Timor-Leste
 attempting to draft a decentralizationpolicy andpiloting a local development approach(with
UNDP financial support) which, incontrast to the CEP model, provides for inclusion o f village
 and hamlet chiefs inthe village councils. Decentralization legislation i s expectedto be developed
inthe next two years.

3.14       Itwas unrealistic becauseitwas assumedthat electingvillage councilsto manage
development funds wouldbe aneffective way o f settingup democratic institutions andbypassing
traditional leaders. Too little credencewas givento traditional notions o f leadership and authority
(Annex B)."Because village chiefs were excluded from the CEP councils, they were notperceived
bythe community to have anypolitical authority, which inturnmeant that they couldnot form the
basis o f local administration. Instead, peopleelectedto the councilspreciselythose individuals who
were not older and senior or able to exercisepolitical authority, butwho were young, literate, and
capable o f interacting with foreigners. The village chief continued to rule as the acknowledged
political ahead" (Chopra and Hohe 2004).23324The SocialAppraisal Report carriedout for the Third
Agriculture RehabilitationProject also notes the importance o fthe village andhamlet chiefs for any
village-level decisionmaking.25An OXFAM (2004a) study designedto look into community-based
andparticipatoryprojectsimplementedduringthe four years since independence identifieda range
o f factors important for success inproject implementation at the community level. Chiefamong the
factors identified was the effective engagement o f community leaders-both               traditional leaders and
localgovernment leaders such as Chefe de S U C O . ~ ~ ' ~ ~

 3.15      This assessment also questions the relevance of usingthe community-driven development
 approach when the pressure to deliver quick results is immense. As implemented, the projects were
 not able to meet one of IDA'Skey objectives inthe country-to                 repair the destructioncausedbythe
 violence. The first round o f grants was to be focused onpriorityrehabilitationor emergency village
 needs, however, as seen under the section on efficacy below, it i s questionable whether the
 infrastructureconstructed inthat phasemet `emergency village needs.' About 50 percent o f the
 resources o f that phasewent into the constructionof community centers and almost noresources
 went into schoolandhealthinfrastructure, destruction ofwhichwas a major JAM concern (see also
 para 5.7).


 Efficacy

 3.16      Overall efficacy-the         extent to which the objectives were achieved-is          rated as modest.
 The overarchingproject objective was "to strengthen local social capital to buildinstitutions that
 reduce poverty and support inclusive patterns o f growth." According to the appraisal document of
 the first CEP, establishment and continuation of local development councils was to be a key
performance indicator of strengthening local capacity. While local development councils were
 established, these ceasedto exist when the resources from the project stopped flowing. Hence, the
project councils are unable to fulfill the long-run role envisioned for them.28329             IEGdiscussions
with community members andwith other stakeholders foundthat the community saw the project
 as a source o f income or aid and not as an investment to manage for their own development inthe
 future.3oStudies show that the pressureto rollout the programquickly hadnegative implications
 for buildingcapacity o fproject staff, council members,andcommunities to manage local
development.31

 3.17      That said, project resources were able to reach all the villages inTimor-Leste just a few
months after the emergency, a large amount o f infrastructure was built and temporary
employment was created for a large number o fpeople. This was a significant achievement given
the logistical constraints and the absence o f government structures at the sub-district level.
However, there is no data to show how much employment was actually created over the three
projects and since no targets were set for number o f sub-projects at appraisal, it i s impossible to
say how well the project did incomparison to appraisal expectations. The completion report only
provides information on dollar amounts spent on each kindo f sub-project and total number o f
sub-projects and does not give a break-down by kindso f sub-projects. This assessment was able

 to get informationonnumber o f different kindso f sub-projects constructedover the life of the
 three CEP projects only through a review o f the available literature. The quality o f the
 infrastructure builtby the sub-projects was also sometimes questionable and may not have
 consistently met "emergency village needs" as                               About 50 percent o f the resources
 o f the first phase went into the construction of community centers andno resources went into

 Inaddition, the distribution ofresources was not alwaystransparent, andelite capture is


 3.18      Neither i s there any evidence to show that the village and sub-district institutions that
 were set up will be capable o f supporting inclusive patternso f growth leadingto poverty
 reduction. Inthe first phase, the community sub-grants were given equally to all villages. This
 may bejustified because this was considered emergency assistance. However, no poverty
 targeting strategies were usedto direct funds to poorer districts even inthe subsequent phases,
 although the early results from the 2001 Household and Suco Surveys, which give a fairly clear
 picture o f the level and extent o fpoverty, were available duringthe time the project was being
 implemented (footnote 2).

 3.19      The highlyvulnerable groups subcomponent was established inCEP I1to ensure that the
 interests o f the most vulnerable (widows, the elderly, and the disabled) were considered. The
 subcomponent was slow to start and, with the overall pressure to implement, its facilitation and
 planning was not a priority for CEP staff and it was not able to reach its target. Analysts note that
 the subcomponent didnot cover groups that were even more vulnerable than those targeted, such
 as migrant populations.

 3.20      The credit component also was not successful. The total value o f loans made i s reported
 to be US$1.3 million(Conroy 2004). Approximately 1,050 primarily unsecuredloans were
 disbursed all over the country over the 3-year periodat an average value o f US$1,200, mostly for
 small retailkiosks (54 percent o f total loans). There i s limitedinformationon the viability o f the
businesses supportedand the broad conclusion o f an independent review i s that the businesses
were generally inbetter shape than the loanprogram (Conroy 2004).37The products sold at the
kiosks, which hadnormally been imported from Indonesia, are reportedto have underminedlocal
production o f rice, coffee, and cooking oil (Nordhaug 2004). Other investments were for

 livestock, fishing, andrice hulling.The lack o f transparency aroundthe distribution o f the credit
 allowedelite capture o fbenefits. The repayment rates across districts ranged from 28 to 31
 percent. Analysts have found several reasons for poor performance o f the credit component:
 failure to clearly explain the objective and working o f the credit programto communities, weak
 and ill-enforced lending practices, and poor monitoring, among others.38Analysts (Conroy 2004)
 have also noted the potential long-term negative impact on the development o f the credit culture
 o f the country, although there i s no firmevidence to support this claim.

 3.21     The most visible aspect of CEP inthe urban environmenthasbeen the renovation o fthe
 national cultural heritage and the performance center. The former Portuguese Garrison
 Headquarter, now better known as Uma Fukun,was to serve as the Cultural Center and National
 Museum for East Timor.

 3.22     The community radio componentthat was added under CEP I1established eight
 community radio stations inselected districts which began functioning effectively. A Community
 Radio Center (CRC) was set up in2002 to administer and provide technical support to the eight
 CEP radio stations. The CRC was infact to function as the hub for a number of supportive
 services for community radios throughout the country. The most significant challenge for this
 component i s also long-term sustainability o f activities begun.


Efficiency

 3.23     Overall project efficiency i s rated modest. It i s difficult to assess the efficiency o f the
 sub-projects constructedunder the main component as rate o freturn calculations were not made
at appraisal or completion. However, the appraisalreports o f CEP Iand I1include data from a
cost-effectiveness analysis for some activities though there i s no information on how the cost-
effectiveness analysis was actually carried out. The analysis was done for a sample village in
Indonesia as data for Timor was not available. It i s questionable how far this i s a reliable estimate
for conditions inTimor, particularly post-conflict Timor, where conditions were very different
from Indonesia. Also, life expectancy, morbidity rates, average populationper village, market
prices for different traded items are different for the two countries. Further, no cost-effectiveness
analysis was carried out at completion. Data i s not available on the number o f different kinds o f
sub-projects constructedand the costs andbenefitsarising from them and hence it was not
possible for this assessmentto calculate rates o freturn.

3.24      Further, while the overall project objective was to strengthen local social capital to build
institutions that reduce poverty and support inclusive patterns o f growth, it i s apparent that the
highcosts incurredinattempting to achieve this objective were not commensurate with the
benefits as project established councils seem to be no longer functioning. Because o f weak
government capacity nearly 58 cents o f every dollar disbursedto sub-projects was used for
technical assistance and local staffing costs (World Bank 2004a).39The project implementation
document (Report No. PID8576) noted that the project exceeded all normal technical assistance
ratios but that such highshort-term ratios were justified by the institutional development goals o f
the project inthe context inwhich every single government andprivate sector institution had
disappeared. The PID also notedthat "In most parts o fthe country and for mucho f the project's

 lifetime, the community and sub-district councils formed through the project will be the only
 functioning forum for community decision-making and action., .           .Benefits  from developing
 capable, democratically elected and accountable representatives will extend well beyond the
 lifetime o f this project." The fact that the ICRitselfrates sustainability unlikely strengthens the
 assessmentthat these benefits didnot, and are unlikelyto, materialize. Iti s difficult tojustify the
 highcosts when the institutionaldevelopmentgoals finally didnotreceive the priority attention
 that was planned for them.

 3.25     Resources were not well spent inthe highly vulnerable groups and credit components,
 which reducedthe efficiency o f resource use for the projects as a whole. Finally, IEGfield visits
 and studies andreports also show that leakage o fresources occurred because o f inadequate
 financial control and corruption invarious components (see Box 3.3).


 Outcome

 3.26     Basedon the assessment o f relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, the outcome for all three
 projects i s rated unsatisfactory. While the project ability to get money out quickly to
 communities has beenregarded as a significant achievement ina crisis, getting money out
 quickly was not a stated project objective and came at the expense o f the projects' community
 capacity enhancing objective. The unstated goal led to pressure from the Bank to deliver money
 ina short period, sometimes evenat the expenseoffollowing Bankprocedures.                 40At the same
time the stated objective o f "strengthening local level social capital" required that time be spent to
prepare communities to effectively manage CEP funds. Hence, there was an internal conflict
among the unstated and stated goals. The recent evaluation o f TFET by the EuropeanUnionalso
noted that "quick and transparent disbursements are not compatible with buildingup capacity o f
local councils" (EU2003).


InstitutionalDevelopment

3.27      Institutional development impact is rated modest.While the project introducedvillagers
to several aspects o f democratic governance, and contributedpositivelyto increasing the
participation o fwomen invillage activities, it was not able to establish a structure o f local
governance. The institutional goal under the project was to buildand fortify local institutions, but
the expectations for the councils were weakly understood even among council members and
women representatives. The councils became mechanisms for channelingproject resources only
and were not integratedinto the local government structures. Neither were they able to expand
their activitiesto include activities beyondthose fundedbythe project.

3.28      The project was managed by a PMUwhose staffbenefitedfrom considerable training
activities duringproject implementation. However the P M Unever achieved integration with the
relevant ministry(initiallythe Department o f InternalAdministration and later the Ministryo f State
Administration) even though it was the first PMUto be "Timori~ed."~'The significantly highwage

 levels o f the PMUstaff was one factor that made integration withthe government difficult. On
project closure little o fthe capacity generatedinthe PMUwas transferred to the government.

 3.29      Through most o f the life o f CEP, there was little integration betweenproject structures
 and the district level administration and bothcontinued to operate separately at the sub-district
 and village levels. This was not surprisingsince the project was modeled on the Indonesian KDP,
which was designedto bypass the district government. Only toward the end o f the project was
 some integration achieved. CEP I1provided financial support to improve andbuildcapacity inthe
districts relatedto community development. Inlate 2002, District Community Development
Committees were finally established integratingdistrict government, NGOsrepresentatives, and
CEP sub-district council members. However these committees only became operational inmid-
2003, very close to the end o f the CEP I11project. It is not clear what the future o f these
committees will be giventhat the government i s now piloting an alternative local governance
model.


Sustainability

3.30       As inthe completion report, project sustainability i s ratedunlikelybased ontwo aspects:
(i) sustainability o f the village-level councils that were created under the project; (ii)          availability
o f resources and technical skills for maintenance o f the infrastructure constructedand other
activities initiated under the project, including the radio and cultural activities.

3.3 1      The local councils establishedunder CEP are no longer functioning. The councilswere
primarily seen as a means o f channeling the money and were not able to take on a larger role as
development agents intheir communitie~.~~           Infact, other Bankprojects, such as theARP,have
also not used the CEP councils intheir implementation. The current Timorese government also
does not consider the structure established under CEP appropriate for local governance and is
now piloting an alternative model with UNDP support (par. 3.13).

3.32       Lack o f resources and technical skills for maintenance i s an issue for most infrastructure
constructedunder the grant comp~nent.~~          Inaddition, CEPsub-projects werenotintegratedwith
the activities o f line ministries inthe communities and hence the project i s not ina position to use
the skills andknowledge ofline ministries onproject closure. For example, the sub-projects in
water supply are not integrated with the other activities carried out inthe villages through line
ministries,which couldhave provided technical support for maintenance when needed.

3.33      Boththe culture andradio components face sustainability challenges. The Uma Fukun
Culture Center has already begun deteriorating. Doors, windows, walls, and floors have been
damaged. Fundingfor CRC ceasedinSeptember 2004 and all CRC assets are now owned by the
MinistryofInterior andadditional support hasbeensecuredthroughJuly 2006.The community
radios have not yet developed a revenue stream sufficient to support day-to-day operations. Need
for training i s also high,but resources for it are scarce. The mission visited the community radio
station inEnneradistrict and found that much o f the equipment was not working. Workers at the
station noted the challenge o f continuing to runthe station usingvolunteers.

 Bank Performance

 3-34      Bank performance i s rated unsatisfactory.While it i s creditable that ina post-conflict
 environment when most infrastructure and communications hadbeendestroyed, Bank staff were
 able to design and implement a project that reached remote communities, the initial design had
 several serious shortcomings. These could have been overcome hadthere been strong monitoring
 and evaluation. It i s also worrying that even though all the three projects were under
 implementation for only four years (from March2000 to March 2004) there were three changes
 inTask Manager. This created gapsinsupervision. Several ofthe shortcomings notedbelow
 could have been containedwith stronger management oversight.

 3.35      Theprojects werepremature and overly ambitious in design. The pressure to produce
 quick results was strong. Inadequate attention was given to the level o f capacity inthe community
 to make decisions for identifylngneeds andpreparing developmentproposals, a problemthat
 could have been addressedat least inCEP I1and 111.The completion report notes that: "The
 project attemptedto compensate for this inthe emergency assistancephase, but failed inmany
respects to follow up andprovide the additional capacity buildingnecessary for later cycles. This
 meant that many councils continued to suffer from low capacity levels in later phases o f the
project" (ICR page 31). Infact, today, the Government o f Timor-Leste does not consider the local
 councils established under the project to be the basis o f the local governance structure.

 3.36     More management attention was needed to overcomethe lack ofproject ownership by the
 transitional government (UNTAET) and by the national government that came topower in May
2002. Lack o fUNTAETownership and commitment is to some extent understandable because in
preparing the CEP, the Bank got into a sphere which was not its agreed-upon mandate (par. 2,4).44
Bank staff interviewedby IEGnote the commitment which Timorese inleadership positions had
toward the project at that time. Project documents indicate that the CNRT (National Council for
Timorese Resistance, which was disbanded inJune 2001 because o f tension within the party)
endorsed and supported the project initially. Although the CNRT leaders agreed to initiate the
CEPprogram, conversationwith stakeholders inthe field and the findings from the literature
reveal that they and UNTAET saw it as a World Bank project separate from the effort to set up a
Timorese administration (Nordhaug 2004).            45 This perception continuedafter a sovereign
government came to power inTimor. Timorese officials interviewedby the mission noted that
CEP was essentiallya Bankproject with little ownership withinthe country andpointed out their
disagreement with the project concept and approachto utilizationo f scarce grant resources. The
country political situation has been changing rapidly and it i s quite possible that initial support
from those inleadership positions may have beenreplacedby resistance from later leaders. It i s
important to remember, however, that the legal government when the project was designed was
the UNTAET, which opposed the project and only reluctantly decided to go along with it.To be
fair, the ambiguous position o f the UNseems not to have been clearly appreciated by Bank staff
at that time (par. 2.6). However, the reluctant support o f UNTAEThad a significant negative
impact on project implementation.

level, CEP is viewed as a World Bankproject.. .. Local community members view the councils as CEP councils, not
their own, andmost East Timoresebelievethat the councils would dissolve without the community grant monieswhich

 3.37      Theruralflnance lessons of thepast were ignored and a credit component was included
 with possiblenegative long-term implications for the development o f a credit culture inthe
 country. Evenduringproject preparation, project files reveal that there was considerable advice
  from peer reviewers against includingthe micro-credit component based onpast experience.

  3.38     Little thought was given to how such an ambitiousproject would be monitored when in-
  country capacity was so weak. Monitoring was largely confined to tracking o f inputsand outputs
 and could not report on overall project objectives. Eveninmonitoring inputs and outputs, there
 were significant weaknesses. The completion report shows that some basic output indicators
 identified bythe project were not monitored, for example number o f Oh4 committees formed.

  3.39     Management oversight was also weak onflduciary compliance. Supervisionreportsnoted
 lack of transparency andweakness infinancial management at the sub-district levelandbelow.
  Supervision reports also notedthat procurement rules were not well understood by communities and
 that there was lack o f transparency. The IEGmission found several examples that point to lack o f
 fiduciary compliance under the CEP project (Box 3.3). IEG's conversations inthe field with
 various stakeholders indicate that the problem may not have been small. It i s also not clear how
 far the Bank, with its limited ability to monitor scattered communities, will be able to avoid a
 recurrence o f suchproblems insimilar future interventions.
I Box.  3.3 Examplesof FiduciaryIssuesinthe CEPProjects
 InHumboe village, ErmeraDistrict, CEP fundswere usedto construct avillage water tank. Villagers reportthat
  oldpipes were usedand water no longer reachesall o fthe houses inthe hamlet because manyo fthe pipes have
 holes inthem. Rather thanpurchase good quality, new pipes, the personresponsible for procuringthe project
 materials kept the money for personal use and suppliedthe community withusedpipes that hadbeen salvaged
 fiom an old Indonesianwater system. The villagers complained to the CEP council "but no one wanted to take
 actionto do anything about it." (IEGmission field visit).
 InWaililivillage, BaucauDistrict CEP funds were obtained tobuildavillage road. The roadwas onlypartially
 constructed and the CEP village chiefkeptthe rest o fthe money for his personaluse. Inaddition the project
 proposal statedthat community members would bepaid$2 per day for labor but when the project was
 implemented village laborers receivedonly $1per day. The current Chefe do Suco claims that the village
 received $7,000 inCEP funding yet only $2,000 was spent on village projects. (IEGmission fieldvisit).
 Council members oftenused"local shopping" to "make money." They provided quotes for inputs and then, using
 local networks, purchased cheaper inputs thanprices listed inproposals. Procurement savings were usually
 dividedamong councilmembers and village heads, or usedto finance village parties. (Knezevic, N.2004 pg. 43)
  "It seemsto have beena problemthat cheaper equipment thanbudgetedfor was purchased, withthe surplus
 funds often not being accounted for." (Grieg, K and Nordhaug, L.2004. pg.10).
 "After thePMU's reorganization inAug2003, CEP's new CFO worked withTreasury to establish aregular
 process for GOTL [Government o f Timor-Leste] disbursement o f funds to the districts..
 Unfortunately,. .several district treasury officers stole large amounts o f community funds ($20,000-25,000 in
                 .                                                                         ..

 each incident). Eventhough they were caught, the GOTLhas beenextremely weak infollowing upthese cases
 (they are stillpending action). This seriously jeopardizes any levelo ftrust that has beenbuiltbetween
 communities and local government." (ICR, pg.29).
 "Reports however exist o f fundsbeing misusedo fappropriatedfor other purposes than intended inthe project. A
 continued cause o fmisunderstandingand misuse seems to havebeenthe 5% set aside for the administrative costs
 which was oftenseen as wage for council members." (Nordic Consulting Group. 2003. pg. 16).

 3.40       It is notpossible to tell whether there were any safeguard violations asfacilitators did
 not have adequatetraining to identzB these. This was flagged as an issue by supervision
 missions, but it i s not clear what was done to address the concern.46

 3.41       Theproject implementation was driven by the unstated objective of getting money out
 quickly topoor communitiesrather than outcomes.As already noted this compromised the
 capacity buildingobjective.


 Grantee Performance

 3.42       No national government existedduringthe immediate post-conflict periodwhen the CEP
 project was designed. There was also no national government when the bulk o f the resources
 under CEP Iwere expended. However, while CEP I1became effective when UNTAETwas in
 control (see Box 3.l),significant part o f the implementation o fthe project was carried out under
                            a
 the national government which came to power inMay2002. CEP I11became effective only in
 July 2002, after the national government took over fiom UNTAET.The three projects were
 designed on the KDP model by the Bank and hence the grantee cannot share the blame for the
 poor design. In fact, Timorese officials interviewed bythe mission noted that CEP was essentially
 a Bank project with little ownership withinthe country and pointed out their disagreement with
 the project concept and approach to utilization o f scarce grant resources. However a national
 government was inplace duringa large part o f the implementation periodfor CEP I1and 111.
Hence, while this assessmentdoes not rate grantee performance for CEP I,it does rate it for CEP
I1andI11on implementation.

3.43       As is already clear, inbothCEP I1and 111, the WorldBank exercised control over project
implementation through a PMUwhich had been set upprior to the establishment o f the formal
national Government structures. The PMUstaff, acting under Bank guidance, didwhat they could
to implement the project. The relations between the P M U and the government were not close and
it is not clear how well informed the latter was about the overall CEP program. Further, formal
government structures were still getting strengthenedduringthe implementation periodfor CEP
I1and I11as limitedcapacitywas one ofthe biggest constraints faced bythe Government. Hence
the Government was not really inaposition to take control o f the project or argue against it.
Hence, under the circumstances Grantee Performance i s rated satisfactoryfor CEP I1and 111.47




46. An internalBankreport found inDecember2001 that althoughmany o fthe proposalshadthe environment impact
sheet included, too oftenthisjust stated that there were no environmentalimpacts.The document notedthe need for
technicalfacilitatorsand assistantsto have bettertrainingto identify environmentalimpacts. Of specialconcern were
roadsbuilt to villages inthe mountainsfromwhich communities were movedinIndonesiantimes. The communities
returningto their previoushomeswere buildingroads where there were oftenno roadsbefore.The reportnotedthe
needfor reportingsuch cases to the ETPAenvironmentgroup. Similarly, the report found that landacquisition forms
stated that there was no landacquisitionwhen often, especiallyinthe case ofthe newroads, privatelyowned landhad
beenused.

 PROJECT     DESIGNANDIMPLEMENTATION              EXPERIENCE

 4.8      The project was a poverty targeted intervention designed to encourage community-based
 activities particularly inrehabilitating access roads. The PASCs were also meant to be
 community-owned and operated businessesthat were to provide agricultural services and supplies
 on a demand-driven basis. Since the trust funddidnothave all the necessaryfunding at the time o f
 project design, it was to be supported through two grants. The first grant (US$6.8 million)was to
 finance priority activities to be carried out duringthe initial 12months. The second grant would
 finance the remaining activities. However, duringthe period o f implementation o f ARP Ionly the
 first grant was available. The second grant eventuallybecame ARP II.

 4.9       Procurement delays, weak in-country capacity, and inadequate coordination between
 staff at various government levels had anegative impact onproject implementation, but are fairly
 common issues inBank-supported agricultural projects. InTimor-Leste, however, project
 implementation was also handicappedby several issues specific to the country's post-conflict
 context. Inthe immediate aftermath o f the conflict, UNTAET's InterimDepartment o f
 Agriculture and RuralDevelopment, subsequently designated the Division o f Agriculture
 AffairsY4*was just getting established and issuesrelevant to hiringand employment o f staff had
not been sorted out. For example, several East Timorese staff working on the project were on
month-to-month contracts with UNTAET and didnot have the commitment to the project that i s
 found inregular government staff, The effect o f the weak in-house capacity to implement the
project was felt even more when there were delays inthe appointment o f East Timorese field
agriculture officers insome districts and inthe appointment o f the DeputyDirector o f the PMU.
The continued assignment o f foreign experts as district agricultural officers created a dual power
structure. While the PMUwas created with the objective o f buildingproject management
capacity within the Division o f Agriculture, inthe early years there were problems with its
integration as it was well funded whereas the Division o f Agriculture Affairs was not, and
consequently there were differences insalaries between the staff, leading to resentment. Lack o f
understandingo fprocurement procedures and delay inarrival o f vehicles for supervision further
handicappedproject performance. There was also a lack o f good coordinationbetween staff at
central, district, and community levels.

4.10      Implementation was slow inthe priority productive asset restoration component because
o f delays inprocurement and identification o f beneficiaries for distribution o f handtools, cattle,
and chicken. The first shipment o f 25,000 hand tools was o fpoor quality and a large number o f
these were abandoned by farmers. On the recommendation o f the October-November 2000 Bank
Support/Supervision Mission, the livestock vaccination campaign was accelerated and expanded
to compensate for the delay indistribution o f productive assets. But acceleration weakened the
quality o f the program, which was further handicappedby lack o f adequate arrangements for
notifying farmers intime about vaccination start dates as well as proper arrangements for
refrigeration o f vaccines. The establishment o f PASCs was delayed because o f the lack o f
familiarity with setting up private sector organizations and at mid-term, the number o fPASCs
was reduced from five to three. Establishment o f the community radio stations was postponed
initially untilthe elections to prevent their use for politicalpurposes. At mid-term it was agreed
that the CEP would take the lead inestablishingcommunity radio stations, withARP focusing on
theprovision ofradio equipment and informationalprogramming.

 RATINGS


 Relevance

 4.11     The assessmento f relevance considers the relevance o f the project objectives as well as
 their translation into the project's design. Onbalance relevance i s rated substantial. Given
 agriculture's key position inthe economy, the objectives o f improving food security for the poor
 and increasing agricultural production and growthwere very relevant for the country. Inthe
 aftermath o f the violence the project focus on the lowland areas where farmers hadlost most o f
 their assets andhadbecome even more vulnerable to crop failure andnatural disasters was
justified. However, there were four shortcomings inthe project's design.

 4.12     First,the project design assumedthat after the violencethe countrywas "starting life
 with a cleanslate'' andthat it was possible to "design the framework for agriculture fromthe
 ground up." This unrealistic assumption led the project to include support for activities like
 PASCs, which were not suitedto conditions inTimor-Leste so soon after the crisis. PASCs were
 to provide agricultural services to farming communities on full cost recovery arrangements. Until
 mid-1998 there had been government subsidies on fuel, fertilizer, andrice. A government agency
 provided farmers with inputsand then purchased outputs at set prices (Republica Democratica de
 Timor-Leste 2004; see also Box 4.2). It i s not clear how itwas expected that these PASCswould
 operate since most Timorese farmers lived outside the money economy and were unfamiliar with
business principles under which the PASCs were expectedto operate. Farmer ownership and
responsibility for business decisions were also new concepts. The difference between the PASCs
 and the former government-orientedunits was not made clear. Critics have questioned whether
 the establishment o f the PASCs might actually have worsened the state o f many East Timorese
 farmers.49

4.13      Second, the project was very ambitious and the design did not adequately recognize the
weak capacity inthe country to implement the operation. Project implementation was to proceed
on all fronts while the government staff were still beingrecruited and trained. This handicapped
project implementation. There was also an unrealistic expectation that there would be a transfer
o f capacity from international advisors to local staffas the project was implemented and the
capacity constraint would hence be addressed.However, communication between advisors and
national staff at the middle and local level was limitedbecause o f language barriers.

Efficacy

4.16      Project efficacy i s rated substantial. The project made an important contribution to
supportingrecovery o f the agriculture sector. However, there were several shortcomings in
achievingthe project objectives. The paragraphs below discuss project achievements by objective.


Objective 1:Improvedfood security of selectedpoor households (Mostly Achieved)

4.17      The project helped create some 120,000 person-days o f labor, providing a muchneeded
infusion o f cash into rural communities. Itwas also successful inmeeting several quantitative
targets for distribution o f tools and livestock, though there were highmortality rates particularly
among chickens distributed. Buffaloes and Bali cattle were distributed to 2,552 farm families.
Since livestock i s a source o f food security reserve inTimor (Annex B), distribution o f livestock
i s likely to have improved the short-term food security o f the receiving families. The completion
report notes that there was a reduction inmonths with limited food for poor households from
seven to five, though it i s difficult to say how much o f this was because o f the project and an
FA0report also found that effective means o fmonitoringbasic food security indicators to be an
outstanding issue (FA0 2003). Targets for vaccination of cattle and other livestock were also met,
butthere is little informationonhow successful the vaccinationprogramwas inpreventing
disease outbreaks. Supervision reports note that not all animals were vaccinated as large numbers
remained inaccessible inupland areas. Further, vaccination was sometimes conducted after the
disease seasons had startedrather than before, limitingits usefulness. That said, the project did
help inlaying the foundation for a national vaccination program.

Efficiency

4.19      An economic rate o freturn (ERR) was estimated at appraisal andcompletion. At
appraisal the ERR was calculated to be 23 percent and at completion it was re-estimated at 22
percent. The coverage o f the analysis at completion was wider compared to that done at appraisal
and includedthe national vaccinationprograms, ruralroads rehabilitation andrehabilitation o f
community irrigationschemes. This assessmenthas major concerns with the re-calculated rate o f
return as presented inthe completion report. However the assessment was not able to undertake a
rate o freturn calculation because o f lack o f availability o f complete data. Project efficiency i s
hence not rated. The concerns are notedbelow.

4.20      First, the ERRestimate at completion assumes an improvement inrice yield becauseo f
rehabilitated community and large irrigation schemes (Table 4.1). However, data from FA0 do
not support the projected yields. The FA0report (June 2003) notes that with assured water during
the cropping season, yields o faround 1.8 tons per hectare are obtained. Higher yields than this
                                                                                     51
require fertilizers and improved varieties o f seeds, which were not widely applied due to high
prices and unavailability. Infact, a MAFFreport shows that even inOecussi where farmers who
usedfertilizers andpesticidesinIndonesiantimes now findthat highprices make it difficult to do
so (MAFF2003). Further, farmers have beenunwilling to take credit because they are not certain
that they can sell their produce because o f the competition from importedrice.

 4.21     Second,the estimationofbenefitsfor the rehabilitationof communityroads component at
 the completion stage was basedon the experience o fthe NationalWatershedManagementand
 ConservationProject inIndonesia. That watershed analysis i s not relevant for the Timor context
 where small lengths o froadway were rehabilitatedall over the country. Inthe calculationsmade for
 ARP Ithe benefitsinthe Indonesiaprojectwere adjusted upwardonthe assumptionthat the roads
 were connectingagricultural areas to markets andtherefore the multipliereffect would be higher.
 However, most o f the farmers inTimor are subsistencefarmers for whom market access i s o f
 minimal importance.

 4.22     Third,the first shipment ofhandtools (25,000) was ofpoor quality andlargely
 abandoned by farmers. A large number o f doses o f vaccine were also wasted because they were
 improperly stored. It i s not clear whether these inefficiencies were considered incalculating the
 cost-benefits from Component 1.Also, analysis for that component assumed a 20 percent
 mortality rate among chickens. Infact, the rate was reportedto be muchhighereven by the
 project completion report.52

 4.23     Fourth,the calculationassumedsustainability o fthe benefit stream, which does not hold
 particularly for rehabilitation of irrigationschemes. Supervisionreports for ARP I1revealed that
 many rehabilitated structures didnot last beyond one season.

 4.24     Fifth, inassessingefficiency, it is important to note that weak implementation capacity at
 the design stage was addressedby involving a considerable number o f international advisors (for
 procurement, financial management, monitoringand evaluation, project management) that
 absorbed a large amount o f project funds- thirty-one percent o f the total project cost was used
 for consulting services. Iti s not clear whether the calculations o f the cost stream for the rate o f
return took into account these overhead costs.


 Outcome

4.25     Basedon the assessmentso f substantialrelevance and efficacy, andthe uncertain
efficiency, overall outcome i s ratedmoderatelysatisfactory.


 Sustainability

4.26     Sustainability i s rated unlikely even though there was a follow-on project. The project
design at appraisal mandatedthat the local communities take over responsibility for maintaining
the secondary and tertiary irrigation systems and for managing the PASCs. This has not
happened. Infact, community commitment to rehabilitation activities i s questionable, basedon
evidence inproject supervision reports. Inthe past, farmers have either beenunable to or have
shown little interest inmaintaining irrigationschemes, and have relied on government for
maintenance andrehabilitation (Republica Democratica de Timor-Leste 2004).

4.27     Itis unclear whether the government will be able to sustain the vaccination program
without Bank support; already it has found it difficult to ensure maintenance andreplacement o f
motorcycles to field staffbecause o f lack o fresources. The departure o f UNTAET ledto
deterioration o f the power supply with implications for maintenance o f the cold chain required for
vaccine refrigeration. The Village Livestock Workers scheme begun under ARP 11also has faced
difficulty due to lack o f willingness (or ability) o f farmers to pay for the vaccination services.

4.28      The three PASCs establishedjust a few months before project closing have not been able
to reach sustainable levels o f activity even after ARP I1(see Project Assessment o f ARP 11).The
PASCs were designed to bebusinesses that dealt with large quantities o f agricultural produce-
quantities that have yet to materialize. Most o f the agricultural produce inTimor i s never brought
to market as subsistence farming predominates. Farmer knowledge o f the PASCs and market
conditions is also limited.Those willing to sell their produce have found the PASCs' prices
unattractive becauseproduction costs have beenhighand market pressures have prevented the
PASCs from offering higherprices. The PASCs have faced competition from other traders due to
lower business skills and fewer linkages with intermediaries.While renting o f trucks has provided
returns, margins have been thin. Some o f the PASCs have also faced management challenges.


InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

4.29     Institutional development impact i s ratedmodest.The project itselfhas providedan
opportunity for the division o f agriculture (and subsequently the ministry) to buildspecialized
capacity on various agricultural subsectors. A largenumber o f staff was trained onvarious topics
such as irrigation technology, farming systems, extension systems, PASC management, etc., though
the specialized capacity did not helpbuildgeneral administrative capacity inMAFFto coordinate
activities andprovide oversight for the large range o f activities supported under the project.
Capacity for procurement and financial management continues to be weak. International advisors
continuedto provide most o f the essential planning and analytical inputsto the project. The
transfer o f capacity from international advisors to national staffhasbeen slow andwas picked up as
a concern even inARP III.     The primaryfocus of the advisors was on implementingproject
activities not training national staff,53



BankPerformance

4.30     Bankperformance is rated satisfactory,but only marginally so. The Bank can be
credited for beingresponsiveand puttingtogether a project very quickly. The Bank task team also
provided close supervision and feedback for appropriate action on problems. However, as seen in
the section on relevance, there were several significant weaknesses inproject design which arose
partly because o f the pressure to respondquickly. The project was also overly ambitious andput a
substantial burdenon the ministry staff to undertake and oversee a large range o f activities.
Outcome and output indicators identifiedinthe appraisal document appear reasonable for
monitoringprogress toward project objectives butnot all o f them were reported on at the
completion stage. Governmentofficials interviewedby the assessment mission felt that they were
not treated as partners even duringthe implementation o f the ongoing thirdproject.


GranteePerformance

4.3 1    It is not appropriateto assess the performance o fthe grantee as UNTAETwas the
recipient and implementing agency for most o f the project period. Nonational government
existed during the initial reconstructionperiod. The World Bank exercised control over project
design and the international advisors under the direction o f the World Bank exercised key control
over project implementation. Therefore the performance o f the grantee i s not rated.

 SECOND AGRICULTURE REHABILITATIONPROJECT


 OVERVIEW

4.32      The objective o f the Second Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP 11)was to improve
the food security o f rural families and to increase agricultural production inselected areas o f
 Timor-Leste. The objective remained unchangedthroughout the project's implementation period.
The project was a follow-on to ARP Iand was designed to move beyond the emergency phase to
 deal with longer-term development challenge inthe agriculture sector. Project objectives were to
be achieved through four components:
                                                         Table4.3. ARP I1at a Glance

     markets. There was also a subcomponent to buildlinkages with Consultative Group for
     International Agricultural Research(CGIAR) international centers; and
     aProgram Management component to help the new government evaluate policy options, help
     upgrade core skills o f agriculture staff, and oversee the implementation o fthe agriculture

4.33      Total project cost at appraisal was US$8.91 million, which includedUS$S.O millionfrom
TFET andUS$0.9 millionfrom CFET. Actual cost was US$8.73 millionsince CFET funding
(government counterpart funding) was reduced to US$0.73 million. The grant was amendedinJune
2002 to allow incrementaloperating costs andpurchase o f agriculturalproducts for the PASCs.The
tasks set out inthe original design were ambitious given the low capacity inthe ministryandthe
short time frame (27 months) andthe project required several date extensions. The project
ultimately closed on June 15,2005.




54. The project also includeda US$1.0 million grant for the Rehabilitation ofthe Hera FishingPort, which was
managed by the Asian Development Bank under a separate but parallel Grant Agreement and hence is not covered in
this assessment.

 DESIGNAND IMPLEMENTATION

 4.34     ARP I1continued several activities begununder ARP I. subcomponent on
                                                                     The
 sustainable animal health services continuedthe veterinary vaccination program, while providing
 training and starter kits to a cadre o fprivate (about 200) village livestock workers (VLWs) who
 would assist farmers inthe simple treatment o f diseasesand improve their access to veterinary
 inputs.The PASC subcomponent was to help consolidate and operate the three PASCs
 established under ARP I.    The RapidInfrastructureRehabilitation Component was to continue
 supportingrehabilitation o f irrigationschemes and farm-to-market access roads. It also provided
 support for water user associations (WUA).The pilot participatory development and natural
 resource management component was new and primarily was to target upland and coastal
 communities, which had solid local governance and traditional leadership inseven districts
 (Baucau, Covalima, Dili,Lutem, Liquica, Manufahi, and Oecussi).

 4.35     The biggest implementation challenge was the limitedcapacity inMAFFboth at the center
 and inthe field to implement the project andmonitor, facilitate, and supervise activities. Moreover,
 two o f the project components involved community participationandthe capacity within MAFFto
 implement andmonitor these components was even more limited. Most facilitators were former
 extension staff from Indonesian times and lackedthe skills needed to moderate a genuine bottom-up
process. Supervision reports reveal that choice o f sub-projects under the pilot participatory
component was not driven necessarily by communityneedandthat some activities were on a scale
that overwhelmedthe capacity o f the communities. Supervision missionsalso notedthe difficulty in
gettingmoney fromthe central MAFFoffice to the villages, inadequate visits by facilitators to
communities partly becauseof lack o f availability o f adequatetransport facilities, and lack o f timely
informationto farmers about vaccination campaigns.

4.36      The three PASCs, inBobonaro (specializing inrice), Viqueque (specializing incopra and
candlenut), and Aileu (maize and coffee) continued to operate at a loss and therefore the idea o f
establishing two newPASCs was dropped. Inlieu o fnew PASCs, MAFFwas to assist existing
Rural Producer Organizations or private sector providers inthe districts o f Covalima and Lautem.

4.37      The mid-termreviewrecognized the needto improve the quality o f project interventions,
to give urgent attention to improving communicationwith the field, andto improve the mobility
o f district staff, Project implementation was also negatively affected with the pullout o f the UN
after control was handedover to an independent government inMay 2002. Access to phone lines
and internet inthe districts was reducedto a minimum, further constraining effective
communication betweenthe center and district staff. This particularly limitedthe effectiveness o f
the CGIAR Secretariat subcomponent because informationfrom international agricultural centers
couldnot be communicated to districts. A further challenge for this subcomponent was to
translate information into a language and form easily understoodby farmers.


RATINGS


Relevance

4.38      The assessment o frelevance considers the relevance o f the project objectives as well as
their translation into project design. On balance relevance is rated substantial.The objectives
were highlyrelevantto the country context and emphasis was given to analysis o f key policy
options to provide the new government with arange o f choices on which to base future decisions.
However, there were several critical design shortcomings. First,this assessment has concerns about
the appropriateness o f activities selectedto meet the project objectives, particularly since ARP 11

                                                           29


was meant to move beyondthe emergency phase. For example, issuesrelevant to cultivation o f
maize and cassava, the two most important food crops inthe country (Annex B table B.1) andmost
critical for ensuringfood security for the poor, were not coveredby the project."Further, rice-
producingSucos (villages) also appear to bebetter developed than maize producing areas and since
the project was movingbeyondthe emergency phasemore emphasis should have been givento the
problems ofthe less-developed regions.

4.39        Second, issues were not treated broadly enough. For example, both the ARP projects
 focused onrehabilitation o f irrigation schemes to help increase rice production. However, too
 little thought was givento all factors that have implications for increasing rice production.
Achieving the projectedyields required not only an assuredwater supplybut also fertilizers,
 seeds, and other inputs.However, the incentive for farmers to buythese products was low as
 domestically producedrice faces intense competition from imported rice. Farmers' incentives to
buy and sellreceived little attentioninthe overall attempt at increasingriceproduction. Itis
understandable that these issues were not givenmuch attention inthe first project, which was an
 emergency operation, but they should have beenpickedup inARP 11.

4.40        Third, it i s not clear that sufficient analysis hadbeendone for some activities supported.
For example, the project focused on rehabilitation o f irrigation schemes for which presumably
adequate feasibility studies had been carriedout. However, the appraisal document for ARP III,
which provides support for an agro-meteorological network, notes that such systems are essential
for designing o f irrigationsystems. Inthe absence of basic rainfall and other related data, there
are concerns about the rigor o f the feasibility studies carried out? Stakeholders interviewedby
the assessment mission notedthat the ARP projects went aheadwithrehabilitation schemes
without fully verifying the reason for lack o f rehabilitation inthe past. According to some, while
neglect o f maintenance was an issue, another reason why some schemes hadnot been
rehabilitatedwas because they were not appropriate schemes to beginwith.

4.41        Fourth, ARP Iwas an emergency operation but ARP I1was meant to be moving toward
tackling the long-term development challenges inagriculture. The experience o f ARP Ihad
highlightedthe difficulty of implementing a project when government capacity is very weak. A
substantial amount o f scarceresources hadbeen spent inthe implementation o f that project on
foreign consultants who, because o f lack o f technically qualified personnel at all levels o f the
government, also performed inoperational roles and as line managers instead o f focusing on their

55. "Maize and cassavaare the predominantsubsistence crops grown in aTimor-Lestewith plantings estimated at
121,000 and91,000 hectaresrespectively.Very little of either crop is traded.. .. Maize and cassava are complemented
by arange of other food crops grown inmixed, inter-cropping systems.These subsistence-croppingsystemsact to
reduce risk and spreadthe availability of food across the year. They are the logical startingpoint inattempts to improve
food securityfor the ruralpoor, but havethus far receivedlittle attention.Yields of maize are low, but there is
considerable potential to increaseyields by varietal change. There is not yet a clear picture aboutpostharvest losses in
maizeduring the normal 8-monthstorage. Even smallreductionsinlosses could have asignificant impact on food
security."(Republica Democraticade Timor-Leste 2004). Bank staff commentedthat those cropswere supported
through Component 1of the ARP I1project, althoughthe Region's own completionreport for the project notes that
"An attempt at integration of food crops and livestock inthe NRMcomponent[Component 11failed, and the MAFF
team consistedmainly of staff with forestry and fisheries backgroundand responsibility which may havebiased
activities towards NRMthanto agriculture."
56. The appraisaldocument for ARP I11recognizesthe importanceofthis networkfor adequatedesignofirrigation
systems. The appraisaldocumentfor ARP I11notes, "At present, Timor-Lestelacksthe meansto collect agro-hydro-
meteorologicaldataon suchbasicparametersas rainfall, temperature, humidity, evaporation, and stream water levels,
which are key for monitoring areas vulnerableto droughts andfloods.They are also necessary for planningagricultural
programs:the designofirrigation systems, for example, requiresdataonlong-termrainfall patterns andintensities."The
Joint AgricultureDonorsMission of January2001hadalso notedthe lackof climate and soil data for planningofirrigation
schemes-i.e., zoningof suitable areas for irrigation schemes throughthe integrationofhydrological datawith soils
characteristics,topography, socio economic informationetc.

 advisory role. The project designwas also very ambitious inincludinga participatory
 development and natural resource management component, implementation o f which requires
 experience with participatory methodologies and intensive facilitation and supervision at the
 community level. Such a component stretched the limitedgovernment capacity even fUTther." It
was imperative that the ARP I1designhave a strong institution-building focus with capacity
 development o f the ministry as a direct project objective. Since this was not the case, the issue did
not get the attention it deserved and a large amount o fresources were again spent on consultancy
 services (see paragraphbelow on efficiency). It i s only inARP I11that this issue has been given
 adequate importance and i s included as an explicit project objective.


Efficacy

4.42     Overall project efficacy i s ratedmodest.The project contribution to food security was
 limited:though ithelpedincrease agriculturalproduction, itdidso less than envisaged at
 appraisal. The expectation at appraisal that double cropping inmost o f the irrigated areas would
be combined with the use of fertilizer andhigh-yielding varieties bythe endof theproject was
not met. The paragraphs below provide information onproject achievements by objective.


 Objective 1:Improve thefood security of ruralfamilies (Negligibly Achieved)

4.43     Though a number o f quantitative targets were met-number               o f hectares rehabilitated in
community irrigation schemes, number o f kilometers o f accessroads rehabilitated, number o f
animal vaccinated were reached-the           project's contribution to food security was limited for
several reasons. First,the project didnot attempt to increase the yields of crops like maize and
cassava, staple food crops that are fundamental to improving food security. Second, though the
Pilot Participatory Development and Natural Resource Management component was able to reach
30 o f the 443 villages inthe country the activities selected were largely confined to plantingtrees
and constructing fishponds; a broader approach toward improvinglivelihood systems and food
security was only partly undertaken. Several o f the activities supportedwere beyond the capacity
o f the communities to properly manage and utilize. Eveninareas where production activities
were successfully pursued, as inthe case o f some fishponds, returns were limitedbecause o f the
marketing constraints faced by farmers because o f long distances from the market and high
transportation costs. The project didsupport rehabilitationo f 123 kilometers o f farm-to-market
roads (123 percent o f the appraisal target) yet the roads rehabilitated were not strategically selected
to ensure that they were able to support the implementation o f other activities. Further, during
implementation the road component was amended and limitedto rehabilitationo f structures,
bridges, culverts, androadside drains that would givelonger-lasting improvements. The pavingand
pothole filling was discarded as this didnot last long, particularly on steep hills.Thismeansthat the
achieved targets do not necessarily mean that the infrastructure was rehabilitatedcompletely.

4.44     On the positive side, livestock constitute the most valuable o f farm assets andprovide
rural families with insurance against economic shocks and crop losses. Hence, the project's
reduction of livestock mortality through vaccinations contributed to improving food security.'*
The impact could have beenmuch greater had more attentionbeen given to getting information

 on the vaccination program to fanners.59Two campaigns-for                 haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) for
 cattleibuffalo and classical swine fever (CSF) for pigs-were conducted duringARP I1and three
 million doses o f Newcastle diseasevaccine were also purchased and distributed. Two annual
 vaccination programs for both CSF and HFwere conducted duringARP 11.A total o f 692,481
pigs and 381,842 cattleibuffalo were vaccinated. However, the impact survey found that less than
 half o f the households interviewed had animals that hadbeen vaccinated inthe past two years.
 The vaccination o f pigshad the highest response with 42 percent, followed by cattlebuffalo with
 14percent andchicken with the lowest at 1percent.              6o



 Objective2: to increaseagriculturalproduction in selected areas of Tirnor-Leste (Partially
Achieved)                  &



4.45       With atotal of 3,908 hectaresin46 community-based schemes (186percent o fthe
 appraisal target) rehabilitated, the project contributed to increased agricultural productionthough
incrementalproduction was less than envisaged at appraisal. The expectation at appraisal that
 double cropping inmost o f the irrigated areas would be combined with the use o f fertilizer and
high-yielding varieties by the end o f the project was not met. Supervision missions also report
 design flaws insome roads and irrigationschemes andthere are problems with maintenance.

4.46       PASCs were expected to contribute to increasing agricultural production. While the
project provided support for the establishment and operation o f PASCs, these were not able to
function as business entities even interms o f havingacceptable accounting andrecord-keeping
procedures. The Alieu PASC has closed down. The assessmentmission visited the Bobonaro
PASC, reportedly the most successful o fthe three, but found little evidence o f successfulbusiness
activity. Internalreports also raise concerns about the lack o f management capacity to runthe
PASCs effectively. The field work carried out inFebruary 2003 inBobonaro and Viqueque for
the Social Assessment of the Third Agriculture Rehabilitation project found that ingeneral the
level o f awareness about the PASC i s extremely low, with many farmers never having heard o f
the organization. Indeed, the most stable service provided by the PASCs was transport rental.
Sales o f inputs (fertilizers, seeds, etc.) were muchlower than expected due to shortage o f cash
with farmers and competition from the blackmarket.


Efficiency

4.47      Efficiency i s rated modest. There are concerns regarding efficiency o f resource use since
the weak implementation capacity at the design stage was addressedby involving a considerable
numberofinternationaladvisors that absorbed a large amount ofproject funds. Over 40 percent
o f the project costs were usedfor consulting services. Further, though a rate o freturn o f 20
percent was estimated for the project at appraisal, the ICR concludes that the originally envisaged
quantifiable economic benefits were too highfor all but the livestock component. At the ICR
stage, recalculationo f a rate o freturn was carried out for the irrigationand vaccination
investments. The recalculatedrate o f return for irrigationinvestment was 6 percent compared to
20.6 at appraisal. For the irrigationschemes with lightto mediumdamage it was 3 percent,
comparedto 35 percent at appraisal, and for the community-based schemes it was 11percent
comparedto 26 percent at appraisal. Without significant investments inextension activities it i s



59. The impact survey also found that the success of the vaccination campaign partly relied on the information
disseminationto farmers beforethe vaccinationandmany morerespondentswere satisfiedwith information beforethe
vaccinationofpigs whereasa very small percentagewere satisfiedwith information beforethe vaccination of chicken.
60. A supervisionmissionreportedsimilar findings.

                                                              32


 impossible to achieve the yields projectedat appraisal.6'The investments inthe PASC didnot
 show positive rates o freturn. For the vaccination program, however, the rate o freturn i s reported
 to be about 23 percent compared to 28 percent at appraisal.


 Outcome

 4.48      Basedon the evidence o f modest relevance, substantial efficacy, andmodest efficiency,
 IEGguidelines indicatethat the project's outcome should beratedmoderatelyunsatisfactory.


 Sustainability

 4.49      Project sustainability isratedunlikely. The follow-on ARP IIIproject i s attempting to address
 some ofthe major issueswithimplicationsfor sustainability.62However, even ifthese are addressedit
 i snot clear that they would enhancethe sustainability of activities carried out under ARP II.

 4.50      Maintenance o frehabilitatedirrigationschemes remains a major challenge. According to
 supervisionreports, many rehabilitated structures didnot last beyond one season. A long-term,
 sustainable approach to rehabilitation o f irrigation systemswould have required complementary

major problem. This was not done. W A Scontinue to be weak andneed considerable support to
 develop the community organizing skills requiredto develop functional operation and
maintenance                    The technical expertise to handle maintenance i s also often missing.
Rehabilitation o f irrigationstructures was introducedinthe first place because maintenance had
been neglected. The fact that the government paid for the labor for rehabilitation o f the irrigation
 schemes communicated to the farmers that the government would accept a maintenance
obligation inthe future. An impact survey carried out by the ministrynotes: "farmers are still a
longway off from self-reliance and sustainability inrespect o f payingfor services [O&M] ...the
opinion was prevalent from programme employees that the population are still expecting the
government and other agencies to "supply" services, which i s a legacy from past systems o f
governance inTimor-Leste" (MAFF2004). It i s not easy now to turnthe community aroundto

4.5 1     A clearer delineation o fthe Village Livestock Worker's role intreating animals (a paid
service) and inprotecting animals through vaccination (a free public service) i s still needed
through intensive informationcampaigns. The impact study found that there was a conflict
between the free livestock vaccination offered by the government and the private VLW program,
which depended on payment for services. Farmers are questioning the rationale o fpayingthe

own contribution to the ICR, also found extensionto be an important concernandnotes that "Face-to-face interaction is

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

4.52       Institutionaldevelopment impact i s rated                     The projectprovided support for studies
on food policy, forestry strategy, fisheries, andwas instrumentalinthe development o f important
laws and legislation for fisheries and quarantine regulation. Duringproject implementation,
technical andproject management advisors were integrated into MAFF's organic structure andthe
PMUwas abolished. The project also contributedto buildingthe capacity o fTimorese staffinthe
MAFFthrough training activities, though shortageoftechnically qualifiedpersonnelremained. The
project didnot make a systematic attempt to improve the weak capacity inthe MAFF.Effective
transfer o f capacityto Timorese counterparts from international advisors remains amajor challenge
for ARP III.    Most o fthe capacity development that took place inthe ministrywas at the center and
there was little impact at the district level. One reason for this was shortage o f district staff, who
were under severepressureas they hadto performbothmanagerial and extension roles.

4.53      M&Econtinuedto beweak whether itwas for use ofproject funds, or for monitoringthe
impact o f informationservices or on crop yields. Because o f weak M&E, the opportunity for
learning, particularly from the pilot participatory development component, was limited. While the
project has helped develop an understandingandpolitical will for localparticipation, W A S
remain weak. While VLWs were trained, the Social Appraisal Report prepared for ARP I11found
that "The VLW programhas not yet gotten underway. Although the first batch o fVLWs have
been selected, they have not yet been trained and equipped yet. As such it is difficult tojudge
how well they will be accepted and utilizedby the farming community." MAFF2003. The
PASCshave hadlimitedimpact onthe market.

BankPerformance

4.54      Bank performance i s ratedunsatisfactory for several reasons.

4.55      First,as already seenunderthe sectiononrelevancethere were several design
weaknesses. The project became effective inDecember 2001 and there was no national
government untilMay 2002. Inthe absence o f a national government, the Bank exercised control
over project designand had tremendous re~ponsibility.~'Yet important issues like capacity


65. "Farmers are still a longway off from self-reliance and sustainability inrespect ofpaying for services. During the
course of this study, the opinion was prevalent from programmeemployees that the population are still expectingthe
governmentand other agenciesto "supply" services, which is a legacyfrom past systems of governancein Timor-
Leste." MAFF 2004.
66. Bank staff commented that they disagreedwith this rating.
67. Bank staff intheir commentsnote that the project was preparedinvery close collaborationwith the Timorese staff
of DAANAFF. However, senior governmentofficials interviewed by IEGnotedthat they haddifferences of opinion
with the Bank as to what were priority issues to be included inthe project. The EuropeanUnion2000 report reporting

World Bank consultedthemon work program and on fundallocation.. .........However, they note that these
on Governmentcomments on the ownership of the entire reconstructionprogramnotes "The Timorese agreedthat the

ownership over the processof reestablishinggovernmentand rebuilding the country, particularly during the transition
period of2000-01andthis feeling of disempowermenttouchedall aid programswhether UN,TFET or bilaterals."

 buildingwere not adequately attendedto. The completion report notes that "Institution building
 and capacity strengtheningwas a recognizedneed, however, but was not made part o f the
 development objective." (ICR page 14). Further M&Ewas very weak inthe first project and
 continued to be a major weakness o f the follow-on project.

 4.56      Second, the time pressure to respond quickly affectedproject design and implementation
 negatively.68The ICRnotes: "Collection o f information and analysis o f key socio-economic and
 agronomic data on farming systemshad started at the design stage. However, time pressure
 prevented a full integration o f this information into project activities. A better understanding o f
 farming systems and livelihood opportunities and abetter analysis o fthe most severe pockets o f
 food insecurity and its causes inboth the upland and lowland areas couldhave ledto an improved
 design or an early re-design o f some o f the project interventions and would have improvedthe
 projects overall outcome." The project design also didnot reflect other lessons emerging from the
 field.There was littletime to systematically and effectively incorporate all the lessons o f
 experience o f the first project into the design and implementation o f ARP II.69               A very important
 weakness that remained was inadequate attentionto clearly assessingthe challenges to
 sustainability for activities begununder ARP I.         Fieldexperience should also have raised the need
 to reassessthe focus onrehabilitation o f irrigationschemes to promote rice cultivation, which
 continuedto receive significant support under ARP             I I S 7 O


4.57      Third, conversations with stakeholders and areview ofthe literature indicate that the
 impact o f limitedlocal capacity on project implementation was not adequately assessed. Several
deficiencies ininternal procedures and accounting were identifiedin financial management
reviews and supervisionreports.71There were also possible safeguard violations. Supervision
missions raise concern about the environmental damage due to roads constructed duringthe
project.72

4.58      Fourth,theBankalso failed to provideadequate support throughitsprocedures for some
o fthe project components that it advocated. For example, PASCswere being supported since ARP
I, simpleproceduresthatcouldhaveenabledthemtooperateasprivatebusinesseshadnot
   yet
been developedas late as mid-2003.73

learningthat took placethe technicaldesignofroads and irrigation infrastructurerehabilitatedwas strengthenedand the

71. Evenas late as the mid-termreview of ARP 11, an internal report found numerousserious weaknessesinfinancial

indication of athoroughsupervisionof a CDD activity.

 Grantee Performance

 4.59       Grantee performance i s rated satisfactory. The project became effective before the
 national government took over though the major part o f its implementation occurred when the
 national government was inposition. The assessmento f grantee performance i s hence made only
 on the basis o f their performance duringproject implementation. Given the low level o f capacity
 inthe government, considerable outside support from external advisors was neededfor project
 implementation. However the government took increasing ownership o f the project and worked
 diligently toward achieving project targets.



 5.         TheBank's Responseto the OpportunitiesandChallenges
            inTimor-Leste:Summary FindingsfromAssessments
 5.1       Based on the design and implementation experience o f the five projects, this section now
 picks up the discussionbegun inchapter two. It first discusses how the Bank respondedto the
 three opportunities and the various challenges and then draws together the overall implications o f
 the Bank's response for the effectiveness o fthese interventions.


 THEBANKSAW THE PEACEAND THE AVAILABILITY                           OFRESOURCES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
BERESPONSIVE TO THE EMERGENCY                    SITUATION

5.2        To the credit o f the Bank early steps were taken to prepare for a response to the crisis in
East Timor (par. 1.8 and 1.9). That early activity allowed the rapidpreparation o fprojects soon
after TFET became active. Though projects were to be administered inaccordance with Bank
procedures, the procedures were streamlinedto accelerate preparation, which was reducedto 3.5
months, compared to a Bank average o f 15 months (Rohland, K and, S. Cliffe 2002). OP8.50 on
Emergency Recovery Assistance, which permitscombined identificatiodpreparatiodappraisal
mission, was applied to the processingo f grants. The approval was delegated to the Regional
Vice President and project documents were made available to the Boardfor inf~rmation.~~Both
CEP and ARP were prepared inrecord time, drawing on the expertise o f staff working on
Indonesia and the Pacific Region, and CEP was the first formal project formulated by the
international community inresponse to the 1999 crisis.

5.3        Since there was no Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Timor then, the Bank's
Transitional Support Strategy presented to the BoardinNovember 2000, provided the framework
for assistancethrough TFET. Basic poverty alleviation and reconstruction over the short term and
analytical and advisory assistance onpost-independence policy and governance issues formed
key elements o fthis strategy.




physicalverificationof stocks, ensuringthe payments for goodspurchasedare clearlyidentifiedand correspond to

were not fully established. The reportalso found that this was exacerbatedby the present disbursementprocedures
where funds allocatedto the PASCshadto bedisbursedagainst invoices ofgoods and services purchasedby the PMU.
Bankstaffcommentedthat the fact that the functions were not delegatedto the PASCsfromthe onsetwas not areason
for their failure as businesses.

                                                        36


 5.4       A review ofthe implementationexperience ofthe five projects shows that the production
 o f quick immediate results was emphasized. However, as the project assessmentshave shown,
 TFET resources were not usedeffectively andefficiently and consequently didnot produce
 acceptable long-term development outcomes. Withthe benefit ofhindsightit i s easy to see why
 this happened. Apart from the need o fthe affected populationto see immediateresults, ina post-
 conflict environment donor pressureto achieve early results i s also likelyto be high(World Bank
 2003a). A reality o f post-conflict Timor, which can easily be forgotten inan ex-post review, i s the
 near total destruction-breakdown         o f institutions and governance, widespread suffering, and
 massive population displacement-to           which international community wanted to respond as
 quickly as possible. The Bank i s not a humanitarianinstitution, but under these circumstances,
 Bank staff, too, came underpressureto show results that could alleviate immediate suffering.


 There Were ImmediateResults

 5.5       The CEP and ARP projects successfully ensured that resources were quickly available to
 rural communities and remote areas. The projects also helped create considerable temporary rural
 employment and provided an infusion o f cash into these communities. The CEP projects also
 succeeded inbuildinga large amount o f basic infrastructure, while ARP Idistributedagricultural
 tools and livestock to a large number o fpeople who had lost these assets duringthe crisis. These
 were byno means small achievements andBank staff worked under extremely difficult
 circumstances withpoor communication and little in-counw capacity to support implementation.
 Further, rapid and visible results inthe early post-crisis period on a national scale are essential to
buildconfidence andmeet expectation^.'^


 ButNotNecessarily the BestOnes

 5.6       Getting resources quickly to communities was not a statedCEP project objective and doing
so came at the expense o fthe project's community capacity enhancing objective. The unstated goal
builtpressure for quick disbursement ofmoney. At the same time, the statedobjective o f
"strengthening local level social capital" requiredthat time be spentpreparing communities to
effectively manage CEP funds. There was a conflict among the unstated and statedobjectives and
duringimplementationthe unstatedobjectiveovertook the statedone. Inassessingthe achievements
o f objectives and outputs under the project, the Bank's own completionreport for the CEPproject
notes that providing "a quick and effective transfer ofresources to poor communities inthe post-
conflict transition" was the first objective. Infact, the report puts the statedproject objective o f
strengthening "local level social capital" last among the three objectives that itnotes (ICR page 11).
The assessment mission's discussions with community members and with other stakeholders reveal
that the community saw the project as a source o f income or aid, not as an investment intheir
capacity. This was not a positive development.

5.7       The CEP was designed on the basis o f the findings o f the JAM mission, which noted that
almost 80 percent o f social infrastructure (schools and clinics) hadbeen destroyedduringthe
violence. The first round o f grants was to be focused on priority rehabilitation or emergency
village needs. However it i s questionable whether the infrastructure constructedinthat phase met
"emergency village needs." About 50 percent o f the resources o f that phase went into the
construction of community centers. No resources went into school and health infrastructure,
which was a major JAM concern and which ajoint government-civil society study found was a

                                                               37


 priority and a pressingcommunity need.76Hence, the Bank's focus on creating social capital and
 empowering communities to carry out development appears to be a less appropriateresponse to
 the JAM concern than simply focusing onrebuilding the lost infrastructure first and secondarily
 working on community capacity.

 5.8        Ithasbeenarguedthat theprojectdidnot support reconstructionofinfrastructurebecause
 thiswas beingdone underother projects. CEP, as designed, allowedcommunities to exercise choice
 inselecting sub-projects. However, facilitators hiredbytheprojecthelpedcommunities decide
 which investments they should choose and those facilitators seemto have influenceddecisions. A
 project that aims to put communities ina decision-makingposition mustnecessarily accept their
 identified priorities ifcommunity-driven development i s to have any meaning+ven,                           as inthis
 case, iftheir choice i s not the best way to address overall development concerns. Supervision
 reports show that community centers were selectedbecausethere was insufficient time for planning
 and discussion andthe centerswere a "quick" non-controversial solution. Hencewhile a genuine
 community-driven approach may have considerable potential, when aproject usingthat approach is
 implementedunder time pressure, actual resultsmaynot reflect community genuine needsnor the
 goals o freconstruction.

 5.9        InARP I, distributionoflivestockto those who hadlost their animals duringthe
                          the
 violence was an important objective. Itwas only later realized that the people who owned
 livestock inthe first place were the richest inthe communities. Hence, replace that livestock was
 not inkeeping with the poverty reduction objective o f the project.


 And the Projects Also Had Several Design Shortcomings

 5.10       The project assessmentsrate the outcome o f CEP as unsatisfactory, o f ARP Ias
 moderately satisfactory and ARP I1as moderately unsatisfactory. Sustainability inall cases i s
 assessed as unlikely. Assessment o fthe design and implementation experience o fthe two groups o f
projects shows two additional shortcomings that arosebecause o f the pressure to respondquickly.

      0     the political, social, and economic context inwhich the projects were to be implemented
            was not given adequate attenti~n;~'
      0     adequate care was not taken to balance immediate reconstructionneeds with priorities for
            long-term development.

5.11        The difficult conditions under which Bank staffworked inthe post-conflict situation also
made it difficult to recognize these shortcomings. The experience o fthe CEP and ARP projects
shows that even several well known and fairly common lessons o f experience were forgotten in


76. Joint Govemment-Civil Society Study o f DevelopmentProjects 2004.
77. A CEP commissioned study o ftraditional power structures cautioned the project to not undermine the role o f
traditional leaders. `While empowering the Village Development Councils as development agents at the village and sub-
district levels, attention should be paid not to undermine the role of the village- and hamlet chief; who untilnow have
served as the point o fcontact for projects inthe community. They usually have a broad knowledge o fthe local situation
and shouldnot be excluded fi-om the CEP decision-making process. Interestingly, although they were not formally
included inthe process, inmanyplaces they found a way to dominate the discussions andinfluence the outcome.
Traditional leaders couldbe formally appointed to the Village Development Councils. To avoid their domination o fthe
councils, elected council members should be empowered through training and education indevelopment issues. Inthis
way they could achieve more credibility, gain the trust o fthe community andbe ina more equal position inrelation to the
traditional leaders. Council members shouldnot be ina positionhierarchically inferior to the traditional powers. This
composition would ensure that the knowledge o fthe traditional leaders is integrated into the decision process. At the same
time the elected council members could make use o ftheir formal power and, inthe longterm, could start challengingthe
traditional powers." (Ospina andHohe, pg. 146)

                                                        38


the attempt to achieve quick results: the needto adequately understand ground levelreality; the
importance o f a proper monitoring and evaluation system; the difficulty o fproviding credit ina
 sustainable way; the needto tackle issues intheir totality to get effective results. These are
 discussedbelow inthe context o f the five projects.


 Understandingof GroundLevel Real@ Appears toHave Been Weak
 5.12     The design o f both groups o f projects was basedon a weak understandingo f ground level
reality and country context. The ARP Iassumedthat because the agriculture sector inTimor
 suffered severe destruction in 1999, the country was starting from a "clean slate" and the
 framework for agriculture could be designed "from the ground up." Hence, the first project set
 out to promote Pilot Agriculture Service Centers (PASCs) to provide agricultural services to
 farming communities on full cost recovery arrangements without recognizing that inTimor the
majority o f the farmers lived outside a money economy and were not familiar with the business
principles under which the PASCs were expected to operate. Further, though improving food
 security was a project goal, neither ARP Inor ARP I1focused on issues relevant for increasing
the yields o f staple food crops like maize and cassava (see also par. 4.38).

5.13      Many analysts have also questioned the suitability o f the CEP design for conditions in
Timor-Leste. CEP was based on the KecamatanDevelopment Project (KDP) inIndonesia, which
hadbeen designed specifically to overcome the limitations o f the local government system in
Indonesia andto buildcommunity participation inlocal development planning and decision
makingto avoid the lack o f transparency, corruption, andproblems inherent inthe Indonesian
system. Post-conflict East Timor was very different from any province inIndonesia. However,
following the model o f KDP, very few grants under CEP were used for rehabilitation o f social
infrastructure, though that was a priority need. Analysts have also noted that project manuals and
training, which were based on the experience o f the Indonesia KDP,may have systematically
discouraged investment insocial infrastructure. A large numbero f CEP facilitators also had
worked under KDP and likely brought their experiences andbiases with them. As the CEPproject
assessment shows, the objective o f the CEP project to create institutions o f local governance was
unrealistic and didnot take into account the village-level power structure. The recent Human
Development Report (UNDP 2006) also notes how the CEP, insettingup a parallel system o f
decisionmaking, undervalued the existing capacity o f communities.'*


TheRural Finance Lessonsof thePast WereDisregarded
5.14      The lessons o fthepast show that providingcredit as apart o f a grant program is not
effective unless it i s part o f a carefully preparedrural finance intervention. The CEP was not a
financial sector project and credit was includedas a subcomponent. The focus was primarily on
micro-credit delivery without attention to broader issues o f micro-finance services such as deposit
facilities, saving schemes, training for cash flow monitoring, and the like, which are equally
important to credit availability. Grant-funded credit programs are particularly unsoundbecause
they lack accountability, ownership, and have recovery issues (Corder0 2000). The project
assessment found that the subcomponent was not effective. Communities lacked information
about how the schemes were expected to operate andthe selection o f individuals for the credit
program was not transparent, which led to significant elite capture. Analysts have also raised


78. "Many recent developmentprojectshave, not, however, takenthis lesson onboard, ignoringtraditionalstructures
and insteadtryingto buildnew ones that seemunlikelyto survivewhen the projectstops.The TFET Community
EmpowermentProject, for example, initially triedto bypassthe existingSuco leadershipandinsteadestablisheda
parallelmechanismfor decisionmaking.While this appearedappropriateintheory, inpractice it failedto buildany
consensusbehinditsdecisionsand thus was unableto implementthem." UNDP 2006.

                                                   39


 concern about the potential negative impact on the emerging credit culture ina country by
 providing credit outside a carefully preparedrural finance intervention (Conroy 2004). Project
 files show that the risko f including credit was brought to the attention o f the Bank at the project
 concept review meeting. Conversations with Bank staff who worked on CEP reveal that they
 were aware o f the risks of including a credit component, but nevertheless included it because o f
 the needto inject liquidityto stimulate economic activity. What was the alternative inthat
 environment? IEGnotes that greater liquiditycouldhave been injectedby puttingmore resources
 inthe grantprogram. Bankstaffalsonote that the CEPcredit componentwas meant to be a very
 short-term solution to an immediate problem untilthe ADB micro-finance project became
 effective and began contributing to the goal o f financial sector reconstruction. However, the
 number o f loans made was substantially greater than originally planned. The total value o f loans
 made by end-August was US$1.305 millionand the total repayment was only 31percent.


 Trackingof Inputs, Outputsand Outcomes WasNot GivenAdequateAttention
 5.15    Adequate tracking o f input, outputs and outcomes i s anecessity inany project. Inthe
 fluidpost-conflict situationinTimor, itwas also important to provide feedback about the
 adaptations that are neededinproject designto ensure that the project goals and implementation
 are inkeeping with the emerging context. This didnot require the setting up o f a baseline. IEG's
 review o f the Bank's post-conflict experience (World Bank 1998) noted: "The post conflict
 context requires that operations receive more intensive monitoringto ensure the continued
relevance-as     well as effectiveness and efficiency-of the portfolio." Inboth the CEP and the
 ARP projects, M&Ewas weak intrackingproject outputs and outcomes. Inaddition, particularly
 inthe CEP, there was no system inplacewhichcouldprovide a feedback about designand
 implementation. This turnedout to be a serious handicap. The ICRnotes, "the Bank team didnot
 succeed inimplementing the kinds o f adaptations that would have beennecessaiyto work within
the environment that emerged. Chief among these was a failure to find a successfd form o f
 sustained interaction with district government, both duringthe UNTAETperiod and duringthe
transitional and independence periods that followed" (ICR, page 4). Further, the fact that project-
established councils didnot fit well with traditional patterns o f social organization was an issue
 for M&E to pick up and provide feedback. However, because o f the lack o f informed feedback
and also because such a role had not beenvisualized for M&E, an opportunity was lost to adjust
the design mid-course so that CEP councils couldbecome more thanjust conduits for donor
resources. There were three CEP projects and there was ample opportunity to correct the design
after the first project ifM&Ehadbeenusedaffectively. However, the CEP councils continued to
function the way they were originally designed through the three projects and the final project
outcome was far from satisfactory. Similarly, the ARP would have benefited from a feedback
mechanismregardingrelevance o f selectedproject activities for achieving the project goals o f
promoting food security and agricultural production.


Focus on Issues in Their Totalityto Establish Prioritiesfor Action WasMissing

5.16     The projects also do not appear to have established priorities for action based on
consideration o frelevant issues intheir totality. This again seems to have happenedbecause
inadequate time was spent inunderstandingthe country circumstances before designing the
project. There are several examples. First,both o f the ARP projects focused on rehabilitation o f
irrigationschemes to help increase rice production. However, too little thought was given to all
the factors that are involvedinincreasing rice production. Achieving the projectedyields required
not only an assuredwater supply but also fertilizers, seeds, and other inputs.However, the
incentive for farmers to buy these products was low as domestically producedrice faces an
intense competition from imported rice. The incentives to buy and sell also received little
attentioninthe overall attempt at increasingrice production. Inaddition, issues likepost-harvest

losses, which have substantial bearing on food security, were not considered." Second, as already
seen inpar. 4.58, while the project was attempting to promote Pilot Agriculture Service Centers
as business entities, little thought was given to the unsuitability o f Bank disbursement and
procurementprocedures, particularly inthe initialyears. Third, under ARP I1some activities like
fishponds supported inremote villages were successfulunder one componentbutwere
constrainedby access to the markets. Under another component the project supported
rehabilitation o f farm-to-market roads yet the roads rehabilitated were not strategically selected to
ensure that they could support successful activities under the first component. Insupporting
activities, either villages that were already well connected should have been selected or thought
should have been givento ensuring that roads rehabilitatedunder another component were going
to provide access for these remote communities. Fourth, the CGIAR subcomponent was meant to
linkMAFFto the globalnetworkofagriculturalresearchcenters. However, howthis activity
would be carried out with a weak communications networkwas not considered. Effective and
responsive linkswith farmers had also not beenthought through. Withthe pullout o f the UN,
Internet andphone communication became even weaker.


LACK OF GOVERNMENT             CAPACITY WAS SEENAS AN OPPORTUNITY

5.17      Eventhough capacity buildingwas a UNresponsibility (par. 1.                  lo), TFET projects
designed and implementedby the Bank made specific efforts to enhance capacity. This
presumably couldnot have been avoided for any project implemented inthe post-conflict
situation. However, project documents offer little recognitionthat the Bank was steppingbeyond
its mandate or that there was any coordination betweenthe Bank and the UNon the matter. The
JAM identification o f apower vacuum (par. 2.7) was seenby the Bank as "a window of
opportunity to introduce democratic structures, based on the beliefthat elected village councils
managing development funds on behalfof the communities couldbe a means to bypass or replace
the former authoritarianstructure"(Greig andNordhaug2004, World Bank 2002d). What
followed was the CEP project, which called for the establishment o f democratically elected
community councils to form the basis of a local governance structure andbuildcapacity inthe
communities to take charge o f their own development. Project-establisheddevelopment councils
were expected inthe long term to take onresponsibility for preparing and executingvillage
developmentplans that addressed localneeds invarious sectors as determinedby the community;
produce village codes o f conduct andresolve disputes; manage village funds; andrelay priority
developmentneeds that could not be met through localefforts to sub-districts and districts.
However, the assessment o f the three CEP projects argues that the decision to set up these
councils waspremature and unrealistic (pars. 3.12-3.14)

5.18     The TJNTAET Regulation also clearly stated that the "Village Councils and Sub-District
Councils shall not duplicate or replace the role o f the traditional and local leaders o f such villages
and sub-districts." Hence, the CEP councils resulted inthe establishment o f a parallel structure
whose primarypurpose became the distribution anduse o f CEP resources. Several studies also
show that, infact, village chiefs and leaders influenced the decision-making process informally,
includingthe election o f council members (Nordhaug 2004, Grieg andNordhaug 2204, Nordic
Consulting Group 2003, Joint Government-Civil Society Study o f Development Projects 2004).


ANDASAN IMPLEMENTATION               CONSTRAINT

5.19     The lack oflocal capacity was arecognized implementation constraint andthe Bankset
upprovisional arrangements to implement the projects. Consultants substituted for local capacity.

79. The Joint Agricultural Donors Mission o f 2001 had found that post-harvest losses were as highas 46 percent.

                                                          41


 As notedinthe project assessments, large amounts ofresources ineachofthe five TFET projects
 were usedfor consulting services. Roughly US$1out o f every US$3 spent on Timor-Leste
reconstructionwas for technical assistanceand consulting services (EC 2004).*O Inthe CEP
project technical assistanceand local staffing cost was about 58 cents for every dollar disbursed
to sub-projects (World Bank 2004a). The Bank was unrealistic inassuming that such an approach
 couldprovide an effective solution to the capacity constraint. InARP I1it was envisaged at
 appraisal that the P M Uwould require only 12 months o f foreign advisory inputs.At mid-termit
was realized that this was insufficient and either replacement advisors were appointed or the
contracts for existing ones were extended. Inmost cases, when the consultants left the capacity
that was builtwent with them.The weak existingcapacity didnot alter the ambitious project
designs and the pace o f implementation. Little attempt was made to understand how project
implementation, through consultants and facilitators, could improve the government's capacity to
undertake development activities. Neither was weak capacity seen as a reason to scale down.
When the CEP was launchedthere was little capacity to implement inUNTAET, internalbanking
and distribution systems were non-existent, procurement capacity was very limited, and there
were no systems inplace to communicate effectively with the field where the project was to be
implemented. One o f the arguments commonly made infavor o f community-driven projects like
CEP i s that communities can to a large extent substitute for weak government capacity. However,
to get the communities to do this, substantial initial support and facilitation i s required for which
basic government capacity i s essential. Supervision reports note concerns about effective use of
resources, lack o f understandingo f the purpose o f the whole exercise among communities, and
poor facilitation. Eventhen, project implementation continued at full speed. As noted inpar. 3.26,
the pressure to disburse took over the implementation. This was confirmed by feedback
stakeholders provided to the IEGassessmentmission.

5.20       Project Management Units(PMUs) were established to manage the projects and keep
them on track. These were seen as World Bank controlled entities. While the PMUfor the
Agriculture RehabilitationProject was integratedwith the Ministryo f Agriculture, the CEP P M U
never achieved integration with the Ministry o f Local Affairs even though it was the first P M Uto
be runby Timorese.81The significantly highwage levels o f the PMUstaff set them apart from the
government and on project closure little o f the capacity generated inthe P M Ugot transferred to
government offices. Even inthe case o f the ARP PMU, the difference insalaries between
ministrystaff andlocalconsultants was a cause for resentmentandmade it difficult for the
consultants to be absorbed ingovernment positions.82The project design included substantial
provision for training o f government officials; however, the quality o f the training was weak,
language was a barrier, and often the same staffparticipated inseveral trainings because o f the
limitednumber o f officials. Moreover, the staff that hadbeen trained were also the most attractive
candidates for recruitment by the several multilateral andbilateral donors active inthe country to
be a part o ftheir implementation teams. Weak capacity continues to be one o f Timor-Leste's
biggest challenges.

5.21      The process o fnegotiating TFET grants was itself a capacity buildingexercise that
involved detailed discussion aroundprogram design and responsibilities o f the Bank and the


80. "There is ageneralcomplaintby our Timoreseinterlocutors,particularlybyNGOs andgovernment officials, that too
muchhasgoneintotechnicalassistanceandconsultingservices,which are mostlypaymentsto foreigners or expatriate
Timorese. There is the perceptionthat foreigntechnicalassistants are overpaidandthat the moneygoes backto the donor
countries, insteadofbeingusedfor Timor-Leste'sreconstructionanddevelopment." EuropeanUnion 2004.
8 1. "CEP did not coordinatewell with the District Administration and its PMUremainednot integratedwith the
Ministry of Local Affairs. (European Union 2004).
82. Bank staff commentedthat while this happenedinitially under ARF' I,   under ARP I1national consultants'salaries
were reducedto the level of governmentstaff, forcing many of them to apply to governmentpositions.

                                                          42


government. But the Bank didnot have a clear strategy for capacity building.The implementation
experience o f the five projects shows that the expatriate experts focused on implementing the
project and hadlittle time to attend to buildingcapacity. This i s not unusual and analysts note that
few firms or consultants have skills inproviding emergency services and ingrooming nationals to
replace them (World Bank 2003a). The pressure to act and disburse quickly put a tremendous
strain on the weak government. InTimor-Leste the issue was complicated even further because it
was difficult for the experts to communicate with local officials because o f the multitude o f local
languages.83The working language o f the UNTAETwas English(and to a lesser extent
Portuguese), which very few East Timorese understoodwell; hence, their participation inmany
regular administration activities was limited.As has been noted by a recent IEGreview on
capacity buildinginAfrica (World Bank 2005a), many Bank projects have capacity building
activities embedded intheir major operational components, but the objectives o f these activities
tend to be illdefinedand their achievements are poorly tracked andreported. Such was also the
case of the five projects inTimor-Leste whose capacitybuildingefforts lacked a strategic focus.
The strategy for capacity building,particularly where capacity i s so weak, needs to be well
thought through and givenpriority attention.84It cannot be assumedthat it would "automatically"
get built as the projects get implemented. Analysts note that buildingpermanent capacity needs to
start early inthe reconstructionprocess and move ahead inparallel with temporary arrangements
that enable a quick start to reconstruction(World Bank 2003a).85


ANDTHEREWAS LITTLE                EFFECTIVECOORDINATION

5.22       Two issues are covered here: coordination among Bank projects and coordination among
donors. First,there was little effective coordination between various Bank projects. IEGreviews
and project assessmentsshow that this i s a general problem with Bankprojects inmost countries
and arises to a large extent because o f the sectoral organization of the institution, which limits an
integrated approach across sectors. This negatively affected project outcomes. Second, though
there were severaljoint donor missions, and a large part o f the donor support to Timor-Leste was
through TFET, coordinationbetween donors remainedweak, despite intentions to the contrary.

5.23      While boththe CEP and ARP were active in the same rural space, there was little
coordination between their activities duringimplementation other than the transfer o f the radio
component from ARP to CEP. For example, while the CEP excludedvillage leaders from the
councils it created, ARP I1relied on the village leaders and not the CEP councils. Initially ARP
did expect to use the village councils, but once it became clear that these councils didnot have
sufficient trust and authority it chose a different route. Existenceo f strong village leadership
(usually understoodto meanvillage chiefs and traditional leaders) was used as a criterion for
selecting villages for the implementation o f the pilot natural resource management activities
under ARP 11.ARP Ialso depended on the village chiefs and other village council members to
help identifybeneficiaries for the distribution o f productive assets. Hence, at the design stage the
projects were expected to be instep with each other, but duringimplementation, they moved




83. Languagewas abarrier inthe participation of local staff inproject designand implementation. Inthe context of the
CEP the La'o Hamutuk Bulletinnoted, "Several mid-level CEP staff who are interestedinunderstandingthe grant
agreement process feel excludedfrom the processbecausethey do not speak or understandEnglish."
84. Bank staff commentedthat staff were not fully recruited until ARP I1was well under implementation. With no staff
or structureyet inplace, it would not havebeenpossibleto do any coherent capacitybuilding strategy.
85. Bank staff commented that the weak attentionto capacitybuilding arose because of a structural fault with the
CFETITFET arrangementandbelongsto an evaluationofthe entire post-conflict experience and shouldnot be
attributedto individual projects.

                                                           43


 apart. This damaged the image o f CEP, as other donors and NGOs saw that the Bank's own
 projects were not usingCEP councils.

 5.24       The village development councils were also not used by other agencies for
 implementation or coordination o f activities, although this was one o fthe primary intentions
 behind their establishment. This was partly becausethe councils were not considered legitimate
 governing unitsbut also partly because other donors hadtheir own agendas at the grass roots
 level. Most international NGOsrefusedto use the councils because o f their lack o f credibility in
 the communities (Joint Government-Civil Society Study o f Development Projects 2004). The
 CEP councils were seen primarily as World Bank councils. There were several projects that were
 active at the community level when the CEP was under implementation, such as AusAid's East
 Timor Community Assistance Scheme (ETCAS), USAID'STransitional Employment Program
 (TEP). Different projects also adopted differentpolicies andprocedures for use intheir approach
 toward community participation, thereby creating confkion among communities.86There was
 also little coordination between donors working inthe field o f community radios. Several donors
 (UNICEF, DANIDA,USAID, UNDP) have supported community radio projects. The radio
 component o fthe Bank's CEP project was not linkedwith the activities o f any o f t.hese donors.

 5.25       Coordinationbetween the major external actors active inTimor-Leste was also weak.
 While donor coordination has always been a challenge, it can be particularly damaging for a post-
 conflict country where in-country capacity i s very weak. When responsibility for various
 activities was dividedbetween the UNand the World Bank, capacity buildingwas seen as a UN
responsibility. Eventhen it was made an integral part o f the CEP. Project documents do not show
 an agreement betweenthe UNand the Bank on this issue. Infact, the relations betweenthe Bank
 and the UNover the CEP were quite uneven. UNTAET was working to establish an
 administrative structure at the central leveland didnot wish to simultaneously preempt local
 governance structures. Even less did it want the World Bank to be involved inshaping
 government institutions (Nordhaug 2004).87UNTAETwanted the program to be more firmly
 controlled by the emerging district administration while the Bank arguedthat the weak district
levelneeded to be bypassed. The final agreement was only reachedwith the intervention o f the
General Secretary o f the UNand the President o f the World Bank. Because o f the weak in-
country capacity, the implementation o f the CEPrequired ahighdegree o f coordination between
the Bank and the UNTAETwhich was lacking. Since UNTAETunwillingly signed the grant
agreement, it i s understandable why the organization's commitment to the project continued to be
limited.Lack o f agreement betweenthe UNTAETandthe World Bank about the project design
affected the implementation o f the project inthe field "undermining the Council's political
legitimacy and encouraging the CEP to develop inparallel with UNlocal government grant
agreements"(Joint Government-Civil Society Study o f Development Projects 2004).

women. Inthe TEP, participationofwomen andmenvariedacrossdistricts, with menpredominantlyinvolvedinroad
work; andwomen includedinactivitiessuch as marketcleanup or communitygardening..        .. Themajority ofthe

were targeted to women. The CEP approachtries to integrategender inall aspects ofthe project:fifty percent ofthe

halfofthoseproposed, a gender balance inthe facilitator teamis encouraged, andall staffreceivegender-training."

87. "Because UNTAET informally cooperated closelywith the village chiefs through CNRT, to themexcludingthese
leaders fromthe CEP structurewas a way ofdelimitingthe role of the councils to more ofadevelopment agent. For the
World Bank, onthe other hand, excludinglocal leadersfromthe villagedevelopmentcouncils was seen as an important
step in introducingdemocraticlocallevelgovernment." Nordhaug2004.

                                                       44


 5.26     There was also lack o f agreement betweenthe Bank and ADB over the design and
 structure o f the credit subcomponent even though ADB raisedconcerns about the possible
 implications o f the component for the establishment o f sustainable microfinance institutions." In
 fact the difference inthe approaches to microfinance inthe CEP and the ADB-supported
 MicrofinanceDevelopment Project were substantial and early supervision missions notedthe
 potential confusion that this couldcreate ina very small financial market as inrural East Timor.
 ADB management also brought these concerns to the attention ofBank staff.



 6.       Lessons
 6.1      The experience o f the five projects offers four lessons for the Bank's future involvement
 inpost-conflict situations. Ingeneral, such interventions mayrequire greater Bankmanagement
 oversight than usual since projects are preparedquickly and implementedunder very difficult
 conditions. IEG's 1998review o f the Bank's experience with post-conflict reconstructionhad
 noted the importance o f proactive involvement by senior Bank management as a requirement for
 Bank assistance ina post-conflict context.

          9 Withits global outreach andthe expertise andexperience ofits staffthe Bankiswell-
              positioned to make a substantial contribution to post-conflict reconstruction and
               development. However, the experience o f the three community empowerment and
              the two agriculture rehabilitation projects shows that careful thought to suitability o f
              design and strategies to country conditions i s paramount, especially where country
               capacity i s weak. Mistakes can be difficult and expensive to correct.
          9 Eveninthe caseofpost-conflict Timor-Leste, where sophisticated M&Ewas
              impractical, there was a need to have a system to track project inputs,outputs, and
              outcomes andprovide information about the adaptations needed inproject design to
              ensure that the project objectives and activities are inkeeping with the emerging
              institutional context and the absorptive capacity o f the country. IEG's 1998 Review
              o f the Bank's experience with post-conflict reconstructionhad notedthat a post-
              conflict context requires that operations receive more intensive monitoring to ensure
              their continued relevance, as well as effectiveness and efficiency.
          9 Particularly inpost-conflict environments, anapproachto capacitybuildingthat
              considers the underlying capacity inthe country as well as how it would be promoted
              by the various donors is critical. It cannot be assumedthat government capacity will
              get builtduringproject implementation through on-the-job transfer o f expertise from
              international advisors and project-supported training activities.
         9 Theexperience ofTimor-Leste highlightsthe critical importanceofcoordinating
              multi-agency reconstruction efforts more effectively ina newlyindependent post-
              conflict country. While the international community was able to raise a large amount
              o f resources for development o f Timor-Leste, there was lack o f agreement between
              the major players on critical strategies, inparticular those dealing with promotiono f
              micro-credit and local governance. This worked both to the detriment o f the donors
              and the country and ledto less effective and efficient utilizationo f resources.


88. "There appearsto beamajor differenceof opinionbetweenthe ADB andthe World Bankregardingthe structure
anddesignofmicro-creditprogrammesand inparticulararecommendationfromthe ADB that the CEP interest rate
shouldbe adjustedfrom 10% to 37.5% p.a. inline with the ADB financial analysisof feasibilityandsustainability."

 Annex B. Sector and Political Context

 SECTOR ANDPOLITICAL CONTEXT

 While mappedinthe Bank's system to the Social Protection Sector Boardthe Community
 Empowermentprojects were multi-sectoral and were compatible withinitiatives inhealth,
 education, roads, agriculture and subnational government administration. Their scope was wide as
 theprojectswere expected to develop a framework for bottomupparticipationinplanningand
 development. The Agriculture Projects were mapped to the Rural Sector Board and covered
 agriculture, forestry, naturalresource management, fishing activities but also ruralinfrastructure.

 Agriculture
 The agriculture sector employs more than 80 percent o f the
 population o f Timor-Leste but contributes only 25 percent to its
 GDP due to low output per worker. Foodcrops are the single most
 important contributor followedby non food and estate crops like
 coffee. Livestock, fishery and forestry industries are not well
developed and contribute comparatively little to GDP, though they         Crop                   Households

play a significant role inmeeting the livelihoodneeds o f the                                    Growing
                                                                                                 crop (YO)
population. Livestock i s an important source o f food security
reserve inscarce times. While forests have always been important         Maize                   81
to the economy o f Timor-Leste, they have been severely over
harvested. The widespread use o f slash and burnagriculture has          Cassava                 68
ledto deforestationand soil erosion, threatening the success o f
agricultural crops inthe longrun.Continuing degradation has also         Sweet Potato            44
                                                                        I
adversely affected watersheds and has direct implications for
availability o f water for irrigation and consequently food security.    Taro                   I33
There i s limited information on off-shore fisheries. Relatively
small scale aquaculture activities focused on inland production are      Bananas
significant locally (Republica Democratica de Timor-Leste 2004).         Squash
Mucho f the land i s difficult to farm because o f the rugged and
uneven topography. About 21 percent o f the land i s less than 500       Rice (all
meters above sea level and about 35 percent i s more than 1,000          ecosystems)

meters above sea level. Ofthe estimated 600,000 ha o f land
suitable for arable production, only 40 percent is cultivated most o f   Coffee

which i s dominatedby subsistence production o f staples such as         Kidneybeans
maize, cassava, beans, tubers and root crops for domestic
consumption. Rice i s also grown but on a comparatively smaller          Vegetables
scale than maize (Table A.1). A few higher-value products are also
produced inparticular coffee, but also coconut, candlenut, h i t s
and vegetables. Coffee i s the most important commercial
agricultural commodity and i s an important source o f seasonal          Mungbean                5

Agriculture i s largely rain-fed and most of the areaproduces only one crop a year. The rainfall
pattern i s varied with the mountains receiving more rain than the coastal plains. The southern
regionreceives more rainfall (2,000 millimeters or more) andhas two harvests, while the northern
regionreceives less rainfall and often has one harvest. The country i s affected by the periodic El
Nino-related weather anomalies and i s highlyvulnerable to droughts and floods which adversely
affect the livelihood and food security o f the people.


Education

Investment ineducation duringthe pre-transitionperiodwas not sufficient particularly inthe rural
areas and, as a result, today Timor-Leste's achievements ineducation are low. The recent Country
Assistance Strategy document notedthat only 50 percent o f the adults inthe country are literate
and less than one-third had some form o f secondary education (CAS World Bank 2005). There i s
also a strikinggap between urban areas where the literacy rate i s about 82 percent and the rural
areas where it i s only 37 percent. The violence of September 1999 destroyed partially or
completely 80 to 90 percent o f school buildings and relatedinfrastructure andnearly all the
textbooks and school material. Just as damaging was the loss o f teachers and school
administrators most o f whom were Indonesians and left the country.

The country embarked on arebuilding campaign soon after the UnitedNations peacekeepers
arrived and a transitional administrationwas putinplace. Withintwo years, withthe technical and
financial support o f the internationalcommunity, many schools were rehabilitated, new teachers
were hired,and the education systembecame operational. The first NationalDevelopment Plan
(2002) made education a cornerstone o f its strategy to alleviatepoverty and facilitate economic
growth. A National EducationPolicywas approved inMarch2004 and defines the key objectives
o f the sector as expanding access, improvinginternal efficiency and improvingthe quality o f
education.


Health

Health standards inthe country are poor. In2004 life expectancy was estimated at only 55.5
years-54    years for males and 56.6 years for females (UNDP 2006). The system for provision o f
health services continues to be weak. While health systems improved under Indonesian rule in
comparisonto those under Portuguese colonization, expenditures on health systems, hospitals and
clinics were eventhen insufficient incomparison to localneed. The country continues to face
several challenges. The average life expectancy i s comparable with those o f Cambodia and
Myanmar but much lower than that ina number o f other ASEAN (Association o f South East
Asian Nations) countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam. Access to health facilities remains a
problem. Immunization rates for children are very low and under-five mortality i s high.At 200
per 1,000,000 live births, it i s more than twice that o f Indonesia's. Major causes of death are
preventable diseases such as malaria, respiratory tract infections and diarrhea.

Significant progress has been made since the violence o f 1999 inrebuildingpublic health
facilities andre-establishinghealth services, but further progress i s neededparticularlyin
expanding immunization coverage and improving pre-natal care. Given severe capacity
constraints the health system continues to be highly dependent on international doctors and
specialists.

 Infrastructure

 Onlythree hnds o f infrastructureto whichthe five projects contributedarebriefly coveredhere:
 roads, irrigation and water supply.


 Roads
 While the country has an extensive roadnetwork largely constructed during Indonesiantimes, it i s
 invery poor condition andmaintenance ismadeevenmoredifficult by frequent landslides and
 floodingg9There are few vehicles inthe country and traffic volumes are light.Withthe light traffic
 andpoor roadconditions, the highmaintenance costs are not financially feasible nor economically
 viable (World Bank 2004a). There i s currentlynoregular transport service to bringagricultural
 produce to the market andno organized marketingsystemwith subdistrict collectionpoints
 (Republica Democratica de Timor-Leste 2004)


 Irrigation
 There are about 420 irrigation schemes most of which are small "run-of-the river" schemes.Very
 few have any arrangements for water storage and water inmany o fthe irrigated areas i s available
 only whenriver water level from the source has increasedto the level o f the intake of the irrigation
 systems.Maintenancei s a chronic problem, with river-in-flood damage and siltingthe maincauses
 of damage. Rice dominates irrigation crop production. Irrigation infrastructure deteriorated inthe
 late 1990s due to neglectand lack o f maintenance. Emphasis to date has beenon the rehabilitation
 o f irrigation schemes as the primary means of increasing agricultural production. DuringIndonesian
 times, a strong emphasis was placed onrice productionby investinginirrigation andproviding
 subsidized inputssuch as fertilizer. However, given the conflicting demands on resources, the
 feasibility o freservoir constructionto supplement irrigation inthe dry season has to be further
 investigated (Republica DemocraticaD e Timor-Leste 2004).


 WaterSupply
Prior to the violence o f 1999, Timor-Leste had a fairly extensive public water supply network
covering the 13 district towns and 49 o f the 63 subdistrict towns. However the quality o f the
system and its service coverage was poor. As a result, private shallow wells were used
extensively inDili and other towns. Villages and rural areas not served by the public water supply
systems had community operated pipedsystems, some o f which received water from public
systems and others from small springs or streams. Shallow wells were also extensively used in
rural areas. About 48 percent o f the total population o f the country had access to safe water.

Today halfthe population continues to be without access to safe water. Duringthe violence,
urbanpiped water systems suffered extensive damage but rural water supplies were largely
spared though there were reports o f wells being poisoned, hand pumps stolen and pipesremoved.
ByMay 2000, water supplies inmost ofthe 13 district towns, includingDili,hadbeenmore or
less restored. Local and international NGOsplayed a significant role inrehabilitating rural water
supplies; providinghandpumps; cleaning contaminatedwells; andrepairing pipesand tanks.
Though a large part of the service has beenre-established a lot remains to be done. Access to
cleanwater inrural areas needs to be expanded and will contribute significantly to improvingthe
livelihoodo f the poor.

the remainderurbanroads (World Bank 2004a).

 FormalandInformalLocal Government Structure

 This section attempts to provide a backgroundfor understandingthe local government structure
 inpost-conflict Timor-Leste. Administratively the country is dividedinto 13 districts (Distritos)
 grouped into three Regions, 67 subdistricts (Postos), 500 villages (Sucos) and 2,336 sub-villages
 (Aldeias or hamlets). Each Suco consists o f one or more Aldeias. The Sucos and the Aldeias
remain the base level o f societal organization inTimor.

Under Indonesianrule, East Timor was a separate province under a governor with three Regions
 (Wilayahs) and 13 districts (called Kabupaten then), though there were only 62 subdistricts
 (called Kecamatan then). There was a highlevel o f centralization o f tasks with Jakarta directly
taking decisions and managing a significant number o f government functions such as budget
allocation, agriculture policies. The administrationwas carried out through a huge bureaucracy
that encompassed the entire country. The estimated 1998 size of the Indonesian government
 sector inEast Timor, other than the army and police numbered about 33,000 (Pedersen and
Ameberg 1999). Within East Timor, three governor's assistants managedthe three Regions.
Almost half o f the government employees worked as a part o fthe provincial administration and
the remainder worked at the district level. The local government was largely an extension o f the
central government. The district leader was called the Bupati and the subdistrict leader was called
the Camat. The government appointedthe subdistrict leaders but the village chief was to be
electeddemocratically by the people. Inpractice the personwas mostly selected inkeeping with
traditional power structures.

Followingthe referendum, and approval o f its result by the IndonesianNational Assembly, the
Indonesian Administration stopped paying the salaries o f the government staff and eliminated
Timor's budget beginningNovember 1999. A very large percentage o f the government staff in
East Timor were Indonesians who left the country at the time o f the violence. East Timor was
theninthe hands oftheinternationalcommunity andthe UNTAETmissionwas installedunder
the Transitional Administrator. The UNhad a tremendous responsibility. It was faced with the
responsibility o f continuing activities on a daily basis without a national government but also with
taking decisions on the old administration structure and the remaining employees. One o f the
challenges for the new country was to keep the government size small incomparison to what
existed inIndonesiantimes.

InNovember 1999, the UNcreatedthe Office ofTerritorial Administration and gave it
responsibility for subnational administration. Inthe following years the office went through
several changes finally becoming the Administration o f Local Government and Development
(ALGD) andthis titleremaineduntilthe restorationofindependence inMay 2002. UNTAET
recruited staffthrough the UNsystemto fill the district and subdistrict administrations. The
deployment o f international staff to the districts started inOctober 1999 and was more or less
complete by August 2000. Inthe subdistricts UnitedNations volunteers were to be used as field
officers though inpractice deployment o f international staff to subdistricts was limited.District
and other posts were only gradually filled by Timorese, however the ALGD office inDili
continued to be predominantly staffed by international staffthrough 2001. It was only in
December 2001that a Timorese Director for ALGD was recruited.

The Transitional Administration didnot define a formal localgovernment structure for the Suco
level. Even after the UNTAEThad established an administrative structure at the district and
subdistrictlevels, the administrationo fSucos andAldeias was largely under the control o fthe East
Timorese Resistance incooperation with traditional leaders. Ineach village a council o f elders that
was well informed about the status and history o f all families inthe areausually appointedthe Suco
chief. InTimorese society, local leaders derive their powers from descent andanew Suco chief i s

                                                               53


 also ratified by the ritual authorities to insure hisancestral legitimacy. The community fears
 ancestral punishmentifthe ancestorsdidnot legitimize the political leader.90991The Suco chief
 played an importantrole duringPortuguese times inimplementingpolicies, collectingtaxes and
 coordinating community labor and leadingthe community intheir daily non-ritual issues.Under
 Indonesiantimes the authority o fthe Suco chief remained intact and hehada large degree o f
 autonomy inmanagement o f Suco affairs. Suco chiefs were expected to seek approval from the
 relevantritualleaders and the elders o fthe community before makingimportant decisions.
 Consensus-based decision makingwas the norm intraditional Timorese society and the Suco
 chiefheld a special, ritually sanctioned position o f authority inthe process. The East Timorese
 see the Chefe de Suco as their link with the government and world at large (NDI2003). (For a
 more thorough review o ftraditional structures at the Suco level see Ospina and Hohe 2001,
 commissioned by the CEP project).




90. "In traditional Timorese society, only certain leaders-in     most cases the village chief-can  acceptably function as a
political authority. His source o f legitimacy is his heredity as part o f a family ordained by ancestral approval. Ifthe
wrong person exercises political power, upsetting the cosmic order and the continuation o f fertility, then villagers will
fear ancestral sanctions that endanger the survival o f the community, such as harvests failing or children falling ill.
Furthermore, the separation o fpolitical powers does not make sense, since the village chief exercises his authority ina
distinct hierarchy that hnctions in strict oppositionto ritual power as part o f the overall sociocosmic order." Chopra
and Hohe 2004.
91. The political rulers are always appointed by the ritual powers. Inmost cases the elders sit together and discuss who
should be the new political ruler. They chose from the right descendants and discuss which o f the available people are
the most skilled in speaking and negotiating. The ritual authorities are seen as superior, as they have the connection to
the ancestors who are the founders o f the Houses. Only the ritual authorities have the knowledge about the descent lines
and oaths that were taken inthe past. Hence they have the capacity to choose a political ruler that is also sanctioned by
the ancestors. People are often scared ifa ruler does not conform to this system, as this can mean misfortune for the
whole community caused by angry ancestral powers. Opsina and Hohe, 2001
