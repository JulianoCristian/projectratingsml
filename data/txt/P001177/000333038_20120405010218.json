the Transport Sector\n            Adjustment/Investment Credit Project for Cote d'Ivoire\n            were as follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the macroeconomic context and the status of\n            public/sectoral finances should be carefully assessed during\n            the preparation of transformational projects to ensure\n            adequate funding and financial coverage during\n            implementation. The preparation and implementation of a\n            project should be cognizant of the political economy factors\n            affecting it but at the same should primarily focus on the\n            objectives, components and activities supported by the\n            project. Assurance of continued support to institutional\n            reforms in the medium term should be sought in the form of\n            adequate personnel and funding and compliance with the legal\n            framework. The mentoring and evaluation (M&E) framework\n            should be simple, easily implementable without too much\n            reliance on project funding, and the Borrower should see a\n            clear benefit in implementing it. The government should\n            identify and empower a champion to push through sectoral\n            reforms through entrenched vested interests. The Bank's\n            added value is to facilitate the implementation of\n            institutional reform by leveraging its global experience of reforms."}, "docdt": "2012-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
