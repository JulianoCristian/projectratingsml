                         Project implementation is underway after the Bank approved an extension of the closing date for one year (until August 31, 2011). Thanks to this one-year extension of the project
                         implementation timeframe, about 10 t more bridges will be constructed (probably more, depending on the actual results of the bidding process). Out of the current 50 bridges
                         under construction. 40 are fully completed and delivered, while 7 are completed but not yet formallly delivered. As a matter of fact, the overall project implemnatation status is
                         maintained satisfactory. As of November 3, 2010, 94.3 percent of the Credit amount has been disbursed, and about US$11 million remains undisbursed. There are no outstanding
                         audits, nor Interim Financial Reports (IFRs). With regards to the safeguards, all environmental and social plans associated to civil works are satisfactorily implemented and monitored.
