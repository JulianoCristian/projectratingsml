F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from the Development Credit Agreement)
The initial Project Development Objectives (PDOs) of the project were to: (a) improve
the condition and efficiency of the Borrower’s transport infrastructure; (b) build capacity
for planning, programming and mobilizing funding required for the execution of
investments in the Borrower’s transport sector; and (c) strengthen the legal and regulatory
framework of the Borrower’s transport sector.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by the original approving
authority on September 2, 2008)
The revised PDO is to re-establish and improve road access and safeguard road
infrastructure assets across the country, notably in Northern Regions.

The PDO indicators were revised on September 2, 2008 but neither targets nor baseline
values were explicitly mentioned in the official letter to the Minister of Finance. The
below targets were mutually agreed and documented in aide-memoires.

most domestic arrears were cleared by end-1996. Notwithstanding the positive results of
the comprehensive adjustment strategy, the fiscal situation remained fragile, and the
heavy dependency on external budgetary support continued. Further fiscal consolidation
was needed to achieve external viability and the deepening of structural reforms was
necessary to promote the private sector regarded as the engine of growth.1

2.      The program was consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated
September 11, 1997 (IDA/17007-IVC), which aimed at achieving sustained economic
growth, reducing poverty and restoring financial viability, and more specifically,
supported institutional capacity building and governance and investment in basic
infrastructure in rural areas. The steep cost of transportation had been hampering the
functioning of internal markets, the efficient delivery of social services, and hurting
economic growth as a whole. Consequently, a program of remedial reforms targeting
protectionist or monopolistic practices and loss-making public enterprises was initiated
by the government in the maritime, civil aviation, rail and urban transport sub-sectors.
However, the road sub-sector responsible for 90 percent of transport movements
remained behind in terms of: (a) the poor condition of the infrastructure and the weak
management and maintenance of the same resulting in high vehicle operating costs; and
(b) the efficient organization of transport services.

3.     The purpose of the program and the contributing project was to complete the
reform agenda in the various non-road sub-sectors, carry out additional road specific
reforms coupled to some physical investments to turn around the declining condition of
the road network. The International Development Association’s (IDA) involvement was
also perceived as a critical catalyst to sustain a coherent framework for donor
involvement and coordination in the transport sector. A follow up operation was already
contemplated to assist with the completion of the road maintenance and rehabilitation
program which could only be partially executed during the implementation of the project.

          approved)

4.      The PDO. The objectives2 of the project were to: (a) improve the condition and
efficiency of the Borrower’s transport infrastructure; (b) build capacity for planning,
programming and mobilizing funding required for the execution of investments in the
Borrower’s transport sector; and (c) strengthen the legal and regulatory framework of the
Borrower’s transport sector. The PDOs were consistent with the CAS dated September
11, 1997.

5.   Key Indicators of Performance. The key performance indicators are
summarized in the table below.

                            Table 1: Key Indicators of Performance

1.3      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

7.     The project was restructured eight times (including reallocation of funds and
extension of closing dates), although the PDO and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
were formally revised only once on September 2, 2008.

      (a) November 8, 1999: The closing date was extended from June 30, 2001 until
          December 31, 2002 (cf. paragraph 8). An artificial reef pilot was added to the
          Port Component. The withdrawal categories were adjusted: small reductions of
          allocation under Category 4 - Consultants; two new categories added - Operating
          Costs and Artificial Reef; SDR 19.2 million added to the first tranche. The PDO
          and key indicators remained unchanged.
      (b) December 20, 2001: This ―corrective‖ restructuring, designed to accelerate
          implementation, reflected the recommendations of the July 2001 Mid-Term

   Review (MTR) and the Bank’s re-engagement strategy (Cote d’Ivoire slipped into
   non-accrual status in October 2000). Rural roads, civil aviation, Human
   Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)
   and poverty components were added, the artificial reef pilot was removed; the
   disbursement percentage for civil works were increased from 70 percent to 80
   percent; some withdrawal category allocations were adjusted; and the release
   conditions for the third and floating tranches were modified. The PDO and KPI
   remained unchanged (no additional indicators were proposed to monitor the
   performance of the new components).
(c) December 17, 2002: Extension of project closing date by six months to June 30,
    2003.
(d) June 26, 2003: This ―adaptive‖ restructuring was part of a wider portfolio
    restructuring and responded to urgent post-conflict infrastructure needs, it
    embodied as a key element of the emergency phase of the new Bank re-
    engagement strategy. The restructuring was also ―corrective‖ to some extent in
    that it sought to improve project performance by restricting the institutional
    support to road management and maintenance and lessening project implementing
    arrangements. This was in response to the lack of traction on the non-road related
    institutional reforms. All components were closed except Component A (Roads);
    the closing date was extended until June 30, 2004; the floating tranche was
    canceled (as conditions were not met by the deadline of January 30, 2003); and
    withdrawal category allocations were adjusted. The restructuring of Component A
    was meant to be made in two stages: the first stage set the rules to
    complete/terminate ongoing works and the second stage followed the assessment
    of the additional work program. The assessment was completed in November
    2003; however, the project could not be formally restructured (i.e. revised PDO
    and KPI) before June 15, 2004 when it was once again suspended for more than
    four years.
(e) September 2, 2008: This ―adaptive‖ restructuring was part of a wider portfolio
    restructuring/reactivation following the clearance of arrears by the Borrower and
    the preparation of a new Bank Interim Strategy for fiscal year 08-09; it was meant
    to: (i) adjust the project objectives to the country’s new post-conflict realities; (ii)
    focus on urgent country reconstruction and reunification activities; (iii) extend the
    closing dates to allow the completion of the new activities. Component A was
    finally restructured and a Component B - Road Safety was added; some
    withdrawal category allocations were adjusted; the disbursement percentage for
    civil works was raised to 100 percent thanks to new country parameters; and the
    closing date was extended until August 31, 2010. The PDO was revised to read
    ―the objective of the project is to reestablish and improve road access and
    safeguard road infrastructure assets across the country, notably in the
    Northern Regions‖. The revised KPI are
              number of bridges rehabilitated in the Northern region;
              number of bridges studies completed for the Northern region;
              Road safety training center is rehabilitated;

                                          14
                      Bus station rehabilitated in Grand Bassam;
                      Number of pedestrian accidents reduced by 60 percent at Grand
                       Bassam bus station at end 2009;
                      Number of representatives from road enterprises trained;
                      Environmental mitigation clauses are included in all bridges contracts;
                       and
                      The payments due to contractors are made within 15 days.

      (f) July 3, 2009: Reallocation of Credit Proceeds.

      (g) August 31, 2010:         Reallocation of Credit Proceeds and extension of project
          closing date.

      (h) June 27, 2011: The purpose of this ―adaptive‖ restructuring was to: (i) repair and
          replace office buildings and furniture, IT equipment and vehicles of the Ministry
          of Economic Infrastructure (MIE) and the project implementing agencies which
          were looted during the post-election crisis and the ensuing civil war, and (ii)
          update the transport sector strategy. Acquisition of goods and consulting services
          were added to Component A and withdrawal category allocations adjusted
          accordingly. KPI and PDO remained unchanged.

8.      The initial closing date of June 30, 2001 was extended five times as shown in the
table immediately below. In December 2004, the Bank decided that all operations in Cote
d’Ivoire would be retroactively extended once the suspension3 that started in June 2004
would be lifted, which happened in April 2008 only.

                                   Give the Borrower some additional time for preparing a meaningful
                                   action plan to address the new country’s context. The Bank had become
                                   the coordinator of all donors and it was important to keep its
                                   engagement in an increasingly sensitive dialogue with the government.

 Because of debt service arrears, the project was suspended for six years (71.5 months exactly) over three
distinct periods: October 31, 2000 to January 30, 2002; June 15, 2004 to April 2, 2008; and December 4,
2010 to May 31, 2011.

1.4       Original Components (as approved)

10.    There were two components, an investment component and an adjustment
component. The latter consisted of four credit tranches with release conditions (cf.
paragraph 6) for a total amount of SDR 72.3 million later increased to SDR 116.49
million. The former, for an amount of SDR 58.3 million consisted of five components.5
Component A - Road Construction, Rehabilitation and Maintenance; Component B -
Road Transport; Component C - Urban Transport; Component D - Port; and Component
E - Transport Sector Administration. Each component contained sub-components as
shown in the table below.

12.     In June 2003, all components but Component A were closed. Component A was
revised to reflect the country’s situation, essentially the fact that the northern area was out
of the control of the government and therefore inaccessible for the project. In September
2008, Component A was restructured and a Component B Transport Sector
administration which focused on Road Safety was added as presented in the table below.
Component A (1) was divided into a firm tranche of 50 bridges and a conditional tranche
of 10 bridges pending available resources—this point was specified in aide-memoires but
not in the formal restructuring letter sent to the Minister of Finance.

1.6    Other significant changes

13.    In 2000, the donors who committed to fund the program in 1998 canceled their
support because of the country deep political crisis [French Development Agency (AFD),
European Union (EU) and Japan]. The German Development Agency (KFW) however,
maintained its support but it was not used as originally intended.

14.     In June 2003, the SDR 7 million floating tranche of the adjustment component
was canceled. In June 2011, the proceeds of the investment component were reallocated
to fund the acquisition of equipment and the carrying out of an updated transport sector
strategy.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

15.     The background analysis was thorough and involved numerous experts and field
missions over a 10-year preparation period. Still project design was overambitious; it
exceeded the financial and human capacity available in the country and prescribed a
project implementation period that was too short to meaningfully achieve the institutional
reforms which were contemplated. Yet these points were noted during appraisal,
concerns were raised about the absorptive capacity of the Small and Medium Enterprises
(SME) in terms of qualified labor, equipment and access to credit; about the time
necessary for the Directorate of Highways and Urban Roads (DRV) to successfully
complete its profound restructuring; and about the financing gap in the road investment
component. Because of the short implementation period, too many results were expected
to materialize almost at the same time whereas in reality the change process is more
sequential. For example, a more effective road administration, leads to a more reliable
database, which leads to a tighter monitoring, in turn leading to more efficient works
management, which leads to better road condition.

16.    A series of reform initiatives were launched during project preparation, but the
hard ones did not progress far enough for the project to be successfully implemented.
Therefore, a long list of conditions was imposed before negotiations, board presentation,
and effectiveness. Some of these conditions were postponed or were dropped after
negotiations - the completion of the lay-off plan for DRV, the effective privatization of
the Public Works Equipment Directorate (DMTP), the strengthening program of DRV,
and the advance funding mechanism from the Treasury to secure a fast payment of
contractors’ invoices. Inasmuch as the technical preparation was thorough, the
macroeconomic and fiscal analysis did not adequately flag the severe budget constraints
and liquidity problems that made the government incapable of fulfilling its funding
commitments right from the project start. Furthermore, the Integrated Public Finance
Management System (SIGFIP) start-up problems which affected the budget flow appear
to have been overlooked or underestimated.

                                           19
17.     Although the Government’s commitment seemed to be strong during the
preparation period, once project implementation started it waned. The project team
should have been more candid in its assessment of the real ownership of government of
the reform agenda that the project was supporting and could have been more realistic in
the objectives that the project was supposed to achieve. Furthermore, the team could have
done a more thorough assessment of the quality of governance in the sector to ensure
successful implementation of the investment component. The risk analysis identified the
right potential risks, most of which did materialize. The mitigation factors were
essentially the conditions attached to the release of the adjustment tranches, an instrument
that had been widely used by the Bank at the time to promote reforms. In reality, it did
not work as expected since the tranches, other than the floating tranche, were then
released with conditions partially fulfilled or changed altogether.

18.    Nevertheless, Quality at Entry was rated Satisfactory (S) after a detailed review
undertaken by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG /QEA).

2.2    Major Factors Affecting Implementation

19.     Project implementation got off to a slow start due to budget management issues
and the unresponsiveness of DRV. In December 1999, one year after the project was
declared effective, a military coup was staged, the harbinger of a socio-political crisis that
would negatively affect the country for more than ten years (cf. Timeline in Annex 8).
The country then defaulted on its debt service commitment and the project was
suspended from October 2001 through January 2002. In September 2002, a second coup
attempt followed by a civil war cut the country in two leaving only the southern half of
the national territory under government control. From June 2004 until April 2008, the
country fell again into non-accrual status and the project was suspended. It was
reactivated and restructured in September 2008 and experienced a new suspension from
December 2010 until May 2011 following a post election crisis and civil war upheaval.
Altogether the project was suspended for six years. Thirteen different governments were
sworn in over the project period which saw the rotation of six Finance Ministers, six
Infrastructure Ministers and eleven Transport Ministers.

20.     Within the above cited context, the implementation of the project can be broken
down into three key periods: the first period until the major restructuring of 2003, the
second until the restructuring/reactivation of 2008, and the third until project closing in
August 2011. The review of the first period can be further divided into the investment
part and the adjustment part—there was no more adjustment part after the 2003
restructuring. Details of performance per component can be found in the project’s
implementation status reports and Aide memoires.

21.    September 1998 to June 2003 – Investment Part

       (a)   Context. Economic and financial crises followed the political crisis of
             December 1999 and October 2000, they were marked by decline in

                                             20
             investment, drop in public expenditure and household consumption and
             increase of internal budgetary arrears, and they led to slowdown in
             implementation; by December 2001 four different ministers of transport had
             been appointed; disbursements were suspended from October 2000 until
             January 2002; implementation picked up in 2002 although with some
             serious disruption due to the civil war and the ensuing split of the country in
             September 2002.

       (b)   Poor financial management system. The public financial management
             system was slow and complex and counterpart funds were inadequate. There
             was uncertainty in the release of funds allocated to road maintenance as they
             were combined to the counterpart funds and as such managed by a Public
             Debt officer. The approval process of contractors’ monthly payment
             certificates was lengthy and generated arrears; there were inconsistency
             issues between SIGFIP and CI-PAST budgeting.

       (c)   Weak road construction industry. Contractors were reluctant to sign a
             contract in an uncertain political and budgetary situation and growing
             payment arrears, the quality of works executed by SMEs was poor and the
             training program and access to credit were limited.

       (d)   Unresponsiveness of DRV. The DRV balked at executing its new
             mandate/mission resulting from its restructuring; by June 2002.

       (e)   Unsatisfactory road works program. The execution of the program was
             about three years behind schedule. By December 2001 only 1.5 percent of
             the project funds allocated to road works had been disbursed, however this
             number increased to 37 percent by June 2003. The contracts in the northern
             area out of government control since September 2002 had to be
             reprogrammed in the south, and the government had to remove from the
             work program the construction of new roads that did not meet the minimum
             12 percent IRR.

       (f)   Actions taken to resolve problems. An advance funding mechanism (régie
             d’avance) was set up in October 2003 and successfully speeds up
             disbursements. The defective financial management software was replaced
             in 2000.

22.    Mid Term Review (MTR) (June 2001). The MTR was carried out at the end of
June 2001. It found that the project objectives were still relevant and recommended to:
(a) simplify the logical framework; (b) create a second generation Road Maintenance
Fund to generate sustained resources for road maintenance without transiting through the
national budget, and a Road Authority to manage the road work program; (c) include a
social assessment in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA); and (d) recruit an
environmental/social expert in the PCU. Upon request from the government, the project
was restructured to add a rural transport, a transport and poverty, an HIV/AIDS, and a

                                            21
civil aviation components (or subcomponents as the case may be) and to increase the
disbursement percentages for civil works from 70 to 80 percent to address a systemic lack
of counterpart funds.

23.     September 1998 to June 2003 – Adjustment part. The fulfillment of the
conditions of effectiveness ipso facto authorized the release of the first tranche in
November 1998 (cf. tables in paragraph 6). It must be noted that the most critical
condition, i.e. the liquidation of all the heavy civil engineering equipment of the
Directorate of Public Works Equipment (DMTP), was barely met despite the fact that this
condition had been watered down after appraisal. The second tranche was released in
April 2000 with two conditions (No. 3 and 8) waived and not met later on, and one
condition (No. 7) was partially met. The third tranche was released in January 2002 after
conditions No. 1 to 3 had been modified in December 2001 (the original conditions were
not met), and condition No. 4 had been waived and transferred to the floating tranche.
The floating tranche was canceled by June 2003 restructuring, consistent with the closing
of all the reform related components of the investment part. At that time, out of seven
conditions, only condition No. 2 had been met. The Bank granted additional funding from
the so-called Fifth Dimension 6 , to adjustment tranches 1 to 3 raising their combined
disbursed amount to SDR 109,490,000 compared to SDR 58,300,000 available for the
investment part (a 65/35 percentage ratio). However, since the country economic
situation was poor that the additional budget support was mostly used for general
expenditures without any contribution to road maintenance which saw its funding dip
well below the minimum amount prescribed at project negotiations.

24.     June 2003 to September 2008.

        (a)    Context. The project was completely restructured in June 2003 and was then
               suspended for more than four years from June 2004 until September 2008.

        (b)    Restructuring. All components but component A were closed; however it
               could not be formally revised before the project was suspended in June 2004.

        (c)    Project implementation over the period. The project was consistently rated
               Satisfactory until May 2005. During this period the investment part
               experienced its highest disbursement rate (US$42 million in 17 months)—
               eligible disbursements made during the suspension period were reimbursed
               after the project was reactivated. The rating was downgraded to Moderately




6
  The economic performance of Côte d’Ivoire, a former International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) borrower, was downgraded soon before project start allowing the country to qualify
for IDA lending. As a result, it benefited from a partial reimbursement of its IBRD interest payments as did
other countries in the same situation at the time. This mechanism was called the Fifth Dimension and
adjustment tranches were the preferred instruments to channel these reimbursements.


                                                    22
             Unsatisfactory in May 2005 and to Unsatisfactory in September 2005
             reflecting the inability of the Ministry of Finance to fund the Road
             Maintenance Fund and the standstill of physical progress due to the
             compounded effect of the political crisis and the project suspension.

       (d)   Actions taken to resolve project implementation matters. The project team
             kept the lines of communication open with the counterparts open at all times
             and updated an action plan for the disbursement of the credit balance to
             make it readily available for implementation as soon as the suspension
             would be lifted.

25.    September 2008 to August 2011.

       (a)   Context. The project was reactivated and restructured in September 2008
             after the political crisis reached a positive outcome and the country was
             reunited in a run up to new presidential elections. However, those elections
             were delayed until November 2010 and followed by a new crisis and a
             violent armed conflict which was finally resolved in April 2011. The project
             was again suspended from December 2010 through May 2011.

       (b)   Restructuring. The road investment component was updated in September
             2008 to reflect the pressing post-conflict infrastructure needs of the country
             and a road safety component with an institutional dimension was added.
             Disbursements made during the previous suspension period were reviewed
             and only eligible expenditures were reimbursed. Another minor
             restructuring was made in June 2011 to fund the replacement of looted
             equipment and office buildings of the executing agencies.

       (c)   Project implementation ratings over the period. The ratings improved
             consistently from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory.

       (d)   Actions taken to resolve problems. The project was extended for one year in
             August 2010 and was slightly restructured in June 2011 to give the
             executing agencies the means for successfully completing the infrastructure
             works critical for post-conflict recovery.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26.    M&E Design. Whereas the indicators and the targets were appropriate and
relevant although missing base line figures, there was little concern about which
executing agency would be responsible for their monitoring and whether they had the
capacity and the willingness to do so. Yet, in a context of reforms and potential
discontent and resistance, this aspect was even more critical. The actual expenditures for
road works were tracked under the adjustment part until 1999. However, this should have
been monitored under the investment part for the whole project duration as it is much
more telling than budget entries. Some targets were optimistic because improvements


                                            23
come in sequence and not at the same time (DRV and road condition). The tranche
release conditions for the adjustment part were unequivocal and relevant.

27.     M&E Implementation. The M&E framework was not systematically
implemented and is absent from the ISRs until sequence 26 when the new format was
introduced. It mostly served as a guide to assess the PDO ratings over the project life.
Pieces of the framework have been used in a few aide memoires to build up a remedial
action plan. It appears that some information required in the M&E framework were not
readily available and proved difficult to obtain, in particular the annual budget allocations
for various types of road works and the corresponding expenditures. To this date, it is
close to impossible to find meaningful detailed public finance data at the Ministry of
Finance. Some were obtained from the executing agencies but are fragmentary. The
M&E framework was not updated following the successive restructurings except for the
last one in September 2008. The monitoring framework of the adjustment part was
partially waived and substantially modified for the second and third tranches.

28.    M&E Utilization. Until the June 2003 restructuring, the M&E framework was
more used to monitor the project implementation pace than the attainment of the
development objectives. This was especially the case for the adjustment part. Following
the September 2008 restructuring, the M&E framework was updated to reflect the drastic
change in project scope. Subsequently, great efforts were committed by PCU to measure
and monitor the indicators, and data were collected for all indicators.

2.4     Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     Safeguards. The Environment Category was rated B at appraisal. Safeguards
compliance was moderately satisfactory. By MTR in June 2001, most environmental and
social safeguard activities were lagging behind due to weak safeguard capacity of PCU
and implementing agencies. It took more than three years to complete a Sectoral
Environmental Assessment7 (SEA) that was due by the end of the first year of project
implementation. Nonetheless by the end of the project and in spite of numerous
interruptions (cf. paragraph 19), the social and environmental management capacity was
significantly strengthened in all implementing agencies: The PCU was staffed with a
socio-environmental expert, an environmental unit was established within DRV and
progressively staffed and equipped, and the Port of Abidjan created a well-staffed
environmental unit in compliance with the MARPOL8 convention. A major outcome of
the project is the general mainstreaming of safeguards in road contracts in Cote d’Ivoire.




7
  Some environmental assessment work was done during project preparation in May 1998, but that was
clearly not enough to be in compliance with the World Bank Safeguard Policies and with the EA regulation
in force in Cote d'Ivoire. AFTES management at the time requested a SEA to be done in the first year of
project.

  International Convention for Actions against Pollution through Ship Wastes.

                                                  24
30.     Financial Management. During the first leg of project implementation, i.e.
before the June 2003 restructuring, the financial management was inadequate and failed
to accurately capture the disbursements by components – the numerous changes in
components had a compounding effect. During the second leg of implementation,
financial management was rated satisfactory. The Coordination Unit (CI-PAST) acted
effectively and the quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports were received regularly and in
compliance with the agreed format.

31.     Procurement. The overall procurement performance under the project was
moderately satisfactory. Until 2003, the weak procurement capacity generated delays in
the execution of the investment part of the program and significantly hampered project
implementation. However, by project closing, the capacity of the staff of the executing
agencies was considerably strengthened thanks to intensive training in procurement for
works and consultant services. As a result, procurement performance improved
significantly.

2.5    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

32.     A follow up operation is under preparation. The proposed project concept aims at
addressing short term emergency infrastructure needs that will directly support the peace
process through the provision of basic infrastructure services. Furthermore, the new
government is now considering adopting a more aggressive investment policy and
launching a large investment program to repair and upgrade the road network to support
agricultural exports and to reconnect communities affected by a decade of civil war. This
large investment program will require the financing support of the donor community
including the Bank. It will succeed if the road maintenance reform is completed, road
transport regulations are implemented, illegal roadblocks are eradicated, arrears are paid
to the construction industry, and above all it is championed by a government decision
maker. In other words, a follow up investment program would run significant risks of
failure if the fragile reforms initiated under the CI-PAST were not strengthened. Thus
Bank should incorporate the completion of a few of these reforms in the new operation if
it chooses to assist the new government in its investment program.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

33.     The original PDO remained relevant at the closing date. However, in retrospect
the project design was overly complex and beyond the reach of the implementing
agencies while the counterpart financial requirements were unrealistic. The revised PDO
and restructured design remained relevant at the closing date as the need to reconnect
isolated rural communities continued to increase after 2008 following a long period of
neglect of road maintenance resulting in cut off land communications. The road safety
component logically completed the upgrading of road infrastructure to improve a critical
downside of road transport services in Cote d’Ivoire. These activities were aligned with
the post-conflict recovery strategy developed by the Borrower with the support of the

                                           25
Bank, and the implementation arrangements capitalized upon the demonstrated capacity
of the AGEROUTE and the PCU under MIE.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives

34.     The PDO revised in September 2008 was substantially achieved as evidenced by
the status of the following eight KPI at the closing date; the outcome is rated Satisfactory:

        (a)    76 bridges completed out of an initial target of 60 (although not formally
               specified in the restructuring letter, the target of 60 was mutually agreed and
               specified in the aide memoires );
        (b)    three large bridges studies completed out of 10 (same comment as under (a)
               above);
        (c)    The rehabilitation of the road safety training center is completed;
        (d)    The rehabilitation of the bus station in Grand Bassam is completed;
        (e)    No representatives of SMEs have been trained;
        (f)    The annual reduction of accident rates at the Grand Bassam bus station
               could not be measured as the rehabilitation works were only completed by
               the project closing date;
        (g)    Environmental safeguards mitigation measures have been incorporated in
               the bridge contracts; and
        (h)    Contractors’ payments have been made within four days on average (from
               the receipt of the approved monthly payment certificate by AGEROUTE).

35.      In contrast the original PDO had not been achieved in September 2008 when the
project was deeply restructured and the PDO revised. The status of the KPI is split
between the investment component which remained in force until 2008 and the
institutional components which were formally closed in 2003. Details can be found in the
attached ―Status of the KPI in August 2011‖.

36.    Investment component. Government expenditures on routine road maintenance
were well below target. Very little was spent until 2004 and compared to the target
amount of CFAF 12,495 million in 2002, the amounts spent were respectively CFAF 350
million in 2004; CFAF 3,500 million in 2005; CFAF 2,900 million in 2006; CFAF
14,300 million in 2007; and CFAF 7,400 million in 2008. It is difficult to figure out how
much was spent on the other type of works specified in the M&E framework because
such budgetary details are not available9. As far as the project itself is concerned (as



9
  Whereas the 1998 and 1999 allocations for road maintenance and rehabilitation works met the
requirements, the actual spending was way below. One condition related to the actual spending was indeed
waived and the other was removed and replaced.

                                                  26
opposed to the program monitored in the M&E framework), the overall achievements
under the investment component are much lower than the planned quantities as shown in
the Table 8.

37.     No new paved roads were constructed, the combined routine and periodic
maintenance planned quantities were only 1.5 percent achieved (2,080 km), the
construction of bridges was three percent achieved (1), the construction of culverts was
about 69 percent achieved (10,667) after conversion of the installed drainage pipes into
culverts (10 ml of drainage pipe per one culvert), while the rehabilitation of paved roads
was not achieved. As a matter of fact, for rehabilitation of paved roads, the achievement
indicated in the table below is misleading because the nature of the works which were
executed where not really road rehabilitation but simply emergency pothole patching.
The maintenance works undertaken on unpaved roads did not last nor contributed to
improving roads condition in the long run because they were not supported by annual
routine maintenance funding nor repeated at regular intervals. The interventions carried
out on paved roads were lightweight and most likely 50 percent of these interventions did
not last as they were not followed by routine or periodic maintenance. As a result of the
above, the overall outcome of the investment component under the original PDO is rated
Unsatisfactory (U).

38.     Adjustment components. Based on the June 2003 status of the institutional
reforms and the fulfillment of the conditions for release of the adjustment tranches (cf.
paragraph 6), the outcome of the adjustment components is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory, if one takes into account the fulfillment of a few key conditions of the
floating tranche [Urban Transport Agency (AGETU)], Road Safety Office (OSER),
Maritime Code, and law governing passengers and freight transportation) and the fact
that the restructuring of the civil aviation sector was successfully completed including the
continued satisfactory management of Felix Houphouet Boigny (FHB) airport through a
concession signed before the project. In contrast to the investment component, the

                                            27
institutional reforms which were achieved under the project are expected to last. As a
matter of fact, they were still in force at project closing and are likely to be sustained
provided they are fully completed; i.e. the funding mechanism of the Road Fund needs to
be improved to ensure a better match between road maintenance needs and resources and
a retrenchment plan of redundant DRV staff should be elaborated and executed.

39.     The combined outcome rating (investment and adjustment) for the original PDO
is Unsatisfactory.

3.3     Efficiency

40.     Improved operational efficiencies. Efficiency improvements caused by the
implementation of institutional reforms supported by the project have not been measured
in economic terms (cost-effectiveness/least cost), but in terms of gains in procedural,
process and service efficiency. With the creation of AGEROUTE, efficiency increases10
have been achieved in the awarding, supervision, and payment of Road Fund contracts, in
the programming of Annual Road Maintenance and in the production of technical and
financial audits. Although its funding is largely insufficient to meet overall maintenance
needs, the newly created Road Fund is improving its financing and control mechanisms.
This is expected to lead to the strengthening of the institution’s financial viability and
long-term sustainability. For land transport services, the creation of SONATT has
improved the quality of services for end users. As a matter of fact, modernization of
drivers’ licenses and vehicles’ registration are now more effective, reliable and secured.

41.     Economic analysis. At appraisal, the Economic Internal Rate of Return was
calculated for the roads rehabilitation and construction component. However, this
component was entirely changed by the September 2008 restructuring while the expected
road rehabilitation and construction works had never started, making it impossible to
calculate an ex-post economic analysis of the same. The investment component first
concentrated on hot spot removal and cross drainage structures along paved and unpaved
roads and then, after the restructuring, on the construction/reconstruction of critical small
bridges in rural areas to unlock agricultural production zones. No ex-ante economic
evaluation had been calculated for these investments. This is why, at completion, the best
alternative to an economic analysis is a socio-economic impact analysis to measure the
benefits for local communities and farmers in the area of influence of the project. Data on
social impacts and economic benefits were collected.

42.    On one hand, with the construction of 76 small bridges, 12,000 concrete culverts
and 5,000 steel culverts, the project helped connect 20 rural districts with all-season
access roads, covering an area of influence where more than 650,000 people have seen



10
   Thanks to European assistance program, AGEROUTE was able to improve its capacity in planning,
procurement and supervision of road maintenance contracts. However, the country’s past political
instability and financial constraints were not conducive of an environment that could reinforce its
autonomy.

                                                28
their mobility improve significantly giving them increased access to employment,
education and social services.

43.     On the other hand, the benefits resulting from connecting agricultural production
zones are substantial, both in terms of product distribution and financial revenues. The
reopened rural roads have allowed the movement of over 430,000 tons of agricultural
products per year with higher farm prices because improved accessibility has generated
more competition and increased demand. The corresponding additional revenues to the
farmers are estimated around CFAF 5 billion annually (US$10 million). This amount
represents: (a) the value of the additional production that can now be shipped and
commercialized plus (b) the incremental value of crops thanks to a higher farmer’s price.
Assuming that these roads will continue to be maintained, a conservative 20-year life
cycle of the structures built, and a continued agriculture production, the net present value
(NPV) over 20 years discounted at 8 percent is around US$150 million or about three
times the cost of the investment.

3.4         Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

44.     In September 2008, when the PDO was revised, US$205 million had been
disbursed of which US$60 million on the investment part. This means that 85 percent
was disbursed before the PDO was revised. When applying the guidelines for outcome
rating of projects with formally revised PDO, the overall outcome scores 2.5, which is
equivalent to Unsatisfactory/Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating is negatively affected
by the heavy relative weight of the adjustment part (US$145.6 million versus US$95
million for the investment part). If one restricts the calculation of the overall outcome to
the investment part only, the resulting rating slightly increases to Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

3.5         Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts11

      (a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

45.    The project completed the construction or the rehabilitation of a total of 76
bridges which have lifted out of isolation about 650,000 people from poor rural
communities and opened access to productive agricultural areas. The aggregate quantity
of agricultural products shipped on roads made accessible was about 430,000 tons in
2011.



11
    The ISR rating for the DO at ICR stage is Unsatisfactory different from the rating in the Datasheet.
The system generates the Satisfactory rating as per last ISR archived before the closing date of the project
on August 31, 2011. Since the last ISR was done after the closing date, the system did not pick it up.
(Refers to section 3.4 in main document page 22 and section C3 in data sheet)




                                                    29
      (b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

46.     Numbers of institutional changes have been initiated by the project, namely: the
Road Maintenance Fund (FER); the Roads Agency (AGEROUTE); the National Land
Transport Agency (SONATT) further to reorganization of Directorate for Land Transport
(DGTTC); and the Urban Transport Agency (AGETU). Although all these agencies are
operational and are likely to remain, they require further support to ensure their
sustainability. This is particularly the case for AGEROUTE, FER and AGETU.

3.5         Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

47.   This is a core ICR which does not require a beneficiary survey/stakeholder
workshop.

4.          Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

48.     The overall risk to development outcome has been calculated on the basis of the
table below.

5.          Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1         Bank Performance

(a)         Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

                                               30
49.    The technical preparation was thorough and of high quality; however it took about
ten years and in retrospect was not cost effective, misjudged the governments true
commitment to institutional reform, failed to properly assess the severe budget crisis that
impaired implementation from the start, and overestimated the capacity on the ground to
implement an already highly complex and demanding project. Moreover, the M&E
framework was overly complex, lacking base line, aggregated indicators, and
implementation arrangements (cf. paragraph. 15-17).

(b)     Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.     The supervision of the investment part was responsive, proactive and sustained
despite the very difficult context. ―Reverse‖ 12 supervision missions were organized
during the project suspension periods or during periods when security measures would
prevent Bank staff from traveling to Cote d’Ivoire; the MTR was actually organized in
country during a period of suspension. The frequency of the missions and the thorough
result-oriented aide memoires testify to the quality of the supervision of the investment
part which is rated Satisfactory. The supervision of the adjustment part was carried out
during the same supervision missions with an equal level of scrutiny and detail. However,
the resulting decisions were influenced by political-economy considerations, in particular
the need for the country to rapidly improve its financial situation, which affected the rigor
of the evaluation of the adjustment tranches and somehow discredited the use of an
adjustment instrument to promote sector reforms (cf. paragraph 23). The supervision of
the adjustment part is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory and the overall supervision is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

51.   The quality of supervision was mixed (MS) while the quality of preparation was
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory




12
   A limited government team would come to Washington or both teams would meet halfway in Paris at
the Bank office.

                                               31
52.     The government did not either follow up actively on the reform program or fulfill
its financial commitment, was impaired by a political crisis throughout project
implementation, and struggled with budget management. However, this unsatisfactory
performance is tempered by the institutional reforms achievements and the proactive
attitude of MIE to reverse the setbacks of DRV.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

53.    The review is mixed. The PCU performed well after a few start up problems. The
Road Fund and the Road Authority performed as well as they could given the lack of
government counterpart funds and investment budget; and OSER performed well.
However, during the September 1998 to June 2003 period, DRV (the agency in charge
before AGEROUTE was created) performed poorly, and the performance of many other
implementing agencies under the Ministry of Transport was hovering between
Moderately Satisfactory and Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

54.    The relatively good performance (MS) of the implementing agencies (MIE, PCU,
Road Fund, Road Authority and OSER) is undermined by marginal Government’s
performance, thus justifying the Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for overall Borrower
performance.

6.     Lessons Learned

55.    The following lessons were learned from this project:

       (a)   The macroeconomic context and the status of public/sectoral finances
             should be carefully assessed during the preparation of transformational
             projects to ensure adequate funding and financial coverage during
             implementation;
       (b)   The preparation and implementation of a project should be cognizant of the
             political economy factors affecting it but at the same should primarily focus
             on the objectives, components and activities supported by the project.
       (c)   Assurance of continued support to institutional reforms in the medium term
             should be sought in the form of adequate personnel and funding and
             compliance with the legal framework;
       (d)   The M&E framework should be simple, easily implementable without too
             much reliance on project funding, and the Borrower should see a clear
             benefit in implementing it;
       (e)   The government should identify and empower a champion to push through
             sectoral reforms through entrenched vested interests;

                                           32
        (f)   The Bank’s added value is to facilitate the implementation of institutional
              reform by leveraging its global experience of reforms;
        (g)   It is paramount to keep communication lines open with the counterparts
              during periods of political crisis or project suspension;
        (h)   Project design and objectives should be kept simple with a focus on
              implementability.
        (i)   Complex hybrid projects support both investment and ambitious sectoral
              reforms should only be used were this strong ownership and strong capacity
              to implement.
        (j)   It is important to quickly restructure a project that is no longer in tune with
              the reality on the ground even if it happens early in project implementation;
        (k)   Careful consideration should be given to keep a project open during difficult
              country circumstances to ensure continuity in dialogue with Government
              and to allow for quick emergency response needed for reconstruction efforts
              versus preparing an emergency operation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      Overall, the government is more positive than the Bank in regards to the project’s
performance and results. As a matter of fact the government ratings are as follows:
project’s outcomes are Moderately Satisfactory; Bank performance is rated Satisfactory;
and Borrower’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

   1. Project implementation: results and performance

       1.1.Project global performance

2.       Project global performance is rather average in so far as most project objectives
have not be achieved, despite the extended timeframe of the project’s implementation (13
years instead of three, although the implementation period included a cumulative duration
of 72 months of suspension (six years). In fact, the evaluation of the institutional reforms
related to road maintenance and financing (Component A), which is considered as one of
the key pillars of the program, did not meet expectations, as it did not permit to
significantly improve the quality and efficiency of core national road network , which is
currently in a dire condition. Concerning the institutional reforms under the other
components (B, C, D, E, F and G), results are also overall moderately satisfactory. Those
components were closed in 2003, while the project was in progress, for insufficient
results.

       1.2. Bank Performance

3.      Overall, Bank performance is rated satisfactory. In fact, in a context of a recurrent
crisis, Bank contribution helped the government to launch/implement major reforms for
transport sector and eventually, to leverage important resources through budget support
(more than US$100 million).

   2. Borrower’s Performance

4.      Borrower’s overall performance is moderately satisfactory. That’s because the
socioeconomic/political crisis context which prevailed during the project implementation
was not conducive to performance, despite the government’s willingness and
commitment which improved the project implementation status (for example measures
taken to improve project financial management).

5.     In fact, initial project implementation timeframe could not be honored,
Government could not comply with Financial Agreement covenants by deadlines,
Government counterpart funds were not always made available on time, and institutional
reforms had not been always implemented as per plan.




                                             39
     3. Implementation’s agencies’ performance

6.      Program Coordination Unit performance is rated satisfactory
        (a)   Performance in procurement is rather satisfactory. In fact, the major
              delays encountered at the beginning of the project had been absorbed as the
              project implementation was underway.

        (b)   Project financial management is satisfactory. There were neither
              outstanding nor qualified audits. Moreover, the disbursement rate of 95
              percent at project closure is rather commendable considering that the project
              was under suspension for 6 years in aggregate.

     4. Investment socioeconomic and environmental impact

7.     Project socioeconomic and environmental impacts are positive and valuable,
especially with regards to benefits generated by the project, thanks to the construction of
76 bridges, as well as the installation of 12,000 concrete cross drainage pipes and 5,000
discharge pipes which maintained critical rural roads passable at all seasons.

8.      Those works are scattered all over the country and will insure people accessibility
to basic services (schools, health centers, markets, production areas, etc.) and connection
between villages, rural districts, departments or regions. Report of the socioeconomic
analysis reveals the main following points:

        (a)   The program helped to connect a direct influence zone populated with
              more than 650,000 inhabitants;
        (b)   The roads made accessible allowed the shipping of over 430,000 tons of
              agricultural products in 2011;
        (c)   Benefits due to the implementation of the investment program are
              valued to about CFAF 5 billion per year;
        (d)   The internal rate of return is estimated at 45 percent, although for N’ZI
              COMOE and ZANZAN regions, the internal rate of returns is low.

     5. Lessons learned

        (a)   Sector reforms launched through the project to support the government and
              the newly created agencies have improved the transport sector efficiency
              and the road maintenance management and financing framework;

        (b)   Despite the recurrent crisis, the government had always confirmed
              support for the project and its commitment towards its implementation
              with a continuous improvement of the performance status;



                                            40
      (c)   Thanks to the project, the government has leveraged additional
            resources amounting to US$100 million, under a budget support
            mechanism; and

      (d)   The project has supported institutional strengthening and capacity
            building in the transport sector and in the road maintenance
            management and financing sub-sector.

   (e) The project suffered from the complexity due to the sector wide approach,
       merging investment and institutional reforms in all sub -sectors;

      (f)   Road maintenance and the other sub-sectors activities were unbalanced;

      (g)   Too much attention was paid to obtaining budget support, and not enough
            attention was paid to supporting implementing agencies at the very
            beginning of project implementation;

      (h)   The project suffered from a woefully inadequate implementation planning
            of the project activities, especially the reform agenda (road maintenance
            and land transport reforms); and

      (i)   The political crisis in Cote d’Ivoire during the past decade, that resulted in
            instability at ministerial level and frequent changes of the coordinator of the
            project implementation unit.

   6. Conclusion and recommendations

9.    For future operations similar to TSIAP-CI project, the following is
recommended:

      (a)   Project Coordination Unit (PCU) should be led by a champion that benefits
            from a strong political support, to facilitate implementation, especially in a
            context of reforms;

      (b)   The information and communication flow between all stakeholders is
            critical in similar types of programs, in order to ensure the necessary
            ownership and commitment that could guarantee achievement of the
            program objectives;

      (c)   Assessment of human resources available to implement the project is also
            critical, since qualified experts are key to projects’ implementation if the
            government is in the driver seat, which should be the case under normal
            circumstances; and

      (d)   A good communication plan and a prior agreement between the parties on
            the means and objectives are necessary to achieve results on the ground.
