low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the Russian Federation selected the single\n            agency model for land administration. This is an approach\n            that was recommended by the team based on its experience in\n            the Europe and Central Asia (ECA). The study visits provided\n            the government counterparts with practical experiences and\n            exposures to the different types of agencies and helped them\n            to make their decisions. The Bank team adapted a tried and\n            tested successful model of land administration projects to\n            the realities of the Russian Federation. In this case, the\n            Bank trusted the commitment of the Federal Agency for\n            Cadastre of Immovable Property (Cadastre Agency), or CA and\n            the Government's support for the land administration\n            strategy, and agreed not to wait for further reform on the\n            structures of the responsible agencies (i.e. integration of\n            land administration services as a condition for the\n            project). The team's support for the merger and the\n            consequent Bank agreement to extend the loan closing date to\n            accommodate the merger and the adjustments needed of the\n            legal and software development contracts was the right\n            approach that was highly appreciated by the Government. At\n            the end, and despite delays and lack of complete clarity,\n            the Bank remained a partner in the advice and in the\n            Government's correct decision to merge the related\n            services for the long-term benefit of RosReestr and its clients."}, "docdt": "2011-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
