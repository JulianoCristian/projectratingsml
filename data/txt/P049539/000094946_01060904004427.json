These\n            responsibilities encompass providing sectoral vision and\n            leadership, analysis and policy follow-up of the health\n            needs of the poor and risks to the public at-large, advocacy\n            of best practices and standards, and support for local\n            initiative. This project has two components. One addresses\n            health needs and issues in specific districts and provinces\n            such as managing decentralization, resource mobilization,\n            and district funding allocations. The second component\n            focuses on strenthening the capacity of MOHSW to control\n            communicable diseases, assuring equity in service provision,\n            and assessing health research needs, capacities, and\n            options, as well as on creating an autonomous food and drug\n            control agency."}, "docdt": "2001-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
