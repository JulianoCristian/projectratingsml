F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's goals are, first, to bring about effective health sector decentralization in the
provinces of North Sumatera, West Java, and Banten. The challenge is to initiate key



                                              ii

sector reforms and put health financing on a firm footing, while protecting health services
which are essential for the poor and the public at large during a period of government
restructuring. The second objective is to help the Ministry of Health carry out its role in a
decentralized system. These responsibilities encompass providing sectoral vision and
leadership, analysis and policy follow up of the health needs of the poor and risks to the
public at large, advocacy of best practices and standards, and support for local initiative.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Indonesia Provincial Health Project II (PHP II) was approved by the Board on June
26, 2001, and became effective on April 24, 2002 for an original Credit amount of US$40
million equivalent and a loan of US$63.2 million.

At the time PHP II was designed and appraised, a major reorganization of government
involving decentralization was underway in Indonesia. These changes brought new
opportunities and risks for a health sector that was overstretched in the pre-crisis period
and was further disrupted during the economic crisis of the late 1990s.

In North Sumatera, West Java and Banten, the project's three focal provinces, health
outcomes in the late 1990s were unsatisfactory. Utilization of government health facilities
remained low and was characterized by sharp differentials across income groups.
Coverage of JPS-BK, the health component of the country's social safety program, set up
in response to the economic crisis was also weak. Less than 30% of the intended
beneficiaries in each of the three provinces were covered due to ineffective targeting
mechanism and inflexible program guidelines and procedures.

Underlying the poor performance was chronic underfunding for the health sector,
exacerbated by high levels of technical and allocative inefficiency in the allocation of the
scarce resources. In addition, there was weak capacity at the province and district levels
for priority setting, program design and evaluation. Decentralization served to highlight
these weaknesses.

Province-level projects like PHP II represented a distinctive and useful component in the
Government of Indonesia Ministry of Health (GOI/MOH's) decentralization strategy.
The First Provincial Health Project (PHP I), which became effective in August 2001,
provided a template for tackling health decentralization within the sub-national
framework. The Credit/Loan provided under PHP II was intended to support a further
extension of this approach in response to decentralization.

The value-added of Bank support included both content and process dimensions. Through
the process of decentralization in Indonesia, the Bank emphasized the need to pay
attention to the opportunities and risks inherent in decentralization. A further contribution
of the Bank was its ability to include inputs from efforts to monitor decentralization
issues across sectors.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The project's goals are, first, to bring about effective health sector decentralization in the
provinces of North Sumatera, West Java, and Banten. The challenge is to initiate key
sector reforms and put health financing on a firm footing, while protecting health services
which are essential for the poor and the public at large during a period of government
restructuring. The second objective is to help the Ministry of Health carry out its role in a
decentralized system. These responsibilities encompass providing sectoral vision and
leadership, analysis and policy follow-up of the health needs of the poor and risks to the
public at large, advocacy of best practices and standards, and support for local initiatives.

For the first PDO, there were three Outcome/Impact Indicators: (i) changes in
organization structure, health financing mechanisms, service delivery arrangements and
work force policies; (ii) implementation of effective, locally relevant curative service
delivery and financing arrangements; and (iii) implementation of effective, locally
grounded public health service provision and financing arrangements.

For the second PDO, there were five Outcome/Impact Indicators: (i) increased awareness
within GOI and among the public of health issues/risks/solutions; (ii) indications of
enhanced commitment at the province and district levels including financing of priority
programs, and basic services/drugs for the poor, and inclusion of health indicators in the
block funding allocation (DAU) formula; (iii) effective partnership arrangements with
districts and provinces and with NGOs; (iv) enhanced effectiveness of communicable
disease surveillance; and (v) enhanced food and drug inspection systems and public
accountability.

Reasons/Justification

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The population and more specifically, poor households located in North Sumatera's 19,
West Java's 22 and Banten's 6 districts and municipalities were expected to benefit from
the project. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), the percentage of poor
people in 1996 in North Sumatera and West Java (including Banten at the time) was
around 10%, but had risen to roughly 22% in North Sumatera, 21% in West Java
(excluding Banten) by early 1999 due to the economic crisis. Approximately, 2.9 million
people in North Sumatera and 8 million people in West Java (including Banten) were
defined as poor in 1999.




                                              2

The poor were expected to benefit from the project through improved access to higher
quality health services. Government subsidies were to be targeted more effectively by
allocating project funds based on the number of poor people in each district and the rates
of public facility use by the poor. Districts in turn, were to be encouraged to develop
mechanisms to improve use by the poor.

The population living in other provinces was expected to benefit also through
strengthened disease control, improved drug and food oversight and improved
mechanisms for targeting public subsidies.

1.5 Original Components

Like PHP I, PHP II consisted of two components, one addressing health needs and issues
in specific districts and provinces, and the second focusing on responsibilities and
functions of mainly the MOH, but also a newly created food and drug control agency.

Component A ­ Districts and Provinces

A1: Managing Decentralization (US$ 20.07 million; 2.2% of total cost)
Project supported Task Forces would focus on critical institutional topics and develop
recommendations for implementation in Phases 1 and 2. The work of the tasks forces
would cover: (i) restructuring health organization in the provinces and districts; (ii)
human resource management and development; (iii) developing new health information
systems; (iv) upgrading the regulatory framework including the licensing and
certification of health professionals and accreditation of health care organizations; (v)
strengthening public accountability mechanisms; and (vi) intensifying health promotion.

A2: Resource Mobilization (US$ 2.43 million; 0.3% of total cost)
District Health Offices (DHOs) would work individually or through the task forces to
explore ways of financing district health needs. This included both making the case for
adequate allocations from the district health budget, and relying on user fees whenever
the population had the ability to pay for treatment costs.

A3: District Funding Allocations (US$ 850.44 million; 94.9% of total cost)
Starting in 2003 (2004 in Banten) Credit/Bank resources would be channelled to districts
through block allocations with the aim of raising government health spending to levels
which are sustainable during the medium term. During negotiations, assurances were
received that government health spending levels would be equal to at least Rp 42,000 per
capita in 2001 prices, or 15% of total district health expenditures by the end of the project
in 2006. The locally financed portion of the district budget was to be treated as
counterpart funding.

A4: Project Management (US$ 5.03 million; 0.6% of total cost)
Project management units would be established at the province and district levels. Funds
would be allocated to support consultant services, supplies and supervision.




                                              3

Component B ­ The Center

B1: Institutional Development (US$ 1.92 million; 0.2% of total cost)
The project would assist in establishing a small, functional Decentralization Unit within
MOH.

B2: Strengthening Communicable Disease Control (US$ 8.57 million; 1.0% of total cost)
The project would help transform the existing Directorate General (DG) for
Communicable Disease Control (P2M) into a specialized central agency within MOH. To
this end, PHP II would support the adaptation in West Java, North Sumatera and Banten,
the development of a surveillance system already implemented in six other provinces
with ADB support.

B3: Ensuring Equity in Service Provision (US$ 3.48 million; 0.4% of total cost)
PHP II would fund National Health Grants to reorient district health systems, provide
cost-effective public health programs and co-finance catastrophic care for the poor. Funds
would be directed to roughly 20 poor districts which also satisfied other criteria.

B4: Assessing Health Research Needs, Capacities and Options (US$0.06 million; 0.0% of
total cost)
PHP II would support a broad analysis of health research requirements and options within
a decentralized system.

B5: Strengthening Food and Drug Control (US$ 2.01 million; 0.2% of total cost)
PHP II would assist in transforming the newly created food and drug agency into a
professional unit whose operations are based on scientific, risk management principles.
At the time PHP II was appraised, GOI had just established an autonomous drug and food
control agency (NADFC) and adjusted the roles and responsibilities of the former
Directorate General of Drug of Food Control of MOH (DG POM).

B6: Project Management (US$ 1.79 million; 0.2% of total cost)
A coordination unit (CPCU) would be established at the central level for overall
coordination of PHP II. Project funds would be used to support consultant services, office
equipment and supplies, workshop, project management training and project supervision.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

The World Bank withheld payment under categories 3 (workshop/training) and 7
(incremental operating cost) under the project for a period of 12 months (May 2005 to
May 2006) following confirmation of fraudulent practices at the central level. Based on
the findings of the investigation, the World Bank declared an amount of IDR
8,673,492,880 as ineligible expenditures. Payment for both categories continued after the
government fulfilled an action plan to strengthen internal financial control of the project.
The CPCU was dismantled and project management responsibility was transferred to a
different team as a result of this. On December 21, 2006, upon request from the
Government, the World Bank cancelled a part of the loan amounting US$32 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Context Influencing Project Design

PHP II and the predecessor to this project, PHP I, were designed with the specific
intention of assisting government in addressing the challenges faced by the health sector
as a consequence of decentralization in Indonesia as mandated by Laws 22 and 25. These
laws, signed in 1999, provided the statutory underpinning for Indonesia's Big Bang
decentralization of 2001. Law 22 provided the conceptual and legislative framework for
decentralization, transferring planning, budgeting and implementing responsibilities to
districts. Law 25 complemented Law 22 by augmenting and increasing the predictability
of financing for local governments. This resulted in the district becoming the key level
for policy implementation as well as formulation and also led to greatly increased
resources for districts. Thus, local assemblies and district chief executives (Bupatis)
assumed responsibility for managing health centers and public hospitals. Districts also
took on training and regulatory functions, and became responsible for priority setting and
resource allocation, together with some quality assurance and personnel management
functions.

The project design that emerged in the context of this process of rapid decentralization
reflected several key considerations. First, because Laws 22 and 25 affected virtually
every dimension of health and health care, project designers believed a sector-wide
approach was essential to preserve basic health services, especially for the poor, during
the period in which new systems were being established in response to rapid
decentralization. This was a significant departure from previous "program-oriented"
health projects. Second, the project designers believed an essential initial priority was to
address the issue of the readiness of government structures to take on their expanded
policy and implementation roles.




                                            5

Thus, while supportive of the process of decentralization in health, the project, by design
recognized that some of the new functions districts were being asked to take on would be
problematic given the small size of their populations and lack of specialized staff. These
included essential public health, health education and information functions for which
districts could not capture scale and scope advantages or gains that would yield
externalities. The project therefore proposed to support selected central and provincial
activities chosen on the basis of the extent to which these activities would result in scale
and scope economies and externalities In taking this position, the project took advantage
of in the fact that Law 22 acknowledged that districts may not have the scale, depth and
numbers of staff and other resources to carry out all of the health responsibilities that the
central government was mandated to transfer. Building on the literature and experience
with decentralization in other countries, scale, scope and externality considerations led
project designers to argue that certain responsibilities previously held at the central level
should be assigned to the province level. It was felt that an important contribution of the
project would be to highlight functions and roles that are best handled by provinces.
These include surveillance, most aspects of communicable disease control and health
promotion.

While most of project activities and support were directed at the provincial and district
levels, the project also included a small component to support central-level agencies with
the decentralization process.     The project design included the establishment of a
decentralization unit within central MOH to facilitate health decentralization and reform.
This unit was also supposed to recommend strategies for transforming MOH internally to
better respond to and prepare for decentralization, and be more responsive to customer
perceptions and preferences.

Project design also recognized that Law 22 had changed the hierarchal relationship
between districts, provinces and central authorities. The project foresaw a need for new
policy mechanisms to ensure that cross-district health concerns were addressed. This led
to the recommendation that a Joint Health Council (JHC) be constituted at the provincial
level, which would become a forum for raising health issues, sharing management
burdens, formulating common policies and organizing advocacy efforts.             Technical
support to the JHC to carry out these functions was to be provided by the Technical
Review Team and Task Forces that would focus on key institutional and health policy
issues, as well as generate recommendations for implementation.

Finally, the project adopted a management structure that fitted the decentralized structure;
Project Directors at the Provincial and District levels were the local government chief
executives while the Deputy Provincial Directors were the head of the province/district
health office.

Limitations of the Overall Design

The project design was in general an appropriate response to the challenges confronted at
the time by a rapidly changing health sector. Project design documents reflected a strong
awareness of the risks involved in proceeding with rapid decentralization in the health
sector, citing approaches that had proved difficult in other country contexts. It also
offered a thoughtful analysis of the functions that should be undertaken at each level of
government in order to ensure that decentralization in health would contribute as much as
possible to improved health outcomes, particularly for the poor. It can be argued also
that if the Bank was to be helpful to the government in the then on-going process of rapid
decentralization, the project had little choice but to accept considerable risk and
uncertainty.   The program was designed to be flexible but that also posed some
challenges as noted below.

A key limitation was in the design of the central-level component, which was more
complex under PHP II than under PHPI, and thus placed greater demands on central-level
policymakers. PHP II envisaged the establishment of the Decentralization Unit that
would help achieve the institutional commitment and support needed to sustain
decentralization. In reality, this proved to be ineffective in bringing about significant
institutional change. Most departments did not share the vision of changing the role of the
central ministry to one of primarily facilitating, monitoring, and advocating for improved
provision of services at the district level. Wide-reaching central-level reforms were
proposed to strengthen communicable disease surveillance, health information systems
and, food and drug control. In a context where support for decentralization was weak, this
proved too extensive a range of reforms for MOH to undertake at the central level. While
it is acknowledged that it is not realistic to expect one operation to change this, the
project was too ambitious in its expectations.

A second limitation was that the project design took on a broad range of reform activities.
The scope of the reform agenda was equally broad under PHP I, yet feasible to
implement. The difference under PHP II was that the project was being scaled up to
larger provinces with greater heterogeneity in initial conditions and institutional capacity.
Given this, a more feasible approach would have been to use the project to provide a
menu of reform areas, which the provinces and districts could have selected from to
outline a program of reforms. Clearly articulated provincial plans would have provided
guidance to the provinces, especially those with less capacity to focus their efforts and
reforms, and thus achieved better results.

A third limitation of project design was that it underestimated the extent to which the
existing, as well as ever changing civil service regulations would constrain the project's
ability to achieve progress on the project's human resource management agenda.




                                              7

2.2 Implementation

The innovative instruments introduced by the project at the province level (TRT, JHC,
TFs, etc.) were, overall, successful and contributed to the success of the district grants
component. Of these mechanisms, the Technical Review Team (TRT) was the most
successful, particularly in West Java. Districts in West Java reported to the ICR team that
the West Java TRT was strong and its support was quite valuable. Experience with the
Joint Health Council (JHC) confirmed the need for a mechanism supporting cross-district
discussion of health issues, but it proved unrealistic to expect district heads to attend
regular meetings on health. Besides, the mechanism needed fine-tuning. Similarly the
Task Force (TF)s proved essential to the reform process, although TF members were
often side-tracked by their routine responsibilities and did not allocate enough time to
moving the reform agenda forward. Short term TA proved beneficial in helping the TF
focus on key issues and consider alternative policy options.

The main constraints to implementation of PHP II were related to delays in and
disruptions to the flow of funds, and the informal suspension sanctioned by the World
Bank upon confirmation of fraudulent practices within the project at the central level.
Implementation of PHP II was severely constrained by delays in the release of funds from
the Ministry of Finance. The late release of funds by the Ministry of Finance each year
meant that the effective implementation period for PHP II was only 6-7 months per year.
For instance, the District Funding Allocation (DFA) component that started in 2004 had
an effective implementation period of 23 months during the 3-year period.

The informal suspension of the program further disrupted project implementation,
exacerbating the effects of delayed financial transfers. Province and central level
activities were the most affected, including those of the TRTs and task forces. Direct
disbursement of DFAs to districts was not affected. By the time the suspension was
lifted, it was too late to implement the proposed activities before the project closed.

Inadequate coordination among the TFs reduced their potential impact, particularly with
respect to developing a clear and coherent reform framework, although reform areas
supported by the project, such as workforce, financing, regulation and information were
interrelated. Moreover, there was also limited collaboration between the consultants
assisting the TFs with regard to sharing information or comparing notes on reform
strategies. By contrast, in Yogyakarta (PHP I), a high degree of collaboration between the
TFs and their consultants was a key determinant of the superior implementation
performance of this province.

Technical coordination and support to provinces from the center were weak. Moreover,
the management support from the CPCU at the center was disrupted. The CPCU lost
credibility after it was found to engage in fraudulent practices. MOH decided to dissolve
the CPCU after it the presence of fraudulent practices was confirmed, and transfer project
management responsibility to PHP I CPCU. This decision improved the management
performance of the CPCU significantly.



                                             8

Project procurement arrangements were another source of delay in implementations.
Difficulties of implementing units, particularly the districts, in following the Bank's
bidding or consultant selection procedures were reported to have impeded performance.
Ring-fencing the operation to the level it was designed meant that the Bank's review
processes were extensive, and contributed to delays in procurement.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Overall, the performance indicators identified in the PAD were broad and did not lend
themselves adequately to monitoring progress towards the Project Development
Objectives (PDOs). However, it is acknowledged that performance indicators based on
health outcomes and health care use alone would have been insufficient to track the
progress of a project focused on strengthening institutions and building health systems
capacity and the focus on institutional change was appropriate.

Monitoring and evaluation of the project, including project baseline, midterm, and final
evaluations, and the tracking and special studies related to the reform process, were the
responsibility of an independent research unit (RU) hired by MOH. Although the RU was
expected to report to the project director, in practice it reported to the CPCU. The
absence of a counterpart in MOH that could engage in technical discussions and provide
direction limited the effectiveness of the RU. Important studies, such as the tracking
study was not conducted while only one special study was conducted quite late in the
project. Despite this limitation, the RU developed a series of operational measures for
each of the project indicators that formed the basis of the baseline evaluation. However,
the RU had a different team leader with differing technical capacity for each of the
baseline, midterm and final evaluations. As a result, the three evaluations were not
directly comparable, rendering it difficult to systematically assess project impact.
Additional studies had to be undertaken to make up for some of these limitations. The
final evaluation used both quantitative (using household survey data (Susenas) and
qualitative methods to measure the institutional as well as direct, health related objectives
of the project. Information was collected retrospectively for different stages of the
project.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management

Based on the experience of PHP I where the performance of private auditors selected by
the project for conducting interim audits was poor, the Bank recommended in October
2004 that the CPCU consider the use of BPKP as an interim auditor for PHP II. However,
in March 2005, anonymous information was received by the Bank regarding fraudulent
practices in the CPCU of PHP II. The Bank team acted quickly and followed up with
MOH on the information. With MOH agreement, the BPK (State Auditing Agency)
conducted an investigative audit to confirm the allegation. When the BPK confirmed
fraudulent practices within the CPCU the Bank launched a special mission to strengthen
financial control of the project and an action plan was agreed upon that was to apply not
only to PHP II but also to PHP I and III. The plan was to serve three purposes:


                                             9

(a) send a strong message to all implementing units for deterrence purposes
(b) strengthen financial controls with the aim of preventing future mismanagement and
    fraudulent practices, and
(c) determine whether fraudulent practices were limited to the two categories in question
    (workshops/training and incremental costs) and by doing so, determine the full extent
    of financial losses.

The action plan consisted of the following areas:

(a) strengthening of controls by removing financial management and procurement
    management responsibilities from the Bureau of Planning to the relevant units in
    MOH, namely, the Bureau for Financing for financial management and the Bureau of
    Logistics for procurement
(b) ensuring the integrity of internal controls and capacity to detect problems by
    recruiting a firm to conduct internal audits of the three PHPs and, at the same time,
    work with the Inspectorate General's office to strengthen internal controls within
    MOH
(c) determining the full extent of ineligible expenditures by expanding investigations to
    include more samples
(d) appointing BPK to conduct project external audit replacing BPKP
(e) withholding payment for PHP II during the transition period until immediate actions
    was taken, except for activities under the District Funding Allocation and selected
    activities at the provincial/central level that were agreed upon by the Bank and MOH.

The Bank also requested reimbursement of the ineligible expenditures under question.
MOH, on the other hand, also took action by removing the implicated staff.

The Midterm Review of PHP II in January 2006 concluded that while actions were taken
and MOH agreed to the action plan, the implementation of some of the actions was slow.
The mission rated financial management of the project as highly unsatisfactory. A
subsequent mission in November 2006 found that all agreed actions to enhance financial
control of the PHPs were already in place, except for the selection of a third party by the
Inspectorate General (IG) to assist in conducting an internal audit while building the
capacity of the IG staff in conducting audits. At the time the project was closed, this
matter still had not been finalized.

Thus, while the initial response of MOH to specific fraudulent practices was timely, steps
to put in place agreed upon broader financial controls were not taken with the same speed
or resolve. Future projects will need to reach agreement upfront on a range of financial
management controls that government and the Bank feel are warranted and can be fully
implemented. Close attention to the auditing function would be especially critical.




                                               10

One notable side effect of the informal suspension was that the provinces and districts felt
they were punished for the actions of others over whom they had no control. Given that
critical funds were put on hold, localities complained bitterly to the ICR team they had
not been able to implement project activities that they very much wanted to undertake,
particularly reform pilots that they had underway. They thought it especially unfair that
it was largely the center that caused this situation given their belief that in other important
ways the center had not fully supported project implementation. It must also be noted
that once the suspension was put in place, project momentum at the center slowed
considerably. Little implementation progress, particularly with respect to restructuring of
the project as proposed by the Bank, occurred after this.

Procurement

Procurement, particularly in PHP II, was a further weak aspect of implementation
performance. Weak capacity and lack of understanding of World Bank procurement
processes, mainly those of the district implementing units, were an issue and contributed
to slow project disbursement. The fact that these difficulties were widespread and
pervasive raises the question of whether procurement under the project should have taken
place at the district level. Given the context of decentralization at the time, districts
would likely have strongly resisted having procurement occur at higher levels of
government although their capacity to conduct procurement according to Bank guidelines
was low as reported by the procurement capacity assessment. Despite the low capacity,
the Bank agreed on district level procurement but strengthened control by applying low
thresholds for prior review. This decision resulted in a large volume of prior review
contracts, and the Bank oversight of these contracts became extremely challenging,
particularly as the 3 Provincial Health Project followed the same procurement
arrangements. Despite the high workload for Bank procurement staff, the Bank could not
change prior review arrangements because Bank post review exercises continued to find
some procurement irregularities until the end of project implementation.

Environment

The project did not result in any significant environmental impacts.


2.4 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

At the district and province levels, the project is widely regarded as having laid the
foundations for institutional change in a decentralizing environment. Specific examples
of how capacity was built to undertake institutional change include: the establishment of
JHCs for formulating policy; the proposal preparation process for applying for district
funding grants; and, the introduction of new mechanisms to improve public
accountability and health promotion through a participatory process involving civil
society. In the majority of cases, the districts and provinces were successful in
conceptualizing and piloting how these institutions would be established.




                                              11

The extent to which the proposed institutional changes were implemented and sustained
depended largely on existing commitment and capacity to implement reforms at the
district and province levels.   In North Sumatera, the Health Promotion Board was
sustained because it was able to leverage local resources. At the end of the project, the
JHC in West Java was integrated into the provincial level planning committee and has
been expanded to include other sectors.

By design, PHP II emphasized the role of the province in assisting the district to gain
economies of scale by building cross-district collaboration.        Although this strategy
seemed incongruent with the goals of decentralization at the time, in hindsight, it is clear
that it was an appropriate strategy in the context of decentralization in Indonesia. Two
recent laws, Law 32/2004 and PP 38/2007 confer greater power to the provinces,
reversing some of the decentralization to the districts in the earlier laws. Evidently, there
are economies of scale and scope to be gained in implementing at the province level
instead of the district level.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project objectives, as appraised, continue to be relevant to current country priorities
and overall developmental objectives. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in 2004
stressed that making public sector service delivery more responsive to the needs of the
poor is an important vehicle for reducing poverty and vulnerability in Indonesia. The
main objective of PHP II was to bring about decentralization in a manner which protected
essential health services for the poor. The 2004 CAS further articulated the need for
revamping management and accountability systems to make providers more directly
accountable to clients, and the need to strengthen local government accountability under
a more coherent decentralization framework. Policy reforms envisaged under PHP II such
as the JHCs, public accountability mechanisms and health promotion activities that
involve civil society are entirely consistent with these CAS goals. The Country
Partnership Strategy for 2008-2011 which was being prepared at the time the ICR was
written also emphasizes the strengthening of public sector systems including institutional
development to strengthen governance.

PHP II objectives are also consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
published in 2003 that emphasized the importance of social protection, and human capital
development and capacity strengthening as critical to addressing the needs of the poor.

According to policymakers, PHP II goals became increasingly relevant as
decentralization progressed further and awareness about the types of institutional changes
it required deepened. There was a consistent comment among district- and province-level
policymakers interviewed for this ICR that PHP II became more relevant as the pace of
decentralization increased. The project's emphasis on capacity building and institutional
change were instrumental in this regard.



                                            12

PHP II goals were ahead of their time, but they were also based on overly ambitious
expectations about the types of institutional change that would be feasible. Many of the
reforms proposed at the district and province levels required concomitant reforms at the
central level. Delays at the central level limited the ability of provinces and districts to
carry out some reforms.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The two Project Development Objectives of PHP II were defined broadly, and so were
the eight PDO Indicators specified in the PAD. In view of this lack of specificity of the
PDO Indicators, this ICR uses the more specific objectives of the two project components
and corresponding sub-components in order to arrive at an assessment of the extent to
which the two PDOs were achieved. In the sub-sections below we first assess the extent
to which the project achieved the first PDO by achieving the objectives of the first
component (Component A--Districts and Provinces) and its sub-components; we then
assess the extent of achievement of the second PDO by reviewing the achievements in the
objectives of the second component (Component B--Center) and its sub-components

(A) Support Effective Decentralization in the Provinces of Banten, North Sumatera
and West Java
The challenge for PHP II was to initiate key sector reforms and ensure the sustainability
of health financing, while protecting health services for the poor during a period of
government restructuring. It sought to meet this challenge through a series of reforms
whose objectives were to: (i) manage decentralization and, (ii) improve resource
mobilization for health through district funding allocations and other means.

(i) Managing Decentralization

PHP II initiatives to restructure the organization and management of key health entities
early in the project was envisaged as a first step to building the institutional capacity to
decentralize effectively. JHCs, TRTs and TFs were established in all three provinces with
the objective of formulating policies and strategies, developing new approaches and
designing pilots for reforms. The extent to which these objectives were met varied across
provinces, due to variations in the level of existing capacity and the flexibility in the
design. West Java, that has strong capacity, for instance made most progress in terms of
the restructuring, personnel, and financing agenda.




                                             13

The PHP II objective of improving human resource management and development was
more difficult to meet because decentralization did not extend authority over personnel
policy to the districts. Decentralization provided a good opportunity to improve
efficiency and quality of service provision by revising personnel policies and redefining
human resource requirements in line with local needs. This would have been possible had
districts and provinces been given the authority over civil servants at each level. In the
absence of such a policy change, districts had little incentive to review human resource
needs and design new policies. This is a good example of the extent to which the design
of PHP II was unrealistic about the types of reform that would be feasible. The only
exceptions to this were a few districts in West Java, which conducted comprehensive
reviews of human resource needs and managed to work within the existing constraints to
improve human resource planning and management. Implementing units at all level did
use project resources to finance fellowship in various areas and various levels of
education (Table 1). This will potentially improve health management and the quality of
health services.

Strengthening Health Information Systems (HIS) is key to decentralization because it is a
means to ensure that the allocation of resources matches needs. While progress was made
in terms of designing blueprints for a HIS, most districts continued to work with the
system designed before decentralization. Typically, provinces turned to information
technology (IT) consultants for technological solutions instead of attempting to reform
the information system itself. Provinces and districts also indicated that they were aware
that the center was developing a national HIS and did not want to invest too much in
developing a local system. A key concern for the provinces and districts was that a new
HIS designed by them would not mesh with the one to be developed by the center.




                                                        14

The PHP II objective of upgrading the regulatory framework in the health sector was met
only partially and in only a few districts. Decentralization and the consequent
reorganization of administrative roles between levels of government provided an
opportunity to upgrade the regulatory framework and thus, to improve the quality of
service delivery. In particular, the project proposed the introduction of more rigorous
competency tests to be administered by independent boards. North Sumatera and West
Java visited Yogyakarta early on to learn from the province's successful experience in
conducting the same reform under PHP I. This was followed by reviews of existing
licensing and accreditation arrangements. Five districts (4 in West Java and 1 in Banten)
unofficially introduced new competency tests. The more substantial reforms to the
regulatory framework expected under PHP II did not take place due to uncertainty over
the extent to which regulation for licensing and accreditation was under the authority of
the central ministry. For instance, there was uncertainty over whether it was premature to
introduce competency test at the regional level before the competence standards had been
established at the national level.

The PHP II objective of strengthening public accountability was partially met. North
Sumatera was one of the better performers with respect to this component in that it
established an independent board, the Healthy District /City Forum (FKK) to handle
complaints about health services in many of the districts. At the time of the final
evaluation, the FKK was functioning in 16 of the 25 districts. Other provinces were not
as successful.

PHP II initiatives to strengthen health promotion were also met with mixed success. A
health promotion board, as proposed under PHP II was successfully institutionalized in
North Sumatera, and proposals for health promotion activities from non government
organizations were accepted for funding. The North Sumatera health promotion board
made a strong effort to leverage other resources, which further enhanced the
sustainability of this activity. West Java and Banten were much less successful in this
regard.

(ii) Improving Resource Mobilization through District Funding Allocations and Other
means

A basic concern at the time that PHP II was designed was that health services will not be
provided with adequate resources post decentralization. Thus, a second PHP II objective
was to overcome limitations in the availability of discretionary public funds for health at
the district level through (i) block grants known as District Funding Allocations (DFA)
and local government counterpart funding and (ii) identification of other options for
generating resources. PHP II also included mechanisms to address and enhance the
budget planning process and the preparation of district health plans in a manner that
better reflected equity issues, epidemiologic needs and local health priorities.

There are two parts to whether PHP II achieved its objectives with regard to the DFAs.
Did PHP II strengthen capacity for budget planning and management? And did the DFAs
lead to an increase in health expenditures at the district level?



                                             15

PHP II was successful in improving districts' capacity to prepare district health plans that
reflect local priorities and needs. The quality of the proposals submitted as part of the
health plans improved significantly during the course of the project. In particular, the
extent to which the proposals reflect the poverty and epidemiological context of the
districts, and local priorities improved considerably. Budget planning and the preparation
of the district health plans became the primary responsibility of the districts, thus building
capacity in the prioritization process. Nevertheless, performance was variable across
districts and was very much influenced by the capacity of the Technical Review Teams
(TRTs). In all provinces, the idea to use the JHC forum for fostering scale economies was
not successful, although in West Java, the role of the JHC in the distribution of the DFA
to the districts was instrumental. Although in practice the JHC gave the final approval of
the DFAs, the act was rather administrative rather than a result of careful deliberation of
cross district needs and priorities.

Budgetary allocations to the health sector did increase during the course of PHP II. The
increase in government allocations to the health sector at the district level occurred in part
due to increases in overall allocations to the districts. No data are available on the number
of districts reaching the target of allocating 15% of their budget to the health sector, the
counterpart funding level negotiated as part of PHP II. Policymakers interviewed for this
ICR indicated that 15% was too high an allocation for districts. Data on health
expenditures were only available for three districts (2 in West Java, 1 in Banten). Per
capita spending increased in all three districts.

PHP II efforts to identify other sources of financing for health did not progress beyond
the assessment of options and design of pilots in some districts. Coverage through other
small insurance schemes did increase in Indonesia during PHP II, but it did so in both
project and non-project districts.

To summarize, the first objective was to support districts and provinces in managing
decentralization effectively by restructuring the organization and management of health
entities, improving human resource planning, and strengthening institutional capacity. On
the whole, achievement with respect to the first objective was moderately unsatisfactory.
The second objective was to improve resource mobilization for health, particularly
through the DFA mechanism. Achievement with respect to the second objective was
moderately satisfactory as it improved planning capacity and was associated with an
increase in allocations for and expenditures on health.

Based on the above discussion the ICR rating for the achievement of the first PDO is
Moderately Unsatisfactory.


(B) Assist MOH in Delineating and Carrying Out Its Roles in a Decentralized
Health System
The objective is to support MOH in providing the sectoral vision and leadership to
successfully undertake decentralization in the health sector. The expected outcomes
related to institutional strengthening at the central level.



                                              16

The Decentralization Unit, a key component of central level reforms contributed only in a
limited manner to performing the following tasks: coordinate efforts at MOH, clarify the
decentralization strategy and develop tools for strengthening decentralization of the
health sector. Its most significant contribution was perhaps the formulation of the
Obligatory Functions and Minimum Service Standards for Health. It also provided some
assistance to the districts in developing district health plans/proposals for funding through
the DFA. Progress was hindered because MOH appeared uncommitted to the idea of
reforming the Ministry in line with a decentralized system. Moreover, the unit was
essentially an ad-hoc unit within MOH with limited experience and leverage to lead the
reform process.

The PHP II objective of strengthening communicable disease control was not met, and
essentially no activity took place under the subcomponent after project midterm review.
Failure to meet this goal reflects poorly on the project because of the importance of a
strong communicable disease control in a decentralized system, particularly as evidence
suggests that disease surveillance system has broken down with decentralization. During
implementation, MOH was keen to replicate the system developed under an ADB
financed project, mainly in relation to the use of information technology for
strengthening surveillance. However, very little was done in terms of assessing the
impact of decentralization on surveillance and on building collaboration with the
provinces and districts to maintain a functioning surveillance system. Implementation of
other interventions was equally limited. Important studies and assessments failed to take
place because of lack of follow up on the Bank's recommendations with respect to the
quality of the terms of reference. Although the project allocated several million US
Dollars for procurement of equipment to strengthen both the CDC laboratories and the
infectious disease hospital, no package was procured because the team in charge of
procurement in CDC claimed they did not have the capacity to follow Bank guidelines,
exposing them to the risk of misprocurement. By midterm review, only 1% of the amount
allocated for this subcomponent had been disbursed.

The piloting of the National Health Grants (NHG) mechanism under PHP II achieved
good results during its two year implementation. The NHG was designed to assist poorer
districts and provide them with incentives to implement MOH priority programs.
Districts that requested support from NHG had to show their commitment by indicating
the amount of counterpart funding they will contribute to implement the NHG financed
activities. Project experience showed there was significant demand from the districts for
these grants, more than 20 district proposals were financed under the scheme. During its
implementation, the NHG program was managed by the CPCU with little involvement
from MOH main units. The scheme however, was discontinued after the project's mid
term review because MOH chose not to adopt the approach despite quite positive
response from the districts.




                                              17

The PHP II objective of strengthening food and drug control was achieved partially
through staff training and provision of consultants for strengthening particular aspects of
the system such as drug inspection. Many National Agency for Drug and Food Control
(NADFC) staff were sent for short term as well as long term overseas training. An
international consultant was also hired to assist in developing NADFC to become a
learning organization. Unfortunately, disagreements between the local and international
consultants undermined performance and eventually led to the contract being terminated.

Based on the above, the ICR rating for the achievement of the second PDO is
Unsatisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

No net present value or rate of economic return was calculated for this ICR since accurate
estimates of the impact are not available for such estimation.

At the time of preparation, benefit-cost ratios were estimated for the project. The main
benefit was to be an improvement in health status (number of life-years saved) that would
result from improvements in allocative efficiency in spending, improved access to health
services and greater quality of health services. The minimum-benefit scenario needed to
justify PHP II investments was estimated as a 2.5% increase in coverage of services.
Although data are not available to measure the impact of PHP II on coverage, the decline
in health care utilization in the household surveys indicates that PHP II had little or no
impact. In short, the minimum-benefit scenario was not achieved.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

ICR Rating: Unsatisfactory

Project objectives and project design were largely appropriate to the challenges brought
upon by decentralization in health, but during implementation it became clear that the
design was too ambitious, particularly for large provinces with great heterogeneity in
institutional capacity like West Java and North Sumatera.

The achievement of the first PDO in all 3 Provinces was moderately unsatisfactory. The
provinces discussed and planned a number of key sector reforms, but implementation was
limited by both capacity and fiduciary issues and the late release of funds.

Achievement of the second PDO is unsatisfactory although achievement of the objective
of some component like the Strengthening of Food and Drug Control was moderately
satisfactory. The MOH has begun to perform new roles since decentralization, but has for
the most part not chosen to do it in ways envisioned by the project. There was little
implementation under the Strengthening Communicable Disease Control component.




                                             18

The overall outcome rating for the PDO is Unsatisfactory because many of the project's
objectives were largely not achieved and any progress that was made was not sustained.
Moreover, the project did not achieve any significant improvement in health care
utilization or outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Improving service delivery outcomes for the poor was a major sector-related goal for
PHP II. However, the available data from evaluation of the project do not permit careful
assessment of the extent to which the project was associated with changes in health care
use and health outcomes for the poor. The National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas),
showed increased utilization of public facilities in 2006 compared to 2002 for the poorest
and near poor income quintiles in all provinces, except for utilization by the poor in West
Java province (Table 2). Similar trends were seen for non-project provinces making it
difficult to distinguish the project impact from other, contemporaneous improvements in
health care use.

Table 2: Utilization of public facilities by the poorest and near poor income quintiles

                   North Sumatera              West Java                    Banten

 Poor             24.8%       29.2%        40.9%         38.9         49%         53.5%
 Near Poor        21.4%       28.3%        37.5%        38.9%         44.3%       49.2%

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional reform and strengthening were key components of PHP II. As already
discussed in previous sections, PHP II had mixed results. Although actual changes with
regard to human resource development, HIS, regulatory framework etc in project
provinces were limited, the project was successful in laying the foundations for
institutional change and strengthening in the context of a decentralized health sector.
Some of the institutional changes initiated under PHP II such as the JHC, TRT and health
promotion boards have been sustained albeit with varying success. The JHC has been
included in the MOH decentralization strategy document which was released as a
ministerial decree. In West Java, the JHC has been integrated into the province level
planning committee and has been expanded to include other sectors. In North Sumatera,
the Health Promotion Board is sustained and the independent board for public
accountability (FKK) continues to function in some districts. There was much less
institutional change in Banten, but this is hardly surprising given the project was a late
starter in the province, in addition to being hampered by the delays in financing that
affected other projects.

N/A

N/A


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

ICR Rating: Substantial

District and province level governments' commitment to institutionalizing the reforms
introduced under PHP II is high. There is broad agreement among sub-national level
policymakers that, given time and resources to follow through with the reforms,
substantial impact on health sector outcomes would have been achieved. However, the
following issues pose risks to sustained implementation of these reforms:

Financial: Funding for PHP II initiated activities such as JHCs and the health promotion
board ended when the project was closed. Meanwhile, delays in the release of funds
continue to have a disruptive effect on province and district level activities.

Economic: Current, relatively high rates of economic growth have created more fiscal
space for investing in the health sector. There is potential for districts wanting to sustain
or strengthen reforms initiated under PHP II by lobbying their respective governments for
larger allocations.

Technical: Follow up investments or government programs need investment in better
monitoring and evaluation capacity.

Institutional: The establishment of the JHCs was an important initiative to formulate
policy across districts and take advantage of province level economics of scale and scope.
Although JHCs have been fully integrated into the government process and expanded to
include other sectors in one province, it is not clear if they will be sustained in others.

Social: Stakeholder support for PHP II has generally been high. In West Java for
instance, civil society representatives belonged to the JHC. In North Sumatera, NGOs
participated in the health promotion boards. These stakeholders continue to be an
important source of support for sustaining PHP II reforms, where possible.

Political: Law 32 and PP 38 endorse the PHP vision that the province should have a
stronger role in decentralization.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Project was a follow on operation to the PHP I which was reviewed by QAG before
the Bank agreed to move on to PHP II. QAG rated the QAE for PHP I as "Satisfactory".
As discussed below, the strategic relevance and approach, technical, economic and
financial aspects of PHP II were satisfactory. Implementation arrangements were
moderately satisfactory and reflected the Bank's and Borrowers' assessment of feasibility
at appraisal. Bank inputs and processes, assessment of risk and fiduciary aspects were
also moderately satisfactory; key shortcomings are described below. The overall rating
for Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is therefore rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

Strategic Relevance and Approach

The objectives of PHP II were consistent with country and sector priorities at the time of
preparation, and continue to be relevant. The design of the project emphasized improving
service delivery for the poor, and attempted to strengthen mechanisms for doing so at the
central and local levels. The institutional strengthening approach taken by PHP II was
necessary given that the Bank's underlying goal was to support decentralization in the
health sector.

The scope of reforms expected in the project was too broad, particularly at the central-
level, given the political and institutional context in which they were to be implemented.
In such a context, it would have been better to set priorities for what reforms should be
undertaken and in what sequence.

The technical, economic and financial aspects of PHP II were relatively sound. The
project correctly assessed that the institutions and processes which underpinned technical
quality would be weakened after decentralization and sought to introduce safeguards.
Design elements such as the TRTs, TFs, the components to strengthen communicable
disease control and surveillance and an independent monitoring and evaluation outfit are
examples of such safeguards.




                                              21

Bank Inputs and Processes

The project was a repeater operation and as such prepared within a 12 month period. It is
not clear that more time spent on project preparation would have ensured that provinces
and districts were ready for implementation. The level of government involvement in
project preparation may not have been as extensive as it could have, in part due to the
short preparation period. As is often the case with projects that push the reform envelope,
PHP II was designed in close cooperation with the more progressive government
counterparts. It is acknowledged that broad-based government support, particularly
central government support, would have been difficult to achieve for a strong reform-
oriented project such as this.

Implementation Arrangements and M&E

The groundwork for many of the key institutional features was laid prior to
implementation. The effectiveness of key executive agencies was reviewed during project
preparation. Prior to negotiation, TORs for key positions such as the PCIUs, DIUs and
CPCU were prepared, and fund channelling mechanisms identified.

Given the complexity of the project, the heterogeneity in initial capacity across provinces
and considerable needs for technical assistance, the project implementers in the districts
and provinces felt that more intensive technical support should have been provided. This
applied to both the implementation of the project components as well as procurement and
financing arrangements. Clearly, the demands for technical assistance were more
significant than anticipated at appraisal.

As already discussed, indicators chosen to measure progress towards PDO's were
numerous and most were not amenable to precise and regular measurement and did not
reflect the institutional strengthening and capacity building goals of the project. The
implementation of M&E was also weak.

Assessment of Risk

PHP II correctly identifies relevant risks but could have done more in terms of risk
mitigation measures. For instance, the risk of central GOI commitment to
decentralization not being sustained is rated as Substantially High. It was expected that
the ongoing reorganization and reform within MOH, such as the setting up of the
Decentralization Unit, changes in internal structure and skill mix and work culture would
foster support and commitment to decentralization. This did not materialize.




                                            22

Fiduciary Aspects

The dilemma for the Bank at the design stage was how to ensure proper procurement
oversight in a situation when significant decision-making powers were being turned over
to districts. The Bank team did not anticipate at preparation that reducing the threshold
for World Bank prior review would result in a high volume of procurement transactions
given the large number of districts involved in the project, making Bank oversight of the
process challenging in light of finite supervision resources. In retrospect, the Bank could
have argued to have control of procurement at a higher level or have different design of
procurement methods.

(b) Quality of Supervision

ICR Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

As discussed below, the Bank's focus on development impact during implementation,
and the supervision of fiduciary and safeguard aspects was satisfactory. However, the
adequacy of supervision inputs and processes, and the candour and quality of
performance reporting was largely unsatisfactory, except towards the end of the project.
The Bank's role in ensuring adequate transition arrangements was minimal. The Quality
of Supervision is therefore rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Focus on Development Impact

Bank supervision of the project remained focused on the development impact of the
project, while assessing progress towards institutional strengthening objectives. Progress
towards institutional objectives such as the implementation of the district planning
process was assessed in terms of their ability to address the needs of the poor.

Adequacy of Supervision Inputs and Quality of Performance Ratings

Project supervision missions were carried out regularly and were comprehensive in
covering all the many different aspects of the project. Supervision missions also took
advantage of the high level of similarity between the three PHPs to do joint supervision.
Supervision missions for PHP I and II and later, PHP III were held jointly, which offered
several benefits to GOI. It reduced the burden on GOI from having to participate in three
separate missions. It enabled GOI to look across the provinces, make comparisons and
learn how provinces with different capacity dealt with the same issues or problems.
Wrap-up meetings were attended by GOI counterparts from all three projects, which
further encouraged sharing of lessons learnt. It also forced the provinces to learn from
each other, as they often participated in supervision visits to other provinces. Finally, it
was possible to pool supervision resources across three projects and share consultants and
experts.

A weakness of the Bank was the failure to recognise and respond to two critical
constraints to implementation early in the project: first, the scope of reforms was too
broad given the scale and heterogeneity of PHP II provinces; second, the complexity of
these reforms required closer, more intensive technical support than anticipated at
appraisal. Notwithstanding delays in the transfer of funds, addressing these constraints
early in the project may have improved the chances of implementation once the flow of
funds resumed. A proposal to restructure the project was made at the time of the MTR.
While this proposal reflects great insight into sectoral needs at the time, as well as
institutional constraints and opportunities, it came too late. The "informal" suspension of
the project before the MTR contributed to MOH reluctance to restructure the project. In
the case of the DFA, the Bank did recognise the lack of technical capacity at the district
level and actively intervened in reviewing the proposals to ensure quality. However, the
demands of such intensive technical support posed a heavy burden on the supervision
team's resources, and further delayed implementation. .

Another weakness of the Bank was a high propensity to overlook the poor performance
by the central government, in an attempt to maintain momentum at the district and
province levels. As funding delays virtually drew the project to a halt, it was increasingly
apparent that central government agencies were resisting project implementation. The
ISR's noted this problem, but continued to rate the project as Satisfactory1. This rating
was justified by the limited progress at the district and province levels, but is
questionable given the poor performance at central level. The Aide Memoires do
however contain more candid assessments of performance, perhaps because they
benefited from the comparison with other PHP's.

However, Bank supervision of PHP II is to be commended for the proactive manner in
which it dealt with the allegations of corruption and sought to restructure the project.
Supervision during the last two years of the project was characterised by candid
assessments of performance, and strong efforts to sustain progress made at the district
and province levels.

Supervision of Fiduciary and Safeguard Policies

Weaknesses in fiduciary arrangements put in place by the Bank are reflected in the
following: (i) protracted procurement process as a lot of time was required to ensure that
the procurement documents met Bank requirements and (ii) the finding of irregularities
during procurement and financial management post review.




1For 3.5 years and 11 ISR's, when disbursements were minimal and the lack of commitment from the central
government increasingly apparent, Satisfactory ratings were continuously recorded for both PDO and IP. While the
Task Team recognized these constraints, it was also aware that commitment for reforms was high at the district and
province levels. The Task Team argued that downgrading the ratings of the project at the time would have undermined
the high level of momentum for reform that had been built up at the district and province levels.




                                                         24

As indicated earlier, the Bank took prompt action when evidence of fraudulent practices
appeared in the project. A high-level mission was mounted to address these concerns and
a strong Action Plan agreed upon with GOI to ensure that future such practices would not
occur in any of the three PHP projects. In the end, most but not all of the actions of the
Plan were put into effect.

While the Bank's response to fraudulent practices was certainly necessary and also
appropriate, there is no question that the secondary effects of these actions were
substantial. As noted elsewhere, provinces and districts far removed from the corruption
that took place at the center felt they paid an unfair price for the mistakes of others. They
were eager to get on with pilots and other activities on which they had worked hard up to
the point when the evidence of corruption at the center became available. When the
informal suspension came into effect, resources for provinces and other forms of support
suddenly dried up (except for the DFAs). This raises the question of whether a more
nuanced approach on the Bank's part might have been possible that would not have so
discouraged the many local project parties who were not part of the fraudulent practices
and whose primary concern was to utilize project resources in order to achieve the
project's objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

ICR Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry was rated Moderately Satisfactory, while
Quality of Supervision was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Given the Unsatisfactory
rating for Outcomes, Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

ICR Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Arguably, there was enthusiasm and good support for the project among various
government agencies during preparation and appraisal or the Bank presumably would not
have proceeded with the project. However, over time this support lessened and took on a
different character, particularly with changes in the key personnel responsible for the
project in MOH. The obvious turning point was the revelation of fraudulent practices in
the CPCU. Once that had occurred, the project's momentum, which was not strong to
begin with, virtually came to an end. Activities in the central component largely stalled.
Progress at the province and district was limited as well because the flow of funds and
other resources was interrupted.




                                              25

As with PHP I, the overall enabling environment provided by central government had
significant shortcomings. Most important among these was lateness of disbursement of
DFA funds and confusion over precise allocation of authorities among government levels.
This made it very difficult to achieve certain project objectives.

The government's response to the evidence of corruption was initially prompt and strong.
It was slow, however, to put in place the complete range of actions agreed upon. There
also did not appear to be interest in MOH or other agencies for a concerted effort to turn
the project around by embarking on new set of actions and activities. Instead, an easier
path was taken, namely to let the remaining time in the project run out while recognizing
that the project's achievements would be quite limited.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

ICR Rating: Unsatisfactory

Central MOH. Perhaps the most important failing of the project was the fact that MOH
took only minimal steps to facilitate the broad health decentralization agenda that the
project had articulated in the PAD. Provinces and districts repeatedly told the ICR team
that they not only did not feel they were supported by the center but argued that in some
cases central MOH actions made it very difficult for them to achieve project objectives
locally.

Provincial and District Project Entities. Here the picture is more mixed. Some provinces
and districts, e.g., West Java, made many efforts to implement project activities in
accordance with their understanding of project objectives.           In other provinces,
commitment and achievements were more mixed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

ICR Rating: Unsatisfactory

Taken all considerations into account, the ICR team reluctantly judges the borrower
performance as unsatisfactory. The project simply did not achieve most of its key
objectives.

6. Lessons Learned

This ICR argues that the Bank had little choice but to respond in a supportive way to the
government's decentralization initiatives, particularly in light of anticipated positive as
well as negative consequences in health.        The experience of the Provincial Health
projects suggests, however, several lessons that emerged from this experience.




                                             26

(a) Providing Bank funding for decentralized activities entails considerable risk to project
    success in a situation where lower level entities, in this case primarily districts, do not
    have clear indications of what specific functions they can or cannot undertake,
    particularly if these functions are not set forth in legislation. Some districts, like
    Subang in West Java were successful in developing local workforce and financing
    policies because of the dynamic and resourceful leadership, and the willingness to
    mobilize required technical assistance either from the province level or from
    consultants.

(b) Projects will meet difficulties if authority is decentralized without provision of
    specific standards for implementing these authorities. One of the major frustrations
    of provinces and districts was being given authority in the laws for undertaking
    general functions that could be used to foster reforms but then not having the ability
    to set standards for ensuring that these functions could be properly performed.
    Nevertheless, North Sumatera and West Java had some progress in their reform
    efforts by learning from and adopting some of the reform ideas developed by the
    Yogyakarta Province, although administrative problems prevented the provinces from
    achieving more results. This is made possible by the good cross learning environment
    established between PHP I and II.

(c) A related issue has to do with the fact that where localities have weak capacity to
    implement decentralized activities, providing extensive technical guidance and advice
    is critical. There are a number of modes for supplying such advice--technical expert
    panels, etc. Provincial and district project participants consistently argued that while
    they supported the project objectives for health reform neither the central ministry or
    the Bank supplied enough specific operational guidance on how to achieve the
    specific reforms advocated by the project, e.g., in the area of restructuring of health
    organizations or how to increase public accountability. They expressed appreciation
    for the advice received from the Bank during supervision missions but held the view
    that this simply was not as extensive and frequent as needed.

(d) In situations of great institutional change and turbulence, reform oriented projects
    should set priorities for which reforms should be taken in what sequence. Attempting
    to implement too wide a scope of reforms at the same time places a large burden on
    project implementers operating in situations of great uncertainty. If the Bank is also
    well out in front of the client in terms of the how well the client understands the
    proposed reforms and how they can be best addressed, the implementation difficulties
    are only compounded.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

    -   A five year project is too short for large system changes envisioned by the project.




                                              27

- Performance indicators were too ambitious and difficult to achieve. It would be
  better to use proxy indicators. Several indicators, such as those related with
  personnel reform, were impossible to achieve by the regions in the absence of
  civil service reform.

- The length of the preparation phase (Phase I) was too short to produce meaningful
  outputs, particularly when the center and the regions were still struggling to get
  the project going.

- Implementation of the District Grants is considered as an innovative way to build
  capacity of the districts in planning and budgeting.

- The role of the JHC was only limited to approval of district proposal rather than
  the expected larger role of developing province level health policies. Limited
  involvement of the Bupatis (Head of the District) in JHC assemblies was seen as
  the main reason for ineffectiveness of the JHC.

- The TRT is considered successful in improving the capacity of districts/cities in
  developing annual proposals

- North Sumatera has an advantage from the closeness of the University of North
  Sumatera in Medan. The province also has strong collaboration with NGOs
  through the Health Promotion Board. West Java's strength is in its TRT that
  provided districts with good quality assistance in developing their annual
  proposals. As a new Province, the capacity of Banten is weak, and Tangerang
  district is the only district that showed progress during project implementation
  particularly in development of its health information system

- The output of the CDC component was limited due to problems in complying
  with World Bank procurement guidelines

- Districts were responsive towards the National Health Grants program but the
  process for obtaining the grant was too complex

- Advocacy of local government is key for project sustainability in order to build
  political commitment for more resources for health

- Informal suspension by the Bank of categories 3 and 7 following the confirmation
  of fraudulent practices at the central level resulted in implementation vacuum at
  the 3 levels.

- Contradiction between the Bank's procurement guidelines and the Government's
  Keppres 18 was the source of confusion to the implementing units, although the
  use of procurement plans was considered as a useful tool for monitoring
  procurement activities. Moreover, procurement activities were often delayed
  because of delays in developing procurement plans, changes among procurement
  committee members and their insufficient knowledge of Bank procurement
  guidelines, weak capacity in TOR development, and lengthy process in obtaining
  Bank no objection letter ,




                                        28

    -  World Bank requirements sometimes caused delays in execution of procurement,
       for example the requirement to conduct a feasibility study prior to construction of
       a new facility, or requirement to reach consensus on performance indicators prior
       to buying computers for developing the health information system

    -  Project Management Reports (PMR) was a useful tool for project monitoring. On
       the other hand, multiple audit activities were considered too many and time
       consuming. Moreover, the auditors do not always have the same perception when
       interpreting Bank regulations.

    -  Disbursement of project funds was very much influenced by procedures and
       regulations from MOF that often resulted in delays in budget release.

    -  It is better to have June 31 rather than December 31 for project closing date to
       ensure availability of Government funding for conducting activities between the
       closing date and the closing of accounts.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Progress on implementation of project components is rated Unsatisfactory because none of the
project's objectives were fully achieved; any progress that was made towards building
institutional capacity at the province and district level was rarely sustained. The only exception is
the DFA component, where there was some evidence of capacity building. In all other
components, the relevant government agencies did not progress beyond conceptualizing the
institutional reforms that were required and designing pilots.

It is acknowledged that much of the poor performance is related to issues that were beyond the
control of the project such as civil service regulations and frequent changes to financial
regulations that led to the delayed release of funds. However, these risks were not sufficiently
anticipated at preparation and little was done to mitigate them before or during implementation.
At the same time, it is recognized that it is beyond the control of the project to intervene in
Ministry of Finance decisions.

Monitoring and evaluation for the project was extremely weak, making it impossible to measure
the impact of the project on either institutional capacity building or on sector related outcomes.
The Key Performance Indicators identified at project appraisal (Annex 1 of the PAD) were
replaced by a set of more operational measures of performance at implementation. This set of
measures was used for the Baseline and Midterm Evaluations. For the Final Evaluation, the
measures were modified again. The Final Evaluation collected information retrospectively in
order to provide comparable data throughout the course of the project. The measures used to
evaluate performance at the Final Evaluation are summarized below against each of the original
project development indicators

                                                  for developing district planning capacity including
                                                  by preparing district planning tools.

                                        All provinces approached this objective by sending
                                        non-health staff for further training rather than by
                                        introducing downsizing policy.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

General

Provincial Health Project I (PHP I) is a project implementing decentralization in two provinces
and followed up by PHP II. PHP II started on April 2002 and finished at 30 June 2007. PHP II is
implemented at: Provinces North Sumatera, Banten, West Java and Central. Generally activities
implemented in PHP II are "Health Sector Reform" activities in all aspects.

In following up changes due to the emerging of the new laws, a lot of preparations should be
done, among others: institutions, human resource and other resources, and supporting regulations.
Usually the above changes are beyond the capacity of the Ministry of Health. This means that we
should prepare to overcome potential problems that may appear.

The implementation of PHP I and PHP II is very close, so that no meaningful PHP I experiences
could be used as lessons learned for PHP II.

The expansion of new districts and province (Banten) often caused personnel transfer or mutation,
limited quantity and quality of personnel, a long process to obtain No Objection Letter from the
Bank, the availability of budget always late, all of these influenced the smoothness of
implementation of PHP II.

During the life of PHP II, the Bank discovers "fraudulent and corruption practices" at component
B6, at the central level. This caused suspension approximately one year for activities in category 3
and category 7. Suspend that applied for central and province has influenced to all project
implementation activities. Further, this also influenced the implementation of the District Funding
Allocation (=DFA, the amount of DFA is about 65 % of the total loan).

Project Design

1. Similar as PHP I, PHP II is a project developed to change a health system, from a centralistic
    character to a decentralistic one. For this change, innovative activities were required in
    relation with capacity building, planning and health expenditure, improving accessibility and
    quality of health service delivery, etc. This change needs to be supported by a consistent
    central policy, which do not often change, including the human resources (tour of duty, tour
    of area, etc.).

2. A five-year period is too short to realize this relatively big system change. We consider the
    Performance Indicators as too ambitious and difficult to be achieved. Proxy-indicators would
    be better. Besides that, several indicators related to human resource were impossible to be
    achieved by the region because it was related to "human resource law" as an umbrella law for
    civil servants.

3. PHP II consists of two phases, Preparation phase (24 April 2002­31 December 2003) and
    Operational phase (1 January 2004­30 June 2007). Preparation phase is considered necessary.
    The 20 months period of preparation phase was considered not enough to yield outputs as
    planned in the PAD. During the Preparation phase, at the Central level, activities were
    mostly focused to furnish necessary documents for implementing "foreign loan project" such
    as:




                                                 41

    a. Circulation Letter from Directorate General of Budget (released on 23 July 2002),
    b. Legal Opinion from Department of Justice (released on 12 December 2002),
    c. Establishment of Implementing Unit such as:

        -   Decentralization Unit,
        -   Implementing Unit at Directorate General of CDC,
        -   Implementing Unit at Central Research and Development in Health,
        -   Implementing Unit at Food and Drug Control Body (Badan POM)

    d. Similar activities occurred at the regions, developing new organizations such as: JHC
        (Joint Health Council), TRT (Technical Review Team), PHPB (Provincial Health
        Promotion Board), Task Forces, etc. Task Forces should come up with outputs as
        planned. However the outputs are developed at the Operational phase, simultaneously
        with the implementation.

4. Implementation of District Funding Allocation (DFA) is an innovative capacity building in
    the "comprehensive health planning and budgeting". Districts and cities develop Plans of
    Action tailored to their needs in the form of proposals, complete with budget and its source.
    Districts and cities develop a Master Plan (a five-year period plan) and a one-year plan based
    on their Master Plan. This prove to enhance personnel's ability to develop a comprehensive
    health plan for their districts/cities.

5. The objective of establishing Joint Health Council (JHC) at the province is for dealing with
    health issues and development of health policies in the region. We assume that JHC's
    members, who are consisted of Bupati/Major, Professional organization, NGOs, cannot
    function well as it is hoped. JHC only provides proposal approval submitted by the
    Districts/Cities.

6. The objective of establishing Technical Review Team (TRT) at the province level is for
    assisting District/Cities in proposal development and reviewing it.        TRT is considered
    successful in conducting its role, even though at the beginning there are rejections from the
    Districts/Cities with various reasons such as: inability to keep company, guidance for
    proposal development was not clear. However as time goes on, the role of TRT was well-
    accepted by the Districts/Cities. There was a significant capacity improvement of district's
    planners.

Project Components

There are five components at provincial and three at central level. Those components are
considered important to support health sector reform which was really required in the
decentralization era (Organization, planning, health information, health financing, regulation,
public accountability reforms, etc.).

Component 3: Assuring Equity in Service Provision. Under this component is NHG (National
Health Grant), managed by the central level. NHG is an activity where regions are interested. A
lot of NHG proposals submitted by the Provinces and Districts/Cities with various topics and
innovative. While other subcomponents: Assessing Health Research Needs; Capacities and
Options; have no activities at all since the beginning of the project.

Output of Project Component

a. Output at Province/District/City


                                                 42

   Decentralization is executed based on Law 22/1999, which was then revised to Law 32/2004.
   For the implementer, Decentralization is a new issue. This is even more if it is linked to
   Health Sector Reform.

   -  North Sumatera Province, with its 25 Districts and Cities, is considered having human
      resources with better ability. To anticipate the JHC weakness, the Provincial Health
      Office took initiative by mobilizing retired personnel to facilitate the provinces, appeared
      to help project implementation running well. University of North Sumatera has experts
      who assist Provincial/District/City health office for developing decentralization concepts
      that could be applied. Beside that, the Provincial Health Office also worked together with
      NGO in developing health promotion activities.

   -  West Java Province: The human resources capacity at Provincial Health Office is good
      enough in developing and implementing the project. The output of TRT at the province
      level is very supportive to the Districts and Cities in developing proposals. Task Forces
      also showed similar performance.

   -  Banten Province: Banten is a new province with many problems such as human resource, in
      term of quantity and quality; at the province as well as at the districts and cities. Tangerang
      district showed significant results, among others in developing Health Information System
      and almost all districts and cities showed good proposals writing for "funding allocation".

b. Output at Central Level

   Organization change from "Ministry of Health and Social Welfare" to "Ministry of Health"
   brought forth mutation of personnel several times at central level. Time is required for the
   new personnel to make adjustment and fully understand in managing the project
   comprehensively.

   -  Component of Strengthening of Communicable Disease Control
      Planning for this component was not done well, so that the output was not sufficient.
      Planning has been done for the development of Sulianti Saroso Hospital as a center of
      excellence for infectious diseases could not be realized because difficulties in the
      procurement process. The Bank insisted the need of a consultant to conduct a feasibility
      study of the advantage of the equipment procured and also the civil work. In fact a
      procurement officer should be assigned to assist the procurement process. However until
      the end of the project, this activity was never realized.

   -  Component of Strengthening Food and Drug Control
      PHP II helped seriously the transformation of Directorate General of Food and Drug
      Control to become a "Professional Unit" in its functions. Various activities related to
      human resource capacity building such as training of the Inspection system for the
      inspector/auditor was done. Other training was: Strengthening of Public Accountability,
      fellowships for S-I and S-II abroad and domestic, technical assistance by consultants, etc.

   -  National Health Grant (Component 3)
      For the purpose of implementing NHG, PHP II has developed guidelines: its objectives,
      activities that could be supported, its mechanism, reporting and monitoring system that
      should be followed for NHG activities. Many proposals submitted by the Districts/Cities.
      However the implementation was not simple. The administrative procedures were
      complicated and lengthy. Monitoring and evaluation of technical issues is much easier


                                                43

         compared to monitoring and evaluation of administrative aspects and finance.
         (Monitoring and evaluation should be done by the secretariat at central level). Budget
         that always overdue, influenced NHG implementation. Sometime amendment of the
         contract between project and regional implementer should be done.
         .
c. Fellowship

     There was a clear benefit in capacity building for health personnel at the
     province/district/city/central through D-III, S-I, S-II and S-III educations. This covered PHP
     II provinces as well as outside PHP II provinces.

d. Project Sustainability and Key Lessons Learned

     -   To increase involvement and sense of belonging of the local government (To gain budget
         allocation) as well as the central MOH, PHP I and PHP II collaborating with "Center for
         Management of Health Service" (PMPK), Gajah Mada University, organized a seminar,
         discussing activities considered as "Best Practices".

     -   There should be a continuous advocative approach toward the local government
         including the local parliament in order to assure political commitment, so that
         implementation budget will be there.

     -   After the project ends, to maintain technical competence of the districts and provinces,
         Ministry of Health must continue to provide technical assistance.


Project Management

The establishment of Project Secretariat at the Central level, Province and all Districts/Cities was
very helpful in the smoothness of project implementation:

-    In facilitating all project activities conducted by Technical Unit/Task Force at the Ministry of
     Health, Provincial/District/City Health Offices.

-    In conducting project administration according to "loan agreement" such as: planning,
     procurement of goods/consultant, finance and monitoring project. Good coordination and
     cooperation in the project secretariat is very helpful in the smoothness of the project.

-    In managing inter-sectoral financing administration such as with the Ministry of Finance for
     replenishment and reimbursement of the budget.


At the early 2005, World Bank discovered fraudulent practices at the central level that caused
suspension for category 3 and 7 (World Bank's letter dated 19 May 2005). In response to the
suspension, Inspector General conducted investigation, followed by the State Auditor (request of
the Bank). Suspension of category 3 and 7 is related to project implementation. Since suspension
was also applied to the Province level, practically all project activities could not be conducted at
all levels.

To prevent the recurrence of similar practices, the World Bank requested Inspectorate General to
conduct internal audit all foreign-loan projects that was never be done previously.




                                                   44

Comments on the World Bank

a. Procurement

   -   The project is obliged to develop a "Procurement Plan" yearly, which must be approved
       by the Bank. The plan contains district's need. The Procurement Plan is very useful as
       assessment tool for yearly needs and for the monitoring the procurement activities.

           · Yearly procurement activities are always late/out of schedule, due to:
           · Procurement plan developments are behind schedule.
           · Procurement Committee members change every year.
           · Insufficient knowledge of the Committee regarding the Bank's rules.

   -   The time needed by the Bank to issue the NOL.

   -   Procurement of Computers to support the Health Information System is far too late in
       procurement. Procurement was just implemented in 2007. This is because procurement
       may be done only after the performance indicators are approved by central.

b. Project Management Report (PMR)

   During 2002 ­ 2005, PHP II was not careful enough in developing the Project Management
   Report (PMR). As a consequence there were differences between un-audited PMR and
   audited PMR until 2004. The auditor (BPKP) never provided statements regarding these
   differences in their audit report, with a consequence the project management never made
   correction of the PMR. So far PHP II management paid no attention to this difference.

   As a result of the above, the following issues occurred:

   -   There was difference of 2005 early balance between un-audit PMR and audit PMR as it
       was reported by BPK (state auditor) for fiscal year 2005.

   -   There was a big backlog in the "letter of payment authorization"

   -   There was a big expenditure in the "bridging account" (State Treasurer).

   These issues have been overcome by the new management.

c. Audit

   -   In line with the Loan Agreement, the project audit consists of:

       · General Audit by BPKP, conducted each year: March­June
       · Ex Post Review, each year conducted by different auditors, appointed by the Bank:
           April ­ June
       · Interim Audit, for district / cities twice yearly March and October.
       · Technical Audit, the Loan Agreement mention as twice yearly. The project considers
           once a year to be sufficient: September­November.

   -   The different audits, going through the same documents, executed at nearly the same
       time/period, make it difficult for the implementers.

   -   Very often they have different perception regarding the Bank's regulation. The guideline,
       a reference for the implementation of the project needs to be clear, free from possible
       mis/multiple perceptions by every component, especially the auditors.


                                                45

d. Performance Indicator

    -   Time target set in the Performance Indicator is too short, since changing the system
        (which is the goal of the project) cannot be achieved in such a short time. There should
        have been a preparation time for the regions, especially the manpower. Implementation
        time needs to be longer.

    -   Other indicators not able to be fulfilled by the regions are those contradictory with the
        existing Law. For example: reducing number of personnel, early retirement, recruitment,
        etc.

e. Closing Date

    We suggest that the closing date of the next projects will not be at 31 December, but 30 June.
    The reason of this suggestion is because of: the project faces difficulties in conducting
    activities between closing date and closing account. The activities are among others: to
    finish up the administration: replenishment, reimbursement, writing final project report,
    follow up of audit/investigation report. These activities require certain budget. The budget is
    liquefied after DIPA issuance, and very often DIPA issuance is late.

Comments on the Ministry of Finance

Loan disbursement is very much depended upon budget withdrawal. In reality implementation is
very often behind the schedule. This is due to:

a. Project implementation was behind schedule, due to error of DIPA software (mistake was at
    the budget proportion of GOI). Software revision is required and this takes time.

b. The different perception with the KPKN / KPPN managers in Lampung and Jogjakarta in
    translating the Circular Letter from Directorate General of Budget regarding the
    implementation of District Grant caused a delay in money withdrawal for Districts/Cities.

c. Transition of the new rule of "Unified Budget" system needs time.

d. The establishment of "travel efficiency budget" policy in the amount of 70 % on August 2007.
    At the beginning it also applied for "Foreign Loan and Grant" (PHLN).              The budget
    efficiency policy was repealed at the early November 2007, and the dispensation to use the
    money was approved at the late November 2007.


Comments on the Ministry of Health

There was no matching budget available at the beginning of the project.

The changes of project management line (which in the beginning under Secretariat General) were
moved to "main unit" (Directorate General of Community Health). This influenced budgeting
mechanism (Changes of Working Unit/SATKER), and required a long time to settle. Revision
process must wait the Regional and Central DIPA compilation.             It could not be processed
separately. Difficulties in recruiting "Working Unit Staff" and members for the Procurement
Committee. Project results, especially best practices, need to be well documented and
disseminated so that other provinces can learn.




                                                46

For the 7 years (84 months) working plan, in reality only implemented 54 months (64 %).

Conclusion

a. Decentralization in the autonomy era is not only delegation of authority or financial
   distribution between central and region. Further more, how decentralization could improve
   services to the community. As a consequence many things should be anticipated, especially
   technical provider in the field.

b. In reality, the human resource in the provinces and districts are not yet prepared to implement
   the programs decentralized by the MOH, so that capacity building is required to achieve the
   development objectives of PHP I.

c. Managerial skill and good communication are very important to manage a project.

d. To obtain local government support after the project closing, political commitment is required
   through continuous policy dialogue.

e. After the project closes, the local governments are still required to further expand the
   technical support from MOH.
