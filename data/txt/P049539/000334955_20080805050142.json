Some of the lessons learned included: 1)\n            providing Bank funding for decentralized activities entails\n            considerable risk to project success in a situation where\n            lower level entities, in this case primarily districts, do\n            not have clear indications of what specific functions they\n            can or cannot undertake, particularly if these functions are\n            not set forth in legislation. Some districts, like Subang in\n            West Java were successful in developing local workforce and\n            financing policies because of the dynamic and resourceful\n            leadership, and the willingness to mobilize required\n            technical assistance either from the province level or from\n            consultants; 2) projects will meet difficulties if authority\n            is decentralized without provision of specific standards for\n            implementing these authorities. One of the major\n            frustrations of provinces and districts was being given\n            authority in the laws for undertaking general functions that\n            could be used to foster reforms but then not having the\n            ability to set standards for ensuring that these functions\n            could be properly performed. Nevertheless, North Sumatera\n            and West Java had some progress in their reform efforts by\n            learning from and adopting some of the reform ideas\n            developed by the Yogyakarta Province, although\n            administrative problems prevented the provinces from\n            achieving more results. This is made possible by the good\n            cross learning environment established between first and\n            second Provincial Health Project (PHP I and II); and 3) in\n            situations of great institutional change and turbulence,\n            reform oriented projects should set priorities for which\n            reforms should be taken in what sequence. Attempting to\n            implement too wide a scope of reforms at the same time\n            places a large burden on project implementers operating in\n            situations of great uncertainty. If the Bank is also well\n            out in front of the client in terms of the how well the\n            client understands the proposed reforms and how they can be\n            best addressed, the implementation difficulties are only compounded."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
