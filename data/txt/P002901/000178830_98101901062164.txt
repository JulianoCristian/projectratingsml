PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
UGANDA SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 258-UG)
PREFACE
.
This report is a project performance review of the Second
Education Project in Uganda (Credit 258-UG) for which a Credit of
US$7.3 million was approved in June 1971. The original Closing Date
was December 31, 1977; this was postponed twice--to December 31, 1979
and December 31, 1981. The final disbursement was made in June 1982
and the remaining balance of US$ 1,290.61 was cancelled in September
1982.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) attached is based on
the findings of a desk study carried out in August-September 1982
by a Unesco team at the RMEA office in Nairobi. The team also paid
a two-day visit to Uganda.
The Operations Evaluation Department decided not to audit
the project and sent the PCR to the Government in May 1983. No
comments have been received from the Government.

1/ The unstable conditions prevailing in the country during the
implementation period precluded thorough supervision and recording
and many data are lacking.
2/ November 1981, supervision mission rough estimate. Using an exchange
rate of USh.8 = US$1.
3/ US$1,290.61 were cancelled in September, 1982. A balance of US$ 30,316.01
remaining in a Unesco technical assistance contract financed under the
project was forwarded to the Association in December 1982 to be credited to
Uganda's debt service on the project.

UGANDA - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT 258-UG
HIGHLIGHTS
The Development Credit Agreement for the Second Education
Project for Uganda (Cr. 258-UG) signed June 23rd, 1971 provided US$7.3
million equivalent to assist the country to ease well defined manpower
shortages in the technical, agricultural and medical fields as well as to
meet urgent needs for teacher training and for improved educational
planning. In this endeavour, the project as designed was intended to: (a)
expand the buildings and provide equipment for one teacher training
institution (equipment for a second one), four upper secondary schools,
five technical secondary schools and two post secondary agricultural
colleges; (b) provide new buildings and equipment for one vocational
training center, three district farm institutes and rural training
centers,4/ one medical tutor training college and one nurses and midwives
school; Tc) provide technical assistance in the form of specialized
teaching staff, for a number of the above mentioned institutions (about 72
man-years) and in an advisory capacity for education planning (about 8
man-years) and (d) provide fellowships for Ugandans in fields related to
the project institution (about 18 man-years). The project was modified in
January 1978 to delete the expansion of the five technical secondary
schools because of the Government's decision to change the programs and
objectives of the schools (para. 2.14(b)). Also because of delays in
implementation and lack of funds, one of the district farm institute was
deleted by the time of the Credit closing date. After two postponements
the Credit was closed December 31, 1981 or four years beyond the original
December 31, 1977 Closing Date. To complement this project, but mainly to
replace educational material destroyed or lost during the 1978 war, US$2.5
million equivalent of the First Reconstruction Credit to Uganda (Cr.
983-UG; signed April 2, 1980) were allocated to assist in completing the
project.
Implementation of the project must be viewed in the light of
the dismal political and economic situation which prevailed in the country
through the life of the project (paras. 2.03 and 2.04). This combined with
the less than adequate performance of the Project Implementation Unit
(paras. 3.08 and 3.09) resulted in substantial delays - some of the
retained project components are not yet completed - and extremely high cost
overruns. The latter were roughly estimated at 76% of the original project
cost by the November, 1981 supervision mission. This figure should be
qualified in two respects: firstly, it is based on an exchange rate of
USh8 to the US$ which would differ from the weighted exchange rate which
would have been consistent with the implementation schedule and secondly,
4/ Vehicles would be provided for 15 centers already in operation.



- vii -
the estimate relates exclusively to the components retained in the project
i.e., it does not take into account the components which were deleted
(about US$2.3 million). Anyway, no definite assessment of total project
cost will be feasible due to serious gaps in the cost records prepared by
the PIU. The sole project item where approximate cost estimates could be
retraced was civil works (paras. 3.22-3.24 and Annex 3) and this prior to
the completion of several of the project buildings.
Under the conditions prevailing in the country and
notwithstanding implementation problems, the fact that nine of the 14
institutions retained in the project were already in operation by end-1982
and that the remaining five are expected to be operational within a few
months, can be interpreted as a sucessful performance (Chapter IV.). The
survival of the basic structure and operations of the educational system
through the very difficult decade of the 1970's assisted the project
in achieving most of its objectives (para. 2.05 and 2.09).
Other points of interest are:
(a) The teacher training project component has been
particularly successful in meeting enrollment targets (para. 4.02). This
can be attributed to its earlier physical implementation, appropriate
guidance provided by Unesco experts since its initial stages and lately by
Ugandans trained under the fellowship program; and
(b) domestic shortages of construction materials and consequent
rapid price increases resulted in civil works for retained project
components costing four-fold the appraisal estimates (Annex 3).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
UGANDA-SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 258-UG)
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Project Objectives. The project was largely designed to provide
middle-level manpower in the industrial, agricultural, and health sectors,
as well as to increase the number of teachers for secondary schools and the
output of 'A'-level science students. The improvement of educational
planning constituted another objective.
Project Generation.  The three-year process leading to the project was
systematic and thorough. It led to a well-defined project, which
unfortunately was overtaken by unforeseeable events including civil
turbulence and war.
Project Components. Of the twenty institutional components in the Credit
Agreement, six were eventually dropped. Of the remaining fourteen, nine
are currently operational although enrollments/output have been below the
targets set at appraisal. In terms of technical assistance, the man/years
of specialist services were reduced from a planned 80 man/years to 35.3,
and fellowships increased from the planned 18 man/years to 31.5.
Project Implementation. Implementation must be viewed in the light of the
turbulent times which began shortly after credit effectiveness and which
continued throughout the life of the project.
In addition to the uncontrollable events, the weak performance of the PIU
throughout the life of the project hampered implementation and precluded an
assessment of the project overall financial performance.
Project Outcomes. Even though only nine of the fourteen project
institutions were operative as of September 1982 and enrolments/outputs are
below targets5/, in the context of the difficulties prevailing in Uganda,
the project can be considered successful. Furthermore, notwithstanding
that some equipment, furniture and building materials were still in storage
by end-1982, the Government expects to have the remaining five project
institutions operational within a few months.
5/ The Appraisal Mission estimated the demand for skilled and semi-skilled
workers on the basis of the continuance in the 1970s of the economic
growth of the 1960s. Due to the severe economic decline, the demand
will be much lower in the foreseeable future.



-  ix
Bank Performance. RMEA's supervision performance was as effective as
possible under the circumstances prevailing in the country. The project
might have been drastically curtailed had it not been for RMEA's
interventions and efforts.
Lessons Learned and Recommendations. The principal lessons to be learned
from the project are as follows:
(a) Under unsettled circumstances the weakness of the project management
team becomes particularly detrimental to effective project implemen-
tation;
(b) particular attention should be devoted to the establishment of an
efficient delivery system under normal circumstances. In abnormal
circumstances, it is not advisable to procure materials at an early
stage of project implementation and to store them for distribution
much later. In this respect it is recommended that future Bank Group
Education missions continue to review the problem of distribution of
equipment and other materials which were still in storage by
end-1982. Project institutions which could not be supervised during
the implementation period should also be visited;
(c) the inclusion of technical assistance can serve as an effective means
of maintaining an objective sense of direction and continuity,
particularly during unsettled times. In this regard, the success of
the teacher training component of the project can be largely
attributed to the effectiveness of the expert team and, subsequently,
to that of the Ugandans trained through fellowships;
(d) the involvement of too many agencies in a project (8 different
ministries in this case) creates substantial problems of management
and coordination.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        This completion report was prepared by EAPED staff on the basis
of a desk study carried out by a Unesco team at the Bank's Regional Mission
to East Africa (RMEA) office in Nairobi in August-September 1982. The
Unesco team, composed of a general educator and an architect, also paid a
two-day visit to Uganda but because of the brevity of the visit and
unsettled conditions prevailing in the country could add little to the
information available in RMEA files.
1.02        The material consulted by the Unesco team at RMEA offices
consisted of the Development Credit Agreement, the staff appraisal report
and related working papers, supervision reports, progress reports prepared
by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), contract agreements,
correspondence and a report prepared by an architectural consultant firm in
August 1981.  Many of these documents provided more limited information
than it would be normally expected for a project implemented in a country
where security does not present problems and where the performance of the
PIU can be more closely monitored. The most serious gaps relate to
reporting on on-site inspection of project institutions - 6 of the 14
institutions in the project could not be visited by supervision missions -
and project cost information - the incomplete PIU recording has prevented
the assessment of project costs for any item besides civil works.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Setting
2.01        At the time of appraisal in 1970, Uganda had a population of
about 9.8 million which included some 110,000 of non-africans, mainly of
Indo-Pakistani (95,000) and European (10,500) extraction. The bulk of the
african population was constituted by four different, and often antagonist
groups representing the country's original kingdoms, the Buganda being the
strongest.
2.02        Since independence in 1962 the country had undergone drastic
political and institutional changes, at times accompanied by periods of
serious unrest and instability. It was not until about 1968 that the first
signs of return to normalcy began to appear. Despite these handicaps, the
initial years after independence demonstrated the country's economic
potential. GDP during the period 1963-70 grew at 4.8% per year (about 2%
in per capita terms) and a reasonably high savings rate permitted the
implementation of an ample investment program without undue pressure on
domestic prices or the balance of payments. Public finances were also in a
relatively healthy state with savings financing a significant portion of
Government development expenditure. The fact that economic expansion fell



below the ambitious target set in the 1966-71 Development Plan can be
explained mainly by a late start in the implementation of the Plan, due to
political unrest, and also by the shortage of skilled manpower at the
various levels required to prepare and carry out the plan projects.
2.03        Soon after approval of the project however, the situation
started to deteriorate, and unfavorable conditions prevailed all through
the project implementation period. This deterioration was triggered by
policies introduced by the military regime, which remained in power from
1971 through 1979 and was exacerbated by external shocks, such as the rise
in petroleum prices and the tensions which led to the break-up of the East
African Community. It culminated with the devastation of the 1978-79 war
and subsequent looting. Although much improved, the situation remains in
many respects unsettled.
2.04        During the years of military rule, value added in all sectors,
except subsistence agriculture, declined sharply, with the result that
overall GDP stagnated and per capita real income declined steadily. Main
contributors to the erosion of productive capacity were two not necessarily
independent elements: (a) the lack of maintenance of existing
infrastructure and productive assets; and (b) the loss of experienced
administrators, managers, entrepreneurs, accountants, teachers and traders
who left the country in the first half of the 1970s (including most of the
Asian population during the so-called economic war" of 1972), and also the
loss of an important share of the urban workforce who felt compelled to
revert to subsistence agriculture.
2.05        Amidst this rapidly deteriorating situation and although
subject to the same constraints as the rest of the economy, the education
sector continued to expand, but to a great extent at the expense of the
quality of education.
The Education Sector
2.06        The structure of education in Uganda is derived from the
British colonial system. General Education consists of seven years of
primary courses, four years of lower secondary courses leading to the
0-level examination, two years of upper secondary courses leading to the
A-level examination and three to five years of specialized higher education
at a college or at the University. Parallel to general secondary education
run primary teacher training courses and technical and commercial courses
of various levels.
2.07        At the time of appraisal, an important share of general
education was in the hands of private bodies (religious charitable
institutions or other private concerns) over which the Government exercised
little or no control. Even though in many of the unaided private schools,
in particular at the secondary level, education was far below acceptable
standards, financial constraints precluded the Government from taking over
their operation. In 1969, these schools may have enrolled as many as
450,000 primary students and 50,000 secondary students, as compared with



Government and aided school enrollments of 710,000 (46% of the age group)
in primary schools and 36,000 (slightly over 4% of the age group) in
secondary schools.
2.08        From the point of view of immediate and projected manpower
requirements, the most urgent training needs identified at that time were
for:  upper secondary students (only 0.7 percent of the pertinent age group
was enrolled in Government and aided schools) teacher training for
commercial, a ricultural and industrial subjects, and specialized
institutions;L/ skilled worker training for industry;  agriculture
training at various levels, including farmer training; and training in the
health sector, including medical tutor training.
2.09        During the period of project implementation, the education
system of Uganda shared with the rest of the Ugandan economy the ravaging
effects of a decade of economic decay and political instability. Even so,
the collapse charasteristic of most parts of the economy was less evident
in the education sector, and the system remained a viable operation. While
in non-aided schools enrollments may have stabilized or even declined
somewhat, enrollments in Government and aided schools continued to expand.
This can be seen from the data presented in the table which follows.
Enrollments in Government and Aided General Education Institutions
1969                 1979
Primary Level (P1-7)                          709,708            1,223,850
Secondary Level:
"O" level (S1-4)                            33,570               61,126
"A  level (S5-6)                             2,513                5,604
Teacher Training (Primary)                      3,944                 7,934
Makerere University                             2,217                 3,913
The pressures of increased enrollments, combined with years of extreme
neglect to the physical inputs needed for the educational process, have
resulted in conditions of deprivation and decay in all parts of the
system. Particularly detrimental have been the effects of: (a) a general
lack of maintenance; (b) the departure of expatriate teachers; (c) a
deterioration of teacher morale; and (d) the loss or damage of school
facilities, equipment and supply.
Project Generation (Key Project Data, page iv)
2.10        The first discussions concerning the Second Education Project
between the Government and the Association occurred in July 1968.2/ This
1/  Even though a great number of expatriate teachers was working in Uganda
at this level of education (72% of secondary teachers were expatriate),
the shortages were becoming increasingly critical.
2/  The first Credit (101-UG), signed in april 1967, provided US$10 million
to help finance the expansion and diversification of secondary
education through the construction of twenty-four new secondary schools
and additional facilities at fifteen existing schools.

led to a Unesco project identification mission which visited Uganda in
February-March 1969 with the report appearing in June 1969. Subsequently
there was an IDA reconnaissance mission in September 1969, followed by an
IDA-Unesco Reconnaissance Mission in December of that year. A Unesco
project preparation mission took place in January-February 1970 and IDA
appraised the proposed project in June 1970. In January 1971, an IDA
Supervision (ED/I) - Reconnaissance (ED/II) Mission paid the last visit
prior to its June 17, 1971 board presentation.
2.11        The above three-year process was systematic and thorough.  It
led to a well-defined project which, unfortunately, was overtaken by
unforeseeable events.
Project Objectives
2.12        The project was designed to provide middle-level manpower in
the industrial, agricultural, and health fields, as well as to increase the
output of 'A'-level science students. Teacher training and technical
assistance were included to support these objectives. Another component
consisted of the strengthening of the educational planning unit within the
Ministry of Education.
Project Content
2.13        The project as appraised consisted of:
(a)  The construction, furnishing and equipping of:
- one vocational training center (Jinja);
- two district farm institute and rural training centers
(Mpigi, Pakelle);
- one district farm institute (Bukwa);
- one medical tutor training college (Kampala);
- one nurses' and midwives' training school (Mbale).
(b)  The construction of extensions to, and the furnishing and
equipping of:
- one teacher training college (NTC - Kyambogo);
- one demonstration school (NTC - Kyambogo);
- two agricultural colleges (Arapai and Bukalasa);
- four upper secondary schools (Aga Khan, Iganga, Kitgum,
Ibanda);
- five technical secondary schools.
(c) The supply of equipment to:
- one technical college for technical teacher training
(UTC - Kyambogo);
- 15 farm institutes (vehicles).



- 5 -
(d) The provision of technical assistance:
-  80 man/years of expertise technical assistance in the
form of specialized teaching staff (about 72
man/years), and in an advisory capacity for education
planning (about 8 man/years);
- 18 man/years of fellowships in fields related to
the project institutions.
Amendments to the Project
2.14        There were five amendments as follows:
(a) May 19, 1976: The IDA financing of Category II, Schedule
I (technical assistance and fellowships) was raised from
75% of total expenditure to 100% of foreign exchange
expenditure and 75% of local expenditure.
(b) January 10, 1978: The closing date was postponed from
December 31, 1977, to December 31, 1979; five technical
schools were deleted from the project because of the
Government's unilateral decision to change the scope and
curriculum of the schools without proper manpower
justification, and compliance with Section 2.01(b) was
waived. The latter involved deductions from the Credit
for all technical assistance received from other sources.
Ultimately 35.3 man/years of technical assistance and 31.5
man/years of fellowships were provided under the project.
(c) December 28, 1979: The closing date was postponed until
December 31, 1981.
(d) May 6, 1980: The funds were re-allocated within the four
categories as indicated below and authorization was given
to use up to US$2.35 million3/ of the First
Reconstruction Credit to Uganda (Cr. 983-UG; signed April
2, 1980) to complement the fund of the Second Education
Project. In this latter case, the funds were used to
procure equipment in order to make completed project
institutions operational.

(e)  December 30, 1981:  Deletion of the Pakelle District Farm
Institute and Rural Training Center, because of
implementation delays and lack of funds. In addition, in
the course of implementation the decision to relocate the
district farm institute and the replacement of two of the
upper secondary schools was agreed upon.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
General Overview
3.01        When assessing the implementation of the project, allowances
must be made for the exceptional circumstances prevailing in Uganda
throughout the whole project implementation period (paras. 2.03-2.04).
Developments in the early years following project effectiveness delayed the
start-up and subsequently slowed down project implementation. Later, and
more specifically, in April 1977 the Project Director reported that the
Government would not be able to make any payments for a number of months.
Chaos came with the 1978 war, and widespread and intensive looting on
building sites and, to a lesser extent, in Project Unit stores, was
reported in May and again in July 1979. Finally, the drastic June 1981
devaluation of the Uganda shilling resulted in a ten-fold increase in the
cost of building materials in the domestic market.
3.02         Civil works were undertaken at only thirteen of the nineteen
institution in the project4 which involved construction. Seven and-a-half
years after their planned completion dates, eight of the buildings were
still unfinished and their status of completion varied from 59% to 99%.
The cost (in USh.) of civil works for these thirteen institutions was five
times the cost appraisal for all the institutions originally in the
project.
3.03        The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) performed poorly from the
start. Further, the Government vacillated in its policy regarding project
institutions. The design work did not begin until a year after
effectiveness and it was two and-a-half years before the first contract was
signed. Each project item had two or even three separate contractors
appointed during the eight-year contract period.
3.04        Credit funds were spent on bulk importation of construction
materials which were not properly controlled. This is said to have
increased instead of decreased, as intended, the final cost of the works.
4/ Of the fourteen institutions which remained in the project, one
involved only the provision of books and equipment.



New vehicles and other valuable items of furniture and equipment did not
reach their intended destinations. Thus, much wastage was due to the weak
delivery system operated by the PIU. This included the PIU's continuous
failure to maintain proper stock control procedures in spite of frequent
requests from RMEA.
3.05        It is not possible to estimate the actual cost to date of
anything but the civil works due to the paucity of information contained in
the records.
3.06         The scope of the supervision missions was limited.  Six of the
thirteen project sites could not be visited by Bank Group staff and thus,
many data are lacking in the records.
Credit Effectiveness
3.07        The Credit Agreement was signed on June 23, 1971 and became
effective October 26, 1971, almost a month later than anticipated,
following the establishment of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and
appointment of the Project Director and the Project Architect.
Project Management 5/
3.08        When the Second Education Project was negotiated, an
implementation management team for the First Education Project (signed in
April 1967) was in place. The Second Project required the official
establishment of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Because the
management of the First Project had been judged unsatisfactory, staff
changes had been suggested. However, no alternative qualified candidates
were found at that time. Ultimately, the Association agreed for the
staff to remain. Finally, the Director indicated he intended to retire in
1976, and the appointment of a new Director was expected to follow.
However, he remained in post all through the implementation period.
Planning and reporting continued to be limited and ineffective at all
times, as regularly reported by RMEA. Particularly detrimental was the
fact that a stock book was never established, making project stores
uncontrollable.
3.09        The First Project architect, an expatriate provided by the
Federal Republic of Germany, in office since appraisal, unfortunately died
suddenly in May 1975. He was not replaced until October 1978. When his
replacement left in the autumn of 1980, a locally established architectural
firm carried out the duties of the project architect. In May 1975 the
procurement officer left suddenly and his post also remained vacant until
December 1978. The project accountant was changed in October 1973 and
again in September 1974. Support staff was often lacking, and when in
place, their performance was not effective.
5/ Annex 1 shows the projected and actual implementation schedules and
Annex 2 the detailed schedule of disbursement.



3.10        Additional management problems arose from the great number of
separate entities involved in the original twenty project institutions,
i.e. eight different ministries. A Project Management Committee
established to formulate procedures for carrying out the project and
coordinate the work, consisting of five of the interested ministries,
failed to carry out its assignment and even to meet at regular intervals.
Periods of up to fifteen months have been reported to have elapsed between
two consecutive meetings.
3.11        It can be concluded that the ineffective performance of the PIU
and thc Managcmcnt Cocittee only compounded implementation problems
originating in the unfavorable conditions prevailing in the country during
the life of the project.
Physical Implementation.
3.12         The problems of project management described above reflected
negatively on the implementation of civil works. Starts were delayed,
progress was slow. Furthermore, scarcities and consequent price escalation
of construction materials had also a disruptive impact on this project
item.
3.13         Sites.  The selection and procurement of sites apparently did
not constitute a major problem. The location of four of the project items
was changed, as shown in Annex 1, without much difficulty.
3.14         The Unesco completion mission team in its two-day trip to the
country was able to visit only four of the project sites.6/ The only
serious problem encountered was lack of electricity connection for the
workshops of the NTC demonstration school and its general state of
dilapidation and neglect. During future education missions it would be
advisable for Bank staff to visit, if possible, the institutions included
in this second project - six of the project sites could not be visited
during Bank supervision missions (Annex 1).
3.15        Appointment of Consultant Architects.  It was agreed early in
the programme that specific consultancy services would all be provided by
private consulting firms in Kampala. At appraisal it was envisaged that
two or three of the Ministries might be able to provide some professional
services but later this proved not to be possible.
3.16        In November 1971, five firms of architects in Kampala were
appointed to work in project institutions.  Two of these were of expatriate
origin and three were of Asian origin. In July 1972 the expatriates firms
were declared persona non grata and two Ugandan firms took their place.
Four months later, only the two Ugandans firms were left. One of these
firms designed nine institutions and the other firm designed five
institutions.7/

Jinja VTC.
7/ One of these, the Pakelle DFI, was ultimately not constructed.

3.17         The appointment of consultants gave substantial problems to the
PIU. On June 9, 1972, the PIU requested approval of the two Ugandan
architects. After much correspondence, the two consultant firms' contracts
were approved on May 10, 1973. In February 1979 it was noted that the
architect for the Sacred Heart School (Gulu) had not visited the site for
eighteen months. The architect pleaded transport difficulties. Otherwise,
the competence of the architects can be judged only through the four sites
visited by the Unesco team (para. 3.18). Regarding quantity surveyors, the
two local firms (all Ugandan staff) appointed since the initiation of the
project seem to have performed very well.
3.18         Architectural Designs.  The Unesco team could only comment upon
its visits to four out of the thirteen surviving project items involving
construction. No structural problems or leaks were evident. The designs
were all sensible and economical. The standard of finish was fair although
lacking in some minor respects.
3.19         Tendering and Civil Works Contracts.  It was the customary
procedure when the original civil works contracts were signed in 1974 that
the prices should be fixed with no allowance for inflation. The rates of
inflation and escalation of all prices and the premium wages commanded by
the few skilled workers left after the expulsion of the Asians, proved
punishing beyond all precedent. Many contractors could not continue at the
contracted rates and preferred to face the possible penalties for breach of
contract rather than outright bankruptcy. Their problems included loss of
transport, impassable roads, unavailability of nearly all building
materials, and spiralling costs.
3.20         Retendering was proposed by RMEA in January 1976 -8for the
eight abandoned sites and retroactive compensation for the contractors who
were continuing their work on six sites. This was considered fair because
the continuing contractors would otherwise have been penalized in relation
to the new contractors. The Project Management Committee agreed to this
proposal in June 1976. The quantity surveyors were instructed to evaluate
the true losses of the continuing contractors and to negotiate agreed
settlements. The new and renewed contracts included price fluctuation
clauses and penalties for late completion. International tenders were
invited in the proper way with RMIEA approval. New contracts were signed in
most of the cases by early 1977 but some were not agreed upon until a year
later. For five of the sites the whole process had to be repeated and new
contracts were signed in June 1980. Increases of up to 756% were agreed
upon by the Government for the completion work on these five sites compared
with the originally tendered rates for such work.
3.21         In 1975-76 with the purpose of reducing total construction
costs, substantial amounts of imported construction materials were procured
in bulk by the PIU, stored in warehouses and released to contractors for
8/ Letter to PS/MOE dated 1.30.75 which warned also of the vastly greater
expense that would be left for the Government to fund: 45% compared to
30% foreseen at appraisal.

use in project buildings. The value of these materials was charged against
the building contracts. In 1977, after long discussions with the
authorities, agreement was obtained for the importation of cement, which
was becoming increasingly scarce in the domestic market. However, the
ineffective storage management, disruptions of the delivery and looting
after the war resulted in subtantial financial losses, the amount of which
might have exceeded that of potential initial savings. Some construction
materials were still in storage by end-1982.
3.22        Construction Costs.  The sole project item for which the Unesco
team could retrace approximate costs was civil works (Annex 3). The cost
overruns are appauling. If expressed in terms of Uganda shillings the
estimated actual cost of the 13 institutions which remained in the project
and which involved construction is almost 5 times as high as the total
appraisal cost estimate for the 19 institutions which involved
construction, or over 8 times as high if the deleted institutions are
excluded. In dollar terms the situation is slightly less striking and the
respective coefficients are 2.4 and 4.2.
3.23         Cost overruns of the magnitude described above could not have
been forecast at appraisal. Both domestic and import prices, because of
unforseeable circumstances, grew at much faster rates than it could have
been expected. For example, the consumer price index (base 1961) for low
income families in Uganda (sole domestic price index available for the
whole implementation period) rose from 147 in 1970 to 410 in 1975 and to an
estimated 10,058 in 1981. Although this index may not be appropriate for
estimating construction cost inflation, at rates of price escalation as
high as those which prevailed in Uganda during this period, the exact level
of the individual indexes and more so, the differences between indexes
become irrelevant. With regard to import prices9/, these also rose
extremely fast during the implementation period; at almost 11 percent per
year between 1970 and 1981 as compared with only 1.1 percent per year in
the preceeding decade. The element which explains the sharp differences
between the estimated cost overruns expressed in domestic currency and in
US dollars is the fact that while the rates of domestic and external
inflation moved so far apart from each other, the exchange rate was
maintained first pegged to the US dollar at USh. 7.14 to the US dollar and
later and until the 1981 devaluation pegged to the SDR at USh. 9.66 to the
SDR. The June 1981 devaluation brought the exchange rate up to USh. 80 to
the US dollar, and the rate continued to climb in the aftermath.
3.24        The above described developments fully explain the cost
overruns experienced by construction under the project and point out to the
fact that notwithstanding the reallocation of IDA funds, the Government was
forced to increase its counterpart substantially for this item.

3.25         Equipment.  Due to staff shortages and inadequacies at the PIU,
RMEA agreed to the appointment of a Kampala and Nairobi Consulting
Engineers' firm to prepare lists and obtain tenders for the procurement of
equipment and some furniture. This was a complex task as described below
in paragraph 3.26. The firm in question seems to have performed well.
3.26         Procurement of equipment was no easy task.  At the first stage
of tendering in June 1976, 32 firms asked for the tender documents but only
seven submitted tenders. A little later, twenty-five were invited but only
four replied and their bids were for only four of the nine groups of
equipment listed. In February 1979, the consultant firm reported on 699
different items tendered by eight firms for the Jinja VTC equipment. One
US firm was recommended for 23% of the items but three days later the US
Government imposed its unilateral trade ban during the Civil War. This
meant rescheduling and inviting fresh tenders for these items where the US
firm had been the sole bidder. By March 1979 the PIU was able to write to
the Tender Board recommending the fresh tenders but seven weeks later, the
consultant firm had to write to all tenderers indicating the letters of
tender were being held in abeyance: "We hope in the foreseeable future
that law and order will be re-established; will you hold your tenders for
sixty days?" Several firms agreed, but in October 1979 the border with
Kenya was closed, cutting off all imports through Mombasa. In March 1980,
RMEA requested the consultant firm to prepare fresh tenders for all the
equipment.  These were opened in November 1980.  By the end of 1982 some of
the equipment had not reached its final destination, other had been damaged
or stolen on delivery within the country. At that time, additional
equipment was being procured under the First Reconstruction Credit.
3.27         Furniture.  In March 1972 the PIU Director wrote to IDA to
inform that the Ministry of Works, Communications and Housing offered to
design and produce all the furniture, but IDA replied that in accordance
with the Credit Agreement, international bidding procedures had to be
followed. With the assistance of the consultant firm tender documents were
prepared and the furniture obtained through ICB.
Technical Assistance and Fellowships
3.28         The technical assistance and fellowships component is detailed
in Annex 4. The recruitment of experts was affected by the unsettled
conditions and, on two occasions, the international staff concerned with
teacher training had to be evacuated to Kenya. However, the success of
this latter project component was largely due to the continuity and
guidance provided by the Unesco experts and subsequently by the Ugandans
trained through overseas fellowships. In general, the fellowship program
for most components was successful and a majority of the trainees are still
occupying the post for which they were trained. In the process of
implementation of the project the number of man/years for experts was
reduced from 80 to 35.3 and the number of scholarships increased from 18 to
31.5 man/years.



- 12 -
Covenants
3.29        The Development Credit Agreement section 3.08(b) required the
Borrower to establish appropriate procedures for the maintenance of the
buildings, equipment and furniture. The Unesco team noted lack of
maintenance in two of the four project sites visited. Otherwise, all of
the covenants in the Credit Agreement and side letters were fulfilled so
far as it could reasonably have been expected of the Borrower under the
circumstances which prevailed in the country during the implementation
period.
IV. PROJECT OPERATING OUTCOMES
Attainment of Project Objectives (Annexes 4, 5 and 6)
4.01         Since the implementation of the Project coincided with the most
difficult period in Uganda's history, it is unrealistic to expect outcomes
comparable to those one would anticipate in a relatively stable situation.
However, the implementation of some components has been remarkably
successful under the circumstances while for others, their success or
failure will have to be assessed at a later date.
Teacher Training
4.02        This component consisted of the provision of the necessary
prerequisites to train secondary level teachers in commerce, agriculture,
industrial arts (all at the NTC) and teachers of technical subjects at the
UTC. At appraisal, the objective was to train 322 teachers within a
five-year period (1975-1979). Actually, 203 graduated in the above
specialities with the exception of agriculture.10/ Further, 60 teachers
completed in-service courses in teaching methods while another 280
participated in workshops and seminars at the two institutions. The
prerequisites, such as the preparation of programs of study and manuals,
the establishment of the Department of Technical Teacher Education (UTC),
and the Department of Business Education (NTC), and the development of the
technical section within the NTC, were all accomplished. Staff development
through fellowships was largely carried out as planned, and the majority of
participants returned to their designated posts. The above units are
reported to be operating satisfactorily with the capability of meeting
current teacher training needs.11/ Hence, the implementation of this
project component is considered to have been quite successful.
10/ Due to the unsettled conditions, it has been reported that it proved
impossible to recruit an expatriate agricultural education specialist
during the life of the Project.
11/ The NTC and the UTC were not looted during the war and remained
reasonably well equipped.



- 13 -
Demonstration School, NTC
4.03        The school was enlarged through the addition of facilities for
the teaching of industrial arts, commerce and agriculture. However, these
facilities appear to be utilized as regular classrooms with the exception
of the arts and crafts room.  In this connection, the electrical wiring was
never completed and whatever specialized equipment was received, remains
stored in packing crates after two years of operation. Thus, follow-up
action is required to ensure that the planned outcomes are attained.
Science Education, Upper Secondary Schools (S.5 and S.6)
4.04         The purpose of this component was to increase the output of
science students for entry into Makerere University so that eventually, as
graduates, they could replace expatriate secondary school science
teachers. It included extensions and equipment for four schools.!.&fThe
planned increase of enrollment by 1976 was 480 for these schools. However,
in 1982, the total number of additional science students had attained only
93.
Vocational Training
4.05        The Jinja Vocational Training Centre is expected to open in a
few months when electricity becomes available and supplementary equipment
is received. The specialists provided for this component served in other
units within the Ministry of Labour. Eight fellowships were awarded, seven
of which were held by persons teaching at the Nakawa VTC (Kampala). The
present administrative and teaching staff at Jinja consists of sixteen
persons. They are engaged in equipment installation and improvement of the
facilities. The teaching staff will be increased when the need arises.
The Principal does not believe at present that the Centre will ever operate
at the planned capacity of 680 places due to the lack of demand for skilled
workers and the related difficulty of finding candidates for training. In
this connection, the planned capacity was based upon an optimistic
projection that the growth of the industrial sector in the 1970s would
continue at the same rate as in the 1960s when, in fact, there was a
decline in industrial activity. However, with the revival of the economy
it is expected that the demand for vocational training will soon escalate.
Agricultural Education
4.06        Of the two colleges, Arapai had had no increased intake as of
1982, while at Bukalasa, an additional intake of 60 was reported.
Apparently the unsettled conditions in both areas has made the recruitment
of students most difficult.
12/ Of the four schools specified in the appraisal report, two were later
changed.



- 14 -
Farmer Training
4.07        It has been reported that both the Mpigi and Kabroron DFIs
would initiate operations in the first quarter of 1983. Here again, local
conditions may militate against achieving projected goals in the near term.
Health Education
4.08        The Medical Tutor Training College at the Mulago Hospital in
Kampala has been installed in the new facilities for over a year. There
were 15 enrollees in 1982 including 10 nurses and 5 midwives. Aside from
some problems with the facilities and equipment, the program has been
handicapped by the departure of the Director who left the college during
the war. He had completed a two-year fellowship and been awarded a
Master's Degree in Public Health at the University of Michigan.
Furthermore, none of the planned expatriate specialists were recruited for
the College. Given the circumstances, this component still appears to be a
viable operation with the potential of attaining appraisal objectives in
the future.
4.09        The Nurse and Midwife Training School at Mbale has not yet
opened. It has been reported that the school will initiate courses within
a few months.
Educational Planning
4.10        At appraisal, it was estimated that eight man/years of
specialist services would be required. However, almost twelve man/years
were provided, largely funded by UNDP.  The information eavailAh1p i
insufficient to allow an assessment of the effectiveness of thp
specialists. However, of the three counterparts trained abroad, the two
remaining in the Planning Unit appear to be performing well under difficult
conditions. Based upon limited findings, it is believed that this
component was well justified and that the outcomes have been positive.
V. BANK PERFORMANCE
General
5.01        Considering the exceptionally turbulent situation prevailing in
the country throughout the eleven years of the project implementation
period, the Bank performance must be considered to have been successful.
Changes in the content of the Project since appraisal were not due to
faulty design of the original project components but mainly to shifts in
domestic policies associated with changes in Government. Five such changes
in Government took place during the implementation period.



- 15 -
Supervision
5.02         The extent of the Supervision Missions was very much
constrained by the political situation and on several occasions by specific
instructions from IDA that travel to the country was unsafe for mission
staff. It was often physically impossible to reach any but the Kampala
institutions due to military or guerilla activities, impassable roads and
lack of vehicles or fuel.
5.03         The sites visited are listed on page iv of the Key Data and are
identified on the Implementation Schedule, Annex 1, by the symbol "V".
From this it will be seen that six of the retained project institutions
were never visited by an IDA mission.
5.04         The project was supervised by 18 missions.  The intervals
between missions varied from 2 weeks to 62 weeks with two-thirds in th'e 5
to 7-month bracket. The missions are listed on page iv of the Key Data and
shown in the time-scale in Annex 1.
5.05         RMEA was careful to ensure that conditions of tendering,
contract agreements and the engagement of consultants were always in
accordance with World Bank guidelines. The weakness of the Project Unit
made this often a most difficult task and RMEA had to perform more than
their usual duties to expedite these processes.
5.06         RMEA staff took particular trouble to help the project over the
exceptional problems and obstacles that impinged upon it. Bulk purchasing
of materials engendered a great deal of paper work and extra effort in
studying storage problems and framing conditions for this unusual activity.
This was extended to piirchasinv contractors' vehicles, plant and spare
parts. RMEA even had to assist in the purchase of livestock for the farm
institutes.
5.07         RMEA staff succeeded in obtaining an extension of the project
architect's contract. They gave considerable help directly to the
consultants working on the procurement of equipment. RMEA in several
occasions contacted directly the Minister of Finance to ensure he was aware
of the vastly increased costs that would have to be met by the Borrower and
also of the PIU staffing problems. They gave energetic and realistic
guidance over the issue of retroactive compensation to civil works
contractors (para. 3.20).
5.08         For obvious reasons the project was in the Association's
"Problem Project" category for most of its life. On several occasions
curtailment of the project was considered. However, it was decided against
such action, and to use the project as a means to maintain a dialogue with
the Government.
5.09         Under the prevailing circumstance and travel constraints, inter
alia, supervision of the project was carried out in a satisfactory manner.

Notes:  1. This missiom ws unable to obtain all the professional feo figures, but they m  be assumed to
have increased pro rata.
2. Final Costs of furniture and of equipment were also promised by PIU but have not bean provided.
This table is therefore the only comparison that can be made.
3. Comparison of cost and area per student place axe invalid because the teaching facilities were
expansions of existing facilities. The student dormitories and staff housing have not ben
coated separately.
4. Credit 983-UG was agreed in January 1980. PIU was authorized to spend from this on 0. 14.80 by
telex from R1A. To date, US. $ 2. 474 million haa bea  spent on the.eproject institutions under
983-Uw but only to replace war damage and loss. None of those furl" are incorporated in the above table.
In May 1982 the contractor for item 13 - Jinja VTC - submitted a cl-i- for an additional U.Shs. 2.5 million
over and above the figures shown here. This claim has not yet been processed and is too late for inclusion
in 258-TW funds.
