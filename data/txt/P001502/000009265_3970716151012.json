{"cdata!": "The purpose of this credit is to support\n            important policy reforms designed to increase the efficiency\n            and productivity of the industrial sector. It will also help\n            increase the capacity utilization of selected efficient\n            industrial enterprises so as to enable them to produce\n            incentive goods for the domestic market and to produce\n            products for export.  One of the project's major\n            components includes:  (a) financing of imports of spare\n            parts and raw materials for selected efficient, private and\n            public industrial enterprises. The funds (US$33.5 million\n            equivalent) would be sold to approved industrial enterprises\n            through the existing commercial bank network.  The banks\n            would receive a commission of 0.5 percent of the amount of\n            the transactions.  The project would further; (b) finance\n            equipment for the rehabilitation of a selected group of\n            enterprises; and (c) provide technical assistance to the\n            Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining."}, "docdt": "1984-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
