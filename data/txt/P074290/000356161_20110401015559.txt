INDONESIA - SECOND EASTERN INDONESIA REGION TRANSPORT PROJECT
 
P074290 
LOAN 4744-IND / 7765-ID 
Restructuring Paper 
 
1. 
This Restructuring Paper proposes to extend the closing date for the Second Eastern 
Indonesia Region Transport Project (EIRTP-2, Loan No 4744-IND/7765-ID) from March 31, 
2011 until September 30, 2011 (6 months) and to cancel US$6 million from the loan amount. 
2. 
Project Status.
 Project implementation is on track towards achieving its development 
objectives (PDOs).  Implementation progress is satisfactory, with 95% (out of a total of about 
1,800 km) of the strategic road network improved by end February 2011, and 91.5% of the 
original loan amount of $199 million has been disbursed.  The project is in compliance with 
all legal covenants and there are no outstanding audit reports.   
3. 
Proposed Changes.
 Two changes are proposed: 
(a)  Extension of closing date by six months from March 31, 2011 to September 30, 2011.  
This will be the second extension, adding up to a total extension of 27 months from the 
original closing date.  The current extension is required due to the expected delays in 
completing 13 civil works contracts (out of a total of 154) as a result of the delayed 
availability of the 2011 regional government annual budgets (DIPA).  
(b)  Cancellation of US$6 million from the loan. This will consist of US$3 million from 
Category (1) - (c): Civil works under Part A.3, and US$3 million from Category (4): 
Consultant services and training.  The date of the cancellation would be the day that the Bank 
received the Borrower’s request letter (3/9/2011).  This cancellation is based on the current 
estimates of the final project cost.  The revised allocation with cancellation is shown in the 
Attachment to this Restructuring Paper. 
4. 
The proposed changes will not affect the PDO, and the project scope, as revised in the 
first restructuring approved in June 2009, will remain unchanged.  It will also not require any 
changes to the results indicators, project components, institutional arrangements, financial 
management, and environmental and social safeguards.  No new contracts will be awarded.
