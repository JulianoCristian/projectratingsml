development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the approach\n            for supporting sub-national public service provision depends\n            on the stage of a country's decentralization process\n            and may vary over time. Advance procurement of\n            implementation support consulting services is a key for\n            success in Indonesia. Sub-national financing arrangements\n            need to be carefully designed to effectively support\n            sub-national components in Indonesia. The loan closing date\n            needs to take into account the country's fiscal year\n            start/end and budget procedures in Indonesia. Components\n            outside of the scope or responsibility of the implementing\n            agency have very little chance of successful implementation.\n            Initial civil works design quality has a significant role in\n            ensuring proper implementation."}, "docdt": "2012-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
