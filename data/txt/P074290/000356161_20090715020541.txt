           Second EasternIndonesia Region Transport Project (EIRTP-2)
                   Project Paper for Second Order Restructuring


1. Introductory Statement
   This project paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President to introduce the
   following changes in the Republic of Indonesia, Second Eastern Indonesia Region
   Transport Project (EIRTP-2), Loan No. 4744-IND, P074290, and accompanying
   amendments to the Project's legal documents.         The proposed changes are (i)
   cancellation of several technical assistance (TA) components, (ii)    Revision of the
   measurement methods of a few performance indicators (PI), (iii)reallocation of
   savings and unallocated funds, and (iv) the extension of the closing date by 21
   additional months. The proposed changes are in line with and will contribute toward
   meeting the original project development objectives of the Project.
2. Backgroundand Reasons for Restructuring
   The project was approved on June 22, 2004, and became effective on October 21,
   2004. The project development objectives (PDOs) are to (i)   improve condition of the
   strategic road network in order to reduce transport costs and enhance regional
   accessibility,  (ii)support     decentralization  of   planning    and   management
   responsibilities for works on Provincial and Kabupaten roads to the respective
  provincial and Kabupaten governments, and (iii)    increase the efficiency, quality and
   transparency of works procurement and implementation.
   The project has been performing moderately satisfactory (MS) to date with regard to
   the PDOs and implementationprogress (IP). A summary of past ISR ratings i s shown
   inAnnex 1. The MS rating for PDOs and IP are mainly due to the slow progress of
   the implementation of the civil works components. As of March 2009, 92 contracts
   representing nearly 1,600 km of road valued at IDR 1.839 billion (US$172 million
   equivalent) have been contracted, of which 45 contracts, representing about 590 km
   of roads, valued at about IDR 513 billion (US$35 million equivalent) are complete.
   This means the overall physical progress is about 37 % in projectedroad length, and
   20 9% in monetary value. The disbursements are about US$105 million, which is
   about 53 9% of the Loan amount (US$199 million).
   Given delays in implementation of both national and sub-national roads, the Project
   will require an extension of the Loan closing date.        Although the Project has
   significant delays in implementation, the bulk of the design and preparation of the
   bidding documents are now complete, and the Project is performing moderately
   satisfactory. The outcomes would be enhanced through the proposed restructuring
   associatedwith the extension of the closing date and the proposed changes.
3. Proposed Changes
   The proposed changes are as follows:

    (i)   Cancellation of three TA components. Due to the changes in the technical
          environment and policies during the last five years the following TA
          components are proposed to be cancelled. (a) TA for training support, due to

                                           2

    the difficulties in the selection process and GOI's new policy to use its own
    funds, not foreign loan, for internal training, (b) TA for establishment of Road
    Board and Road Fund, as the Government has put a proposal to the parliament
    to revise the current legislation (Traffic and Road Transport Law) to allow for
    the establishment of a Road Fund and i s waiting for the outcome before
    committing to this component, (c) TA for Traffic and Road Asset Monitoring
    System, as the MPW decided that the proposed system i s premature in the
    current technical environment of Provincial and Kabupaten roads.
(ii)Revision   of the measurement methods of two performance indicators. The
     following two revisions are proposed for refinement of the PImeasurement. (a)
     2c: "percentage of works packages reported by the RDSCs in environmental
    monitoring reports to Bapedalda" - the words "to Baledalda" will be deleted.
     This is because the Regional Design and Supervision Consultants (RDSC)
     does not report to Bapedalda (Environmental Agency in each sub-national
     government), and report to DGHon all contracts. (b) 3c: "Number of technical
     audits carried out by Inspectorate General" - the word "number" is to be
     replaced with the word "ratio", as the number of original contracts has fallen
     substantially, so the target i s proposed to be set at the same ratio (52 %) as the
     original target.
(iii)Reallocationofsavingsandunallocatedfundsrelatedtothemodificationofthe
    project structure. This i s due to the facts that (a) The Government has updated
     strategic plan for maintenance of National roads, which necessitates increased
     allocation for National roads, and also the MPW needs to provide special
     support to infrastructure development for the new province of Sulawesi Barat
     which was established in October 2004, (b) the project will have some savings
    by the design adjustments and low tender prices of Goods category, and (c)
     several TA components need to be cancelled, and (d) reallocation of
     Unallocated component i s intended to complete the National roads component.
    The proposed reallocationof funds is shown inAnnex 2.
(iv) The extension of the closing date bv 21 additional months to March 31, 2011.
     The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has examined the status of all the works
    packages and analyzed the factors to influence the further implementation,
     including the grant mechanism for ongoing sub-national works. It is expected
    that 15 National road contract packages (9 ongoing, 5 rebid and 1 not yet
     tendered) and 49 Provincial and Kabupaten road contract packages (27
     ongoing, 16 in tender process or to be rebid, and 6 not yet tendered) will not be
    completed by the original closing date (June 30, 2009). The estimated works
    completion i s expected in December 2010 *(the revised implementation
     schedule i s shown in Annex 3). This i s considered as the optimal time for
     completion of all the packages of Notional, Provincial and Kabupaten road
     works, and optimal use of Loan funds without exceeding the total Loan
     amount. The proposed extension of the closing date i s based on this estimate
     and the proposed action plan (shown in Annex 4) to complete the project by
    the revisedclosing date.

4. Analysis
   The proposed changes are not expected to have any major effect on the original
   economic, financial, technical, institutional or social aspects of the project as
   appraised. The proposed changes do not raise environmental category of the project
   nor trigger new safeguard policies.      The proposed changes do not involve any
   exceptions to Bank policies.
5. ExpectedOutcomes
   The proposed changes will not affect the achievement of the intended PDOs, outcome
   targets, or outcome indicators.
6. Benefitsand Risks
   With the proposed restructuring of the Project, there is no major risks that could
  jeopardize the achievement of the original PDOs and outcome targets including
   political, policy-related, social/stakeholder related, macro-economic, financial,
   institutional or capacity related risks.
   Fraud and corruption are serious risks in the context of infrastructure development in
   Indonesia. Both EJRTP 1 and EIRTP 2 have been subject to investigations by the
   Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency (INT). INT has ,substantiated a number of
   allegations which have resulted in the application of appropriate remedies, and some
   entities may be subject to Bank sanctions for engaging in collusive and corrupt
   practices. EJRTP 2 includes a substantial anticorruption plan, the elements of which
   aim to detect and mitigate such risks.

   Annex 4: Action Plans to Complete the Project by the Revised Closing Date

1. Actions for ContinuousFinancingfor Sub-nationalRoadsComponent
   a. The critical issue for continuing the implementation of Provincial and Kabupaten
      roads is the difficulty to extend the Sub-national Grant Agreement to maintain
      financing of Provincial and Kabupaten road packages. The original Grant
     mechanism was based on the MOF decree No. 35/KMK.07/2003 on Loans to
     Regions, and has continuedunder transition arrangements contained in the revised
      decree No. 52/PMK.010/2006. However, these arrangements are no longer valid
      under the new decrees No. 168 and 169 of 2008. A new Grant mechanism would
      need to be developed under decrees No. 168 and 169 of 2008, however, this
      process i s likely to take considerable time, and potentially runs beyondthe current
     Loan Closing Date.
  b. In order to speed up the process, it is proposed to continue to use a mechanism
      based on transfers from the Central Government, since the Road Law no.
      38/2004, Article 30.I d allows the Central Government to assist sub-national
      governments. The MPW has already set aside a budget of Rp.251.84 billion in
      2009 for the purpose of financing the Loan share of sub-national road works
      under EIRTP-2.

   C. The above action plan needs a mechanism to involve transfer of rights to work on
      certain sections of sub-national road components to the Central Government in
      line with the Loan portion, which will be returned to the sub-national
      governments at the completion of the works. The sub-national governments will
      continue to contribute their own share in line with the original Grant Agreements.
      The DGHwill be responsible for the usage of the Loan share funds.
   d. A statement of obligations including allocation of funds, accepting the Loan
      Agreement covenants including the Project Management Manual and maintaining
     the works on the targeted roads will be contained in a Declaration by each sub-
     national government.

2. Actions for Managing Implementation of the Remaining Works
   To ensure good control of the remaining works implementation including both
   ongoing and new contracts, the following actions will be taken:
   - Ongoing contracts will maintain their validity, and will not be split. However,
     they will have two sources of funds, namely the national portion (Loan share) and
     the Region's contribution (equivalent to the counterpart funds),
   - The contracts will be managed by a single unit, the "Work Unit" (Satker Daerah)
      who will be authorized by a decree from the Central Government for the Loan
      share, and from the sub-national governments for their contribution.
   - Supervision of the whole works will continue to be carried out by the Regional
     Design and Supervision consultant (RDSC) engagedby the Central Government.
