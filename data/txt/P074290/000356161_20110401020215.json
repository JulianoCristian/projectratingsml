The closing date of\n            the project extended by six months from March 31, 2011 to\n            September 30, 2011. This will be the second extension,\n            adding up to a total extension of 27 months from the\n            original closing date. The current extension is required due\n            to the expected delays in completing 13 civil works\n            contracts (out of a total of 154) as a result of the delayed\n            availability of the 2011 regional government annual budgets.\n            The changes will not affect the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO), and the project scope, as revised in the\n            first restructuring approved in June 2009, will remain\n            unchanged.  It will also not require any changes to the\n            results indicators, project components, institutional\n            arrangements, financial management, and environmental and\n            social safeguards."}, "docdt": "2011-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
