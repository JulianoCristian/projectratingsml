KINGSTON FREE ZONE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            Jamaica
Beneficiary:         Kingston Free Zone Company Ltd. (KFZC)
Amount:              US$13.5 million
Terms:               Payable in 17 years, including 4 years of grace at
11.6% interest. The Borrower would onlend loan funds
to KFZC on the same terms as the Bank loan, with repayment
denominated in US dollars.
Prolect
Description:         The proposed project would include: (i) developing
23 acres, complete with roads, power, water and
sewerage networks; (ii) constructing 80 shell factory
buildings and (iii) providing training to KFZ
management and staff and technical assistance for
foreign investment promotion.
By providing efficient factory lay-outs and reliable
infrastructure facilities and business-related services,
the project would help: (a) increase foreign private
investment; (b) directly create 4,000 additional jobs
when fully developed; and (c) induce investments in small-
scale satellite operations outside the free-zone to provide
services and supplies to the free-zone enterprises. The
risks involved relate to the possibility of: (a) a short-
fall in the Port Authority of Jamaica's and KFZC's cash
flow during the early phases of project execution; (b) a slow
occupancy of completed factory shells; and (c) uncompetitive
wage levels. The satisfactory financial outlooks for PAJ
and KFZC should enable them to obtain short-term bridge
financing to meet cash flow needs during the project develop-
ment stage. In the event demand for leased space slackens,
new factory shell construction can be slowed,
thereby reducing the risk of having unleased space. Exist-
ing wage levels are now competitive and the Government's
policy of maintaining a realistic exchange rate should
help maintain wage competitiveness.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR THE
KINGSTON FREE ZONE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$13.5 million for the Kingston Free Zone.
The loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 11.6% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
A. Introduction
2.        An Economic Report entitled "Development Issues and Economic
Prospects" was distributed to the Executive Directors in February 1982.
Annex I contains the basi6 country data.
3.        After almost a decade of sustained decline, the Jamaican economy
is beginning to resume growth. A new government, elected in October 1980,
is following policies designed to bring the economy out of its long
depression, and to correct serious structural weaknesses. According to
preliminary data, the Government has halted the deterioration and the
economy may have registered some growth in 1981.
4.        The fact that the Jamaican economy deteriorated over nearly a
decade is particularly striking as the country is endowed with natural
resources, has well-educated and skilled manpower, enjoys the advantage of
proximity to the large North American markets, and possesses a relatively
developed financial system. By the same token, however, it also suffers
from considerable disadvantages. The openness of the economy makes it
highly sensitive to international price and demand changes. In particular,
the lack of domestic energy resources makes the economy very vulnerable to
increases in the prices of oil; imports of this fuel provide about 99% of
Jamaica's commercial energy consumption. Its labor and capital are
internationally mobile, and massive outflows of both have occurred.
Recently, the burden of the external debt at variable rates has also made
the economy more vulnerable to increases in interest rates in international
capital markets. In the face of these external pressures, the careful
management of the country's resources simultaneously to promote short-term
economic recovery, financial stability, and structural reform, is the
central challenge to the new Government.
1/   Parts I to IV are the same as those appearing in the President's
Report for the Jamaica Structural Adjustment Loan.



B. The Jamaican Economy to 1980
5.        The economy of Jamaica was affected by severe disturbances during
the 1970s. The first years of the decade had repeated the brisk growth
performance of the 1960s, but the trend was abruptly reversed as a result
of external shocks and the impact of domestic policies. As a result, per
capita GDP declined every year from 1973 to 1980 and the cumulative decline
reached 26% by the latter year. On the external front, the increases in
energy costs in 1973-74 and 1979-80, the mid-decade recession in the
industrial countries that provoked declines in export volumes and in the
price of sugar and aluminum, and the increase in interest rates in
international capital markets, all affected Jamaica negatively. On the
domestic front, the Government's programs to tackle unemployment and
redistribute land coincided with the deterioration in the external
environment and eventually led to an overextended public sector and the
disruption of production; at the same time an increasingly populist image
of the Government destroyed the confidence of the private sector, both
domestic and foreign, contributing to reduce productive investment and to
increase the outflow of capital and skilled migrants.
Output, Unemployment and Inflation
6.        In 1980 total GDP stood 18% below the 1973 peak.  The expenditure
components of GDP ('for which estimates only date back to 1974) show the
impact of the policies pursued; consumption expenditures increased their
relative importance at the expense of investment expenditures.   The share
of public consumption expenditures increased every year, from 18% in 1974
to 25% in 1980; the share of private consumption expenditures also
increased initially, from 68% in 1974 to around 74% in 1976 and 1977, but
it declined thereafter, fluctuating between 63% and 65% in 1979 and 1980;
on the other hand, the share of investment expenditures decreased from 22%
in 1974-75 to 12-15% in 1977-80.
7.        The agricultural sector was one of the few sectors whose output
did not decline during the decade. Overall agricultural production
increased at a trend growth rate of .7% per annum from 1970 to 1980. The
major components, however, showed contrasting trends: while export
agriculture (sugar, bananas, citrus, coconuts, coffee, cocoa, and spices)
declined at a rate of 4.0% per annum, domestic agriculture (other crops)
increased at 3.8% per annum; these trends, to a large extent, reflected a
shift in the use of agricultural land: while between 1970 and 1979 the area
devoted to export crops decreased 27%, the area planted with domestic crops
increased 54%. The remainder of the agricultural sector (livestock,
fishery, and forestry) declined at a rate of .4% per year.
8.        The poor performance of the export sector was heavily influenced
by developments related to sugar and banana production. Sugarcane output
declined throughout the decade, from 4.2 million MT in 1970 to 2.7 million
MT in 1980. The failure of the 23 sugar workers' cooperatives, created in
1974 to cultivate the land that belonged to the sugar estates purchased by
l



- 3 -
the Government in 1970 (45,000 acres, or about one-third of the sugarcane
area) was an important factor; these cooperatives were never endowed with
the managerial resources needed to operate effectively, and as time went by
cultivation practices and discipline deteriorated sharply. Other factors
contributing to the decline were inadequate prices leading to the diversion
of lands to other activities, the deterioration of cultivation practices
leading to the spread of plant disease and reduction in yields and, in
recent years, the unavailability of inputs due to the foreign exchange
shortage. Furthermore, the sugar factories that were bought by the
Government (80% of factory capacity was eventually Government owned) were
managed deficiently and were progressively run down, compounding the
problems of the subsector. Output of bananas fell from 384,000 MT in 1971
to 69,000 MT in 1980. A major reason for the decline was the diversion of
banana lands to agricultural production for the domestic market, also a
result of inadequate prices. In addition, yields fell as a consequence of
the deterioration in the quality of services provided by the state-owned
Banana Company, the scarcity of inputs and equipment due to the foreign
exchange shortage, and--in 1980--the devastating impact of Hurricane
Allen. The problems affecting the production of sugar and bananas were, to
a large extent, similar to those affecting other export crops. Farmgate
prices were regulated by the external marketing organizations and, in an
inflationary environment, they lagged behind farmgate prices for domestic
crops. Besides, productive activities related to export crops took place
in an increasingly regulated environment characterized by the expansion of
the non-marketing functions of the external marketing organizations, that
now include direct involvement in production, supply of inputs, credit,
insurance, extension, and research.
9.        The role of the bauxite/alumina sector as a leading force in the
economic development of Jamaica came to an abrupt end in 1974. Between
1970 and 1974 the sector grew at an average real rate of 9.7%, continuing a
pattern established in the 1960s. Bauxite/alumina real value added fell by
37% in 1975-1976. Output recovered, particularly in 1977 and 1980 but even
in this last year sectoral value added was still 15% below the 1974 level.
Three major factors account for the decline in Jamaica's bauxite/alumina
industry: the tendency of aluminum producers to diversify their sources of
alumina supply, the 1975 recession in the industrial countries, and the
bauxite levy imposed by the Government of Jamaica in 1974.
10.       The most important factor was the imposition by the Government of
Jamaica of a bauxite production levy in 1974. Some--but not all--of the
other major producing countries followed suit; as a result, Jamaica's
competitive position deteriorated while Australia, Brazil and Guinea
improved theirs. Jamaica's share in the world bauxite and alumina trade
declined from 18% and 10% in 1974, to 13% and 7% in 1979. On the credit
side, the bauxite production levy increased more than fivefold the
Government revenues originating in the sector, from an average of US$33
million in 1969-73 to US$170 million in 1974-79. In late 1979, the
Government of Jamaica negotiated an agreement with the companies that
resulted in a reduction of the levy rates.



- 4 -
11.       Total manufacturing production peaked in 1973; by 1980 the
sector's output was 31% below the 1973 peak. The general decline of the
economy caused, and was fed by, the contraction in manufacturing; although
the apparent cause was the unavailability of imported inputs due to the
shortage of foreign exchange, the root of the problem lay in the shocks
undergone by the economy. Frequent labor unrest, unavailability of skilled
manpower (caused by intensified emigration) and the deterioration of the
country's infrastructure, compounded the sector's problems. The
unfavorable investment climate led producers to shelve expansion plans.
Although manufactured exports registered some growth during the period,
they did not compensate for the decline in the domestic economy. The
import-substituting-oriented industries set up in the 1950s and 1960s were
ill prepared to face the challenge of world markets. Besides, the
structure of incentives, resulting from a protective system based on
quantitative restrictions to imports, made sales to extraregional markets
less profitable than sales to the sheltered but limited CARICOM market, and
these in turn less profitable than sales to the domestic market.
12.       The decline in economic activity increased unemployment from 22%
in 1973 to 27-28% in 1979-80. Joblessness is even more acute for some
groups; the 1980 unemployment rates for youths aged 14 to 19 and for women
were, respectively, 60% and 39%. However, Jamaican statistics overestimate
unemployment compared to data from other countries because both the labor
force and the unemployed include non-seekers of work (those persons who
although not looking for work, wanted work and were in a position to accept
work during the survey week.) If this group is netted out, the official
unemployment rate for 1980 would be nearly halved.
13.       Inflation was moderate in 1970-72, but increased to 27%in 1973.
After a period of generally improved price performance, in 1978 the
December to December inflation rate jumped to 50% reflecting the impact of
the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar during that year and the elimination
of subsidies on some consumer goods. In 1980 the inflation rate was 29%.
Public Finances
14.       The financial performance of the Jamaican Central Government was
weak during FY73/74 - FY80/81, deteriorating sharply between FY74/75 and
FY76/77. Large increases in both current and capital expenditure--
associated with the Government's new social programs-- outpaced revenue
growth. As a result, the current account, which had registered a surplus
in FY74/75, showed a deficit equal to 6% of GDP in FY76/77; the overall
deficit increased from 8.6% of GDP to 19% of GDP in the same two year
period. As financial performance declined, the Government relied
increasingly on domestic financing, mostly from the banking system. During
FY77/78 and FY78/79 the Government took a number of measures to increase
revenues and control expenditures in order to correct the fiscal imbalance
and stabilize the economy. By FY78/79 the current account deficit had
decreased to 2.6% of GDP and the overall deficit to a share of 13.7%



- 5 -
15.       In spite of a program which in FY79/80 aimed to improve further
the financial performance of the Central Government, the fiscal position
weakened. The current account deficit rose to 4% of GDP and the overall
deficit increased to 12.4%. Current expenditures were higher than pro-
jected, in part owing to higher interest payments that reflected conditions
in international capital markets but also because of the Government's
inability to restrict wage increases and spending on goods and services,
some of the latter to repair flood damage. The financial performance of
the Central Government deteriorated further in FY80/81. The growth of cur-
rent expenditures was 20%, while revenues rose only 5%. Thus, the current
account deficit increased to 8.1% of GDP and the overall deficit rose to
about 18.1% of GDP.
External Sector
16.       In 1973-1980 Jamaica's balance of payments was under continuous
pressure. The reasons were: poor export performance reflecting
unfavorable conditions in the international economy as well as the impact
of domestic policies; a sharply rising oil bill provoked by higher oil
prices and a lack of exploited domestic energy resources; mounting debt-
service caused by increased recourse to public capital inflows aggravated
by the surge of interest rates in international capital markets; and pri-
vate capital outflows caused by the deterioration in private sector confi-
dence. By 1976, an acute scarcity of foreign exchange became apparent and
in 1977 and 1978, stabilization policies adopted by the Government and the
refinancing of commercial debt eased the shortage, although the situation
remained serious. But in 1979 and 1980 the balance of payments position
deteriorated significantly again, after the stabilization efforts
weakened,and the foreign exchange shortage became ever more serious.
17.       The current account of the balance of payments showed a
deficit every year during the decade. The deficit reached a high of US$335
million, 11% of GDP, in 1976. The principal reasons for this
deterioration were the decline in volume of the major export commodities
and the increase in the oil import bill. The volume of exports of goods
showed a declining trend after 1974. Primarily as a result of the
producers' reactions to the bauxite levy, by 1976 the volume of bauxite and
alumina exports had dropped 25% below the 1974 level, when they had
accounted for about two-thirds of export value. In spite of some recovery,
1980 export volumes of bauxite and alumina were still significantly below
the 1973 levels. In 1980 the volumes of sugar and banana exports were off
by more than one-half and more than three-fourths the peak levels of 1970.
The volume of imports contracted sharply during the decade, reflecting the
poor export performance and the adverse movement in the terms of trade.
Import controls were progressively tightened in an attempt to allocate the
increasingly scarce foreign exchange to priority uses. The volume of
nonoil imports in 1980 had fallen 61% below the 1970 level, and shortages
of imported goods, particularly inputs and spare parts were crippling the
economy.



- 6 -
18.       The large and sustained current account deficits in the balance
of payments were partially offset by inflows of official capital and losses
of international reserves. As a result, Jamaica's external debt increased
from US$349 million (17% of GDP) at the end of 1973 to an estimated
US$1,209 million (46% of GDP) by the end of 1980, of which the Bank held
14%. The debt service ratio increased to 16% by 1979. The ratio dropped
to 12% in 1980, largely because of the deferment of about US$100 million in
payments due. Losses in net international reserves also financed the
current account deficits; at the end of 1980 these stood at US$-532
million, including US$114 million of commercial arrears, compared to US$37
million at the end of 1973. Gross reserves had been reduced to about one
months' imports by the end of 1980.
C. Economic Performance in 1981
19.       In 1981 the Jamaican economy grew for the first time since 1973.
Real GDP growth is preliminarily estimated at 1.3%. Most major productive
sectors increased in response to the general improvement in business
confidence and the increase in the availability of imports.  Construction
(6%) was the leading sector, but important gains were also registered by
domestic agriculture and manufacturing. The sectors that did not grow were
export agriculture where output (and exports) of sugar continued to decline
reflecting the lack of easy solutions to the deep structural problems that
affect this crop (paras 58-63); electricity and water, where the frequent
power outages resulted in outputs lower than demands; and Government
services, where a reduction reflected the Government's policy of reducing
public sector employment to the extent of the attrition rate of the labor
force.
20.       Unemployment and inflation have decreased, the former modestly
but the latter dramatically. In April 1981 the unemployment rate stood at
26.2%, that is 1.7 percentage points less than a year before; during the
twelve month period 40,000 new jobs were created.   The inflation rate
declined substantially in 1981 as a result of the increase in the
availability of goods, both imported and domestically produced; the
December to December increase in the All Jamaica Consumer Price Index was
6%, compared to an increase of 29% in 1980.
21.       The fiscal position of the Central Government is improving in
FY81/82. Tax revenues would increase about 20% over the previous year.
The increase would reflect the growth in economic activity and better tax
administration, in particular increased collection efforts. At the same
time, receipts from the bauxite levy are expected to increase
substantially, in the last three months of the fiscal year, as a result of
increased bauxite production related to the US Government's decision to
increase its stockpile. Current expenditures are expected to increase less
than 10%, as a result of the Government's strict incomes policy, the
reduction in real subsidy levels and other expenditure control efforts.



-7-
Accordingly, the budgetary deficit would decline from about 8% of GDP in
1980/81 to about 4.0% in FY81/82. Despite some increase in capital
expenditures, largely reflecting an increase in capital transfers to meet
the financial requirements of the nonfinancial public enterprises, the
overall deficit is expected to drop from about 18% of GDP, in 1980/81 to
about 15% in 1981/82. The Government is financing the deficit primarily
through external sources (special balance of payments assistance,
commercial banks, and project-related inflows) and through other domestic
sources. In keeping with the IMF program the level of banking system
support will have been substantially reduced from J$485 million in FY80/81
to about J$140 million in FY81/82.
22.       In contrast, balance of payments performance has sharply
deteriorated in 1981 with a near doubling of the current account deficit to
US$410 million, or about 14% of GDP. This deterioration had been partially
anticipated, but export performance fell short of the projections made at
the beginning of the year. Exports of goods and non-factor services only
increased by 3% in nominal terms. Exports of bauxite and alumina grew
marginally because of the depressed world market. Production (and exports)
of the two major export crops, sugar and bananas continued the declining
trend of the last decade. Tourism, in spite of some growth, still shows
the continued effects of the adverse climate of 1980 and the depressed
levels of economic activity in most source countries. Imports of goods and
nonfactor services rose sharply, increasing by nearly 20% in nominal terms
and by 14% in real terms. Liberalization of licensing and foreign exchange
restrictions facilitated an inventory buildup, the satisfaction of pent up
consumer demand and the availability of the inputs needed to support
economic recovery. The volume of food and other consumer goods imports
rose by 41% and 35% respectively. Capital goods imports increased by 38%
in real terms and imports of raw material were also up sharply. The value
of fuel imports remained constant at the 1980 level; volume declined mostly
because of continued conservation efforts.
23.       Net capital inflows are estimated to total about US$325 million.
At the March 1981 meeting of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in
Economic Development donor countries and international financial
institutions pledged in special balance of payments assistance for the
Jamaican FY81/82. In addition, foreign commercial banks agreed to
refinance the Government's maturities due in FY81/82 and FY82/83 and made a
new loan of US$71 million to the Government of Jamaica. In spite of a
sharp increase in amortization payments, net public capital inflows are
expected to total US$277 million. Inflows of other capital have also
increased, primarily reflecting the sharp rise in no-funds import
licenses. As a result of the higher capital inflows, the loss in net
international reserves was held to the 1980 level, about US$75 million. At
the end of 1981 net international reserves stood at US-$607 million.

PART II - THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
A. OVERALL STRATEGY
24.       As described in the previous section, the Government elected in
October 1980 faced grave economic problems. The cumulative effects of past
policy decisions and the evolution of the international economy since 1973,
had led to a severe balance-of-payments crisis that reflected serious
structural deficiencies. This situation impeded the utilization of productive
capacity and clouded prospects for its expansion as well as for employment
creation. By late 1980, the crisis had pervaded all areas of the economy.
25.       The main problems that demanded the new Government's attention
included, inter alia, a productive structure which needed to be repaired and
reoriented, particularly in the agricultural and industrial sectors; a
potentially dynamic tourism sector damaged by social and political unrest, a
decline in service quality, and the international economic situation; an
acute scarcity of skilled managerial and technical personnel, particularly in
the public sector, mainly as a result of massive emigration in recent years;
an unfavorable investment climate for domestic and foreign capital provoked by
a high level of political rhetoric coupled with trade union activism and a
deterioration of law and order; and persistent and large deficits in both
public finances and the balance of payments.
26.       The Government's overall strategy is export-oriented and relies on
the private sector as the main engine of development. The strategy was
designed and adopted in two partly overlapping stages. The first contained
priority actions that could be begun within two or three months and was
supported by an Extended Agreement reached in March 1981 with the IMF. This
program focused on the need to reverse the economy's decline and gradually to
restore financial viability. Total IMF support amounted to SDR 536 million.
The second and longer term program is related to the proposed SAL. It
emphasizes actions to overcome the deficiencies in Jamaica's economic
structure.
27.       The first stage of the strategy is described in the Economic Policy
Memorandum attached to the Statement on Development Policies, and was prepared
in connection with the March 1981 agreement with the IMF. The main objectives
of this first stage were:
(a) To promote immediate increases in exports through the fuller
utilization of capacity in the bauxite/alumina industry, steps
toward the rehabilitation of tourism and of the sugar and banana
subsectors, and an increased emphasis on manufactured exports.
These goals were to be achieved by assuring the availability of
foreign exchange; reaching agreement with private sector firms
operating (or interested in operating) in these areas; reaching
agreement with foreign governments in areas such as double taxation
and bauxite stockpiling, and undertaking an active tourism promotion
campaign;



- 9 -
(b) To increase the utilization of existing capacity in industries
producing for the domestic market by providing the foreign exchange
required for importing inputs and replacement capital goods;
(c) To promote private investment, both domestic and foreign, through
the simplification of existing regulations and procedures governing
such investment, and the formation, on a bilateral basis, of joint
business groups with industrialized countries;
(d) To reduce inflation and to achieve financial stability by inter
alia, limiting wage increases; freezing public employment at the
March 1981 level; limiting monetary expansion and following an
appropriate interest rate policy; and maintaining a realistic
exchange rate, adjusting it if and when it becomes necessary to
ensure the competitiveness of Jamaican exports;
(e) To reduce the Government's involvement in directly productive
activities, except in the field of public utilities. To this end,
the Government has created a Divestment Committee that will seek the
orderly transfer to the private sector of productive enterprises
that are now Government owned.
Section I. C above, described the results obtained in 1981 through the
implementation of this first stage of the new economic strategy.
28.       The Government has also prepared the second, and in many respects
farther reaching, part of its economic strategy, that addresses the structural
reform of the Jamaican economy. As the formulation of the required policy
measures advanced, the Government began their implementation in a number of
areas. By the end of 1981, a substantial part of this second phase, the
Structural Adjustment Program, was already being executed.
29.       The program is described below under two main headings.  The first
-summarized in the following table-concerns aspects of the Program linked
explicitly to the proposed SAL; the second consists of other important planned
measures and objectives not directly linked to the proposed loan.

Savings and Investment
30.       As a middle-income developing country with a well-developed
financial system, Jamaica has the potential to generate savings to cover a
substantial portion of its capital accumulation effort. National savings
rates around 20% of GDP were not uncommon in the early 1970s; even in the
depressed conditions of 1977-79, private savings were always about 11% of
GDP. The rate at which the public finances are strengthened and confidence in

economic management is restored will largely determine whether the national
savings rate increases. Under the aegis of the program agreed to with the IMF
the Government is already taking steps to increase budgetary revenues and
limit the growth of public expenditures (para 33-35). Other measures to
strengthen public sector finances and mobilize increased levels of private
savings form part of the structural adjustment program. Under another action
program the Government seeks to increase after tax real returns on financial
assets and to eliminate obstacles to the development of capital markets (paras
40-41).
31.       Gross domestic investment also faltered during the eight years of
Jamaica's economic decline. Decreasing levels of investment reflected
declining investor confidence, a shortage of domestic counterpart funds and
foreign exchange constraints. As private investment slackened, the public
sector was unable to fill the gaps. Financial, managerial and technical
shortfalls led to project delays which exacerbated cost overruns .
Accordingly, measures to rationalize the public investment effort, and to
stimulate private investment have been included in the Government's program.
(a) Current Savings of Public Enterprises
32.       The Government is committed to improve the savings performance of
the public sector. In connection with the Central Government, the
Government's objective is to turn an estimated deficit on current account of
3.5% of GDP in FY81/82 to a surplus of at least 1% of GDP in FY83/84. There
is also scope to increase the savings performance of public enterprises
considerably, through tariff and price adjustments and cost reduction
measures. In FY80/81, the cash surplus generated by the 16 major nonfinancial
public enterprises was zero; eight ran current account deficits, the aggregate
of which represented over 1% of GDP. At the beginning of 1981 most deficit
enterprises were projected to continue generating dissavings.
33.       Action Program.  The Government is committed to eliminate the
current account deficits of selected enterprises in FY82/83 and to eliminate
all current account deficits in FY83/84. This will be achieved through the
implementation of specific programs to reduce costs and/or increase prices and
through divestment of unprofitable operations. Some measures have already
been taken. As of August 1, 1981, Jamaica Public Service Company instituted a
tariff increase in electric power rates of about 6% on top of the 1% monthly
escalation. On December 15, 1981 the Government decided to increase the
domestic price of sugar by an average of about 50% and further price action
will take place before the release of the second tranche. Significant
cost-reduction measures were taken in Air Jamaica, including the
discontinuation of unprofitable routes. The Government has prepared specific
action programs for Air Jamaica, Jamaica Public Service Co., Sugar Industry
Authority, National Sugar Corporation, National Hotels and Properties, and
National Water Authority.   Prior to the release of the second tranche the
Borrower will have prepared and approved programs for the Banana Company,
Jamaica Omnibus Service, and Jamaica Railway Service. The action programs for
the Sugar Industry Authority and the National Sugar Corporation will be
reviewed then, considering possible changes in the international economy
(mainly the EEC sugar price and the exchange rates of the importing European
countries). In addition, and as part of the program to achieve the financial



- 17 -
rehabilitation of public enterprises, pricing decisions have been left to the
managers of those enterprises (excluding utilities), and the Government has
stated its intention to reduce the relative importance of the budget's
contribution to financing capital expenditures. In this connection, a
quantitative target has been defined: the enterprises will be expected to
generate surpluses large enough to pay corporate taxes, debt service, and
contribute 30% of the cost of investment programs after 1984. Overall, public
enterprises have been targeted to generate current account savings equivalent
to 2% of GDP in FY83/84.
(b) Establishment of Functional Medium-term Lending Institutions
34.       A major factor limiting the recovery of indigenous private
investment is the lack of medium-term credit. Existing institutions have been
ineffective. The Jamaica Development Bank was created in 1969 as the
successor to the Development Finance Corporation, which had become
decapitalized through poor lending practices. JDB was supposed to be the
Government's principle institution for providing term capital to the private
sector for industry, tourism and agriculture. It was capitalized with
financing from the Government and external sources, including the Bank.
Unfortunately, JDB fared not much better than its predecessor organization.
Its poor record on loan recovery forced the Government to suspend all new loan
commitments in October 1981. JDB's function now is to administer its own
portfolio and that of several smaller moribund Government institutions that
lent for small business like SIFCO, formerly Development Venture Capital
Financing, and SEDCO, which was merged with the Small Business Loan Board.
The record of Government development lending to the private sector indicates a
long standing tendency in Jamaica to treat Government loans as
non-reimburseable financial assistance.
35.       Action Program.  The economic program attaches high priority to the
establishment of lending facilities that will make medium-term credit once
again available to the private sector. The Government has created two new
institutions, the Agricultural Credit Bank and the National Development Bank,
which will operate as wholesalers channelling their resources through the
commercial banking system. The Government believes that the repayment record
for medium term loans will be improved by placing the credit risk on
commercial banks. The Agricultural Credit Bank will become fully operational
before the National Development Bank. It has taken over the agricultural
operations of the now quasi-defunct Jamaica Development Bank. An operational
program has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Agricultural Credit
Bank. The National Development Bank is at an earlier stage of its
development. A Board of Directors and a general manager have been appointed.
An operational program will be prepared and approved by its Board before the
release of the second tranche. Preparation and adoption and satisfactory
program of operating policies and procedures which allow NDB to function as an
effective financial institution, capable of meeting the term credit needs of
the industry and tourism sectors, will be a condition to the release of the
second tranche. Terms of Reference for the preparation of an NDB operational
program, to be financed under the TA Loan, have been prepared.



- 18 -
(c) Public Sector Investment Program
36.       Public sector investment activities will need to play a
supplementary but critical role in stimulating economic growth over the next
few years. In keeping with the Government's focus on an expanded role for the
private sector, public sector investment will need to concentrate on providing
services and infrastructure that will facilitate expanded production.
Accordingly, the program aims primarily at stimulating nontraditional
agricultural activities, upgrading agricultural services, promoting the
expansion of industry and tourism through the construction of factory shells
and stepped-up promotional activity, and rehabilitating and upgrading basic
economic and social infrastructure.
37.       If the execution of the public sector investment program is to
proceed satisfactorily, a number of constraints need to be borne in mind.
First, the recent outflow of managerial and technical skills has weakened
project execution capacity in the public sector. Accordingly, most projects
need to contain a significant element of training and institution building,
while technical assistance available from external sources needs to be fully
utilized. In the past, the shortage of counterpart funds has constrained
project execution and contributed to cost overruns. It is therefore essential
that projects be selected against the background of a realistic financing plan
which takes into account the availability of budget resources as well as
likely external flows. In this regard, projects will be identified on a
reserve basis, so that the investment program may be quickly scaled down
should financing not materialize as expected.
38.       Action program.  The Government has prepared a public sector
investment program and financing plan for the three-year period
1981/82-1983/84. The investment program, which amounts to approximately J$2.7
billion and averages 14.4% of GDP, is consistent with the development emphasis
on export-oriented, employment-intensive sectors and the development of
domestic energy resources. The Government is committed to maintain overall
public investment expenditures below 15% of GDP in each year of the program.
About 23% of the program is devoted to investment in the directly productive
sectors and 46% to support economic infrastructure. About 25% of the program
is allocated to essential investments in the social sectors. In keeping with
the Government's policy of reliance on the private sector, investment in the
mining, manufacture, and tourism sectors will be left largely to private
investors. The year-by-year allocations of expenditures show the Government's
attempts to reorient its investment; while the proportion allotted to economic
infrastructure increases through time, the proportions devoted to directly
productive activities and to social infrastructure decrease.
39.       Of the total J$2.7 billion required to finance the investment
program, public sector savings 1/ would provide about 16%, or J$429 million;
on an annual basis, the proportion of public investment expenditures covered
1/   Includes capital revenue.



- 19 -
by public sector savings would increase from -8% in FY81/82 to +15% in FY82/83
and to +35% in FY83/84. This projection of savings assumes:
(a) real GDP growth amounting to about 4% in 1982/83 and about 5% in
1983/84;
(b) additional revenue measures in FY82/83 and FY83/84;
(c) nominal growth in Central Government current expenditures of no more
than 13% in 1982/83 and 7% in 1983/84; and
(d) substantially improved performance on the part of the nonfinancial
public enterprises, arising from rationalization of prices and
divestment of certain operations.
About 19% of the program, or J$522 million could be financed from other
domestic sources. Net external financing would be required to finance the
remaining 65% of the investment program. After taking into account
amortization requirements, gross disbursements of external capital on the
order of J$2.5 billion would be required over the three-year period.
Approximately 70% of this amount has been committed or is reasonably certain.
The remainder, amounting to about J$750 million, would need to be mobilized
largely in the form of quickly disbursing assistance. The Government has
stated the priorities of the investment program in Attachment "C" to the
Development Policy Statement. When the public sector investment program is
rolled over prior to the release of the second tranche, it will be extended to
cover FY84/85 and FY85/86. The Government is also establishing a monitoring
system which will enable it to track project execution and external inflows
and forestall bottlenecks.
(d) Promotion of Private Savings
40.       In addition to the measures described above to strengthen public
sector savings, the Government hopes to increase the confidence of the private
sector and hence its savings rate. Moreover, the economic program provides
for the financing of the Central Government through open market operations;
interest rates, consequently, have increased and are expected to continue
doing so. In this context, the Government is also committed to ensure that
sufficient bank credit is available for the private sector. Given the
Government's emphasis on the dynamic role of the private sector, it would also
be appropriate to assess the functioning of capital markets, with a view to
introducing the reforms that may be required to strengthen them.
41.       Action program.  Given the high progressivity of the personal income
tax, there is scope for increasing after-tax real returns on financial
assets. The Government has partially exempted from personal income tax the
interest earnings on deposits of maturities of more than one year. In
addition, as part of the comprehensive reform of the tax system, the
Government is undertaking a review of the progressivity of the personal income
tax. The review is scheduled to be completed by September 30, 1982. If such



- 20 -
progressivity were to be reduced, after-tax real returns on financial assets
would increase. The Government will also carry on an assessment of the
functioning of capital markets in Jamaica emphasizing the analysis of factors
that reduce the availability of risk capital. The assessment will be done
through a study, with assistance from IFC, that would be completed before the
end of August 1982; satisfactory progress of this study would be made prior to
the release of the second tranche.
Balance of Payments Management
42.       The Government is aware that the balance of payments is likely to
continue being the binding constraint to economic growth for the next few
years. In this regard, the structural adjustment program addresses the issues
of foreign exchange policy and attracting additional private external
capital.
(a) Efficiency in the Allocation of Foreign Exchange.
43.       It is an already stated government policy to ensure the price
competitiveness of Jamaican exports.   If this competitiveness is eroded
through excessive domestic price increases and a departure from wage
moderation, corrective measures would be called for. Given the acute shortage
of foreign exchange, achieving greater efficiency in its allocation is of
major importance. In this connection, the Government seeks to move to a
market-oriented allocation process.
44.       Action program.  A first step in the Government's policy is to move
towards a general open-license system for imports. The Government has already
taken several measures to increase the efficiency in the allocation of foreign
exchange. All legal sanctions to transactions in the informal foreign
exchange market have been eliminated, and the Fiscal Intelligence Unit has
been eliminated. In addition, the Government has introduced a number of
modifications to the import licensing system: administrative procedures have
been simplified considerably; the value of no-funds licenses issued has
increased substantially and the issuance of such licenses is automatic for raw
materials, spare parts, and capital goods; a system of special retained
foreign exchange accounts has been established for importers, and those who
operate under this system do not need import licenses; import licenses are
issued automatically for exporters that operate under the Bank-supported
Export Development Fund. The Government wishes to analyze the possible
introduction of an auctioning system for import licenses for certain low
priority goods. A study of two to three month duration will be conducted in
order to analyze ways of increasing the efficiency of the import licensing
system; satisfactory progress in the preparation of this study would be made
prior to the release of the second tranche.



- 21 -
(b) Attracting Private Capital.
45.       Private external capital played an important role in the economic
development of Jamaica during the 1960s and early 1970s. In the last eight
years, direct foreign investment dwindled and capital flight occured. The
challenge now facing the Government is to create an atmosphere conducive to
renewed foreign investment. A further challenge, as well as opportunity for
the Government, is to find ways to induce the large numbers of Jamaicans
living abroad to remit part of their assets and income to Jamaica. Interest
rate differentials, as well as the possibility of providing convertibility
guarantees, will have to be viewed from this vantage point.
46.       Action Program.  In order to attract private capital, the Government
has set out to restore an atmosphere of confidence in the country and in the
quality of its own economic management, as well as to provide appropriate
stimuli. The Government's strategy in this respect should go a long way
towards the restoration of confidence: as to the overall approach, it has
unequivocally defined a leading role for the private sector--domestic as well
as foreign--in the economic recovery process; in connection with the quality
of economic management, the Government has entered into an extended agreement
with the IMF and has adopted a stern attitude in the wage negotiations in
which it participated, contributing to a mood of wage restraint that is
gradually spread-ing throughout the economy. In order to attract direct
foreign investment the Government has launched a vigorous promotional campaign
through the creation of bilateral groups of businessmen that will identify and
develop investment opportunities in Jamaica. On the domestic front, the
Government has created the Jamaica National Investment Promotion Co., a
"one-stop" promotion agency that centralizes all relations with potential
investors. In order to facilitate the repatriation of Jamaican capital that
flowed out during the last decade, the Government has established a system of
foreign exchange accounts for importers, in addition to decriminalizing the
informal foreign exchange market. In order to attract migrants'
savings--potentially a major source of foreign exchange--the Government has
requested the Bank of Jamaica to analyze the options that are available. The
Bank of Jamaica is conducting a study that will be finished by the end of
March. A decision would be made subsequently and an action program would be
prepared before the end of September 1982.
Agricultural Sector
47.       The agricultural sector of Jamaica has the potential for rapid and
sustained growth. In the short run, the scarcity of inputs resulting from
the foreign exchange shortage is the limiting factor; but, like other
productive sectors, there are structural problems that will have to be solved
if recovery is to be transformed into sustainable medium-term growth.



- 22 -
(a) Land Use.
48.        Several complex issues related to land tenure and ownership
contribute towards the underutilization of Jamaica's agricultural resources.
The title situation of some private lands is unclear, partly as a result of
the inefficiency of the land administration system which is fragmented into
three agencies. Tenant farmers on government-owned lands are uncertain about
their future status and therefore postpone investment decisions. Another
difficulty arises from the fact that free-hold farmers cannot receive
appropriate guidance from the various extension services because land
resources have not been appropriately assessed and classified as to their
optimal uses. As a result, lands lie idle or underutilized. Finally, the
Government needs to announce its intentions with respect to the future
agricultural use of bauxite lands.
49.       Many small farms are located on hillsides.  These lands experience
soil erosion problems which require special cropping patterns and soil
conservation measures. The Ministry of Agriculture has introduced an
intensive soil conservation program, with support from FAO/UNDP. An important
element of the soil conservation program is the annual maintenance work that
follows the initial investment in conservation work. Unfortunately, very
little maintenance work is being done in the Jamaican mountains and
hillsides. Because of the heavy costs of the program and the urgent need to
help small hillside farmers, the entire soil conservation program needs to be
re-evaluated.
50.       The development of water resources is related to agricultural
development not only through its possible impact on agricultural production,
but also through its impact on living conditions in rural areas. Most
households in rural Jamaica do not yet have domestic water supply systems. To
date only some 85,000 acres are irrigated, and most systems are inefficiently
organized and poorly managed. Although the expansion of irrigation could be a
source of increased agricultural production, expansion of rainfed agricultural
areas would yield higher returns than expansion of the irrigation system. The
Bank's economic mission recommended that water resource development issues be
addressed in the following order of priority: (a) completion of water supply
systems for domestic use; (b) improvement of water management and more
efficient utilization of existing irrigation systems; (c) development of new
irrigation schemes for specific high-value crops where the supporting system
already exists; and (d) sewerage.
51.       Action Program.  In order to achieve a fuller utilization of
Jamaica's agricultural resources:
(i)  The uncertainty faced by tenant farmers on government-owned lands
will be reduced through a program to sell or lease those lands to
producers. The Government has announced that it is preparing an
action program for the orderly sale or lease of government-owned
lands, and has started to implement aspects of it. Satisfactory
progress towards developing a policy for the sale or lease of these
lands to agricultural producers would be a condition for the release
of the second tranche. The program is expected to be in operation
by the end of the year.



- 23 -
(ii) The lack of information on optimal uses of land is being tackled
through the implementation of a program of land classification.
MINAG has already put in place a work program that includes the
review of previous soil studies (completed), the implementation of a
detailed land resource inventory, and eventually a capability
classification leading to the formulation of land use policy.
Satisfactory progress of the detailed land resource inventory would
be a condition for the release of the second tranche.
(iii)  Regarding the control of erosion of hillside farms, the Government
has decided on the main features of the program, the main thrust of
which is the adoption of lower cost methods; some works have been
stopped, and others are being redesigned. Before the end of
September 1982, the program would be fully developed and approved by
Cabinet; satisfactory progress in the development of the program
would be a condition for the release of the second tranche;
(iv) In order to increase the agricultural area under effective
irrigation, the Ministry of Local Government in conjunction with the
MINAG is preparing a program to improve the efficiency of water
management and to develop new systems under well defined
priorities. The Ministry of Agriculture has chosen a strategy--in
line with previous Bank recommendations--that emphasizes the proper
use of microdams, and provides assistance to farm communities for
the development of small irrigation systems. The program will be
developed before the end of September 1982; satisfactory progress in
the development of the program would be a condition for the release
of the second tranche.
(b) Inefficiency of monopolistic external marketing organizations.
52.       Medium-term growth of the agricultural sector depends on the
provision of price incentives that make agricultural production profitable
vis-a-vis other economic activities. During the 1970s, agricultural prices
fell; within this declining trend, during the second half of the decade,
prices for domestic crops became relatively more favorable than prices for
export crops and, not surprisingly, export agriculture declined while domestic
agriculture grew.
53.       Two major factors can explain the movement of intra-sectoral
relative prices in favor of domestic agriculture: (a) the foreign exchange
rationing that led to reduced food imports, creating incentives for import
substitution in the agricultural sector, and (b) the differences in marketing
arrangements for export and domestic crops.   Export crops were marketed
through governmental or para-governmental entities that enjoyed monopsony
powers and regulated farmgate prices, while domestic crops were marketed
through a largely private system, in which farmgate prices were unregulated.



- 24 -
54.       Although the external marketing organization (EMOs) may still
have a part to play assuring a minimum return to small farmers, these
organizations seem to have grown beyond their optimal size, and their
dominant role over export crops is not consistent with an export-led
development strategy based on greater reliance on the private sector. The
functions of the external marketing organizations should be reassessed
with a view to: (i) eliminating their monopolistic privileges, including
their monopsony powers for external marketing, permitting competition of
private organizations; (ii) transferring their respective extension
services, to the national extension services; (iii) terminating their
involvement in the provision of credit as soon as the new system chosen by
the Government for this purpose (which includes the recently created
Agricultural Credit Bank as well as commercial banks) can take over this
service; (iv) reducing their involvement in the supply of agricultural
inputs and services, except when these cannot be provided through
commercial channels.
55.       Action Program.  Subject to conditions which are designed to
maintain minimum prices and preserve the quality of Jamaica's premium
export products, the Government has terminated the monopsony powers of EMOs
except those dealing with sugar and bananas, which are considered special
cases, and some specialized products in which Jamaica enjoys a de facto
monopoly. It has ordered management audits of all the EMOs. The
management audits for the coffee, cocoa, and citrus EMOs have been
completed. Since the proposed reduction in the non-marketing activities of
the EMOs must be accomplished in an orderly fashion to avoid
discontinuities in the provision of productive services or supply of
inputs, a series of studies will be undertaken on the sequence and timing
of the reduction of activities. Prior to the release of the second
tranche, satisfactory progress will have been made with respect to the
studies related to: (a) the orderly reduction of the non-marketing
activities of the EMOs; (b) the external marketing operations of the EMOs
for coffee, citrus, pimento, and coffee; and (c) the management audits of
the EMOs for sugar, bananas, and pimento. The studies of the EMOs will
take about three months to complete after consultants are engaged.  The
management audits are underway and will be completed by September 1982.
(c) Assuring farmers rewards for their work.
56.       Praedial larceny has a long history in Jamaica, but has become
more acute during the last few years. Crops are stolen by large-scale
operators and sometimes productive assets are destroyed in the process.
The issue of praedial larceny is of importance, because the effects of
future incentives on production could be neutralized unless this peculiar
form of crime is reduced substantially. Unless the Government is in a
position to guarantee that the farmer who worked his land will also be the
one reaping the benefits, the production response to economic incentives
will be weak. The solution lies in a general improvement in the
administration of law and order in rural areas.



- 25 -
57.       Action Program.  The Government has launched a program to
eradicate praedial larceny. New legislation will shortly be submitted to
Parliament, introducing stiffer penalties. Measures have also been taken
to simplify administrative procedures and accelerate the process of
recovery of the stolen goods. The Government will also increase the
deployment of security forces in rural areas, including the institution of
a system of agricultural wardens, of which 200 will be operational before
the end of December 1982.
(d) Long-term decline in sugar production and exports.
58.       Sugar production has declined steadily over the last decade.  As
a result, output in 1980 was nearly 40% below the 1970 level. This decline
reflected the inefficient operation of the nationalized sugar factories as
well as falling production in the fields, resulting from the dismemberment
of the sugar estates and the creation of sugar cane workers' cooperatives
that never functioned satisfactorily.
59.       Over the longer term, Jamaica may need to diversify its
agricultural production away from sugar and towards other activities that
are more profitable. Over the short- to medium-term, however, there is
room to increase this subsector's efficiency and output, contributing to
foreign exchange earnings and to the improvement of living standards in
rural areas.
60.       Action Program.  The Government has recently taken two major
policy decisions concerning, respectively, the sugar workers' cooperatives
and the operation of the National Sugar Company's (NSC) factories. These
decisions shape the action program for the rehabilitation of the sugar
subsector.
61.       The registration of the cooperatives (which all were quite
insolvent) was cancelled and their affairs are now being wound up. The
land is now being leased to three sugar factories which they supply with
cane. With regard to the government-owned sugar factories, two are being
closed, one before the start of the 1981/82 crop and another before the
start of the 1982/83 crop. The largest factory will be retained under
management of the National Sugar Corporation. All of the remaining
factories will be leased to private firms. Discussions are already under
way with local and foreign groups. Given the condition of the factories
and cane fields, it may be a year or more before all the negotiations are
completed. There is, therefore, a considerable but unavoidable degree of
uncertainty about any plans for the factories that are the subject of
negotiation, along with the associated cane fields.
62. In line with the Government's objective to eliminate the current
account deficits of all public enterprises by FY83/84, while at the same
time providing greater incentives to farmers, the Government has increased
the domestic price of sugar by about 50% and the guaranteed price
to farmers by some 27%. An additional increase in the domestic price of



- 26 -
sugar is planned, before the end of June 1982, in order to limit the
deficit of the National Sugar Corporation/Sugar Industry Authority to J$25
million in CY82, and is a condition for the release of the second tranche.
Over the medium term, and in line with the desired deregulation of the
economy, the Government's objective is to phase out price intervention for
the sugar industry. By November 1982, the Bank and the Government will
conduct a review of the Government's program for the rehabilitation of the
sugar industry.
63.       Besides these changes in ownership structure, the Government has
prepared an action program to deal with the immediate production problem.
The main objective for the subsector, public and private, is to achieve an
annual production of 330,000 tons of raw sugar. This action program covers
three areas: field operations, including transport and tractors;
factories; and personnel. Its main characteristics are:
(i) Field: The target of 330,000 tons of sugar will require some 3.5
million tons of cane. This will be achieved by farming 120,000
acres to yield some 30 tons of cane per acre; this area would
only be marginally higher than the area under sugarcane in 1979.
Critical components of the action program are: (a) to guarantee
farmers a price that covers their debt service plus a 15 to 20%
profit margin; (b) a program to assure the timely availability of
fertilizer and chemicals in each estate; (c) a program to assure
that estates have their own land preparation equipment or
contractors to assist farmers; (d) a program to assure that
estates have some reaping and transportation equipment available
to assist farmers with their deliveries; (e) a program of road
repairs to improve the condition of cane roads for the harvest
season; (f) a program for the irrigation systems, especially in
Clarendon, St. Catherine, and Bernard Lodge, to be brought back
to their maximum efficiency; (g) a monitoring system by the Sugar
Industry Research Institute of the availability of seed material
to improve yields; (h) a monitoring system by the Sugar Industry
Research Institute of the cultural practices and reaping cycle
for the cane; (i) the implementation of an incentive scheme based
on sugar yield per acre; (j) a program to reduce the heavy
incidence of praedial larceny and also to reduce the destruction
of cane by stray stock; and (k) the availability of spare parts
for field equipment. All these areas are being addressed by the
Government in cooperation with the All Island Jamaica Cane
Farmers' Association, the Sugar Industry Authority, the Sugar
Industry Research Institute, the Sugar Producers' Federation and
other agencies.
(ii) Factories: The key components of the program for the sugar
factories are: (a) to plan the timing of the crop to take
advantage of the best juice period and weather pattern; (b) to
minimize-lost time at the mill, through a system of planned daily
quotas, and also contributing to eliminate the use of oil as a
fuel through a more efficient use of bagasse; (c) to establish a
system to monitor the quality of cane; (d) a repair program with



- 27 -
adequate spare parts in place for the repair season; and (e) an
incentive scheme based on the planned throughput of each
factory. This program's measures will be reviewed within a year,
when the Government expects to have completed the reorganization
of the sugar industry and the subsector will have to find its
equilibrium at world market prices rather than guaranteed prices.
(iii) Personnel: The Government is aware that a sugar estates complex
can only operate successfully with on the spot dedicated and
efficient management. This is already borne out at the privately
owned Hampden, and Worthy Park factories. The National Sugar
Company will require some further upgrading in this area.
Regardless of any divestment, offers of assistance in the area of
technical and management personnel have been made by several
multinational corporations and international organizations. The
Government is identifying its requirements and will tap those
sources for assistance.
(e) Long-term decline in banana production and exports.
64.        Bananas are the second most important export crop in Jamaica, but
in recent years yields, output, quantity exported, and quality have all
declined. Exports have declined from 136,000 MT in 1970 to 33,000 MT in
1980 and an estimated 22,000 MT in 1981. This situation has resulted from
mismanagement of the Banana Company, shortage of inputs and materials,
deterioration of cultivation practices, insufficient protection against
plant disease, poor methods of fruit handling, an inefficient and costly
transportation system, and the effects of Hurricane Allen.
65.       Action Program.  The Government has developed an action program
for the rehabilitation of the sector. The objective is to increase output
and exports to a target (for the latter) of 150,000 tons per year,
which coincides with Jamaica's quota in the sheltered UK market (1981
exports will only cover one seventh of the quota). This export target
would be achieved with an increase in the area devoted to bananas of only
3,000 to 5,000 acres, that is about 5 to 8% of the area planted in 1979.
The Bank's Second Export Development Fund Project included a $4.0 million
component to finance inputs for the banana industry. The major components
of the action program are:
(i)  To increase the supply of basic farm inputs:  The Government has
allocated foreign exchange for this purpose. The Banana Company
imported fertilizers, spraying materials, and plastic sleeves.
These inputs are now being sold to farmers through the All Island
Banana Growers' Association.



- 28 -
(ii) To increase the quantity and quality of extension services
provided to banana farmers: Responsibility for the provision of
extension services to farms of less than 2 acres has been shifted
from the Banana Company to the Ministry of Agriculture. This
will allow the extension service of the Banana Company (14
extension officers) to concentrate on 3,000 banana farmers while
the remaining 18,000 banana farmers (most of which have mixed
stands anyhow) will be covered by the Ministry of Agriculture.
(iii)  To reorient the disease control system:  The Banana Company is
reorienting its disease control system emphasizing ground
spraying instead of air spraying.  Ground spraying equipment has
been purchased and made available to farmers.
(iv)  To divert banana output of exportable quality from the domestic
to the external market: There are two components to this
program. First, the Banana Company has increased the price paid
to farmers from J$.09/lb to J$.11/lb and, in addition, it has
instituted a quality premium of J$.02/lb. Second, the Banana
Company has begun to provide farmers plastic boxes, to encourage
cutting and boxing the banana fingers at the farm, thus hoping to
reduce-the proportion of export rejects at the packing house
level and creating another incentive to exports as opposed to
supplying the domestic market.
(v) To market export rejects in the domestic market: Under the
existing system, export rejects are dumped. The Banana Company
will start to sell rejects--on an experimental basis--in the
domestic market. If the experience is successful, it will create
an additional incentive for farmers to market through the Banana
Company, while at the same time offsetting upward pressures on
the domestic price of bananas that are likely to be triggered by
the diversion of output from the domestic to the external market.
(vi) To expand planted banana area: The Banana Company has negotiated
an agreement with an international corporation to expand the area
planted with bananas by at least 3,000 acres. Output will be
organized in large farms, and expected yields are 8 to 10 MT per
acre (compared to the current average of 3 MT/acre).
(f) Governmental institutions dealing with the agricultural
sector
66.       The organization of the Ministry of Agriculture both at the head
office and at the regional level is adequate. The nucleus of a unit
to plan, coordinate, and monitor development programs already exists, and
some of its components have been developed independently with external
assistance. However, given the large number of projects being planned or
implemented, as well as the large number of Government agencies related to
the agricultural sector, there is a need to strengthen the planning unit
and to reorganize the system. More particularly:



- 29 -
(a) the agricultural extension services should develop methods and systems
to transfer knowledge and information to a larger number of farmers; (b)
the field extension agents, need stronger support from subject-matter
specialists and other senior extension personnel; (c) the multiple
extension services should be merged under the Minister of Agriculture; and
(d) the specialized research units for bananas, coffee, coconut, and
sugarcane should be merged with the research service of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
67.       Agricultural credit in Jamaica has been channelled through a
variety of institutions, including the Jamaica Development Bank. The
comercial banks play an important role in agricultural credit, a role that
could be expanded beneficially. In addition the agricultural extension
service should cooperate more closely with the commercial banks in
implementing the credit programs and a promotion scheme for the credit
programs should be initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture and the
commercial banks.
68.       Action Program.  The weakness of agricultural institutions
severely limits Government's capability to design agricultural policies and
execute programs. The Ministry of Agriculture has already taken steps to
strengthen some of its units, particularly the extension service. The
Ministry of Agriculture has prepared an action program to strengthen
agricultural sector institutions; the program includes the provision of
extension specialists, financed under the First Rural Development Project
(Loan No. 1464-JM), to assist in the introduction of the Training and Visit
System; a program, partly financed under the proposed Technical Assistance
Loan, to assist local agents to prepare demonstration plots and train
extension agents at the local and regional levels; the redefinition of the
non-marketing functions of the EMOs, financed under the proposed Technical
Assistance Loan, possibly leading to the consolidation of their extension
services and research services under the Ministry of Agriculture; an
analysis of the trade-off between domestic crops and export agriculture,
which should be completed by September 1982; and finally, another program
financed under the proposed Technical Assistance Loan, will strengthen the
planning unit of the Ministry of Agriculture. Institutional aspects
related to the provision of credit will be covered by the action program to
develop the Agricultural Credit Bank into a viable financial institution
Industrial Sector
69.       The manufacturing sector has large unutilized capacity and can
make a rapid and significant contribution to GDP growth, employment
creation, and foreign exchange earnings. If, in addition, longer term
growth is to be viable, the deep structural problems that beset the sector
will have to be tackled. Measures to achieve the structural transformation
of Jamaica's manufacturing sector can only be implemented over the medium
term, but since an immediate output and export response is also needed,
additional policy measures consistent with the desired transformation of
the sector could assist the recovery. In addition, the lack of a
source of medium term credit hampers the chances of success of a growth
policy based on the leading role of the private sector.



- 30 -
(a) Lack of dynamism in manufactured exports.
70.       Manufactured exports (as well as other non-traditional exports)
have not performed dynamically during recent years, the main reason being
a structure of protection based on quantitative restrictions to imports
(QRs) that penalizes sales to external markets --particularly those outside
the CARICOM region -- and distorts the internal allocation of
resources. QRs apply mostly to consumer goods; of 364 items subject to QRs,
82% correspond to consumer goods, 7% to intermediate goods, and the
remaining 11% to capital goods. QRs do not affect significantly the
availability of producer's goods for export industries that, by and large,
have access to them at international prices. However, since domestic
production of protected goods can be sold to the domestic market at prices
substantially higher than international prices, the system of incentives is
biased against exports.   Effective protection coefficients, that measure
the extent to which domestic value added can exceed value added measured at
international prices, show that for the manufacturing sector as a whole
effective protection was 50% in 1978. A breakdown of this coefficient
according to the geographical destination of sales shows that sales to the
domestic market had the highest effective protection (68%), followed by
sales to the CARICOM market (19%), while sales to extraregional markets had
negative effective protection (-10%).   Thus, although the existing
industrial structure could possibly supply a rapid output response until
capacity utilization is nearly full, it does not provide an adequate
foundation for longer-term growth, in view of the limited size of the
domestic and CARICOM markets.   The key issue is to undo the anti-export
bias of inward-looking policies while reducing the intersectoral
differences in effective protection.
71.       Action program.  The Government has already taken several
measures in support of the development of manufactured exports, such as:
(a) the creation of the EDF, financed by the Bank and the IDB, that assures
the availability of foreign exchange to finance imported inputs used by
exporters; (b) the creation of the Kingston Free Zone, providing economic
infrastructure, in a free trade environment, for the functioning of enclave
type industries; (c) the liberalization of the import licensing system,
including the provision of automatic licenses to EDF users; (d) increased
activity by two effective public sector organizations such as the Jamaica
National Export Corporation (a promotional agency) and the Jamaica Export
Trading Company (a trading house). The Government is also committed to
maintain a competitive exchange rate. The Government has also agreed to
terms of reference to prepare an action program on export incentives, to be
put in place in 1982.
72.       Over the medium term, instilling dynamism to manufactured exports
requires undoing the anti-export bias resulting from past policies. In
Jamaica, this calls for the elimination of quantitative restrictions to
imports--presently the main form of protection--and, instead, making the
CARICOM Common External Tariff fully operational. The Government considers
that the reform of the system of protection is a major component of the
shift to an export oriented development strategy, but wishes to effect it
gradually in order to avoid possible adverse consequences in the short run.



- 31 -
73.       The Government is committed to eliminating the QRs gradually over
a five year period. The following schedule has been agreed to:
Schedule for elimination of QRs
Date                  Number of
Items
February 7, 1982        64
January  1983           61
January  1984           61
January  1985           86
January  1986           46
January  1987           46
Total              364
74.       The Government has announced the policy of gradually phasing out
all QRs, except those related to national security or social reasons. The
Government feels that in order to go beyond the first round of elimination
there is a need to conduct studies to detect which domestic industries
might be severely affected and, in some cases, to introduce temporary
tariff surcharges or excise taxes, as well as to decide on the specific
sequences in which QRs would be eliminated. The criteria governing the
choice of the specific sequence will be: a) to achieve an even distribution
of the short term disturbances that the implementation of the new policy
might cause on production and employment levels; and b) to emphasize during
the early years of the program the elimination of QRs on intermediate and
capital goods. Completion of these studies would take place prior to the
preparation of the list of QRs to be eliminated in January 1983.
75.       The gradual elimination of QRs will only have an impact on
exports over the medium term. In the meantime, the Government of Jamaica
has agreed to the preparation of an action program for the promotion of
non-traditional exports (including agricultural goods), that will be
completed before the release of the second tranche of the proposed SAL.
The action program would include three classes of measures: (a) measures to
increase the availability of foreign exchange to exporters, possibly
through the extension of the system of retained foreign exchange accounts
to all exporters; (b) the provision of fiscal incentives to exports outside
CARICOM; and (c) possible modifications to the export financing systems.



- 32 -
76. In order to create sources of medium term financing for the
development of the manufacturing sector, the Government has created the
National Development Bank, that will function as a second-tier lending
institution. The action program to establish the National Development Bank
was discussed in paragraphs 34-35.
(b) Rationalization of specific industrial subsectors
(garments, footwear, construction materials).
77.       There is a need for the rationalization of certain industrial
subsectors. The Government has selected three: garments, footwear,
construction materials. The first two have been selected by the Government
because the country is believed to possess a comparative advantage in them
and the export drive would thus be reinforced. The construction materials
subsector is considered important in connection with the intensified
investment effort that the country will make over the next few years.
78.       Action Program.  The objective is to develop exports and, at the
same time, reduce the prices of these products for domestic consumers.
These subsectors would operate in a free trade atmosphere as far as access
to inputs is concerned, and would be allowed to compete in the domestic
market under the CARICOM Common External Tariff. The Government is
preparing specific programs for each subsector. Satisfactory progress in
the development of the specific action programs would be made prior to the
release of the second tranche and implementation of the program begun
before the end of the year. Depending on the results obtained in these
subsectors, the scheme might be extended to other subsectors.
C. THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT POLICIES AND THE EXTENDED
AGREEMENT WITH THE IMF
79.       The policies and actions related to the proposed SAL are fully
consistent with the objectives and commitments undertaken as part of the
Extended Agreement between the Government of Jamaica and the IMF. The
overall objective is the same in both cases: economic recovery and
sustained growth through the adoption of an export oriented strategy that
emphasizes the dynamic role of the private sector. There is, however, a
difference in emphasis. The Extended Agreement with the IMF places
more emphasis on short to medium term issues, while the structural
adjustment policies adopted as part of the proposed SAL places more
emphasis on medium to longer term issues.
80.       Some of the action programs that make up the proposed SAL refer
to policy areas that were not covered under the Extended Agreement with the
IMF. The remainder are policy areas that were covered under the Extended
Agreement, but are now being defined with greater detail or more
specificity. The action programs that are entirely new under the proposed
SAL are: (a) establishment of functional medium term lending institutions
(paras. 34-35); (b) increasing efficiency in the allocation of foreign
exchange through the possible introduction of an auctioning system for
import licences (paras. 43-44); (c) attraction of private capital through
the possible establishment of a scheme to attract migrants' savings



- 33 -
(paras. 45-46); (d) fuller utilization of agricultural lands (paras.
48-51); (e) elimination of praedial larceny (paras. 56-57); (f)
rehabilitation of the sugar industry (paras. 58-63)1/; (g) rehabilitation
of the banana industry (paras. 64-65) 1/; (h) strengthening of agricultural
institutions (paras. 66-68); and rationalization of certain industrial
subsectors (paras. 77-78).
81.       In those policy areas that are common to both the proposed SAL
and the Extended Agreement with the IMF, the Government is now undertaking
further commitments, made possible because greater knowledge has been
accumulated, or because it is now possible to focus on longer term issues
and to identify measures with greater detail. For those policy areas the
EFF and SAL may be compared as follows:
(a) Savings of Public Enterprises
EFF. The Government stated its objective of requiring public
enterprises to operate efficiently and its intention to limit
budget support to these entities. The Government also set forth
its intention to divest itself of commecial-type public
enterprises and made reference to programs to rehabilitate Air
Jamaica and the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation.
SAL. Action programs for eight public enterprises have been
identified, five of which have already been prepared and are now
being implemented. The Government committed itself to
eliminate the current account deficits of all major public
enterprises and to restrict its share of investment expenditures
of public enterprises to no more than 30% of total investment
costs by its fiscal year 1983/84. Pricing decisions have been
delegated to managers of public enterprises other than utilities.
(b) The Public Sector Investment Program.
EFF. The Government stated that it would prepare a public sector
investment program with the assistance of the Bank.
SAL. A public sector investment program was prepared as part of
the SAL, a monitoring system is being put in place and the
Government is committed to rolling over the program annually.
1/   The objective of increasing output of this crop was stated under the
Extended Agreement, but no detailed action program was spelled out.



- 34 -
(c) Promotion of Domestic Savings.
EFF. The Government agreed to a thorough review of the tax
system, with a view to increasing revenues, as well as to remove
possible disincentives to savings.
SAL. An analysis is to be made of the obstacles to the
development of capital markets, particularly those that might
hinder private savings.
(d) External Marketing Organizations.
EFF. The Government agreed to the termination of the monopsony
powers of the external marketing organizations.
SAL. Provision is made to make six management audits of the
external marketing organizations, three of which have been
completed. In addition, a program of studies will be undertaken
to reduce the non-marketing functions of the external marketing
organizations.
(e) Quantitative Restrictions.
EFF. The Government made a commitment not to introduce any new
quantiative restrictions on imports.
SAL. The Government is committed to eliminate all QRs within a
five year period and to prepare an action program for the
development of non-traditional exports.
D. OTHER STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS
Bauxite and Alumina Industry
82.       Jamaica's endowment of bauxite resources, with reserves
equivalent to 130 years' output, permits further expansion of the bauxite
and alumina industry. But, over the medium term, export growth will have
to be mostly in the form of alumina, since international trade is now
geared towards taking alumina rather than bauxite, as a consequence of the
rise in shipping costs that followed the increases in energy prices during
the 1970s. In the short run, however, Jamaica's potential for increasing
the volume of alumina production and exports is rather limited, because the
existing reduction plants are operating close to their effective
capacity utilization limits, estimated at 92% in 1980. Therefore,
increased alumina exports will require substantial investments involving at
least a three-year gestation period. Output of bauxite, on the other hand,
could increase rapidly with only minor investments but the international
marketing of the bauxite might be difficult.



- 35 -
83.       Enhancing the competitiveness of Jamaica's bauxite and alumina
industry is a major Government objective. Presently, Jamaica has three
major advantages over other bauxite and alumina producing countries. One
is its proximity to the United States and Canadian markets, which account
for more than one-third of the world's bauxite and alumina imports. The
second is the ease of mining bauxite, with virtual absence of overburden.
Finally, Jamaica has a good inland transportation system and the mines are
close to ports.
84.       Jamaica's disadvantages--compared to other major producing
countries--are the lack of exploited indigenous energy sources, a higher
production levy, the lower alumina content of the bauxite, and the chemical
composition of the mineral which requires higher temparatures in the
refining process. Energy costs, which in Jamaica move pari passu with the
price of imported oil, are thus a major factor in the economic viability of
the local alumina industry. The bauxite production levy is another impor-
tant factor.  From 1974, when the levy was introduced, through 1979, when
the levy was reduced, Jamaica became an unattractive location from the view
point of the industry: production declined and no new investments were
made. In 1980, with a lower levy, alumina production increased and in
early 1981, with a new domestic political and economic environment, new
investments were being planned.
85.       This suggests that, given the level of the levy, cost considera-
tions are of paramount importance for new alumina plants. Minimization of
energy costs, then, becomes a crucial issue; in this connection, the sub-
stitution of coal for fuel oil merits serious consideration. Such a sub-
stitution, if profitable, would enhance the attractiveness of Jamaica as a
location for the alumina industry. If coal is a more profitable energy
option for the new investments, retrofitting to coal the existing plants
could also be profitable, given the economies of scale involved in the
expansion of ports, in loading and unloading devices, and in the inland
transportation system. Preliminary studies comparing fuel-oil versus coal
in the expansion of an alumina plant indicate that at the relative prices
prevailing in early 1981, the coal option would have a payback period bet-
ween 4 and 5 years.
86.       Action Program.  The major objectives of the Government in the
bauxite/alumina sector are: (i) to increase bauxite production and find
suitable markets for it; (ii) to expand alumina production capacity and
exports; (iii) to develop new markets.
87.       Inasmuch as most of the world's bauxite is traded within
integrated companies, and international commitments assumed by the
Government of Jamaica under the International Bauxite Association preclude
an aggressive pricing policy, increasing bauxite exports in the short run
is a difficult task. The authorities are following a four-way approach.
First, they are negotiating with the bauxite companies to use more Jamaican
bauxite for their production of aluminum and also to increase their sales
to third parties. As yet, however, there is no indication that the
companies' policy of geographical diversification of mineral sources will



- 36 -
change, or that the processing capacity of their North American plants
will increase. Second, the Government is concentrating on the EEC Market,
where it benefits from the Lome II Agreement. Third, the authorities are
approaching international brokerage firms to place some of Jamaica's
bauxite. Finally, the Government has sought to sell bauxite to the United
States strategic stockpile. The US Government has agreed to purchase 1.6
million tons of bauxite in its FY81/82.
88.       The Government is holding discussions with the companies on an
individual basis with a view to increase alumina production capacity.
Priority is being given to the expansion of existing facilities as opposed
to new plants, so as to reduce the time lag involved in bringing new
capacity on stream as well as to minimize investment costs. The Government
is offering investment incentives in the form of a rebate on the production
levy to be granted on a case by case basis. Negotiations are now under way
to expand the Jamalco plant from 550,000 MT/Y to 900,000 MT/Y. The
restoration of Alpart's capacity from 1.1 to 1.2 m MT/Y is also being
negotiated. At the same time, the Government has deferred the decision on
a government-owned 600,000 MT/Y alumina processing plant at South
Manchester, until the negotiations with the alumina companies are
completed.
89.       With regard to the development of new markets, the Government is
closely monitoring the possible construction of an aluminum smelter in
Trinidad and Tobago, which could be partly supplied with Jamaican alumina.
In addition, the Government has already signed a seven-year contract with
the USSR for the supply of 250,000 MT/Y from 1984 through 1990. Other new
markets are being sought.
Tourism
90.       The tourist sector has large unutilized capacity and can make a
rapid recovery contributing to foreign exchange earnings and employment
creation. A major issue is the public ownership of hotel properties. It
is the expressed objective of the Government to divest as many of the
currently owned hotel properties as possible, in line with its general
objective of distancing itself from commercial operations.
91. Availability of medium-term credit--at nonsubsidized rates--is a major
factor affecting the growth prospects of the sector. During recent years
medium-term credit was available only from foreign commercial banks, in
small quantities and at high cost, since lenders were reluctant to increase
their exposure in Jamaica and the Jamaica Development Bank was inactive.
The establishment of an operational source of medium-term credit (paragaphs
34-35) is quite relevant from the point of view of the tourism sector.
92.       Achievement of the growth targets defined by the Government will
require a major advertising and promotional effort, particularly at the
beginning, when the negative impact of the turmoil of 1980 will have to be
overcome in the context of a less than buoyant market for international
tourism. The Tourist Board should be adequately funded for this purpose.



- 37 -
93.       Action Program.  The Government's strategy in the tourism sector
is directed at rapidly decreasing the Government's involvement in the
direct operation of hotel properties and creating an atmosphere conducive
to the private development of the sector. The Government is presently
conducting its strategy in two stages; in the first stage, the hotels are
returned to private operation through a lease or management contract;
in the second stage, after a few years, the hotels would be sold. This
approach avoids the sale of properties at a time when the depressed
condition of the tourism market would be reflected in prices. In addition,
the longer period would furnish domestic tourism operators more opportunity
to place competitive bids. The Government has also launched a major
promotional effort through increased funding to the Tourist Board. The
establishment of the National Development Bank should help meet the
sector's requirements for medium-term credit.
Energy
94.       Jamaica's effectiveness in tackling its energy problem will have
a large bearing on the medium-term performance of the economy. Presently,
bagasse is virtually the only exploited domestic energy resource; as a
result, imported oil must cover over 90% of the island's total energy
consumption, or 99% of commercial energy consumption (the remaining 1%
being hydroelectric power). Oil imports are therefore high; in 1980 they
totalled 15.6 million barrels, with a foreign exchange cost of US$470
million, or 39% of merchandise imports and 16% of GDP. Given that the
balance of payments is, and is likely to continue being, the binding
constraint to Jamaica's economic growth, the connection between energy
consumption and economic performance is inescapable.
95.       Jamaica's domestic energy resources have never been fully
assessed. The limited information now available suggests that Jamaica's
energy resources are modest, and even if exploitation turns out to be
economically feasible, long lead times will be involved before commercial
production reaches a substantial scale. Identified or possible energy
resources are: (a) the Blue Mountain hydroelectric scheme, (b) other
(micro) hydroelectric sources, (c) peat, (d), oil, both onshore and
offshore, and (e) non-conventional sources, like biomass, solar energy,
ocean thermal energy conversion, etc.
96.       Energy conservation through a major demand management effort is
the only approach to Jamaica's energy problem that can yield results in a
relatively short period. The Government's program attaches a major role to
energy conservation. The issues involved in a major conservation effort
comprise both pricing policies and other energy conservation measures.
Jamaica has already had some successful experiences in both aspects of
energy conservation.
97.       Action Program.  The thrust of the Government's development
strategy in the energy sector is to reduce reliance on imported petroleum
through the promotion of energy conservation and the development of
indigenous energy sources.



- 38 -
98.       In the area of energy conservation, the Government is pursuing a
policy of realistic pricing for energy products. All subsidies on
petroleum products have been eliminated, and, with the exceptions of fuel
oil and marine diesel, prices for petroleum products sold in the inland
market are controlled by the Government. Sales to the international sector
are made at international prices. At the final consumer level, price
differentials between gasoline and medium distillates have traditionally
been high, because of taxation. The Government determines inland prices
through a price fixation formula based on Caribbean quotations that has
permitted full recovery of costs. In order to even out short-term price
fluctuations of crude prices, a "stabilization" levy on all petroleum
products was introduced in 1977.
99.       With assistance of USAID, the Government has developed an energy
conservation plan that seeks to set up lines of credit for energy saving
activities, to assist consumers with energy auditing and retrofitting, and
to strengthen the capability of Ministry of Mining and Energy to plan and
monitor the program. The major sources of increases in energy efficiency
of the Jamaican economy would be in the energy-intensive industries. As
indicated above (Paragraph 85) the bauxite/alumina industry has the option
of converting to coal. The rehabilitation of the cement plant includes
improving fuel efficiency in heating processes and substitution of more
efficient fuels in electricity generation; the feasibility of retrofitting
to coal is also being considered. In addition, through the rehabilitation
and upgrading of transmission and distribution networks operated by the
Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSC), as well as through improved
maintenance, the Government hopes to effect substantial fuel savings. The
Bank is currently considering a loan to JPSC for this purpose. Such a loan
would continue the programs finances under two earlier Bank projects.
100.      The Government is also attempting to develop indigenous energy
sources. In this regard, an onshore oil and gas exploration project
supported by the IDB is under way; offshore exploration is being supported
through a project that has received Bank financing. The Government intends
to undertake all oil and gas exploration activities through, or in
partnership with, private oil companies. The feasibility of hydropower
development at various sites, among them the Blue Mountain, is also being
studied. Finally, the development of nontraditional energy sources,
including peat, solar energy and other alternative sources are being
explored.
Tax Reform
101.      Reform of the taxation system would contribute to public resource
mobilization, to reduce inequities, and to increase economic efficiency.
There is scope to increase the buoyancy of the tax system; this could be
accomplished substituting ad valorem tax rates for specific rates (about
half of the revenue generated by indirect taxes results from specific
rates) and introducing periodic reassessments of property values. Some
excise taxes may be increased, particularly for goods whose imports are

effected by QRs. Tax administration could be improved to prevent
reportedly large evasion and arrears, in particular with respect to the
income tax. The income tax system has brought about certain inequities
through evasion encouraged by high marginal tax rates, negligible
penalties, and poor tax administration.
102.      Action Program.  The Government is planning a number of measures
during the next two years in order to increase receipts of tax revenues and
improve the fiscal position. First, a Board of Review has recently been
established with the purpose of overseeing administrative strengthening of
the tax system. In this regard, the Board has already initiated programs
to improve revenue collection and encourage compliance, recruit and train
staff, and to monitor the assessing activities of the Revenue Departments.
Second, steps are being taken to review the property tax sytem through
revaluation of land and revision of rates. It is expected that this
process will be completed by FY83/84. Third, the income tax system, both
personal and corporate, is being reviewed. Among other aspects, the rate
structure, allowances, and means of reducing tax avoidance and erosion are
being assessed. Fourth, the Government is planning to shift to an ad
valorem system of sales tax in order to increase revenues and improve the
efficiency of administration. Fifth, the Government is reviewing the
excise taxes applicable to goods whose imports are limited by quantitative
restrictions. Finally, computerization of the tax collection department
will strengthen the administration of a variety of taxes.
III.  PROSPECTS FOR THE JAMAICAN ECONOMY, 1982-86
A. Directions of the Jamaican Economy
103       The economic policies of the new Government of Jamaica emphasize
the dynamic role of the private sector in pursuing an export-led
development strategy. They differ substantially from past policies that
stressed the leading role of the public sector and oriented production
towards the requirements of the domestic market.
104.      If the private sector is to become the main engine of growth, a
major effort will be needed in order to reestablish a propitious investment
climate. The Government's positive attitude towards investors, domestic
and foreign, has resulted in the creation of several bilateral business
groups through which numerous investment proposals and enquiries are being
processed. External private capital plays a major role in the Government's
program (paras 45-46). At the same time, efforts to increase the savings
of public enterprises and to rationalize and limit the investment
activities of the public sector (jointly with the increase in savings of
the Central Government) will reduce the public sector's claim on scarce
investible resources (paras 32-33). The creation of medium-term lending
institutions seeks to provide an adequate channel for private sector
financing (paras 34-35).



- 40 -
105.      Agriculture, manufacture, and tourism are likely to be the main
sources of output growth in the 1980s. The bauxite and alumina industry
also has a role to play, contributing to ease the balance of payments
constraint; such a role, however, is likely to be less important than in
the 1960s and early 1970s because of the lack of domestic energy resources.
106.      Agriculture, manufacture, and tourism hold the greatest promise
for rapid output growth, employment creation, and foreign exchange
earnings. In connection with agriculture, the Government's program
emphasizes better resource use (paras 48-51), the reconstruction of
commercial agriculture including rehabilitation programs for the sugar and
banana subsectors (paras 58-63 and 64-65), and the deregulation of the
sector through a revision of the role of the EMOs. The factors limiting
the growth of manufacturing production (such as availability of foreign
exchange and export incentives) are likely to be overcome faster and,
therefore, the sector holds the greatest promise in terms of dynamic output
growth and employment creation. However, rapid growth can only take place
if extraregional exports increase substantially; the Government's strategy
emphasizes redressing the balance of the incentives system, reducing the
profitability of production for the domestic market (through the
elimination of QRs) (paras 71-74) and increasing the attractiveness of
nontraditional exports (para 75).
B. Output, Income and Expenditure
107.      The stabilization efforts and the medium-term programs launched
by the Government of Jamaica are expected to put the economy once again on
a growth course. Real GDP growth has been projected at 3.8% in 1982, 4.9%
in 1983, and at rates fluctuating between 4.0% and 4.5% in 1984-1986.
These growth rates, to be attained through the adoption of an export
oriented development strategy, would imply a strong economic performance,
especially in view of the fact that the world economy is projected to grow
relatively slowly during those years. 1/ These projections imply, given
a rate of population growth of 1% per annum, that per capita GDP in 1986,
would reach--in terms of US$ of 1980--a value of $1442, which would be 18%
over the 1981 level, but still 13% below the 1972 peak level.
108.      On the expenditure side, the macroeconomic projections reflect a
shift from consumption to investment; in this framework, private
consumption expenditures would attain modest gains. Measured at constant
prices, the share of investment expenditures in GDP has been projected to
1/   The World Development Report IV, for example, projects "midpoint" OECD
growth at 2.5% per annum during 1980-85; this compares to 5.1%
(1960-70), 3.3% (1970-80), and 1.3% during 1980.



- 41 -
increase from 14% in 1981 to 19% in 1986, reflecting the need gradually
to intensify the capital accumulation effort in order to achieve the growth
targets. The share of total consumption expenditures, private plus public,
has been projected to decrease from 89% in 1981 to 79% in 1986 reflecting
the need to limit the growth of consumption to rates consistent with the
expansion in investment. Public consumption expenditures were projected to
decline 3.5%, reflecting the Governments objectives of reducing public
expenditures relative to GDP and of also reducing public sector employment
to the extent of the labor force attrition rate. On the other hand private
consumption expenditures were projected to increase 15% over the projection
period, permitting some increase in the standards of living.

109.      The financing of the investment effort has been projected to
change its composition, in line with the Government's policies.
Investment--measured at current prices--is projected to increase as a share
of GDP, rising from nearly 17% in 1981 to about 24% in the last two years
of the projection period. Internal saving is expected to finance a growing
portion of the capital accumulation effort, while external saving would
finance a decreasing share. Internal saving are projected to increase from
3% of GDP in 1981 to 16% in 1986. The expectedIt ?e in public sector
saving from -1.2Z of GDP in 1981 to 6% by 1984 reflects the Government's
commitment to strengthen the financial performance of the Central
Government and to increase current saving of major public enterprises.
Private sector saving is also expected to show a rising trend. External
saving, the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments, is
projected to decline from nearly 14% of GDP in 1981 to 7.4% in 1986.

110.      Agricultural output is expected to grow 28% during the projection
period. During the initial years, the recovery of traditional export
crops--sugar and bananas--would constitute the major source of growth;
later on, other agricultural activities are expected to provide the main
impetus to growth. Sugar output has been projected to increase from
200,000 MT in 1981 to 330,000 tons in 1986, a level consistent with the
productive capacity of the sugar factories that will continue operating.
Output of bananas has been projected to increase from 70,000 MT in 1981 to
200,000 MT in 1986, a level that would be consistent with the Government's
objective of filling the quota in the UK market. For both products the
projected increases are steep; but in both cases, output is severely
depressed and the targeted levels only imply its recovery to previously
attained levels.
111.      The mining sector has been projected to grow 18% during the
projection period. The annual growth rates vary considerably reflecting
the specific hypotheses that were adopted. In the case of bauxite, output
levels reflect the recent decision of the US Government to purchase
Jamaican bauxite for its strategic stockpile in 1982 and 1983. In the case
of alumina, it was assumed that the existing reduction plants would
gradually approach capacity utilization, reaching it in 1985, and that the
Jamalco plant will be expanded by 350,000 MT/year with the new capacity
coming into operation in 1986.
112.      The manufacturing sector has been projected to increase by 46%
during the projection period. The projected output value for the terminal
year of the projections would be 2% higher than the peak level reached in
1973. Annual growth rates are higher during the first three years,
reflecting the existence of vast unutilized capacity in the manufacturing
sector, and/or the possibility of restoring productive capacity, degraded
during the last few years, through minor investments. The assumed pattern
of annual growth rates reflects increased availability of foreign exchange,
some expansion of domestic demand, and a substantial increase in
manufactured exports.



- 43 -
113.      Construction activity ha's been projected to increase 48% from
1981 to 1986; annual growth would be smaller during the first two years
than during the last three, reflecting the gradual pick up in private
investment. Gross Domestic Product generated in the rest of the productive
sectors has been projected to decline in the case of government services
and to increase in the case of the remaining sectors. The decline in
government services was projected at 3.5% with respect to the 1981 level,
reflecting the Government's intention to reduce public employment. The
rest of the productive sectors were projected to increase 25%, following
the increase in economic activity.

C.   The Balance of Payments
114.      The medium-term balance of payments projections are based on the
Government's export-led development strategy. Growth in export earnings
reflects the program's objective to put unutilized capacity to work in order
to generate foreign exchange quickly. The anticipated increase in economic
growth would need to be supported by increased imports, particularly of raw
materials and capital goods. In nominal terms, the current account deficit is
not projected to begin a gradual decline until 1985. The balance of payments
will continue to be the binding constraint on the economy; the projections
imply continued reliance on public capital inflows, but the estimated
requirements are somewhat lower in the latter three years of the projection
period. Consistent with the Government's objective of relying more on the
private sector, direct foreign investment is expected to be a significant
component of capital inflows, thus contributing to the gradual reduction in
the need for foreign official assistance.
115.      Growth of the volume of exports of goods and non-factor services is
expected to average 7.1% a year during 1982-86. Attaining this projected
rate, however, will entail a substantial effort, particularly if the world
economy only grows modestly as it is now expected to. The volume of exports
of bauxite is expected to attain substantially higher levels in 1982-84,
reflecting purchases by the US Government for its strategic stockpile. The
volume of alumina exports, on the other hand is expected to decline nearly 12%
in 1982, but after this year, it is expected to growth gradually to reach full
capacity utilization by 1985. In 1986, alumina exports would increase by 12%,
reflecting the completion of the Jamalco plant 350,000 MT/year expansion.
Volumes of the traditional export crops of sugar and bananas are also expected
to rise, in line with the Government's objective of exploiting fully its
guaranteed markets in Europe and the action programs for those sectors. Sugar
exports would begin to increase in 1983, rising from the 1982 projected volume
of 100,000 MT to 230,000 MT by 1986. The recovery of banana exports from the
depressed 1981 level of 22,000 tons would start in 1982 and by 1986 exports
would fill the quota in the UK market, 150,000 tons. Reflecting their pivotal
role in the Government's export-oriented program, manufactured exports are
projected to nearly triple from a 1981 nominal value of US$116 million to
US$331 million in 1986, representing an average real growth of 15% a year.
This growth assumes that the sector will undergo significant structural
changes during this period. Tourism is expected to achieve average real
growth of 9% per annum as capacity utilization gradually is increased to a
nearly 70% hotel occupancy rate by 1986. After taking into account projected
changes in international prices, the nominal growth of exports of goods and
non-factor services is expected to average 14.4% a year during the period,
rising from US$1.5 billion in 1981 to nearly US$3 billion in 1986.

116.      Growth in the volume of imports of goods and non-factor services
is projected at of about 5% between 1982 and 1986; the nominal increase is
expected to average 12.2% per annum, from US$1.7 billion in 1981 to
slightly over US$3 billion in 1986. Jamaica's fuel import bill would rise
from an estimated US$450 million in 1981 to US$724 million in 1986. Energy
conservation is expected to generate oil import savings in
the non-bauxite/alumina economy of about 20% by 1985, so that the volume of
fuel imports would increase by only 8% over the period. In line with the
expected expansion of output in the mining, manufacturing and construction
sectors, imports of raw materials and capital goods are expected to record
an average real increase of about 8% per year. Outflows of investment
income are projected to average about US$360 million a year given the rapid
increase in public external debt, and also reflecting higher private sector
remittances, particularly in the latter years of the projection period,
from the mining sector and other direct foreign investments.

117.      The share of the current account deficit in GDP is projected to fall
gradually from 14% in 1982 to 7.4% in 1986.  The nominal current account
deficit is projected to peak at US$524 million in 1984; thereafter the deficit
would decline gradually to US$439 million by 1986.
118.      Net external capital inflows averaging about US$520 million, would
be required to cover the current account deficit, external debt amortization
and an increase in international reserves. External capital requirements
would peak at US$544 million in 1984, and would fall to US$469 million in the
last year of the period. About 30% of the requirements would be covered by
private capital flows whose importance would increase from a share of 14% in
1982 to 39% in 1986. A large share of the estimated direct investment
corresponds to the anticipated expansion of the Jamalco alumina plant. In
addition, the Government is trying to attract other foreign investments,
particularly joint ventures, and has set up an organization to manage
promotion efforts and to assist interested businessmen. Of course, the
projections for private direct investment (other than alumina-related) are
highly tentative. If they are less than anticipated, the requirements of
public capital would be correspondingly tigher or the growth targets would
have to be scaled down. The remaining 70% of external capital requirements
are projected to be filled by public capital disbursements averaging US$565
million a year. Disbursements would peak in 1982 at US$642 million, but
decline to lower levels, reaching US$533 million in 1986.

D. Creditworthiness
119.      Because of the rapid increase in public external debt in recent
years, Jamaica's debt service ratio has risen to 20.3% in 1981. The burden
will ease particularly after 1983, and the projected debt service ratio
would reach 16% in 1986. The continued requirement for public external
capital results in a rising ratio of public external debt to GDP, from a
projected 52.5% share in 1981 to a high of 61% in 1983 before gradually
falling in the following three years, reaching 56% in 1986.   Nevertheless,
the new Jamaican Government is implementing a program to end the country's
long period of economic decline and to initiate economic recovery which is
supported by a three-year agreement with the IMF. The Government has
defined a program for the structural transformation of the economy in close
consultation with the Bank. With the policies adopted by the Government,
the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments would decline
from 14% of GDP in 1981 to about 7% of GDP in 1986; this is a substantial
improvement but Jamaica will need to continue reducing this deficit in
subsequent years. On this basis, provided Jamaica successfully carries out
its economic stabilization and recovery program, it should be considered
creditworthy for continued external assistance, subject to close monitoring
of implementation of the action program described above.
PART IV - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA
120.      The Bank has made 25 loansl/ in Jamaica totalling US$330.2
million after cancellations. Of this amount, US$117.4 million (36%) has
been for infrastructure investments in transportation, electric power,
water supply and sewerage; US$98.5 million (30%) for program-type lending
and for a revolving fund for financing of inputs for export industries; and
the remainder has been for agriculture and agroindustry (12%), education
(7%), sites and services (5%), forestry (4%), population and nutrition
(3%), small-scale enterprises (2%), and petroleum exploration (2%). At the
end of 1980, Jamaica's debt to the Bank stood at US$171 million, or 14% of
external debt outstanding and disbursed; debt service to the Bank during
the year amounted to US$16.7 million, or 10% of total debt service. These
shares are not expected to change substantially in the next five years.
The undisbursed amount of Bank loans as of September 30, 1981 amounted to
US$97.3 million. There have been four IFC investments in Jamaica, with the
most recent being a loan in 1981 to a flour mill company.
1/   Including a telecommunications loan made in 1967 to the Jamaica
Telephone Company and cancelled in the same year, but not including a
US$6.8 million Third Education Project for vocational education, which
was approved by the Executive Directors on December 15, 1981.



- 49 -
121.      Bank lending in Jamaica has covered a wide range of sectors and
development problems. Initially, the Bank lending program emphasized
infrastructure investment. Although financing for this purpose continued,
the emphasis of the lending program in the early and middle 1970s moved to
the social sectors, with projects in education, population and nutrition,
housing and employment for the urban poor and rural development. In
response to the changing economic situation, a further shift in Bank
lending took place in Jamaica in the late 1970s. The priority needs of
this most recent period have been the country's critical short-to-medium
balance of payments and production requirements. Thus, the FY78 lending
program contained a US$30 million program loan and an US$18 million loan
for the rehabilitation of sugar factories. The FY79 US$12 million forestry
project and US$31.5 million second program loan were directed at similar
needs. Most of the FY79 program loan proceeds were allocated to the
financing of import needs of export industries through the establishment of
a revolving Export Development Fund. Other FY79 lending operations
included a fourth highway loan of US$16.0 million and a small-scale
industry loan of US$7.0 million. In the absence of a medium-term economic
program no loans were made in FY80. In FY81, the Bank made a second loan
for the Export Development Fund and a loan for offshore petroleum
exploration.
122.      Project implementation difficulties have occurred in Bank and
other internationally financed projects. These difficulties have had three
principal causes: (i) shortage of key personnel; (ii) organizational and
structural problems in the public sector, including inadequacies in the
management systems used in planning and controlling projects; and (iii)
budgeting restraints resulting in shortages of local financing. The
difficult economic conditions of the last several years have affected and
intensified the problems in all areas. The Government has committed itself
to deal with these problems through the structural adjustment program that
it has undertaken, which includes specific measures for improved project
management, monitoring and financing.
123.      The Bank's lending program for FY82 includes--in addition to the
proposed loan--an already approved US$6.8 million loan for vocational
education, a $76.2 million structural adjustment loan and a US$6.2 million
technical assistance loan which would help support the structural
adjustment program. Other projects under consideration for Bank financing
are a third power project, aimed at rehabilitating the electric power
system, and agricultural and industrial credit projects, which would
support new credit institutions and provide medium- and long-term capital
for private sector investment, particularly in those areas which will
result in increased exports. If the proposed SAL is a success, i.e. if the
Government Program is executed as projected and has the expected results, a
follow-up SAL may also be considered for FY83.



- 50 -
124.      Coordination with other external lenders and assistance agencies
has been given particular attention in formulating the Bank's lending
strategy. The Bank has taken a lead role in an international aid effort
for the Caribbean called the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development. The Group has met annually in Washington since 1978. The
Group has brought together the donor agencies and countries and the
recipient countries. Within the framework of the Group, individual country
subgroup meetings, similar to Bank consultative group meetings, have been
held. The subgroup meetings for Jamaica have provided an opportunity to
examine jointly the country's economic situation and policies, to consider
a country project list, and to coordinate overall assistance efforts. As a
result of the Caribbean Group and subgroup meetings, and of related donor
activities, Jamaica has received commitments, exclusive of Bank and IMF
assistance, for additional balance of payments and project local cost
financing of US$225 million in FY81 from several bilateral and multilateral
donors. This assistance financed inter alia the local cost requirements of
several Bank-assisted projects. The Caribbean Group has also provided a
basis for cofinancing foreign exchange costs with the OPEC Special Fund in
the Bank-assisted Second Power Project. In addition to the close
relationship established with the IMF and the UNDP in dealing with Jamaican
problems, the Bank has worked intimately with other sponsoring agencies of
the Caribbean Group--the Inter-American Development Bank and the Caribbean
Development Bank--as well as with bilateral aid agencies in several major
donor countries.
PART V - THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR AND KINGSTON URBAN SETTING
A. The Manufacturing Sector
Growth and Structure
125.      Through 1976  the Jamaican manufacturing sector grew more rapidly
than the overall economy and by that year reached 18.5% of GDP, compared to
only 11.5% in 1950. Following the sharp deterioration of the balance of
payments in 1976, however, the sector was hampered by shortages of raw mate-
rials and spare parts, reduced consumer demand caused by the general economic
slowdown, and a virtual halt of investment activity of the private sector.
Sector output declined at an average annual rate of 7.5% in real terms in the
five years through 1980, a much steeper decline than the 3.6% annual decrease
in GDP. In 1980 , manufacturing contributed only 15% of GDP, and sector
employment was 80,000 or 11% of the employed labor force, down from a high of
81,000 in 1974. Preliminary figures for 1981 indicate that this declining
trend has been reversed with a growth of about 2% for the sector's output.
126.      The current structure of Jamaica's manufacturing sector and its
characteristics are the result of incentive and trade policies which, since
the introduction in 1956 of the Industrial Incentives Law, have been directed
at establishing and protecting domestic industry. The law allows Jamaican
manufacturers to import capital goods, raw materials and intermediate goods
without duty, and further encourage the use of capital goods through generous



- 51 -
tax write-offs after a ten year income tax holiday. The manufacturer has
further been protected by the exclusion of competing imports without the
application of any meaningful efficiency criteria, when there is sufficient
installed capacity to supply the domestic market. The Government has under-
taken to eliminate its system of quantitative restrictions on imports under its
structural adjustment program. Its commitment is to eliminate QRs gradually
over a five-year period. As a first step, 64 QRs were eliminated on February 7,
1982.
127.      The quantitative import restrictions have resulted in very high
effective levels of protection to domestic industry. Estimates developed in
1979 indicate that effective protection levels (excess of value added at
domestic prices, including the effect of protection on locally manufactured
inputs, over value added at world prices) average 68% for the sector as a
whole. Furthermore, firms exporting to CARICOM enjoy an effective level of
protection of, on average, 19%. In the presence of quantitative restrictions
tariffs have played a relatively small protectionist role. In the past,
tariffs in Jamaica have served primarily the revenue purpose. The overall
tariff levels are rather moderate averaging only 22%, and in recent years
their role as a source of fiscal revenue has been significantly reduced. At
present, most manufacturing firms can import their inputs totally exempt of
tariff duties or any other tax.
128.      The industrialization policies and incentives have resulted in
significant distortions within the manufacturing sector. The system of in-
centives encouraged the development of a mix of capital intensive industries,
and many so-called "screwdriver" industries performing final assembly or
processing operations with very low domestic value added. Paradoxically,
the policy of import substitution through the encouragement and protection of
domestic industry has resulted in the creation of a highly import dependent
manufacturing sector that is exacerbating, rather than helping, Jamaica's
balance of payments' problem. By providing incentives in the form of duty-
free imports of intermediate goods, efforts to develop backward linkages where
comparative advantages might have existed, or developed, were effectively
discouraged. Currently, the direct import content of domestic manufacturers
is about 43% of sales. For that portion of manufacturing production that is
exported, the direct import content is 46%, and over 50% when indirect imports
are included.
129.      The high levels of effective protection of the manufacturing sector
also cause high profits, inefficiencies, cost penalties associated with
small-scale production, and unutilized capacity. Despite the limited size of
the Jamaican market, the generous industrialization incentives encouraged
investments to manufacture the vast majority of finished goods consumed
locally. The resulting industrial base is fragmented into many small and
inefficient producers. The sector is operating at about 60% of capacity on a
one and a half shift basis owing to the contraction of the local market. Many
firms have been unable to maintain or increase their export markets because of
shortages of foreign exchange, which have limited their ability to purchase
the necessary spare parts and equipment required to overhaul and modernize
their capacity. The net effect is a relatively high cost structure for



- 52 -
Jamaican manufactured products, and inordinately high profit margins per unit
produced or invested, necessary to obtain reasonable financial rates of return
on investment.
Exports
130.      In recent years exports of non-traditional manufactured goods 1/
have represented 10% to 12% of total Jamaican merchandise exports. Manufac-
tured goods exports increased from US$50 million in 1972 to US$73 million in
1976, or 10% yearly in nominal terms, but then remained stagnant through 1978.
The lack of growth between 1976 and 1978 was mainly due to the over-valuation
of the Jamaican dollar, the substantial increase in wages during the six years
prior to 1978, and the shortage of foreign exchange which made it difficult
for exporters to obtain necessary imported inputs. In 1979, however, manufac-
tured exports increased 32% to US$95 million mainly as a result of: (i) the
96% adjustment of the exchange rate between April 1977 and May 1979; (ii) the
decrease in real wages brought about by the Government's economic stabiliza-
tion program; (iii) the granting of some incentives to exporters, including
priority consideration in the issuance of import licenses to manufacturers
that received "Certified Exporter" status in early 1979; and (iv) the assurance
of foreign exchange availability for the import of inputs made possible by the
Export Development Fund (EDF), which was funded with the proceeds of Bank Loan
1715-JM approved by the Board on May 30, 1979. In 1980, export growth slowed
down to about 8-10% due to the further deterioration of the economic situation
and political climate. During the year manufacturers were plagued by an
extreme shortage of foreign exchange, labor strikes and disruptions in basic
services such as power and transportation.
131.      Between 1972 and 1978 there was a marked shift in the composition of
exporting firms and manufactured export goods. Beverages, tobacco products,
paper products, furniture, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, metal mechanics, and
mechanical and electrical equipment registered real growth, while textiles and
clothing suffered a substantial decline. The latter reflects the limited
scope of past export incentives. The Export Industry Encouragement Law of
1956, amended in 1960 and 1969, contained the same set of basic incentives as
the Industrial Incentives Law, but in addition provided exemptions from all
indirect taxes to firms exporting 100% of their production volume to non-CARICOM
markets. This resulted in the establishment of some 150 so-called "export
enclave" firms performing assembly operations mostly in the garments field.
Because of the general deterioration of the economic climate for manufacturing
enterprises, by 1978 only 30 of these firms remained. The most affected
subsector was textiles and clothing, which decreased from 21% (US$10.4 million)
of total manufactured exports in 1972 to only 6% (US$4.4 million) by 1978. In
1979, there was a notable recovery of this subsector (to US$7.8 million) as
those 100% export firms that continued operating in Jamaica responded to the
currency devaluation and decrease in real wages.
1/   Excluding petroleum products, sugar and molasses, and alumina.



- 53 -
132.      Until 1979, practically all new export volume was to the small but
protected CARICOM market. Between 1972-1978 exports to CARICOM increased from
US$17 million to US$39 million, while exports to the rest of the world stagnated
at about US$33 million. In 1979, exports to CARICOM further increased to US$57
million, while exports to other markets increased to US$38 million, exceeding
for the first time in many years their prior year's level in both current and
real terms. The growth of export volume outside of CARICOM in 1979, was made
possible by the increase in the international competitiveness of Jamaican
products and a growing awareness of the Government and private sector about
the need for developing new markets beyond CARICOM. The success of Jamaica's
new export drive will very much depend on the willingness and ability of both
the Government and the private sector to adopt policy measures and undertake
investments in market development and new plant and equipment all of which
are necessary to make a higher volume of the new exports to non-Caricom
markets possible.
Prospects
133.      To achieve its economic development and growth objectives the
Government has given high priority to increasing exports of manufactured
goods, and to development of deeper and wider linkages within the sector and
with other sectors to stimulate the economy and to reduce the import dependence
of manufacturing. In the short term -- two to three years -- if a continuous
and reliable source of foreign exchange is made available to exporters, which
is one of the main purposes of the Bank's Second EDF loan, approved on May 15,
1981, annual export growth of about 30% can be achieved as exporters continue
their growth pattern in CARICOM, and as they make wider and deeper inroads
into the new markets beyond CARICOM.
134.      However, to achieve a sustained 25% to 35% yearly  growth beyond
1982, important changes to the industrial infrastructure and incentive systems
will be required. During the next two years it will be necessary to improve
significantly the cost competitiveness of Jamaican products with a comparative
advantage outside of CARICOM, and to develop the marketing know-how and
managerial drive necessary to penetrate new international markets. This task
will require, among others: (i) policy adjustments to redress the imbalances
in incentives which favor production for the local market over exports to
international markets; (ii) expansion of the exportable product mix by better
identification of the country's comparative advantages; (iii) investment in
new plant and equipment for products with a comparative advantage, particularly
outside of CARICOM; (iv) expansion and training of the existing managerial
pool, particularly in the fields of export marketing, cost accounting and
industrial engineering; and (v) further reorientation of the private sector,
which to date has been accustomed to relatively well protected low volume and
high margin sales, to larger volume cost efficient production for the export
market.
135.      The Government is aware of the sectoral requirements for rapid
short-term export gains and sustained long-term export development. Already
during the last three years the previous Government took some steps designed
to support its export promotion policy, and initiated a dialogue with the



- 54 -
private sector to assure that new policies were compatible with the needs of
exporters. The most significant short-term steps taken were the adoption of
realistic exchange rate and wage policies. Also, the Jamaican National Export
Corporation (JNEC), which provides export marketing services to local firms
in the private sector, was restructured and substantially strengthened. The
creation of the EDF, supported by Bank Loans 1715-JM and 1978-JM, and the
Certified Exporter Status scheme has helped eliminate the foreign exchange
bottleneck that had been holding back export growth.
136.      The present Government is planning to revitalize the institutions
in the manufacturing sector with a view to increasing exports as rapidly
as possible. A study of these institutions, to be financed through the Bank's
Technical Assistance Loan, is expected to provide the basis for decisions to
be adopted within the next few months regarding the role of each one and the
institutional changes that may be required throughout the sector. The
Government has established a new organization, the Jamaica National Invest-
ment Promotion Corporation (JNIP). Its objectives are to improve service
to potential investors and to coordinate and clear their dealings with the
agencies involved.
137.      For the longer term development of non-traditional exports the
Government considers that the imbalance in incentives offered producers for
the domestic market and those offered producers for export should be redressed.
In the view of the Government, however, the actions to be taken in this area
cannot be precipitous. Given the importance of manufacturers for the domestic
market as employers of labor, and the current high unemployment rate, the
authorities believe that it would be difficult to take actions which would
result in further layoffs, unless it becomes clear that prospective export
growth can at least compensate for these negative short term effects. Also,
to the extent that incentives are changed through tax measures, or the pay-
ment of cash subsidies, the fiscal implications would have to be consistent
with the Government's overall economic program. To design appropriate policy
measures, at the request of the Government a portion of the technical assistance
funds available under Loan 1715-JM has been reallocated to cover the expenses
of internationally recruited experts who are assisting in the development of
the industrial reform package. Additional funds required for studies and for
assistance in the implementation of a reform program would be made available
from the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan. The Technical Assistance Loan would
also finance the preparation of an action program on export incentives and such
a time-phased program would be one of the measures necessary to release the
second tranche of the Bank's Structural Adjustment Loan. Specific programs
are also being prepared as part of the structural adjustment program to
rationalize important industrial subsectors such as garments, shoes and con-
struction materials and satisfactory progress on these plans would also be
a condition for release of the second tranche of the Structural Adjustment
Loan.
138.     The KFZ project is seen by the Government as another instrument of
its export promotion policy. As such it is designed to (i) attract foreign
investors; (ii) give domestic industries a demonstration of the country's
export potential; (iii) create backward linkages to domestic supply of materials
and components; (iv) provide training and experience in technical skills,



- 55 -
management, international marketing and quality control for local employees;
and (v) stimulate and facilitate technical/financial contacts and collaboration
with foreign firms. In most cases free zone firms are not expected to enjoy
substantial advantages over "domestic" exporters in Jamaica, since the latter
can import capital goods, raw materials and intermediate goods without duty.
While the operations of "domestic" exporters in some industries may presently
be limited by quantitative restrictions on imports of goods also manufactured
locally, the lifting of these restrictions, as noted above, is expected to be
part of the structural adjustment program. Domestic exporters also have
assurance of foreign exchange through the EDF and are granted tax holidays on
export earnings for up to fifteen years. As a result of its pricing policy,
firms renting space from the KFZC will not pay rents which are significantly
less than alternative space outside the zone. In general it is expected that
foreign firms will prefer to locate in the zone for other reasons. These
would include: (i) reduced amount of paper work; (ii) proximity to port
facilities and faster clearance of goods; (iii) a higher degree of physical
security; and (iv) a way for foreign investors to become familiar with Jamaica
with fewer perceived risks.
B.   Kingston Urban Setting
General
139.      The Kingston Metropolitan Region (KMR) covers a total land area
of 250 square miles. The region is situated in the southeast portion of the
island, and includes Kingston, the capital city and largest urban center, and
the city of Spanish Town, approximately 12 kilometers west of the KFZ.
Historically, the KMR developed outward from the old waterfront area to the
southeast of the KFZ (see Map 1). About 44% of KMR's population of 743,000 in
1980 lives in this primarily low income, high density area known as South
Kingston. The main industrial zone, of which the KFZ is a part, is concen-
trated along the more recently developed waterfront on the southwestern edge
of the area.
Employment
140.      In 1980 it was estimated that the KMR had a labor force of 345,000,
implying that 46% of the population were economically active. Approximately
27% of the labor force or 94,000 are estimated to be unemployed. The largest
group of unemployed, about 51,000, are located in the south Kingston area
where the unemployment rate reaches 32%. Though there are no hard figures
on the distribution of unemployment by age groups or occupation in the KMR,
national figures show that the highest unemployment rates are among the young.
In the age groups 14-19 the unemployment rate is 58%, and 39% among 20-24 year
olds. For those over 24, unemployment runs at 30%.
141.      Studies by the National Planning Agency estimate that in 1978, about
half of the workers employed in the waterfront industrial zone, which includes
KFZ, lived in the South Kingston area, and the next largest group (20%) lived
in the Portmore-Braeton area. Owing to its location, the employment benefits



- 56 -
resulting from the KFZ project are therefore expected to accrue primarily
to South Kingston, the area with the most chronic unemployment problem in the
KMR. The types of light assembly operations envisaged for the KFZ would
also offer jobs to those younger age groups with the highest unemployment
rates.
PART VI - THE PROJECT
Backaround and Oblectives
142.      The project was prepared by the Port Authority of Jamaica (PAJ)
with the help of the Jamaica National Investment Corporation (JNIC) which did
the feasibility study. The Government requested Bank financing in September
1978 and the appraisal was carried out in December, 1980. Loan negotiations
were begun in June 1981 and suspended until February 1982 in order to
make adjustments in the financial plan. A report entitled "Kingston Free Zone
Project" (Report No. 3442-JM) dated February 25, 1982) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the proposed loan
and project are summarized in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III of
this report.
143.      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to promote
exports, generate foreign exchange earnings and create new employment opportuni-
ties near one of the highest unemployment areas of Kingston.
Proiect Description
144.      The project would expand the operations of the existing Kingston
Free Zone (KFZ) and improve services and operational efficiency by executing
the following project components:
(a) Internal Infrastructure
(i)  Development of 23 acres of land with shore protection on the
harbor side, ready for building construction, complete with
roads, power, water and sewerage networks.
(ii) Construction of 80 standard factory buildings and a 12 foot
high security wall.
(b) Technical Assistance and Training
(i)  Management/financial/technical experts attached to KFZ
as advisors (on-the-job training).
(ii) Contracts with specialized firms to carry out defined work
programs in such areas as international investment promo-
tion (the single highest priority activity over the next
2-3 years).



- 57 -
(iii) Organized training courses and study tours for key KFZ
staff in foreign locations such as Ireland, Philippines,
Singapore, and Malaysia.
145.      PAJ created KFZ in 1976 on land bordering the transshipment terminal,
but the law defining its legal status was not passed until February 1980.
The law authorizes PAJ to administer, control, operate and manage the Free
Zone. In February 1982 PAJ created a limited liability company, KFZC to
operate the Zone as its subsidiary and agent in carrying out its responsibil-
ities under the law.
146.      Using its own funds and those borrowed from the Jamaica National Invest-
ment Corporation (JNIC), the Port Authority has constructed during the FY1976-
1981 period 28 SFBs totalling 176,000 ft of factory space. These are presently
leased by 18 companies, of which 211 are light manufacturing industries.  Another
7 SFBs totalling about 45,000 ft are under construction for five tenants.
Sufficient supplies of fresh water, electricity and telephone/telex hookups
are available to meet the forecasted demand from the project. Other infra-
structure is available in the area.
Project Execution Arrangements
147.      Implementation of the Project will be the responsibility of the
KFZC/PAJ. PAJ has a small engineering department and relies on outside
consulting engineers for design, tendering, bid evaluation, and supervision
of construction for all large projects. This procedure is acceptable and
would be followed for the proposed project. In addition a Project Manager
whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment
shall be acceptable to the Bank will be appointed by KFZC as a condition of
loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 of Loan Agreement). He would be assigned
exclusively to the project and report directly to the KFZC general manager.
Accounting and general engineering support would be supplied by PAJ until
the work load justifies the assignment of permanent staff with KFZC. The
project started in August 1981 with the construction of seven SFBs and two
partially built ones to be retroactively financed. Project execution
would extend over a four year period ending in September 1985.
148.      From the beginning, PAJ has looked upon the KFZ as a profit-making
venture and made a conscious effort to minimize staff overhead. KFZC presently
has seven professionals with engineering, procurement and accounting services
provided by PAJ central office staff. Other staff assigned to KFZC presently
total 21. KFZC plans to increase its staff as the level of operations
require. It has agreed to maintain salaries at a level needed to attract and
retain qualified employees for KFZC at all times (Section 3.05 of Project
Agreement). Though local engineering and accounting consultants can properly
provide KFZC with basic services, they are less familiar with advanced concepts
and practices being developed in the long established free zones in other
parts of the world. KFZC will also need foreign help from firms specializing
in international investment promotion. The Borrower has agreed to prepare a
detailed plan for technical assistance and training by June 30, 1982 (Section
2.02(b) of Project Agreement).

Procurement and Disbursement
149.      PAJ/KFZC procurement procedures are consistent with established
government guidelines for public sector entities. They call for prequali-
fication of contractors and local competitive bidding. The appraisal mission
reviewed these procedures and found them acceptable. PAJ relies on local
consulting engineers to carry out most phases of design and procurement.
They have performed well in the past and have the capability to implement the
project. Because of the nature of the project, construction is planned in
phases or slices so that resource commitments do not get too far ahead of
effective demand. As in the pas:, SFB contracts will normally range between
5-10 modules or 32,500-65,000 ft , corresponding to a contract value of
US$.8-1.6 million. Land filling could be carried out in one contract for
the full 17 acres amounting to about $1.5 million. Those for equipment are
not expected to exceed US$50,000 each. Because of PAJ/KFZ's long standing
policy of favoring smaller contractors, the average size civil works contract
is not expected to exceed US$1.0 million. Nevertheless, if demand were to
exceed the forecast, requiring an accelerated construction schedule, larger
contracts could be tendered. Local competitive bidding procedures would be
required for all contracts up to US$2.0 million. Above this limit, Bank ICB
guidelines would apply. In any event the first construction contract for
SFBs, the first ones for roads, water and sewerage, land development, and all
contracts estimated to cost more than US$1.0 million, as well as all ICB tenders,
would be subject to a priori review and approval by the Bank (Schedule 1.C.2
to the Project Agreement).
150.      Direct and indirect foreign exchange costs for the project average
60%. About 3% of total project costs is made up of technical assistance
which has the highest foreign content (90%). The technical assistance compo-
nent will be financed from other official aid sources. This would allow the
Bank to finance 62% of the remainder of the project and still not exceed the
average foreign exchange costs for the total project of 60%. The Bank would
disburse 59% of all project expenditures for SFBs and infrastructure and 100%
of foreign expenditures for materials and equipment, not to exceed 60% of total
project costs. Retro-active financing of up to US$1.0 million for expenditures
incurred after August 1, 1981 is recommended for the ongoing construction of
nine buildings (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para 4).
Prolect Costs and FinancinR Plan
151.      Total project costs are estimated at US$22.5 million with a foreign
exchange content of US$13.5 or 60% of total costs. Cost estimates include a
10% physical contingency on all infrastructure and 5% on SFBs as a standard
proven design is to be repeated. Price contingencies amount to 19% of base
costs and assume annual international inflation rates of 8-1/2% p.a. in 1982
and 7-1/2% p.a. for the years thereafter. Local inflation is assumed to be
10% p.a. during the years 1982-85.
152.      The proposed loan of US$13.5 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost of the project. Local funds for the project equal to 40%
of total costs would be provided by PAJ from its own cashflow and by the



- 59 -
Borrower. A breakdown of project costs and financing is presented in the
Loan and Project Summary. The PAJ has agreed to provide J$1.29 million in
1982/83, J$1.64 million in 1983/84, J$1.58 million in 1984/85 and J$.60
million in 1985/86 (Project Agreement Section 2.01(e)). The Government would
make annual contributions out of its budget amounting to J$2.235 million in
1982/83, J$2.855 million in 1983/84, J$2.750 million in 1984/85 and J$1.045
million in 1985/86 (Loan Agreement Section 3.01(b)). These funds would be
shown in the accounts of KFZ as equity. The Bank loan would be onlent by the
Government to KFZ on the same terms as the Bank loan, including the foreign
exchange risk in US$ dollars in accordance with a subloan agreement acceptable
to the Bank. The Government would assume the cross-currency risk. Signing of
this subloan agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan
(Section 6.01 of Loan Agreement).
PAJ
153.      PAJ was incorporated in 1959, for the purpose of providing and
operating such port facilities in Jamaica as the Government requires. In
addition, it regulates the use of all other ports in the country. The
cargo berths in Kingston and nine other ports which include special purpose
bulk commodity handling facilities, are privately owned. About 90% of
PAJ's assets are located in the port of Kingston. They include (i) the
transshipment container terminal, (ii) its investment in KFZC, (iii) two tug
boats and other harbor service craft, and (iv) approximately 100 acres of filled
land which is treated as a "Land Bank" for future expansion. With these facili-
ties, and the seven privately owned general cargo berths, the Port of Kingston
is considered the finest in the West Indies. In general, PAJ prefers to act
as a landlord and relies on private enterprise to operate its facilities and
equipment. Private operators are paid on a cost plus basis, with PAJ receiv-
ing the net revenues. Ships also pay port dues, as well as wharfage fees, to
PAJ to cover the cost of dredged channels and wharfs.
154.      Overall policy of PAJ is set by its seven member Board of Directors,
which represent various interested government agencies and private sector
organizations. Its chairman acts as chief executive officer. PAJ has about
220 permanent staff, half of whom are engaged in providing harbor services and
maintenance. Accounts are kept manually on an accrual basis, and PAJ has
experienced long delays in determining its receivables and payables. PAJ
management is taking steps with the help of its external auditors and consul-
tants to correct these problems. The law creating KFZ requires PAJ to keep
separate accounts for KFZ, and it has started to do this on a formal basis for
the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1981. KFZC and PAJ have agreed to maintain
adequate accounts for both PAJ as a whole, and for KFZC (Section 4.01 of
Project Agreement). It was also agreed that these accounts will be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (Section 4.02 of Project Agreement).
KFZ Law
155.      The law allows for the duty free import and export of goods to and
from the Zone. Goods from the Zone can be exported into Jamaica with the
consent of the Ministry of Industry, and in such cases duty would not be



- 60 -
charged on local value added. Companies operating in the Zone may transfer
funds in and out of the Zone without restrictions, though they must get the
permission of the Bank of Jamaica to borrow from local banks. The salaries
of Jamaican employees must be paid in local currency. As long as a company
is located in the KFZ its profits related to such operation are granted total
relief from Jamaican income tax. The Kingston Export Free Zone Act of 1980
establishes the legal ground rules for firms operating in the Zone, but relies
on PAJ to make the detailed rules and regulations governing the owner/tenant
relationship. KFZC management has not yet prepared such a regulatory package,
but during negotiations it agreed to prepare such rules for the Bank's comment
by September 1982 (Section 3.04 of the Project Agreement). The PAJ agreed
that the land associated with the project would be valued by an independent
appraiser, using a method acceptable to the Bank, by September 30, 1982
(Section 2.08, Project Agreement) and the borrower agreed to include this land
within the legal boundaries of the KFZ by the same date (Section 3.02 of Loan
Agreement).
KFZ Subsidiary
156.      In February 1982, PAJ created a limited liability company, Kingston
Free Zone Company Ltd. (KFZC), to operate the Zone as its subsidiary and agent
in carrying out its responsibilities under the law. All PAJ assets in the
Zone have been transferred to the new company by means of a 99-year lease at a
nominal rent. PAJ's equity in the new company presently totals J$6.4 million.
PAJ's present ownership of 100% of the common stock is expected to drop to 60%
by the end of the project implementation period to reflect the Government's
equity contributions to the project. The Board of Directors has nine members,
six of whom are selected by the PAJ and three by the Ministry of Finance. In
all matters that require the approval of the Minister, the KFZC Board must
make recommendations to the PAJ, which will retain responsibility for obtaining
Government approvals. The day to day operation of KFZC will be the responsibil-
ity of its manager, but final responsibility for the management of the subsid-
iary would remain with PAJ, which will make available its general manager and
various department directors on the basis of a management contract.
KFZC Organization
157.      PAJ has seconded its 28 staff members who were working full-time
on free zone business to the KFZC. These include the manager, a chief of
planning and development, four promotion officers and a chief accountant.
Full time support staff total 21 of which 14 provide security and 7 adminis-
trative support. Common services such as accounting, legal, engineering
and procurement have been provided by PAJ staff on a part-time basis. Free
Zone operations have now achieved the size to justify separate accounting
and a project engineer, though legal, procurement and engineering support
services will continue to be provided by PAJ under its management contract.
158.      All employers within the free zone are subject to the local labor
laws, which among other things require adequate toilet and washing facilities
and a separate covered area for employee dining in each plant. There are no



- 61 -
restrictions against labor unions within the KFZ. Though most large manu-
facturing operations in Jamaica have been unionized, only one plant within the
KFZ has a union at present. Salaries offered by firms within the Zone are
competitive with those available for similar work in Kingston. Working condi-
tions within the Zone are considered better than normal for Kingston as all
buildings are relatively new and well maintained. Special training programs
for workers in new industries are organized through the Jamaica Vocational
Training Development Institute and other agencies under the Ministry of
Labor and Public Service.
Marketing Strategy
159.      In the short run, KFZC's strategy is to follow up on many contacts
made with foreign investors as part of an international promotion program
carried out in 1980-81 by the World Trade Institute. The program concentrated
on the labor intensive sectors of garments and electronics, primarily in the
U.S. market.  Most of the companies contacted were reluctant to make commit-
ments until the legal status of the KFZ was officially defined and the local
investment climate improved. Now that both of these impediments have been
removed, KFZC's management has re-established contacts with the companies
it believes might still be interested. Afterwards, this program would be
expanded to identify other companies in these sectors during 1982. In doing
so, KFZC hopes to attract a sufficient number of initial occupants to achieve
credibility and increasing interest in the foreign business community.
160.      While priority would be given to labor intensive manufacturing
companies which would generate more foreign exchange for Jamaica, management
feels that at the beginning, it cannot be too selective in its choice of
investors. Warehousing, trading and distribution activities, though not
characterized by high levels of value added or jobs created, would be accept-
able in the initial stage, if they (i) generate substantial shipping traffic
for the port; (ii) are likely to evolve into manufacturing operations later;
or (iii) have sufficient international status to improve the image of the
zone. As a "critical mass" of operating firms is achieved, it would be used
as a promotional tool to attract industries that will have more structural
permanence. They would have the ability to generate increased value added
from greater amounts of locally supplied materials. Production processes would
be more complex and require higher skill levels for workers.
161.      Based on KFZC's past performance under difficult conditions, and on
the improved climate for investment in Jamaica, demand for SFBs in the Free
Zone is estimated at 20 units a year for a total of 80 over the four year
execution period. KFZC would accelerate or slow construction of the project as
warranted by market conditions. The ideal, sought by all EPZs, is to time the
construction of new facilities in parallel with, but slighty in advance of,
effective demand, so that at all times a few factory units are ready, or very
close to being ready, for occupancy.
Financial Analysis of KFZ
162.      KFZC, as subborrower of the proposed Bank loan funds, under a subloan
agreement with the Government, would be responsible for servicing this debt



- 62 -
and bearing the associated foreign exchange risk in US dollars. It would be re-
sponsible for maintaining all KFZ facilities, though its leases with tenants
also require them to do so as well. On its part, the PAJ would be obligated to
make a substantial contribution to the local counterpart in the financing plan.
The following analysis concentrates on the financial viability of KFZC as a
subborrower responsible for project execution while PAJ's ability to provide
its share of the financing plan addressed below.
163.      The revenue forecast for KFZC assumes a continuation of its present
pricing policy, of full cost recovery. During negotiations it was agreed that
factory space financed by the Bank and completed during FY82 and FY83 would
be rented at rates sufficient to yield annual revenue of not less than 11X of
the capital invested. It was further agreed that in order to improve KFZC's
projected financial position and the project's financial rate of return, KFZC
would charge annual rents of 12% on SFBs completed in FY84 and FY85 and 13%
on those completed in FY86 as competitive conditions in the Caribbean
permit. KFZC's policy of reviewing leases every two years with reasonable
upward adjustments of rent on renewal to approximate rental rates on current
construction would be maintained (Schedule 2, Part B of the Project Agreement).
A proforma financial forecast for the fiscal years 1982-89 shows that KFZ's net
income is not expected to become positive until FY86, though net cash flow
becomes positive a year earlier. Accumulated deficits in cash flow after debt
service total J$1.3 million in 1982-1984. In order to cover these deficits as
well as to bridge the gap between project expenditures and reimbursement from
the Bank loan, PAJ has agreed to make available or guarantee short term
financing to KFZC, if the latter cannot otherwise obtain it from commercial
sources on reasonable terms (Section 2.01e of Project Agreement). In the
first full year of operation after completion of the project (FY87) KFZC's debt
service coverage ratio is expected to be only 1.25. This ratio increases to
1.42 in FY89. Its debt-equity ratio would reach a high of 59:41 in FY85, and
would decline rapidly thereafter. Increasing debt beyond this level is not
considered prudent in light of the anticipated three years of losses necessary
to reach profitability. For this reason, PAJ and the Government would be expected
to supply the local counterpart (J$16.0 million) for the project as equity.
KFZC has agreed not to incur any long term debt unless its projected annual cash
flow would exceed 1.5 times its projected debt service for each fiscal year
(Project Agreement Section 4.03). Given the debt service coverage projections
presented above, it is not anticipated that KFZC would incur additional long term
debt through 1989.
Financial Rate of Return
164.      The project's financial rate of return (FIRR) is calculated by
considering the revenues and costs associated with the project. The FIRR for
the project over a 23 year period is estimated at about 10% in constant
prices, if rents are increased in accordance with the agreed pricing policy
in real terms. If 2KFZC cannot increase rental rates in real terms beyond the
present US$3.50 ft (11% of construction costs), the FIRR becomes 8%.



- 63 -
Benefits, Justification and Risks
165.      The principal purpose of the proposed expenditures for constructing
and operating the KFZ is to attract foreign investors to Jamaica by offering
factory shells and services to exporting enterprises. This investment would
subsequently induce a series of further investments by these enterprises in
furnishing and equipping the factory shells for productive purposes. A
comprehensive economic evaluation of the KFZ project should thus include net
benefits from both the principal and the induced investments. Because of
the difficulties associated with trying to determine the probable costs of
induced investments and the net benefits which would emerge from them, the
economic analysis assumed that the jobs to be created in the zone would be
similar in number, per square foot, to those created in the past. Since the
firms are expected to import most material inputs and to export most outputs,
and will not pay taxes, the economic benefits of their activities will be
primarily the jobs that they provide.
166.      The conservatively defined economic benefits to Jamaica would in-
clude (i) rental income at US$3.50 ft2/yr, increasing to US$4.25 ft2/yr in
1986; and (ii) the wages paid by the firms for local labor. Wages are a US$
cost to the firms, but are converted to local currency by the Central Bank.
The economic costs of the project to Jamaica are the capital costs of the
project less duties and taxes, and the marginal costs of operating it.
Because of the critical shortage of foreign exchange in Jamaica a shadow
exchange rate with the US$, which is 20% higher than the existing rate has
been used on all foreign costs and benefits. Based on the above assumptions,
the project has an economic return of about 35%. If wage benefits are shadow
priced at 50% rather than the 75% used in the base case, the ERR becomes about
28%.
167.      In addition to the economic benefits included in the calculation of
the rate of return, there are induced benefits related to goods and services
purchased in Jamaica, other than the direct labor used in their operations. An
important part of KFZ's marketing plan is to attract firms which have the
potential to develop backward linkages to the Jamaican economy. Experience in
other free zones has shown that many opportunities will be created for small-
scale, satellite enterprises to supply inputs to firms located in the EPZ and
sell goods to workers from the zone. The project would also provide training
and experience in technical skills, management quality control and international
marketing.
168.      A financial projection of PAJ's operations shows that during the
project execution period (1982-86), PAJ would generate enough cashflow to
cover its debt service obligations, its equity contribution to the project,
and have J$2.1 million in cash to use for other purposes. The limited amount
of cash available for investment is primarily due to high debt service require-
ments associated with PAJ's borrowing program to finance large investments in
port operations planned during this period. Its equity contribution to the
KFZ project makes up only about 17% of its capital investment budget for the
period 1982-1986. Funds available for other purposes represents the extra
margin of coverage for PAJ's equity contribution to the project. If PAJ's



- 64 -
gross revenues turn out to be less than projected, it can: (i) generate the
required cash flow for investment in the project by postponing its port invest-
ments, thereby reducing its debt service requirements, (ii) draw down some of
its cash balances or (iii) use short term bridge financing to make up the
difference. Possible revaluation of its foreign currency long term debt
obligations may cause non cash accounting losses in the future, as they have
in the past. About 70% of PAJ's revenues are either collected in US$ or,
while charged in local currency, are tied to the US$. Its foreign currency
risk is thus limited to the cross currency risks between the US$ and the other
foreign currencies it has borrowed. 1/ Since its expenses, not related to
debt service, are paid primarily in local currency, possible future devalu-
ations of the J$ relative to the US$ would tend to improve PAJ's cashflow.
169.      The competitiveness of Jamaican labor costs cou'ld decline, if
realistic exchange rate policies are not pursued by the government. Such an
occurance would also lower demand for KFZ facilities. The possibility of
construction costs exceeding the estimates is not expected to affect the
economic rate of return, as KFZC has agreed to tie rents to construction
costs. Rents could become too high to be competitive, according to the pricing
formula, if the J$-US$ exchange rate becomes unrealistic. If competitive con-
ditions in the Caribbean do not permit KFZC to raise the level of its rents in
real terms as agreed with the Bank and US$3.50 ft /yr is maintained, the ERR
decreases from 35% to 34%.
170.      If for whatever reason the KFZ experiences less demand than is ex-
pected during the construction phase of the project, it can deal with the
problem by reducing the number of factories to be constructed. The risk of
having unoccupied buildings during this period would thus be limited to the
two or three modules that KFZ plans to construct in advance of firm demand.
After the project is completed, there is a risk that an unrealistic Jamaican
exchange rate might make local labor so uncompetitive that some existing firms
would not renew their rental contracts. If such a situation were to occur
during a five year period starting two years after completion of the project,
and 30% of the project's SFB's were vacant during this period, the FIRR would
drop from 10% to 8%, and the ERR from 35% to 32%. It is reasonable to assume
that in such an eventuality government policy would be adjusted as needed.
PART VII - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
171.      The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Kingston Free Zone Company and the Port Authority
of Jamaica and the Bank and the report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed
separately. Special conditions of the loan are listed in Annex III, Section III.
1/   As of April 1, 1981, 60% of PAJ's long term debts were in US$,30% in
Norwegian kroner, and 10% in British pounds.



- 65 -
Special conditions of effectiveness are that the Subsidiary Loan Agreement has
been signed by the Borrower and KFZ, and the appointment of a project manager
whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment shall
be acceptable to the Bank.
172.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VIII - RECOMMENDATION
173.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.  Status of Projects in Execution as of September 30, 1981
Ln. No. 1003-JM: Sites and Services: US$15.0 million Loan of June 13,
1974; Effective date: September 9, 1974;
Closing date: June 30, 1982.
Project implementation is about 4-1/2 years behind schedule due
to delays in establishing and staffing the project unit and problems with
contractors. These delays resulted in a substantial cost overrun of the
original project. In view of the Government's budgetary constraints the
project has therefore been restructured to allow for some reduction in the
number of lots to be developed and for a significant reduction in housing
standards. The Government has recently proposed additional changes
involving the provision of shell houses on uncommitted lots and the
conversion of one site into an industrial estate. The Bank will study
these proposals but has not yet taken a position. The revised project is
expected to be completed by mid-1982.
1   Loan of $11.4 million for Jamaica Flour Mills Ltd. approved, but not
signed.

Ln. No. 1032-JM: Third Highway Project: US$13.5 million Loan of July 26,
1974; Effective date: September 27, 1974; Closing date:
September 30, 1981.
Construction has been delayed due to shortages of engineering
staff, reliable equipment, cement and asphalt. The project is now
completed, about four years later than the appraisal estimate.
Ln. No. 1146-JM: Kingston Sewerage and Water Supply Project: US$15 million
Loan of July 23, 1975; Effective date: June 24, 1976;
Closing date: December 31, 1981.
Project implementation is more than 3 years behind the appraisal
schedule but is now proceeding satisfactorily. The Borrower's financial
position has, however, continuously deteriorated. A 45% tariff increase
took effect August 1, 1981 but additional measures will be required of the
Borrower in order to comply with the Loan Agreement.
Ln. No. 1284-JM: Second Population Project: US$6.8 million Loan of June
12, 1976; Effective date: August 30, 1976; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Project implementation has progressed reasonably well. The civil
works on health center facilities are expected to be completed by the end
of 1981. Disbursements are however lagging behind. Completion of other
project components is expected to be delayed until early 1982.
Ln. No. 1464-JM: Rural Development Project: US$15 million Loan of June 29,
1977; Effective date: October 14, 1977; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Project implementation had initially been slow due to shortage of
funds, manpower problems and the difficult general economic situation.
Recent progress has however been encouraging; most project components are
now under implementation and are advancing satisfactorily. The first group
of settlers has been placed and a large share of the farm homes have been
completed.
Ln. No. 1516-JM: Second Power Project: US$20 million Loan of March 6,
1978; Effective date: June 1, 1978; Closing date:
September 30, 1982.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily after
considerable delays during the initial phase of project implementation, and
most of the loan proceeds have been committed. JPSC's operations have been
seriously affected by the limited availability of its most fuel efficient
generating units due to poor maintenance and operating procedures and a
lack of spare parts. The Government has requested a Bank loan for the
rehabilitation of these units, and for improvements to JPSC's transmission
and distribution system. Although JPSC's financial position has improved,
an increase in tariffs will be required to meet the agreed covenant.

Ln. No. 1517-JM: Sugar Rehabilitation Project: US$18 million Loan of March
6, 1978; Effective date: June 1, 1978; Closing date:
June 30, 1983.
Although some progress in the rehabilitation of factories has
been made, implementation slowed down during the last two years due to the
extremely difficult financial position of the National Sugar Company,
executor of the project. The Government is now planning the divestment of
the sugar mills owned by NSC and the dissolution of the sugarcane
cooperatives that supply the cane. The future of the project will be
decided in negotiations with the Government.
Ln. No. 1609-JM: Small Scale Enterprise Development Project: US$7 million
Loan of August 2, 1978; Effective date: December 27,
1978; Closing date: June 30, 1982.
Implementation of the program for modern small scale enterprises
executed by the Premier Investment Corporation (PIC) is ahead of schedule.
Implementation of the sub-program for very small scale enterprises has been
adversely affected by the uncertainty concerning the institutional
arrangements. Subject to Government confirmation remaining uncommitted
funds from this project could be reallocated to PIC.
Ln. No. 1715-JM: Second Program Loan: US$31.5 million Loan of June 8,
1979; Effective date: August 27, 1979; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Loan proceeds allocated to the Export Development Fund to finance
imports of raw materials and components for expansion of nontraditional
exports have been fully disbursed. Implementation of the technical
assistance components financed with loan proceeds is proceeding
satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1716-JM: Forestry Project: US$12 million Loan of June 8, 1979;
Effective date: December 11, 1979; Closing date: June
30, 1985.
Project implementation is behind schedule but is proceeding
satisfactorily. Actual planting and clearing has been delayed as a result
of Government decision to reallocate some project land to coffee
production.
Ln. No. 1740-JM: Fourth Highway Project: US$16 million Loan of July 10,
1979; Effective date: September 20, 1979; Closing date:
March 31, 1983.
The project has encountered serious delays caused primarily by
extraordinary rains and floods in 1979, a hurricane in 1980, shortages of
key staff and of budget resources. In view of the Government's difficult

ANNEX II
Page 5
budgetary position and the need for urgent rehabilitation, the project has
been restructured to allow utilization of loan funds for essential
maintenance work by reducing targets for more expensive types of periodic
maintenance.
Ln. No. 1978-JM: Second Export Development Poject: US$37 million Loan of
May 15, 1981; Effective date: August 6, 1981; Closing
date: December 31, 1983.
The loan includes US$22 million for financing of imports of raw
materials and spare parts for expansion of nontraditional exports. In
addition US$10 million are allocated to provide medium-term financing to
exporters and their suppliers for capital equipment and working capital.
US$4 million are to be used for financing inputs of imports for the banana
industry and US$1 million is for technical assistance to JECIC and JNEC.
Ln. No. 2017-JM: Offshore Petroleum Exploration Project: US$7.5 million
Loan of June 16, 1981; Effective date:
Closing date: June 30, 1985.
The project is directed at promoting exploration of Jamaica's
hydrocarbon potential by strengthening the Petroleum Company of Jamaica
both as a partner of private international companies and as an independent,
investor. This loan is not yet effective.
