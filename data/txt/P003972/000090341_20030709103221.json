was likely,\n            the institutional development impact was substantial, and\n            the Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory.\n            The lessons learned include: Institutional Development -\n            continuing restructuring and reorganization of local\n            governments and Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research\n            and Development (IAARD), resulting from the decentralization\n            of the government, has caused confusion about the roles of\n            various agencies at the provincial and district levels. As a\n            consequence, change management practices need to be\n            incorporated into the operating procedures for IAARD. When\n            reforming an institution that involves merging of personnel\n            from different agencies, tasked to do similar work,\n            comparable remuneration and benefits should be instituted up\n            front, and made a conditionality of project implementation.\n            To institutionalize gender and social issues in an\n            organization, it is important to mainstream gender and\n            social concerns early, organize teams, and train staff in\n            this topic. Regional Technology Assessment - Technological\n            innovations are more likely to be useful to and adopted by\n            farmers/fishers when they are tested and validated in a\n            participative manner under local conditions.\n            Farmer-to-farmer exchanges are very effective mechanisms for\n            introducing improved technologies. Any follow-up project\n            should give high priority to promoting farmer-managed\n            assessment and dissemination activities. Research and\n            Assessment Management - Local governments are only willing\n            to provide funding when they see tangible benefits to\n            farmers/fishers in their province or district.\n            Decentralization of Research and Development activities\n            becomes more successful when the IAARD accompanies this with\n            appropriate decentralization of authority and clear mandates."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
