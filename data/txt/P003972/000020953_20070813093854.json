ratings:\n            outcome was satisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was substantial; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The Decentralized Agricultural and Forestry\n            Extension Project had the following ratings: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was substantial; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from this assessment\n            included: 1) Extension projects with grant-funded\n            Farmer-Managed Activities should provide for early\n            recognition of highly profitable farm-level innovations and\n            for dissemination to other farmers. Such projects should\n            facilitate the timely identification and dissemination of\n            both farmer-managed and research station innovations that\n            are profitable; 2) Research and extension projects should\n            directly address rather than bypass the problem of an\n            ineffective public sector extension service; 3) If a project\n            is de facto a pilot, then designate it a pilot project. The\n            Decentralized Agricultural and Forestry Extension Project\n            would have benefited from being explicitly designated as a\n            pilot project. Its expected outcomes would not have been as\n            high; 4) Project appraisal documents should describe not\n            only what activities are proposed, but also why they are\n            proposed; and 5) Projects should provide early intensive\n            training to local project staff on the application of Bank\n            procurement guidelines in order to prevent procurement deficiencies."}, "docdt": "2007-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
