INDIA
SECOND FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01   India's commercially exploitable energy resources consist of coal,
oil, gas, hydro potential and uranium, which account for about 46% of the
total primary energy supply. Non-commercial energy, firewood and
agricultural and animal waste account for the rest. Coal 1/ is the main
domestic source of primary energy, with potential reserves estimated at about
85 billion tons, of which 25 billion tons are proven reserves. Most of the
coal is of low to medium quality (3,500 to 5,500 kcal/kg) with a high ash
content (up to 50%). India's remaining proven and potential reserves of
fluid hydrocarbons are currently estimated at 800 million tons of oil
equivalent, of which 470 million tons is oil and the remainder natural gas.
Domestic production of oil has increased from 0.5 million tons in 1961 to
16.2 million tons in 1982 and currently meets about 44% of the country's oil
requirements. Annual gas production is estimated at about 3.1 million tons
of oil equivalent, of which about 60% is used as fuel or feedstock, and the
balance is flared, mainly because there is no market within reasonable
distance. The economically exploitable hydro-electric potential of India is
about 100,000 MW, of which only about 12,000 HW has been developed. Another
4,700 KW is under construction, and 23,000 MW is under investigation. India
also has sufficient uranium (about 15,000 ton equivalent of U3 O
economically exploitable) and thorium reserves to meet the count§y's demand
for nuclear power in the foreseeable future.
1.02    India's energy policy has been geared to limiting the use of
petroleum to sectors where it cannot be economically substituted by other
energy resources, particularly coal. Despite the recent development of the
offshore petroleum reserves, the country remains dependent, to a large
extent, on imported oil to meet growing demand for transportation,
fertilizers and petrochemicals, as well as in agriculture where substitution
by electricity continues to be limited by insufficient power generation and
distribution. The cost of oil imports in 1981/82 was US$6 billion,
representing about 70Z of India's estimated merchandise export earnings.
Well identified domestic energy reserves of coal and hydro-electricity are
large enough to supply most of India's future commercial energy requirements
for industry and power generation. However, proven oil and gas reserves are
not sufficient to meet the demand for oil in sectors where substitution by
other fuels is not economically viable.

1.03    Renewable energy resources accounted for about 59% of the total
supply of primary energy in 1975/76, but since then its share has been
declining. Wood, charcoal, dung and vegetable waste accounted for an
estimated 92% of the renewable energy supply. The rest was in the form of
hydro-electric power. It is expected that renewable energy (especially
traditional fuels) will continue to play an important, though decreasing,
role in the supply of energy in rural areas in the coming decades.
Energy Prospects
1.04    Studies prepared in 1979 by a Working Group on Energy Policy
appointed by GOI indicate that the availability of commercial energy may
become a serious constraint to India's economic development and recommended a
systematic program for energy conservation and demand management. The main
policy measures recommended are: (i) improvement in the efficiency of energy
utilization; (ii) introduction of fuel-efficient technologies; (iii)
reduction of the demand for transportation through improved planning of
production and consumption locations; (iv) reduction of the energy intensity
of industries; and (v) inter-fuel substitution from commercial energy
resources to non-commercial and renewable energy resources. According to the
studies, such measures, supplemented by appropriate pricing policies, are
expected to restrain commercial energy consumption without impeding economic
growth.
Energy Pricing Policies
1.05    India has consistently followed a policy of maintaining composite
retail prices of oil products at international levels. All products except
kerosene and naptha are priced at or above border prices. Although there is
a cross-subsidy from gasoline to kerosene, based on social and environmental
considerations, the weighted average prices for all products are highar than
import prices. Coal prices are generally below the economic cost of supply
to the country. Although most of the Indian coal is non-tradeable due to its
low quality, there are substantial amounts of steam and coking coal.
Adjusting for quality, quantity and duration of contracts, the estimated
price for tradeable Indian steam coal would be, at the pithead, between US$29
to US$37 per ton, compared to current price which ranges between US$21 to
US$30 per ton. The situation is similar for coking coal whose pithead
estimated trading price is between US$30 and US$54, while the domestic price
is between US$19 and US$46. For non-tradeable coal there are indications
that it is priced below the long run marginal cost (LRMC) given the financial
losses incurred by the producers and the relatively low levels of resources
mobilized by the industry. There is no uniform pricing system for gas in
India. Currently, its price is fixed on the basis of form of production
(associated or free) and on the type of supply contract. There are no
studies on its LRMC of supply. Although there are variations among State
Electricity Boards (SEBs) in the price of electricity, the average tariff is
below the estimated LRMC. in 10 out of 15 SEBs, average industrial tariffs
a



-3-
approach LRMC whilst for domestic consumers LRMC is about three times the
average tariff, and for agricultural consumers it is about four times the
average tariff. The weighted average LRMC for all SEB consumers is nearly
twice the average revenue. GOI is aware of this discrepancy and has made
explicit its policy for rationalizing energy prices. Coal prices were
increased by 30% in February 1982, 16.5% in May 1982, and 25% in January
1984. There also has been a considerable increase in the power sector
prices. From 1981 to 1983, electricity prices increased by about 28%
compared to a 6.3% increase in the general wholesale price index in the same
period.
The Power Subsector
1.06    In recognition of the need to develop indigenous energy resources,
coal based generation and hydro-electricity have been receiving top priority
in Central and State Government policy planning. The power sector now
receives the largest share of India's public investment resources (20% of the
Sixth Five-Year Plan outlay). In spite of this emphasis, demand for power
continues to exceed supply. In keeping with the global energy policy, GOI
has also indicated the need to increase the hydro-power capacity to achieve a
more efficient operation of power systems, which presently are predtennantly
thermal (coal based), and to make better use of the existing thermal cap.city
through upgrading and improved operation and maintenance.
Power Supply and Demand
1.07    In the 1950s and 1960s, installed capacity and power generation
managed to keep pace with the nation's demand for power. Both grew during
that period at an average annual rate of about 11%. Since 1970, however, thte
situation has deteriorated. Delays in the commissioning of new power plants,
operating and maintenance problems (mostly due to lower than expected coal
quality), and insufficient investment under severe budget constraints have
led to a critical shortage of power. Between 1970-1975, power generation
increased at an average annual rate of about 5%. The situation improved
considerably between 1975-1980, with growth in both generation and capacity
averaging 7%-9% annually. This was largely due to successively good monsoons
in 1975/76 and 1976/77, improved coal supply, and a concerted effort to
Improve project implementation, thermal capacity utilization and overall
power system management. Since 1979/80 power generation has been increasing
at a higher rate than installed capacity. Data for 1980/81 and 1981/82 show
an average annual increase for these two years of about 8.0% for power
generation and 6.5% for installed capacity, indicating better utilization of
existing resources. Nevertheless, power shortages have persisted in many
parts of the country.
1.08    As of March 1983, India's total installed generating capacity,
including non-utility plant, was about 38,100 MW. Of this, about 63Z was
conventional thermal, 35% hydro, and 2% nuclear. Annex 1 shows the relevant
figures for the power sector in India between 1951 and 1983. Industry



-4-
accounts for about 60X of all electricity sold in the country, agriculture
(mainly irrigation) for about 18%, domestic use for about 12%, and other
consumers for about 10%. As a result of accelerated agricultural
development, there has been a marked growth of power consumption in the rural
areas where more than 80Z of India's population lives. The number of
electrified villages, for example, grew from approximately 3,000 in 1950/51
to an estimated 300,000, or about 52% of all villages in India, by the end of
1982. Projections made by India's Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for
its long-term power plan indicate that over the thirteen-year period
1981/82-1994/95, utility generating capacity should grow at an average annual
rate of about 9.5%, to a total of about 106,000 MW. Of this, about 59,000 MW
(56%) would be thermal, 44,000 MW (41%) hydro and 3,500 MW (3Z) nuclear.
Annex 2 shows the forecast capacity and energy requirements for India up to
year 1992 (as estimated by CEA), based on the long term National Power Plan,
1983.
Bank Group Operations in the Power Sector
1.09    Since 1954, the Bank Group has made 15 loans to India for power
projects amounting to US$1,389.6 million, and 16 IDA credits totalling
US$2,266 million. Of these, US$2,465.4 million was for generating projects;
US$23 million for construction equipment for the Beas hydro-electric project;
US$630.7 million for the provision of high-voltage transmission projects; and
US$536.5 million for the support of rural electrification schemes. Fifteen
loans and credits have been completed. The list of Bank loans and IDA
credits for power projects in India is given in Annex 3.
1.10    A project performance audit was conducted in 1980 for the Second
Power Transmission Project (Credit 242-IN). The project was considered to
have been successful in assisting the nine beneficiary SEBs in extending
their transmission systems to meet the growing power requirements.
Utilization of generating capacity in these SEBs exceeded the appraisal
forecast. Rehabilitation of the finances of SEBs, which commenced under this
project, is continulng under subsequent projects. The audit highlighted the
difficulties of adequately supervising this project, which consisted of many
widely scattered subprojects, and of effecting institutional improvements in
the absence of a close working relationship between the Bank Group and the
beneficiary SEBs. With the assumption of increased responsibility by CEA in
the power sector, a more effective relationship with SEBs is envisaged.
Sector Institutions
1.11    Under the Indian Constitution, the responsibility for supplying power
is shared by the Central and State Governments, and full agreement between
the two is required for the Implementation of most actions. The principal
agencies in the sector are: the State Electricity Boards (SEBs), the Regional
Electricity Boards (REBs), the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the



-5-.
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydro-Electric Power
Corporation (NHPC), and the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
1.12    SEBs were constituted by the State Governments under the provisions
of the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, to promote the efficient and
coordinated development of generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity, and to control and regulate public utilities and private
licensees within the States. The States effectively own or control over 90%
of electricity supply facilities. Although SEBs are corporate entities and
enjoy some autonomy in the management of their day-to-day operations, they
are under the co-trol of State Governments in matters covering capital
investment, tariffs, borrowings, pay scales and personnel policies.
1.13    With the physical interconnection of State systems forming regional
systems, there has been an increased need for interstate coordination. In
response to improved operation and planning, REBs have been set up for each
of the Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern Regions. The
general function of an RES is to coordinate the operation of the power system
to the maximum benefit of the Region as a whole, to coordinate overhaul and
maintenance programs, to determine generation schedules and power available
for transrer between States, and to determine tariffs for the transfer of
power within the Region.
1.14    The CEA was constituted in 1950 with responsibility for formulating
national power policies and coordinating the activities of the various
agencies involved in electricity supply. Its powers were extended by
amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 in 1976. It is now also
responsible for the formulation and coordination of plans for power
development, optimization of investments in the power sector for the whole
country, development of interconnected system, operation, training of
personnel, and research and development. CEA accumulates data on economic,
financial and accounting aspects of the power industry, both at the Center
and State levels, with particular reference to the operations of SEBs, and
advises them on financial matters. In addition, CEA plays the role of
consultant to SEBs for the engineering of electro-mechanical elements of the
systems. Working in coordination with CEA, the Central Water Commission
(CWC), under the Ministry of Irrigation, is responsible for the preparation
and approval of all civil engineering aspects of hydro-electric projects and
serves as the consultant to SEBs in this regard.
1.15    Economic and technical considerations indicated the need to construct
and operate major generation and transmission facilities, where size exceeds
SEBs' needs and capabilities. For this reason, in 1975 GOI incorporated NTPC
and NHPC, for the purpose of constructing, owning and operating large power
stations, as well as high-voltage power transmission lines and associated
substations. NTPC has under construction and partly in operation about
10,000 MW of generating capacity in six large thermal power stations, while
NHPC is building three hydro stations. Although the Central Government is



-6-
becoming increasingly important in the sector, the SEBs will continue to play
a major role, particularly in hydro-electric projects. The States own most
hydro sites and are unlikely to turn over these sources of comparatively
inexpensive energy to the Center. NHPC can develop hydro sites only when the
water rights are clear and the State has surrendered its claim on them.
1.16    The REC was constituted in 1969 and registered under the Companies
Act of 1956 as a limited company wholly owned by GOI. Its primary objective
is to finance rural electrification schemes prepared by SEBs throughout
India, functioning as a financial intermediary with technical expertise, and
ensuring the efficient onlending of funds drawn primarily from GOI. REC
coordinates its lending operations with the activities of other agencies
which provide financing for rural development. Although the amount of REC
financial support is small in relation to total SEB operations, REC today
finances more than half of total rural electrification expenditures.
Bank Group Strategy in the Power Sector
1.17    The Bank Group has had a continuing dialogue with GOI in seeking
solutions to a number of complex and politically sensitive problems which
have confronted the Indian electricity supply industry. The sensitivity of
Center-State relations, and the political constraints arising from the fact
that electricity supply is within the concurrent jurisdiction of the Central
and State Governments (para 1.11), have dictated a policy of seeking progress
through cooperation. Specifically, the Bank Group's main objectives in its
lending operations in the power sector are: (a) to accelerate the
installation of generating and transmission capacity to eliminate power
shortages, and to promote measures to improve the operation and maintenance
of existing plants; (b) to foster comprehensive long-range regional and
national system planning to ensure implementation of a least-cost power
development program; (c) to promote improvements in sector organization and
training; and (d) to strengthen the finances of the sector institutions,
particularly SEBs.
1.18    Some noteworthy results have been achieved, which include:  (a) the
establishment of REBs and later of the Centrally-owned power companies (NTPC
and NHPC); (b) reorganization and strengthening of CEA through amendment of
the Electricity (Supply) Act in 1976; (c) amendment of the financial
provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, which provided for the operation
of SEBs on a more commercial basis, with the objective of financing a
reasonable proportion of their investments from internal resources (para
1.19); (d) implementation of action plans by a number of SEBs, designed to
improve their financial performance through tariff increases, rationalization
of manpower requirements, improved maintenance management, and the
introduction of other cost-effective measures; (e) completion of tariff
studies by most SEBs with a view to reassessing tariff policies; (f)
satisfactory progress of NTPC's generation/transmission construction program



-7-
with Bank Group assistance; and (g) establishment of the Committee on Power
to rei'ew all aspects of the Dower sector (para 1.20).
1.19    Two areas of specific concern to the Bank Group in the past have been
the lack of a nationwide long-range plan for power development, and the weak
financial position of some SEBs. Based on terms of reference suggested by
the Bank, CEA completed in 1983 a long-term National Power Plan providing
a forecast of power demand through the year 2000 and the least cost solution
for the generating capacity and necessary equipment required to meet this
demand. GOI is in the process of adopting the National Power Plan, which
would be updated periodically and would become the basis for both five- year
plans and annual investment programs. With regard to the financial situation
of SEBs, there has been considerable improvement in their overall performance
since 1978/79. With the approval in 1982 of the Third Rural Electrification
Project (Loan 2165-IN), new financial performance criteria were established,
which set specific levels of internal cash generation and rural
electrification subsidies to be paid by the States to projects. SEBs have
already undertaken to fulfill these requirements. These measures are
adequate and should lead to further improvements in SEBs' financial
performance in the 1980s. In August 1983 the Parliament of India approved a
number of amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, which were
proposed after discussions with the Bank. This action removed the legal
obstacles to SEBs operating as commercial entities. GO! expects to implement
the amendments in April 1985, the beginning of the SEB's next fiscal year. A
summary of the amendments approved is presented in Annex 4.
1.20    In 1978, GOI recognized that all aspects of the sector needed to be
reviewed in depth and that satisfactory solutions had to be found for
outstanding sector development problems. Consequently, it established in
November of that year a Committee on Power, whose purpose was to examine all
aspects of the power industry and make recommendations for improvements. The
committee submitted its recommendations to GOI in September 1980. These
recommendations refer to all aspects of the power sector: planning, project
formulation and implementation, operation and maintenance, organization and
management, finance, financial management and tariffs, rural electrification,
and research and development. Implementation of most of the Committee's
recommendations is already underway; for example, better planning procedures
and improved operations and maintenance management. However, other important
measures require due deliberation by GOI and the State Governments and their
joint agreement before they can be implemented. These relate to sector
development plans, organizational structure of the institutions, and sector
finances.
1.21    In 1982, GOI submitted a program for the implementation of five
categories of power sector improvements which the Bank Group considered areas
of high priority. The five categories are: (a) improving the performance of
thermal power plants: (b) coordinating power development with the development
of other sectors; (c) intensifying hydro-electric power development; (d)



-8-
strengthening the role of the Central Government in power generation and
transmission; and (e) establishing appropriate financial objectives and
policies for SEBs. GOI has taken several concrete steps in this direction.
For example, teams of specialists have been appointed by the Department of
Power to visit all power plants with 100/120 MW and 200/210 MW thermal
generating units in the country to diagnose technical and operational
problems, and to propose solutions and assign responsibilities for their
implementation. The phase of diagnosis was completed by mid-1983 and a
detailed program has been worked out which includes, for each power plant,
remedial measures, their cost and time frame for implementation as well as
the expected improvement in plant performance. The program also includes
proposals with regard to spare parts and training of operational personnel.
During negotiations, the Indian delegation presented the scope and content of
the thermal power plant rehabilitation program and reiterated GOI's intention
to request the Bank to finance a project of thermal power plant
rehabilitation, possibly in FY 1985/86. The first Bank Group supported
hydro-electric project in India (Upper Indravati) was approved in FY 1982,
and a number of others, in addition to the proposed Bodhghat project, are in
advanced stages of preparation. NTPC has been decentralized, to achieve a
more effective monitoring, control and operation of its power generation and
transmission facilities. Finally, amendment of the financial provisions of
the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 has been approved by GOI; a uniform
system of commercial accounting for the SEBs is under development; and new
financial performance criteria for the SEBs have been introduced (para 1.19).
Power Supply and Demand in the Eastern Region
1.22    The Eastern Region is comprised of the States of West Bengal, Orissa,
and Bihar, which will be served by the proposed project. The major power
suppliers in this Region are the SEBs of each of the above three States, the
Damodar Valley Corporation, the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation,
Durgapur Products Limited, and The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC),
wholly owned by the Government of India (GOI), who will implement, operate
and own the proposed project facilities. -
1.23    During the late 1970s, installed capacity in the Region increased by
about 5% per year. Plant utilization, however, deteriorated during the
latter years, resulting in a decrease in generation in 1979/80 and only small
increases thereafter. This was attributable largely to inadequate
maintenance of SEBs' thermal power plants, labor disputes affecting plant
operations and coal supply, and institutional weaknesses of the SEBs.
Potential unconstrained peak demand in the Region is expected to grow by
about 8% per annum until 1995. Although installed capacity is projected to
increase at a rate of about 9.5% per. annum until 1995, relatively reliable
supply is unlikely to be attained before the early 1990s. The probability of
loss of load, particularly if high forced outage rates continue, will be
unacceptably high throughout the 1980s. Supply restrictions will have to



-9-
continue for some time to come, and can only be eased through the timely
implementation of projects and rapid improvement in plant maintenance. New
additions to capacity in the Eastern Region during the 1980s will be
predominantly thermal. New sites available for hydro development are limited
and will take time to develop. However, hydro-power development is planned
to increase significantly during the early 1990s, so that by 1995 it is
expected that about 30Z of total installed capacity in the Region will be
hydro. Much of this increase in hydro capacity will take place in Orissa,
where more than 1,000 MW will be commissioned by 1990, and a further 1,000 MW
could be developed thereafter. The Farakka power plant (2,100 MW) in West
Bengal, together with the future Kahalgaon power plant (2,800 MW) in Bihar
and the planned three - State project at Talcher (3,000 MW) in Orissa, all of
which will be owned by NTPC, will contribute to a significant increase in
thermal power capacity in the Eastern Region. The existing and forecast
situation of power supply in the Eastern Region is shown in Annexes 5 through
8.

II. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
2.01    NTPC, the beneficiary of the proposed loan, was established in 1975
and is registered under the Companies Act, 1956. It is a company wholly
owned by GOI and functions under the general supervision of the Ministry of
Energy. Its initial authorized share capital of Rs. 1,250 million (US$125
million) has increased progressively to Rs. 25,000 million (US$2,500 million)
in 1983. The paid-up capital of the Corporation on March 31, 1983 was
Rs. 11,806 million. The Corporation had, as of March 31, 1983, a Board of
eleven Directors, including the Chairman and Managing Director.
2.02    Under its Memorandum and Articles of Association, NTPC has broad
powers to carry out its operations. However, the tariffs to be applied, as
well as any changes in such tariffs, its investment plans and annual capital
budgets, have to be approved by the Government. NTPC is also subject to
periodic examination by the Committee on Public Undertakings, a body
established by GOI to monitor the performance of public sector enterprises.
2.03    The main objectives for which the Corporation was established are:
(i) to design, construct, and operate large thermal
power stations and transmission systems; and
(ii) to transmit and sell the power generated to State
power entities.
NTPC will construct most of the EHV (extra high voltage) transmission systems
being established by the Central Government, to develop effective
interconnected regional systems for ultimate integration into a national
grid. NTPC will own and operate the 400 kV transmission systems, over which
power will be transmitted from each plant and sold in bulk to SEBs.
2.04    NTPC has currently under construction six thermal power stations
totalling about 10,000 MW and operates the 720 MW Badarpur station near Delhi
on a management-fee basis. In addition, new projects at Muradnagar and
Kahalgaon (see Annex 9), with a total capacity of about 1,680 MW, have been
approved by CEA while other projects totalling about 12,000 MW are under
consideration.
Organization and Management
2.05    NTPC has commenced the operational phase with seven units each of
200 MW (excluding 720 MW at Badarpur) presently generating.  These units have
been commissioned in rapid succession since the beginning of 1982 and have
stabilized within a short period of two to four months following
commissioning. Current indications are that transition from the construction
to operational phase is being efficiently accomplished. The present Chairman
and Managing Director of NTPC has long operational experience in generation
and system operation and has organized this transition in a competent and
effective manner. He has taken a personal interest in the development of
extensive systems for the operation of thermal plant.  Considering the rapid



-11-
increase in NTPC's operational and construction activities, as well as the
dispersion of these activities in the case of the 400 kV transmission lines,
a study to develop a decentralized organizational structure was taken up in
1982. Based on the study, NTPC has adopted a regional organizational
structure with each Region under the charge of an executive director
responsible for the design, construction and operation of generation and
transmission facilities within the Region.
2.06    The decentralization (on a regional basis) of NTPC's operations, as
reflected in the revised corporate organizatione1 structure (Annex 10), and
approved by NTPC's Board on August 16, 1982, has been largely implemented
in respect to appointment and re-deployment of staff, delegation of authority
and co-ordination of procedures, management information systems and
reporting. For the first phase of decentralization, regional headquarters
personnel have been situated in New Delhi in close proximity to the corporate
headquarters to facilitate communication with, and assistance from, corporate
staff to ensure a smooth transition. The second stage will involve the
relocation of regional personnel to already identified sites in each of their
respective regions.
2.07    Regional headquarters staff, headed by Executive Regional Directors,
have been established for:
(a) the Northern Region, comprised of the power stations and
associated transmission systems at Singrauli, Rihand,
Badarpur and Muradnagar;
(b) The Western Region, comprised of the power stations and
associated transmission facilities at Korba, Vindhyachal,
Farakka and Kahalgaon; and
(c) the Southern Region, consisting of the Ramagundam power
station and related transmission systems.
2.08    As at present only the Farakka and the future Kahalgaon power
stations are located in the Eastern Region, it was expedient to include these
stations in the Western Regional structure. Although Ramagundam is the only
power station located in the Southern Region, the Region has a network of
over 3,000 km of 400 kV lines. For this reason NTPC considered it necessary
to establish a separate regional headquarters for this region.
Recruitment and Training
Recruitment
2.09    Recruitment is progressing at a satisfactory pace to meet operational
needs as plant completions occur and commercial operations expand. Manpower
by category of staff in 1983 and additional recruitment required to meet



-12-
projected requirements by 1990 is set forth in Annex 11.  Present NTPC
manpower as a percentage of FY1990 operational requirements is 48Z for
executives, 43% for supervisors, 30% for skilled and unskilled staff and 36Z
for the total of all NTPC staff categories.
Training
2.10    NTPC is a young organization which is growing rapidly to meet the
dpmands of its large construction and operations program. In 1990, when most
current facilities have been completed and commissioned, NTPC will have a
staff of about 3,300 . The importance, therefore, of implementing training
programs for the various skills required during the construction and
operational phases is receiving due emphasis. NTPC has placed a high
priority on the importance of training as a factor in its organizational
development and detailed programs have been developed for instructing and
training all categories of staff. Actual recruitment of trainees as of 1983
as a percentage of requirements by 1990 is 25% (executive 43%, supervisory
27% and skilled workers 16%). Actual trainee recruitment to date, by
category of staff, compared to projected requirements by 1990 is set forth in
Annex 12.
2.11    The approach adopted by NTPC to effectively train its large manpower
requirement is two-fold, involving pre-employment and post-employment
training. Pre-employment training is provided to personnel who enter the
organization as trainees at varying entry levels and undergo an extensive
training program before being placed on-the-job. Under the post-employment
training schemes, training is provided for personnel who are already employed
by the Corporation or who have joined the Corporation with previous
experience but need some exposure to the expertise required in their new
assignments with NTPC. Details of NTPC's training activity are provided in
Annex 13.
2.12    In addition, Operation and Maintenance personnel are being trained
on a regular basis, both within the Company and abroad, in collaboration with
power organizations of international repute, for example, The Central
Electricity Generating Board (U.K.)
2.13    The Centre for Education in Power Management, in addition to offering
Management Development Programs, also undertakes applied research (including
the development of training material) and consultancy assignments in the
various techno-managerial areas in the power sector.
2.14    A Central Institute of Training is being established at the Badarpur
Thermal Power Station complex. Its scope of activities will include policy
issues related to training, developing course and instructional material
regarding engineering aspects of power plants, developing case studies and

operations of units, developing new systems of training, and provision of
training for trainers.
2.15    Training centers have also been established at NTPC's plant
locations. These centers, with workshop and hostel facilities, will train
young graduates, diploma holders and other trainees.
Accounting Organization and Systems
2.16    Decentralized accounting systems, related to the construction phase,
have been established and fully and successfully implemented at all NTPC
project sites.
2.17    General and cost accounting systems for the operations phase are in
operation at Singrauli and Korba. Singrauli commenced commercial operations
for the first generating unit on June 1, 1982 and for the second unit on
February 1, 1983. Commercial operations for the first Korba generating unit
started August 1983. During a Bank mission in June 1983 it was observed that
Singrauli was experiencing some difficulty with the implementation of
operations general and cost accounting due to delayed and insufficient
training of staff. As a consequence a back-log of accounting work had
developed. NTPC had engaged consultants to assist them in resolving these
problems. It was evident that, for the same causes, Korba would encounter
difficulties resulting in a similar back-log. It was consequently proposed
by the Bank mission that accounting consultants be engaged to assist in staff
training and in the Implementation of operational accounting immediately at
both Singrauli and Korba and a later date at Ramagundam and Farakka. NTPC
management agreed with this recommendation and has engaged A.F. Ferguson &
Co. for this purpose for the four stations.
2.18    With the assistance of these accounting consultants NTPC has prepared
and put into use charts of accounts and accounting and systems manuals for
financial accounting, payroll accounting, contract accounting, procurement
and inventory control, loan accounting, internal audit, costing and
capitalization, management information system, sales accounting, cash and
bank accounting, procurement and inventory control, and budgetary control.
2.19    The organizational structure for NTPC Corporate Finance, Regional
Finance and Finance and Accounts for the four Regions are set forth in
Annexes 14 through 19. The organizational structures are well conceived
while recruitment and training are progressing at a satisfactory pace to meet
the requirements of the developing commercial operations f the organization.
Audit
2.20    The audit of NTPC's accounts and records is undertaken by a
professional auditor appointed by the Company Law Audit Board, on the
recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The auditor



-14-
is normally a member of the Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants, and
his audit report on NTPC's financial statements is subject to comment by the
Auditor General. For the audit of the accounts for FYs 1980, 1981 and 1982,
two auditors were appointed, Messrs. Raghu Nath Rai & Co. and Messrs. Prasad
Azad & Co. For FYs 1983 and 1984 the appointed auditors are Messrs.
Maheshwari & Co. and Goel Garg & Co. All four are firms of Indian Chartered
Accountants. There were no adverse comments from the auditors in the
accounts for each of the respective years and the audits were satisfactory to
the Bank. It should be borne in mind that NTPC's activities covered only
project construction until FY 1982 when power was sold for the first time.
NTPC has undertaken in connection with previous credits and loans to furnish
to the Bank Group audited financial statements within seven months of the end
of the fiscal year to which they relate, together with a certified report
by the auditors, and a review of the accounts by the Director of Commercial
Audits.

III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01    NTPC's current program for the 20 year period FY77-96, amounting to
about Rs 224,700 million (see Annex 25), which is part of India's long-term
National Power Plan, provides for the construction of eight coal-fired power
stations with associated 400 kV transmission: Singrauli, Rihand and
Muradnagar (Uttar Pradesh), Korba, aud Vindhyachal (Madhya Pradesh),
Ramagundam (Andhra Pradesh), Farakka (West Bengal), and Kahalgaon (Bihar).
These power plants, totalling 12,240 MW, are located at coal fields, with the
exception of Muradnagar, since it is more economical to transport electricity
than coal to the load centers. It is likely that in addition, NTPC will take
over ownership of the 720 MW Badarpur station near Delhi, which is at present
being operated by NTPC on a management-fee basis. Two new thermal power
projects, Kahalgaon and Muradnagar (National Capital Region) are described in
Annex 9. NTPC has also undertaken studies identifying additional sites for
thermal power stations to be owned by the Central Government.
Project Objectives and Rationale for Bank involvement in the Proposed Project
3.02    The main objective of the proposed project is to provide additional
least-cost thermal capacity in the Eastern Region to help in gradually
eliminating power shortages in India in general and in the Eastern Region
in particular. At present the Eastern Region is experiencing a severe
shortage of capacity and energy which has led to widespread rationing and
permanent overloading of existing thermal units. The-situation has resulted
in increased operation and maintenance costs as well as high forced outage
rates of the units.
3.03    The participation in financing the proposed project would give the
Bank the opportunity, through our continuing dialogue with the relevant
authorities in India, to continue its involvement in the development of the
regional power systems, which will lead ultimately to a national grid, and
to assist in the development of the Indian power sector in such areas as:
- development of sector organization and policies for the
operation of regional and national power systems; and
- long-range national power development planning.
The Project
3.04    The Project consists of the second stage of the Farakka Thermal Power
Project located in the Murshidabad District of West Bengal (see attached
maps). The first stage, comprising three 200 MW units with associated
transmission, is under construction with Bank/IDA financing. The first unit
is expected to be commissioned in January 1985, followed by the two remaining
200 MW units at six month intervals. The second stage would comprise two
generating units of 500 MW each, including boilers, turbo- generator sets,
electrical and mechanicsl auxiliary equipment, associated civil works and



-16-
common services and facilities. The Project would also include three 400 kV
double-circuit transmission lines: Farakka-Jeerhat, Farakka-Biharsharif and
Farakka-Durgapur, totalling about 640 km. A third 500 MW unit, which would
bring the Farakka power plant to its final planned capacity of 2,100 MW,
would be installed under a separate future project. In addition, 40
man-months of consultancy services are included in the Project for reviewing
the design of the power plant and assisting NTPC in the preparation of
specifications (para. 3.12).
3.05    Coal for the Farakka power plant will be supplied from the Hurra
Block of the Rajmahal Coalfields of Eastern Coalfields Ltd. which contains an
area earmarked for open-cast mining with estimated coal reserves of about
500 million tons, of which 340 million tons are proven mineral coal reserves.
The production of these mines alone would be sufficient for the 2,100 MW
power plant for 45-50 years. The production program of these mines, provided
by the Department of Coal, indicates that production would gradually increase
from 0.12 million tons/year in 1982-83 to 10.8 million tons/year in 1993-94
(stage I and II). This production schedule covers fully the demand for the
Farakka power plant which would increase from 0.98 million tons/year in
1985-86 to 6.19 tons/year in 1993-94. Coal will be transported from the
Hurra mines, about 50 km from the power station, by a captive merry-go-round
railway system which is under construction as part of the first stage of the
Farakka power plant. During negotiations of the proposed loan, the Indian
delegation provided a chart showing the annual coal requirements for the
Farakka I, Farakka II, and proposed Kahalgaon thermal power plant, together
with annual producation estimates for the Rajmahal mines, from 1985/86
onward. A note addressing the proposed extension of the Rajmahal mines was
also provided. Arrangements for the provision of coal to the Farakka power
plant, as outlined in these documents, are satisfactory (para. 6.02(d)).
3.06    The source of cooling water for tbe power station is the Farakka
Feeder Canal which is a perennial canal running along the eastern boundary
of the Project with a flow varying from 25,000 cu. ft./sec (700 m7sec) to
40,000 cu. ft./sec (1,120 z sec). The requirement of cooling water for the
full designed capacity of 2,100 MW will be about 3,000 cu. ft./sec
(84 n sec). The cooling water will be returned to the canal about 1.5 km
below the intake point and, therefore, no international water rights issues
are involved. The Farakka Barrage Authority has given an undertaking,
confirmed by the Central Water Commission, to supply up to 300 cu. ft./sec
(8.4 m)sec) for consumptive use covering water reqjuirements for boiler
make-up, ash disposal and project township. Tbc cooling water system,
comprising intake and discharge structures and channels as well as the
discharge pond and the gravity intake tunnel, has been provided under the
first stage of the power plant. Therefore, the Project would include the
cooling water pump house and forebay, the associated duct and seal pit and
the extension of the discharge pond and gravity intake tunnel.



-17-
3.07    About 2,300 acres, including the land for the ultimate capacity of
the main plant, have already been acquired. Most of the infrastructural
facilities have been provided under the first stage. The Farakka development
is described in greater detail in Annex 20.
Estimated Cost
3.08    The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during
construction, duties and taxes, and front-end fee is about Rs 12,117 million
(US$1,122 million). Based on the experience with siailar projects in India,
the direct and indirect foreign currency costs are estimatf.d at about Rs
4,374 million (US$405 million) and tLc local currency costs at Rs 7,743
million (US$717 million). The estimated cost of the Project is set out in
Annex 21 and summarized in Table 3.1 below:

1/  Fifty pe-cent of project costs (not financed by internal resources) are
financed from equity contribution by GOI, while the remaining fifty
percent is provided through GOI loans which include the Bank loan. As in
the case of the previous Bank financed NTPC projects, it is now GOI's
practice to consider its financing of the project to be first passed on
to NTPC as equity (until the 50% level is reached) and then as interest
bearing, repayable loans. The only exception to this rule is the
proposed Bank loan where GOI and NTPC have agreed during negotiations
to draw the Bank's loan as loan from the beginning. Consequently, GOI
and NTPC agreed that interest during the project implemeantation period
(at the onlending rate of 13% per annum) would be accounted for as inter-
est during construction and capitalized as a component of the project's
capital cost in the accounts of NTPC The above table reflects this agree-
ment.



-19-
Total project cost, net of duties and taxes of US$69.0 million, amounts to
US$1,122.0 million.
3.09    The estimate for the steam generators and turbo-generator units is
based on the order value of the respective equipment for the Korba power
plant and the estimates of other packages, including transmission line
equipment, are based on order values for the Singrauli power plant, updated
to 1983 levels. The resulting cost of USS1,030/kW and US$250 thousand/km of
double circuit 400 kV line, excluding interest during construction is
comparable with the cost of similar facilities implemented or under
construction in India and other countries with similar conditions. The
foreign cost would represent the following percentages of the total cost:
20% of the steam generator cost, 51% of the high pressure piping cost, 30%
of the turbo-generator unit and accessories cost, 51% of the cooling water
system cost, 46% of other mechanical equipment cost, 2% of the cost of civil
works, 15X of electrical equipment cost, 80% of the cost of steel in the
towers for 400 kV lines, 50% of the cost of insulators and hardware, 36% of
the cost of conductors and 20% of the cost of 400/220 kV transformers.
Inland freight and insurance is calculated at 4% of ex-works price plus
excise duty (8% of ex-factory cost) for local supply, and 4% of CIF cost plus
customs duty and landing charges on imported equipment. Customs duty and
landing charges for imported equipment have been assumed at 50% and 2%
respectively of the CIF cost. Sales tax is charged at 4% on the ex-works
cost. Spares are provided at 6% of ex-works for mechanical equipment and 4Z
for electrical equipment. Erection is estimated at 20% of ex-works cost for
main plant equipment and 8% for other equipment.
3.10    Physical contingencies of 10% on civil works and 5X on equipment
costs have been allowed which, based on previous similar projects, are
considered adequate. In assessing price contingencies, it has been assumed
that contracts will be either fixed price or with ceilings on price inflation
for the plant equipment, as has been the case for NTPC's projects under
construction. Local costs for equipment and erection have been escalated at
7% for FY1984 and FY1985, 8Z for FY1986 and FY1987 and 6% thereafter, and
foreign costs at 7.5% for FY1984, 7% for FY's 1985 and 6Z thereafter, all
observing the before mentioned ceilings.
Project Financing
3.11    The proposed loan of US$300.8 millioL, representing about 27% of the
project cost (excluding duties and taxes and interest during construction
and including the capitalized front-end fee), would be applied to the CIF
and/or ex-factory costs of the turbo-generator units and associated
equipment, power cycle equipment, cooling water pumps, coal handling and
transportation equipment, electro-static precipitators, water treatment
plant, ash handling plant, condensate polishing equipment, air compressors,
chimney elevator, fire fighting equipment, a combustion turbine generating

unit, control and instrumentation, electrical equipment and transmission line
materials as well as consultants' services. The rest of the required
equipment and materials, civil works, plant erection costs, inland
transportation costs, interest during construction, duties and taxes and any
other costs not financed from the Loan would be financed in the form of GOI
loans and equity share capital, and NTPC internal resources, as follows:
US$ Million
GOI loans (including Bank loan and
co-financing)                              628.3
GOL equity share capital                     628.2
NTPC internal resources                       84.0
Total Financing Required                 1,340.5
There are indications that additional external sources may be available for
the financing of the steam generators at a total value of approximately
US$150 million. During negotiations, the Indian delegation stated that GCI
would, at the appropriate time, consider co-financing for some of the
equipment packages such as the boilers and the high pressure piping, which
consequently have been excluded from the list of items initially proposed to
be financed from the proposed Bank loan (para. 6.02(e)).
Engineering and Construction
3.12    NTPC has built up adequate expertise on the engineering of thermal
power plants equipped with 200 MW units. Design activities of three projects
involving 500 MW units are in progress and NTPC has developed a capability
for design of stations including units of this type and size. Since the 500
MW units are standard for all NTPC's power plants and the general layout of
these plants is similar specifications and bid documents are already under
preparation. The construction organization for the first stage of Farakka is
established and consequently can be phased into the second stage on schedule.
The detailed design for the project will be taken up before any of the 500 MW
units are in operation. Since the basic designs would be largely of a
repetitive nature, a retainer consultant satisfactory to the Bank would be
engaged as necessary, to (i) review deviations from earlier power station
design and (ii) assist NTPC, in the design and preparation of specifications.
NTPC will also use sub-consultants as required. An aggregate cost of
US$500,000 is provided under the proposed loan for consultancy.

Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed loan would be
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines.  Documents for individual contracts above US$3,500,000
equivalent would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Bidding documents
for such equipment, including tender analyses and recommendations for award
of contracts, would be prepared by NTPC, and agreed upon by the Bank.  To
facilitate contract coordination, the invitation to tender for major plant
contracts would be on a supply and erect basis. This could include civil
works in certain cases where these cannot be disassociated from the plant
contract, i.e., coal handling, substation structure and transmission lines.
Local manufacturers would be expected to bid for all categories of equipment.
A domestic preference of 15Z or the import duty, whichever is less, would be
applied in bid comparison for equipment contracts. To prevent administrative
delays, in case the lowest evaluated bidder is a foreign manufacturer, GOI
1/ Other mechanical works include an combustion turbine generating unit and
all other mechanical equipments such as water treatment plant, fire
fighting equipment, condensate polishing equipment, air compressors, ash
handling plant, chimney elevator, etc., to be financed under ICB.

will grant, as in previous projects import permission for such items.
Disbursement
3.15     Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made against 100Z of
the cost of consultants retained for the 500 NW units (para. 3.10), 100X of
the ex-factory cost of equipment and materials procured in India subject to
international competitive bidding, and 100Z of the foreign cost of equipment
and materials procured abroad. Estimated disbursements as provided in Annex
24 have been determined by NTPC and relate to the project implementation
schedule (Annexes 22 and 23). Although the period of disbursements (7 years)
corresponds approximately to that of the 6 1/2 year Bank disbursements
profile, the proportionate disbursements by semester differ somewhat and
reflect NTPC's experience in implementation of thermal power plants, for
which their disbursement estimates have proven reasonably accurate.
Ecology
3.16    Under the first stage of the Farakka power plant, the Indian National
Committee of Environmental Planning and Coordination of the Department of
Science and Technology has indicated no objection to that project on
environmental grounds, and NTPC is complying with all environmental quality
standards prescribed by that Committee in the design, construction and
operation of the power plant. Appropriate action would be taken during the
detailed design of the second stage to deal with the principal environmental
problems which are related to:
(a) Location. The Farakka power plant is a pit head station
far from any urban area. Accordingly, there are no problems
other than the need to ensure the health and environment of
the operating staff who will be housed in a residential area
some 4-5 km from the power plant.
(b) Stack Emission. As in the case of the first stage, electro-
static precipitators with an efficiency of 99% will be
installed to take care of the high ash content of the coal.
The stack will be of such a height as to ensure that
particulate matter is dispersed in the atmosphere to reduce
pollutant fall-out concentrations to internationally acceptable
levels. The coal is of low sulfur content (0.3-1.5Z) and
sulfur dioxide levels in the gas are within acceptable
limits.
(c) Heat Dissipation. The power station's requirement of cooling
water will be met from the Farakka feeder canal, and will be
returned to the same canal through a discharge channel to a
point about 1.5 km downstream, where a suitable diffusion



-25-
device has been provided. After leaving the power house there
will be some heat dissipation in the discharge channel. The
maximum temperature rise in the feeder canal due to the return
of cooling water is estimated to be not more than 3°C. Water
in the canal will gradually return to its normal temperature
as it flows downstream.
(d) Ash Disposal. The ash will be pumped as slurry through
a pipeline to an ash dump area located some 6.5 km from the
power station. Skimmers would be provided to obtain rela-
tively ash free water from the disposal area before going
to natural drainage.
3.17    With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel must
conform, will be strictly enforced. The turbine hall of the steam turbine
power station, which is the noisiest area of the plant, will have a sound
pressure level of less than 90 decibels which is well below the maximum
acceptable threshold for the normal 8 hour/day shift worker.
Project Risks
3.18    The Project represents one segment of an overall development program
comprised of over 12,000 MW generating plant and about 9,000 km of 400 kV
transmission lines. It is part of a tightly designed program with plant and
transmission coming in at phased intervals throughout the period 1982 through
1993. Maintaining this program on schedule requires careful coordination and
expert supervision at all levels. The principal risk is the possibility of
slippage which could give rise to delayed commissioning of plant and loss of
benefits. Seven 200 MW units included in this program have been commissioned
so far on schedule or ahead of schedule. With a program of construction of
this magnitude, there is no guarantee that some delays will not occur, but
these should be kept to a minimum through careful coordination and
supervision during construction and careful attention, when placing
contracts, to the capability of manufacturers to meet the delivery schedules.
3.19    Other risk areas are in engineering design, cost overruns and
problems in commissioning and operation during the early operational stage,
with resultant loss of revenues. There is also the risk of damage due to
fire, explosion, etc., but this is covered by insurance provided by the
respective contractors during the construction stage and by GOI through its
self-insurance policy after commissioning.
3.20    These risks have been carefully assessed and the following safeguards
taken:
(a) NTPC is being assisted by consultants, and this should minimize
problems as regards engineering and design;



-26-
(b)  Plant and equipment costs are based on similar works currently
in progress in India; provision has been made for cost escala-
tion and there should be little risk of any substantial cost
overrun unless inflation exceeds estimates; and
(c) a number of 500 MW generating units will have been in opera-
tion for some years before the Project is commissioned, thus,
providing experience and trained manpower for the Project.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.  NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED (NTPC)
Investment Program
4.01    NTPC is currently in the eighth year of an investment program which
originally provided for the construction of four large thermal power
stations with an aggregate capacity of 7,300 MW together with about 6,000
circuit kilometers of associated 400 kV transmission lines, estimated to
cost about Rs 41,000 million (US$3,796 million). However, because of
rescheduling and additional projects, the investment program has been
subject to continuous review over the past seven years, with appropriate
revisions being made during appraisal of the previous Bank financed
projects. Revisions were made during appraisal of the proposed project to
reflect (i) increase in the expected base costs of equipment; (ii)
provision for two new projects (Kahalgaon and Muradnagar); (iii)
rescheduling of generating plant commissioning dates; (iv) additional
provision for projects not yet identified (5,000 MW), extending the
investment program to FY1996; and (v) revision of the proposed project.
4.02    NTPC's currently revised investment program is set out in
Annex 25 while a detailed comparison of the current program with the program
at previous appraisals is provided in Annex 26. The present program
indicates capital expenditure of Rs 224,707 million (US$20,806 million)
over the 20 year period FY1977-96, reflecting an increase of Rs 65,545
million or 41X over the previous investment program revised at the time of
the Central Power Transmission Project appraisal in October 1982. The
addition of Kahalgaon and Muradnagar (described in Annex 9) combined with
an increase in the provision for new projects not yet identified account
for a Rs 66,221 million increase. Projects identified in the previous
investment program at Singrauli, Farakka and Rihand reflect an increase of
Rs 2,922 million while the projects at Korba, Ramagundam, Vindhyachal and
the Central Power Transmission Project show a decrease of Rs 3,598
million. Of this decrease, about Rs 3,344 million is attributable to
capitalized interest during construction which was overestimated in the
previous investment program. Where increases occurred, these were due
largely to:
(a) price escalation resulting from anticipated slippage in
commissioning of power units;
(b) revision of construction and equipment base costs;
(c) increase in foreign costs, in terms of local currency,
resulting from an increase in the exchange rate applied; and
(d) increase due to the application of revised inflation factors.



-28-
4.03    Financing for the increased investment program costs will come
from increased internal resources and from GOI in the form of long term
loans and equity share capital. Financial statements showing both past
performance and future forecasts of NTPC's operations are provided in
Annexes 30 through 36. Assumptions upon which the forecasts are based are
rovided in Annex 48.
Past Performance and Present Financial Position
4.04    As NTPC started commercial operations only during FY1983 there is
no prior history of financial operating performance. Operations during
FY1983 were minimal due to the still ongoing stabilization activities of
Singrauli I, and consequently provide insufficient actual operating
experience upon which to base any meaningful financial analysis. Gener-
ation of NTPC's first 200 NW power unit was erratic during the first part
of FY1983 attributable to start-up and testing procedures. Commercial
operations of the second Singrauli unit started in the latter three months
of FY1983. For the third Singrauli unit and the first Korba unit, commis-
sioned in the last month of FY1983, there was no sale of power generation
in that year. Net earnings for FY1983 were Rs 46 million compared to Rs
45 million projected in the appraisal for the Central Power Transmission
Project. The financial position of NTPC at FY1983 year-end (refer to
table 4.2) reflected a debt/ equity ratio of 21/79. A negative working
capital figure of Rs 702 million existed at the year-end attributable to a
delay in receipt of GOI project financing received early in FY1984. The
financial position of NTPC at FY1983 year-end was satisfactory.
NTPC's Consolidated Operations and Future Earnings
4.05    The projected commissioning of 200 MW and 500 NW power units
through FY1996, together with the number of months change for each unit,
compared to the projected schedule at the time of the Central Power Trans-
mission appraisal, are provided in Annex 27. Projected plant capacity,
generation and GWh sales through FY1996 are set forth in Annex 28. A
comparison of projected plant capacity (KW) and power generation (GWh)
with projections at the time of the Central Power Transmission appraisal
together with variances due to:
(a) additional projects;
(b) commissioning slippage; and
(c) earlier stabilization of generating units,
are provided in Annex 29.



-29-
4.06    With the progressive increase in commissioning of power units and
the consequent rapid increase in generation and power sales, NTPC's
Operating income is projected to increase from Rs579 million in FY1984 to
Rs 23,086 million in FY1996. The Income Statement set out in Annex 30
shows the projected consolidated operating results of NTPC from FY1984
through FY1996 together with actual results for FY1983. The forecast
earnings performance is satisfactory and reflects rates of return on net
fixed assets increasing from 7.1Z in FY1984 to 14.7% in FY1996. During
negotiations for the Central Power Transmission Project, GOI and NTPC
agreed to set tariffs for the bulk sale of power to SEB's at levels suffi-
cient to achieve in FY1991, and maintain thereafter, a rate of return of
not less than 9.5Z on the average net fixed assets in operation. Between
FYs1984 and 1990 they agreed to achieving a minimum rate of return of 8%
per year calculated on an adjusted basis assuming the hypothetical situLa-
tion of fully operative and stabilized plant generation. Their current
projections reflect rates of return of 9.7Z in FY1991 and from 12.2% to
14.9% (calculated on the adjusted basis) for FYs1984 to 1990, thus exceed-
ing the agreed minimum rates of return.
4.07    The FY1991 performance is based upon generation which represents
of 55% the projected generation when all units in the investment program
are fully stabilized and operating at full capacity. On the basis of the
projections the average bulk supply tariff in FY1991 will be 50.39 paise
(US4.67 cents) per kWh in current terms, reflecting an increase of 1.37
paise (2.8%) over the 49.02 paise per kWh projected during the Centra
Power Transmission Project appraisal (October 1982). The regional bulk
supply tariffs have been projected to progressively increase from FY1984
resulting in an increase of the average NTPC tariff (including fuel sur-
charge) from 35.45 paise per kWh in FY1984 to 50.39 paise per kWh in
FY1991 (the year in which NTPC is required to achieve the previous
covenanted minimum rate of return of 9.5%). The 1.37 paise increase is
attributable to:
Paise per kWh
(a)  Base fuel costs                                  0.43
(b)  Fuel surcharge                                  (0.97)
(c)  Operations and maintenance costs                 0.61
(d)  Depreciation                                     0.02
(e)  Operating Income                                 1.28
TOTAL                                            1.37
4.08    As a consequence of the rapid commissioningly of plant from FY1984
onward, net earnings are projected to rise progressive from Rs 196 million
in FY1984 to Rs 13,626 million in FY1996. The rate of return is expected
to increase to 14.7% in that year. Projected net earnings for FY1991
reflect an increase (versus Central Power Transmission Project appraisal)



-30-
of Rs 602 million (13%) due to an increase in operating revenue of Rs
2,109 million (9Z) offset by an an increase in operating expenses of Rs
886 million (7%) and an increase in interest expense of Rs 921 million
(16%) 1/.
4.09    GOI has not agreed to the principal of revaluation of assets as
the basis upon which to measure the performance of Government owned
entities. Consequently NTPC's projected operating performance is measured
by the operating income rate of return on net fixed assets valued at
historical cost. As NTPC is a relatively young organization, with all
fixed assets acquired since FY1977, there is not as great a disparity
between the rate of return based upon revalued assets versus assets at
historical cost, as would be the case for older organizations where assets
were acquired over a considerably greater period of years. This rate of
return gap will, however, increasingly widen as NTPC approaches FY1996,
the last year of its present investment program. NTPC forecasts a rate of
return of 14.7% on the historical cost of net assets in FY1996 while, if
assets were revalued, their projections would reflect a rate of return of
about 9.2%. The minimum rate of return of 9.5% for FY1991 and thereafter
agreed under previous Bank Group Loan/Credits is not adequate in the later
years to ensure an operating income sufficient to cover debt service and
in addition provide sufficient internal resources which will be required
for extension of their investment program and for the eventual replacement
of assets, at current costs, as they approach the end of their useful
life. GOI and NTPC consequently agreed at negotiations (para 6.02(a)) to
set NITC bulk supply tariffs and conduct operations to assure the achieve-
ment of the following rates of return based upon net fixed assets at
historical cost:
(a) in FY's 1985 through 1990, an annual rate of return
of not less than 7% on non-revalued assets;
(b)  in FY's 1991 through 1995, a minimum rate of return of not
less than 9 1/2%; and
(c) in FY1996 and thereafter, annual rates of return at levels
satisfactory to ensure the financial viability of NTPC.
At negotiations an understanding was reached that, based on the assump-
tions of the current financial projections, a rate of return on histori-
cally valued assets of 14.7Z (approximately equivalent to a return of 9.2%
1/ GOI onlending interest rates were increased from 12.5% at Central
Power Transmission Project appraisal to 13% in the current projec-
tions.



-31-
on revalued assets) would be satisfactory to ensure the financial
viability of NTPC, for purposes of (c) above.
NTPC Regional Operations
4.10    Regional income statements for the Northern, Western, Southern and
Eastern Regions, set out in Annexes 31 to 34, providing the projected
operating performance for each Region from FY1984 to FY1996, are satisfac-
tory. The only Region in commercial operation during FY1983 was the
Northern Region which produced operating income of Rs 120 million and net
earnings of Rs 46 million. All Regions are projected to produce net
profits through to FY1996 with the exception of the Southern Region
(Ramagundam) for which minor losses of Rs 6 million and Rs 9 million are
forecast for FY1984 and FY1985 respectively. This is acceptable at that
early stage in the Region's development program.
Taxation
4.11    NTPC is liable for income tax under the Income Tax Acts.  However,
owing to the large capital expenditure program, tax relief is provided
beyond the period of the current investment program. Consequently a tax
equalization reserve is not necessary.
Inte%rnal Cash Generation
4.12    A Statement of Source and ApplicaLion of Funds for the years
FY1977 through FY1996, covering NTPC's current investment program, Is
provided in Annex 35. Internally generated funds are expected to con-
tribute 18% to NTPC's investment program (leaving a cash surplus of US$1.6
billion) between FY1983 and FY1996 (Table 4.1). As a percentage of annual
average capital expenditure (3 year average), internal cash generation is
projected to increase from 3.3% in FY1984 to 52.1Z in FY1993. Internally
generated funds of Rs 21,719 million, in excess of construction program
requirements, have been shown as short-term deposits. Dividends on equity
share capital are not anticipated in the forecasts on the assumption that
surplus funds would be applied to the increase and ex--nsion of the
investment program. From FY1983 (the first year of commercial operations)
onward, debt service coverage is satisfactory, ranging between ratios of
1.5:1 and 3.3:1.
NTPC's Financing Plan FY1977 - FY1996
4.13    The financing plan for the total of the past a.tual 7 year period
(FY1977 to FY1983) and the projected 13 year period (FY1984 to FY1996) is
set out in Table 4.1 and is satisfactory. The investment cost of the
proposed project represents about 5% of the construction expenditures in
the financing plan.



-32-
4.14    Bank financing of the proposed project, US$300.8 million, together
with Bank Group financing of NTPC's investment program to date, in total
US$2,401.5 million, represents about 30% of the total US$8,120.5 million
investment required for the projects involved.

-33-
Onlending Agreement
4.15    It was agreed during negotiations that the Bank Loan for the
proposed project would be onlent to NTPC by GOI in accordance with an
acceptable Subsidiary Loan Agreement as a condition of effectiveness of
the Loan (para. 6.01(b)). As in previous lending operations, the terms
of the onlending agreement would provide for maturity in 20 years, includ-
ing a grace period of five years, and repayment of principal in equal
semi-annual installmeuts, with interest payable on outstanding balances
according to GOI's scheduled rates of interest applicable at the time but
not less than 13Z per annum. The scheduled rate of interest at which GOI
currently lends to industrial and commercial undertakings in the power
sector is 13% per annum and reflects an increase from the rate of 12.5%
in effect at the time of the Central Power Transmission Project appraisal.
The current 13% scheduled GOI rate provides sufficient margin over the
current Bank rate of 10.08% to cover the foreign exchange and interest
rate risks which are borne by the Government, and represents about 6% in
real terms. This rate compares favorably with a prevailing commercial
bank rate in India of upwards of 13.5%, and a rate of about 14% for such
alternative lending institutions as the Industrial Development Bank and
the Industrial Credit Investment Corporation. Inflation in India is
projected to be of the order of 6% to 8% per annum in the period to
FY1992. As NTPC's previous practice has been to fully draw down GOI
equity financing before utilizing loan financing, GOI and gTPC agreed
during negotiations that, for those project components partially or
totally financed by the Bank Loan, NTPC would draw down loan financing up
to the amount financed by the Bank before drawing GOI equity financing for
such project components. In addition the Indian delegation clarified that
the interest cost on Bank loan disbursements (at the onlending rate
specified in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement) would be reflected as interest
during construction and capitalized as a component of the projects capital
cost in the books of account of NTPC.
Future Finances
4.16    Actual and forecast Balance Sheets, at March 31 annually from
FY1983 through FY1996, are set out in Annex 36 and reflect a satisfactory
financial position for each of these years. The balance sheets reflect
the phased construction program, the commencement of commercial operations
in FY1983, and the financing of NTPC's capital requirements by GOI through
a combination of long-term borrowing and equity capital, in a ratio which
does not exceed 1:1. Initially the equity portion of financing would be
released by GOI followed by loan capital, except in the case of the Bank
loan. Table 4.2 sumzmarizes NTPC's financial position at three significant
points in its development:



-34-
(a)  at March 31, 1983 - end of the year in which NTPC commenced
commercial operations and became revenue earning;
(b)  at March 31, 1993 - end of the year following the year in
which the proposed project is completed; and
(c)  at March 31, 1995 - end of the first full year in which all
generating units, of the identified and approved projects
in the investment program, are operating at full capacity.
4.17    These forecasts indicate that at March 31, 1983, when NTPC became
revenue earning, total capitalization was Rs 15,050 million (US$1,393
million), divided between GOI loans (including the onlending of Bank Group
finance) and equity in a ratio of 21/79. Ten years later (March 31,
1993), after the proposed project is completed, total capitalization will
have risen to Rs 197,618 million (US$18,298 million) reflecting a
debt/equity ratio of 31/69. No external debt or equity financing is
forecast after FY1993 for the current investment program and this, com-
bined with a significant increase in internal cash generation, will reduce
the debt/equity ratio to 25/75 by March 31, 1995.

Commercial Arrangement, for Sale of NTPC Power
4.18    Under previous credits and loans, GOI and NTPC agreed to sell the
output of power from NTPC's power plants to the SEBs under contracts
satisfactory to the Bank Group. They also agreed that a final draft of
the contracts would be forwarded to the Bank six months prior to the first
sale of energy from each power station. During the appraisal mission,
Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) were received for all states of the
Northern Region (Singrauli) and subsequently for the Delhi Electricity
Supply Undertaking (DESU) and the states of the Western (Korba) Region.
These MOUs represent an interim agreement between NTPC and the relevant
States for the sale of power, during the duration of the contracts, at an
interim flat rate of 31.12 paise and 34.5 paise per kWh (excluding trans-
mission charge, fuel price surcharge, and duties and taxes) for the North-
ern and Western Regions respectively, which approximate the Long Range
Marginal Cost (LRMC) of bulk supplies by NTPC. The MOU contracts expire
on March 31, 1985 for the Northern Region and March 31, 1986 for the
Western Region, or when replaced by revised bulk supply contracts,
whichever occurs earlier. Although the MOU's defined most of the factors,
terms and conditions considered by the Bank to be required in order to be
satisfactory, there were clarifications sought at negotiations concerning
the validity of the contracts after their expiration dates, provision for
a capacity charge, provision for NTPC profits, and the calculation of the
flat tariff rates. During negotiations GOI and NTPC provided satisfactory
clarification on these points. They provided a copy of a legal opinion
verifying that the interim contracts (MOU's) will remain legally valid
after their expiration date and until replaced by revised contracts. They
also provided details of calculation of the interim flat rate tariffs
clarifying that the rates included correctly, all factors which were of
concern to the Bank, which included an NTPC profit component of 10% on
NTPC equity and loan interest at the GOI onlending rate. The Indian
delegation clarified that the interim contracts included provision for a
committment (capacity) charge, which is not at present recovered as a
separate element in the tariff, but is covered by the overall tariff rate.
They explained that at the present stage of development, the inter-state
transmission systems had not advanced to the point where NTPC could ensure
supply of the SEB's agreed power allocations. Owing to the contractual
financial penalities of non-supply of allocated power, which are a part of
the commitment charge provision, it is considered premature at this stage
for NTPC to bill SEB's for power sales on the basis of a two-tier tariff
(fixed commitment charge plus variable energy charge).



-36-
4.19    Contracts have not yet been received for Ramagundam which were due
in May 1983. In the case of Farakka, contracts will be due in July 1984.
As the Bank mission emphasized during previous missions, and during
appraisal of the proposed project, satisfactory contractual agreements
between NTPC and the relevant SEBs for the sale of power are essential
to ensure the financial viability of NTPC. It was therefore agreed by the
Indian delegation that submission to the Bank of signed contracts for the
States of the Eastern (Farakka) and Southern (Ramagundam) Regions would be
a condition of effectiveness for the proposed Bank loan (para 6.01(a)).
During negotiations GOI and NTPC also agreed to provide to the Bank
revised bulk supply contracts for all four Regions, by March 31, 1986
(para 6.02(c)), incorporating the following provision:
(a) Provision for periodical renewal of the contracts
beyond the initial validity period;
(b) At the time of renewal, replacement, or extension of
the contracts, but in any event at not more than
three-year intervals, revision, where required, of the
tariffs and the factors for their calculation to
ensure recovery of NTPC's operating costs and loan interest,
and generation of a satisfactory level of net income;
(c) Provision that a commitment (capacity) charge be introduced
at a time as considered appropriate by NTPC; and
(d) Definition of the NTPC profit component of the tariffs.
4.20    In respect to power transfers to SEB's outside of a particular
Region, the sales of NTPC power will be priced at the bulk supply tariff
rate of the receiving region for sales within the committed power alloca-
tion of the relevant SEB. Where sales are in excess of the committed
allocation, the tariff rate of the generating region would apply to that
portion in excess.
4.21    NTPC bulk supply contracts establish regional tariffs for NTPC
power sales in each respective region. Operating costs applicable to the
transmission facilities of the Central Power Transmission Project will be
absorbed by the relevant regional NTPC organizations. Recovery of such
costs, therefore, is reflected in the regional tariffs as a separate
component of these tariffs. The regional income statements set out in
Annexes 31 to 34 show the projected regional bulk supply tariffs and fuel
surcharge tariffs from FY1983 to FY1996. The regional tariffs projected
for FY1991, the qualifying year for NTPC to achieve the 9.5Z rate of
return, are as follows:

Variations in the above tariffs reflect regional differences in capital
investment, coal costs, investment timing and level of energy generation
in FY1991. The above Regional tariffs approximate the Long Range Marginal
Costs (LRMC) of NTPC generation and transmission of power.
B. STATE ELECTRICITY BOARDS OF THE EASTERN REGION
4.22    The power generated from the proposed project will be allocated
and sold to the West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa State Electricity Boards of
the Eastern Region. Financial projections for the Orissa SEB through
FY1992 and for West Bengal and Bihar SEBs through FY1993 are provided in
Annexes 37 through 47. These financial projections are comprised of:
(a) Income Statements;
(b) Balance Sheets;
(c) Funds Flow Statements (except for the Orissa SEB); and
(d) Statements of Net Cash Generation.
The projections for these SEBs would indicate that all three of them, from
FY1984 onwards would meet the financial eligibility criteria agreed at
negotiations for the Third Rural Electrification Project (i.e. achieve
a minimum contribution to investment of 20% and achieve a phased reduction
of rural electrification subsidies from State Governments to an eventual
maximum level approximating 10% of electricity sales).

V. JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost System Expansion
5.01    A regional optimum power capacity expansion plan has been developed
for India and completed in September 1982. 1/ The model used to derive the
least cost expansion plan (WASP-III) takes -is fixed projects those for which
investment decisions have been cleared by CEA, and as variable projects those
which have been identified to yield benefits in the timeframe of the plan.
5.02    The optimization studies carried out by CEA during the preparation of
the National Power Plan indicated that the generation option corresponding to
the accelerated hydro development and improved thermal plant performance
corresponds to the optimal generation expansion plan for the Eastern Region.
The demand forecast assumed for purposes of these studies has been the high
demand scenario. The required aggregate generation capacity in the Eastern
Region by 1995 to meet above demand with maximum loss of load probability
(LOLP) of 1Z would be in the order of 17,200 MW consisting of 12,000 MW
thermal and 5,200 MW hydro capacity. The optimal solution included 3x200 MW
and 1x500 MW at Farakka as a committed project. A futher 2x500 MW has been
considered as floating for purposes of the optimization studies along with
other projects (Talcher) and it has been accepted by the WASP studies. This
therefore indicates that an additional 1,000 MW at Farakka beyond 3x200 MW
plus 500 MW forms part of the least cost generation expansion option for the
Eastern Region. In the expansion program for the Eastern Region one 500 MW
unit beyond the 3x200 MW in Farakka has been treated as already firmly com-
mitted. To ascertain that the project of two 500 MW units is optimum in the
expansion sequence, an updating exercise which treats the project as variable
has been carried out. The result of the exercise indicates that the project
is justified as a component of the desirable power program for the Eastern
Region. For the purpose of this exercise two sequences of new power projects
have been developed which would satisfy the anticipated unconstrained demand
for electricity. The first sequence consists of Farakka with 2x500 MW units
and the second with these units being replaced by 2x500 MW at Talcher in
Orissa. The commissioning program of sanctioned and on-going projects and
new identified projects have been updated (Annex 6) and computer studies have
been carried out based on deterministic approach and providing for system
reserve margins as per CEA norms (Annex 49).
5.03    Costs of new projects in both sequences are expressed in border
prices. Where CIF prices are not applicable, a standard conversion factor of
0.8 is applied. Unskilled labor costs are valued at 75% of market wage rate.
1/ The plan has been presented and commented on in the Staff Appraisal
Report for Upper Indravati Hydro Project (Report No. 4289-IN)



-39-
The economic cost of coal is estimated as its long run marginal cost of
extraction, because of its low quality and its non-tradeable nature
(approximately Rs 172/ton at pit head). Coal consumption at 0.7 kg/KWh and
fuel oil support of 5ml/KWh at a price of Rs 2800/ton have been also taken
into consideration in the studies. Operation and maintenance expenditures
are 2.5% (thermal), 2.0% (hydro) and 1.0% (transmission) of the aggregate
investment cost. The investment in transmission and distribution has been
taken into account according to the pattern expected during the 7th plan
period and beyond (50% of investment in generation projects) (Annex 50).
5.04    The present value of the cost stream of the sequence containing the
project is lower than that of the alternative sequence at any discount rate
within reasonable range. The project constitutes, therefore, part of the
least cost expansion plan for the Eastern Region. Annex 52 shows the present
values of the cost streams of both options. The cost advantage for the
sequence containing the project amounts to about Rs 580 million (US$ 58
million) at 10%, falling to about Rs 417 million (US$41.7 million) in the
most pessimistic case at 15%.
Economic Rate of Return
5.05    A two stage approach has been adopted for the quantification of
economic benefits arising from the expansion of generating capacity in the
regional system: (i) average retail tariffs in the Region representing the
minimum willingness to pay for electricity; and (ii) in order to quantify
some consumer surplus beyond this minimum, the cost incurred by industrial
consumers in maintaining and operating standby generating sets has been
assumed as the maximum willingness to pay for continuous power supply (Annex
51).
5.06    The incremental amount of energy sold is adjusted to account for
system losses typical of the Region. The weighted average of 1983 tariff
revenue at the retail level in the Region has been estimated at Rs 0.52/KWh
(USCent 5.1/KWh), and converted to border prices for purposes of comparison
with economic cost. This value increases to Rs. 0.61/kwh if an estimate of
industrial willingness to pay replaces the industrial tariff (Annex 51).
5.07    Additional cost of transmission and distribution has been allocated
to both generation sequences in line with the general regional investment
pattern (Annex 50). Benefit and cost streams are presented in Annex 52.
5.08    Using only retail tariffs the internal rate of return of the invest-
ment program is about 7.0%, falling to 5.5% with more pessimistic scenarios
(Annex 52). These results indicate that SEB retail tariffs including elec-
tricity duty in the Region are economically somewhat inadequate to ensure
acceptable financial return on the proposed program at the retail level.



-40-
5.09    The minimum economic rate of return (considering industrial con-
sumers' willingness to pay; para. 5.05) is about 13Z, falling to about 11Z if
more pessimistic cost and benefit assumptions are tested (Annex 52). The
true internal rate of return is likely to be considerably higher than the
minimum quantifiable estimate, if industrial, agricultural and commercial
output made possible by the alleviation of shortages is t4ten into account,
and if indirect benefits accruing to the Indian economy are fully considered.
Benefits accruing ro non-industrial consumers are likely to be understated by
the use of tariff as a proxy for benefits.
SEBs' Tariffs
5.10    Past LRMC studies prepared in collaboration with the Bank Group
(1979) have shown that, in general, SEB tariffs for high voltage (mostly
industrial) consumers ranges from 50% to 90X of LRMC, wbile low voltage
tariffs (particularly those of domestic and agricultural consumers) cover
only 20% to 50Z of LRMC. Cross subsidization among consumer categories is a
policy unlikely to be abandoned in the near future for social and political
reasons. Nevertheless, since the bulk of electricity supply goes to high
voltage industrial consumers (more than 70Z in the Eastern Region), the
overall relation between LRMC and the average price per KWh can be considered
acceptable.

NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
SECOND FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
New Projects Included in the Investment Program
1.      Muradnagar Thermal Power Project - (National Capital Region)
A National Capital Region Thermal Power Project will be estab-
lished at Muradnagar, district of Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The project
will initially be developed for four units at 210 NW capacity each with
provision for further expansion. The station shall primarily supply power
to the National Capital Region. The project has been cleared by the
Central Electricity Authority and work has started to develop infrastruc-
tural facilities.
Coal for the station is proposed to be obtained from the North
Karanpura Coal fields of Bihar, located at a distance of about 1,200 km,
and will be transported through the Indian Railway network. Yearly coal
requirement for the project is expected to be of the order of 2.87 million
tons.
Water requirements are expected to be of the order of 80
cu.ft.sec. and shall be drawn from the Upper Ganga Canal which is at a
distance of 3.5 km from the project.
As per the present program the first unlt is expected to be com-
missioned in FY1990 with subsequent units following at intervals of nine
months each thereafter.
Three transmission lines, namely (i) 220 kV - Capital Region -
Muradnagar (5 kn); (ii) 220 kV - Capital Region - Burari (40 km); (iii)
400 kV - Capital Region - Mehrauli (85 km) are proposed to be constructed
to evacuate power from the thermal station.
The total project, including the transmission system, is expected
to cost about Rs 11,479 million.
2.      Kahaigaon Thermal Power Project
The Kahalgaon Thermal Power Project will be established in the
Bhagalpur district of Bihar. The project will initially be developed for

four units of 210 MW capacity each with provision for further expansion to
2,840 MW with the addition of four units of 500 MW capacity. The station
would primarily supply power to the Eastern region of the country. The
project has been cleared by the Ceutral Electricity Authority and work has
been started to develop infrastructural facilities.
Coal for the s tation is proposed to be obtained from the Rajmabal
Coalfields in Bihar, which would be transported by a captive 80 km
Merry-Go-Round railway systm.  Yearly coal requirement in the final phase
of the project is expected to be of the order of 11.30 million tons.
Water requirement for the final capacity of the power plant is
expected to be of the order of 4,200 cu.ft./sec. which would be drawn from
the River Ganga.
According to the present program the first unit of the firat phase
is expected to be commissioned in FY1989 while subsequent 200 MW units
would follow at an interval of six months.
The transmission lines, namely (i) Kahalgaon-Kahalgaon; (ii)
Kahalgaon-Chandrapur; (iii) Kahalgaon-Gaya are proposed to be constructed
to evacuate power from the first stage of the thermal station.

SECOND FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Project Description
1.      The Farakka development, located in West Bengal on the West Bank of
the Farakka feeder canal, is one of a series of large coal fired power
stations planned by GOI to feed into a 400 kV interconnected transmission
system and supply bulk power to the State Electricity Boards.
2.      The final profile of the Farakka power plant totalling 2,100 MW
includes three units of 200 MW and three units of 500 MW each. The first
stage (3x200 MW) is under construction with Bank/IDA financing, the first
unit being expected to be commissioned in January 1985.
3.      The Project consists of the second stage of the Farakka development
comprising two units of 500 MW each with associated mechanical and electrical
facilities and three 400 kV lines totalling about 640 km. The third stage,
consisting of a third 500 MW unit, would be installed at a later stage, under
a separate project.
4.      The 500 MW turbine will be three cylinder reheat condensing type
having one HP cylinder, one double flow IP cylinder and one double flow LP
cylinder with initial steam parameters of 168 kg/cm2 and 538c C/5380 C. The
generators will be water and hydrogen cooled, each rated at 588 MVA. The
boiler will be controlled circulation, pulverised coal fired, balanced draft
type using the direct firing system. The boiler will have a continuous
evapoiation rating of 1,700/h with a superheater outlet pressure of 178
kg/cm and temperature of 5400 C. Each generating unit will have 4 single
phase 200 MVA 21/400 kV transformers and will feed power into the 400 kV
system.
5.      The salient features of the development are shown below:
POWER STATION
Final Capacity                 - 2,100 MW (3x200 MW + 3x500 MW).
Fuel                           - Coal from the Hurra Block of Rajmahal
coalfields, located about 50 km from
the power station. Consumption of the
2,100 MW power station at 5,500 hrs of
operation per year is about 4 million
t/year. The average calorific value of
the coal is 3,600 kcal/kg; moisture 3.7-
10.1Z; ash 19.7-44.5%; sulfur 0.3-1.5Z.

Tran sprt                      - Unit train continuous system with bottom
of Coal                          discharging wagons.
Cooling System                 - The power station's requirements of cooling
water are proposed to be met from the
Farakka3feeder canal with a flow of 700-
1,120 m (25,000-40,000 cu ft)/sec. As there
is an abundance of water available from the
canal compared to cooling water requirements,
the power station has been designed for once-
through cooling. The estimated requirements
of cooling water for the 2,100 MW station
is 84 m  (3,000 cu ft)/sec, almost all of
which would be returned to the canal. The
consumptive water requirements for boiler
make-up and township would be comparatively
small. Water will flow from the feeder
canal through a channel up to a pump house
where it will be pumped to the power house.
Provision is allowed for a second stage pump
house, in line with the first stage, which
will be constructed under the second stage.
After cooling the condensers, the water will
be discharged into a channel through a dis-
charge duct (under construction) and lead
back into the feeder canal at a point
approximately 1.5 km downstream of the intake,
where a suitable diffusion device has been
provided. Temperature of the water in the
feeder canal, will rise about 30 C as a
result of this, but it will gradually cool
down to about its original temperature as it
flows from there.
Ash Disposal                   - The ash disposal area is available approxi-
mately 6.5 km from the power station site.
Ash would be pumped as a slurry through a
pipeline. Skimmers would be provided to
obtain relatively ash free water from the
disposal area which would overflow to
natural drainage.
Land                           - A total area of approximately 1,820 ha
(4,500 acres), excluding land for the coal
transportation system, is required for the
final capacity of the power plant (2,100 MW).
Of this, about 930 ha (2,300 acres) including

a year, regional average tariffs have been calculated which
result in a consolidated average NTPC tariff of 35.45 paise/kWh
for FY1984. Regional average tariffs have been progressively
increased for each subsequent year to levels resulting in an
average NTPC tariff of 50.39 paise/kWh (including fuel
surcharge) in FY1991 which is achieves a 9.7% rate of return
in that year. The regional tariffs include provision for

SECOND FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
CEA Norms for Calculation of Peaking Capacity and Energy Availability
The details of norms adopted for calculating the peaking capacity and
energy from the existing and on-going sanctioned thermal and hydro stations
on monthly basis, for assessing the power supply position are given below:
I. Thermal Generating Units (including Nuclear and Gas)
The peaking capacity available on bars is arrived at by making
deductions in respect of retirement of old units, planned boiler and capital
maintenance, forced outages, partial outages and auxiliaries as detailed
below:
(1) Effective Capacity: In the case of the existing thermal
generating units the derated capacity, if any, is considered.
In the case of newly commissioned thermal units, no benefits
are taken during the first three months after the unit is
commissioned and subsequently 50X of the capacity during the
next 9 months, and thereafter full benefits are considered.
(2) Retirement of Old Sets: Deductions on this account are made
@ 1/2 percent of the installed capacity available at the end
of the base year 1977-78 and it is increased cumulatively
@ 1/2 percent per year.
(3) Planned Maintenance: (Boiler and Capital). For boiler
maintenance, a period of one month every year and for capital
maintenance two months once in three years (which would also
include one month of boiler maintenance in that year) have been
allowed. Thus 1-1/2 times the installed MW capacity available
at the beginning of the year would be accounted for every year.
These figures are optimised to make the monthly surplus/deficit
position, as uniform as possible.
(4) Forced Outages: These are calculated at an average annual rate
of 17% with different rates for various months based on actals
as obtained for 1980-81, on the balance capability obtained
after allowing for retirement, planned and capital maintenance
from the effective capability.
(5) Partial Outages: These are calculated at an average annual rate
of 14X with different rates for various months based on actuals
as obtained for 1980-81, on the capacity available for
operation after accounting for the forced outages.
(6) Auxiliaries: This is calculated @ 92 of the capacity available
for operation after accounting for the forced outages.



AMNNE 49

-110-
(7) Norms for Energy Calculations: The basis on which the energy is
computed for the generating units is as given below:
(a) For existing station- @ 5350 KWh/kW gross.
(b)  For new stations - 2500 KWh/kW gross generation during
Ist year;
- 4000 KWh/kW gross generation during
2nd year;
- 5000 KWh/kW gross generation during
3rd year;
- 5350 KWh/kW gross generation during
4th year;
II. Hydro Generating Units:
(1) Generating Availability: The generating availability figures are
based on the designed head conditions on month-to-month basis
computed for a 9% dependable year.
(2) Retirement: Deductions on this account are made e 1/2 percent of
the installed capacity available at the end of the base year
1977-78 and it is increased cumulatively @ 1/2 percent per year.
(3) Planned Maintenance: The figures are worked out such that as
far as possible the hydro generating units are maintained during
lean periods only, keeping in view the peak system demand to
be met vis-a-vis the hydro generating availability obtainable
in each month during the year.
(4) Capital Maintenance: This is worked out @ 3% of the effective
generating capability obtained after deducting retirement from
the gross generating availability.
(5)  Forced Outages: An allowance of 5% on the effective generating
capability is made towards forced outages.
(6) Auxiliaries: On the balance capacity available for operation,
an allowance of 1/2% towards auxiliaries consumption is taken.
(7) Spinning Reserve: A spinning reserve of 5Z on the capacity
available on bars has been taken for the hydro units.
(8) Energy Output from Hydro Generating Units: The month-wise
energy figures based on 90Z dependable year in respect of
all the stations are considered, after deducting 1/2% towards
auxiliary consumption.

SECOND FARAKKA THERHAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Benefits
Method
1.      The approach used is one of identifying a proxy for the minimum
benefit that reflects the willingness of consumers to pay for incremental
power supply. The traditional method uses tariff revenue for this pur-
pose, bearing min mind that actual, non-quantified benefits are con-
siderably higher, both because of the existence of a consumers- surplus,
and because of the generally subsidized level of power tariffs. Some of
this surplus is identifiable if the cost incurred by industrial consumers
for the purchase and operation of diesel standby generating sets (neces-
sary in the case of not fully reliable power supply) is included in the
benefits. A further refinement would be to express benefits in terms of
industrial and agricultural output gained by the program's alleviation of
power outages that interrupt production. Additional benefits such as
greater work, leisure, and educational benefits accruing to domestic
consumers are quantifiable only with difficulty.
2.      In order to include some of the above industrial consumer surplus
in the benefit calculation the following method has been applied by the
Bank. At the time of commissioning of the projects in the program, the
Eastern Region is still expected to face a tight power supply situation.
As shortages affect the large industrial consumers more than agricultural,
domestic and commercial ones, it is likely that the use of industrial
standby generating capacity still will be widespread. Assuming a mix of
grid supply and own generation of industry (implying a downward-sloping
demand curve for industrial energy input), the result is a decreasing
average valuation of the kWh unit with increasing energy use, or decreas-
ing share of standby generation: a movement along the demand curve. The
average industrial willingness to pay is assumed to be the average of the
cost of own generation and the industrial tariff.
Energy Sales
3.      The amount of energy sold to final consumers is arrived at by
reducing the kWh sent out from the project (after auxiliary use) by the
average regional system losses: these will amount to about 15% of units
sent out at the time of project commissioning. The high share of
high-voltage industrial consumption keeps the losses low.

4.      The minimum proxy for benefits in the region is arrived at as
follows:

State                    Consumption     1983

Orissa                        21            37.0
Weighted average - financial                52.1
- economic                42.0
Industrial Willingness to Pay
5.      Assuming an average 1982 purchase price of a generating set of Ra
4,300/kW (including 10% installation cost), the total cost can be
expressed per kUh as follows:
Life of set               -     15 years
Average utilization at
30% load factor         -     2,628 hours/year
Purchase price            -     Rs 4,300JkU
Annual charge at 12%
discount rate           -     Rs 631/ku/year or Rs 0.24/kWh
O&H Cost                  -     Rs 215/kW/year or Ra 0.08/kWh
Fuel and lubricant        -     Rs 0.80 kWh
Total cost:  financial   -      Rs l.L2/kWh
economic    -     Rs 1.09/kWh
6.      The economic cost of Rs 1.09/kWh (at the assumed load factor)
represents the observed maximum willingness to pay for maintaining con-
tinuous power supply. The average industrial tariff in the region is
about Rs. 0.55/kWh, representing a lower limit of value attached to power
supply by industrial consumers. Zhe benefit proxy for industrial con-
sumers is taken as the average between the maximum observed willingness to
pay weighted by the shortage of power in the Region (around 30%) and the
industrial tariff. The resulting weighted average is Rs. 0.71/KWh. If
the benefits accruing to other consumer categories are valued at their
respective weighted averages of regional tariffs, the total minimum
average valuation of the energy unit at consumer level is Rs. 0.61/kWh:
