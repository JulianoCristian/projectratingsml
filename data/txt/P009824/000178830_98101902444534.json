Power\n            Project's main objective is to assist in meeting the\n            electricity demand in the Eastern Region of India through\n            the addition of 1,000 MW of thermal capacity at the Farakka\n            thermal power plant in West Bengal. The project comprises\n            the installation of two 500 MW generating units including\n            boilers, turbogenerator sets, electrical and mechanical\n            auxiliary equipment, associated civil works and common\n            services and facilities. The project includes also the\n            construction of about 640 km of associated transmission\n            lines. There are no risks other than those normally\n            associated with this type of project. All the major\n            equipment components are manufactured in India, and there is\n            adequate understanding of and experience with their installation."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
