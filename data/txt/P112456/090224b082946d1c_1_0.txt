Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The Program Development Objective (PDO) remains unchanged from RTFP I, and that is to facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and
 productive activities through the provision of insurance, coinsurance, reinsurance, financial instruments and related services. The key results
 expected include: - Increased trade in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of trade in participating countries insured by ATI policies
 (disaggregated by domestic, intra-regional and international). - Increased investment in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of
 investment in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by domestic, intra-regional and international) ; and, - Increased private
 participation through reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships with private and public insurers, measured by the volume of reinsurance obtained.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Operation was approved by the Board on June 14, 2011. The Financing Agreement for Benin was signed on November 9, 2011 and became
 effective on October 8, 2012 (Grant No H725-BJ). The Ghana Financing Agreement and Project Agreement lapsed in 2013, and the associated amount
 of SDR 12,700,000 was cancelled.

 As evidenced during the previous mission, PDO and intermediate indicators now appear to be on track to achieving their targets. This ISR reports the
 result of discussions with ATI Authorities held in Washington in October 2014 during the World Bank Annual Meetings, as well as the most
 recent supervision mission which focused on risk management and governance arrangements.
