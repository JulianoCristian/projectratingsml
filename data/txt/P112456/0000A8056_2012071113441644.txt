                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Program Development Objective (PDO) remains unchanged from RTFP I, and that is to facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and productive activities
                         through the provision of insurance, coinsurance, reinsurance, financial instruments and related services. The key results expected include:
                         -        Increased trade in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of trade in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by domestic,
                         intra-regional and international).
                         - Increased investment in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of investment in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by
                         domestic, intra-regional and international) ; and,
                         -        Increased private participation through reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships with private and public insurers, measured by the volume of reinsurance
                         obtained.
