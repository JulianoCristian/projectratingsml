                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Program Development Objective (PDO) remains unchanged from RTFP I, and that is to facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and productive activities
                         through the provision of insurance, coinsurance, reinsurance, financial instruments and related services. The key results expected include:
                         -        Increased trade in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of trade in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by domestic,
                         intra-regional and international).
                         - Increased investment in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of investment in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by
                         domestic, intra-regional and international) ; and,
                         -        Increased private participation through reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships with private and public insurers, measured by the volume of reinsurance
                         obtained.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reports the result of the field visit conducted in May 2013 in Nairobi, Kenya.

                         The Operation was approved by the Board on June 14, 2011. Financing Agreement for Benin was signed on November 9, 2011, --and the Financing Agreement for Ghana was

                         signed on August 7, 2012. The Grant No H725-BJ for Benin became effective on October 8, 2012.

                         Overall project progress is characterized with delays. The DO and IP ratings have been downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory because of the delays in effectiveness. It took 16
                         months for the Financing Agreement of Benin to become effective. The Ghana Financing Agreement (FA) did not become effective by the final deadline date for effectiveness which
                         was May 3, 2013 (date which the Bank unilaterally extended from February 3, 2013). Thus, the Financing Agreement and Project Agreement for Ghana (Credit No. 5007-GH) were
                         terminated.
