Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Operation was approved by the Board on June 14, 2011. The Financing Agreement for Benin was signed on November 9, 2011 and became
 effective on October 8, 2012 (Grant H7250). The Financing Agreement and Project Agreement for Ghana lapsed in May 2013, and the associated
 amount of SDR 12,700,000 was cancelled.
 This ISR reports the result of discussions with ATI during the implementation support mission conducted from 30 March to 2 April 2015, and a
 subsequent meeting with the ECOWAS Commission during the Spring Meetings in April 2015.
 The incremental capital financed by the Project has been deployed by ATI to facilitate incremental trade and investment flows in African member
 countries taking into account market demand and risk profiles (not limited to the country who subscribed the incremental capital). Performance
 and intermediate results indicators appear to be on track to achieve overall targets, including in Kenya where the agency is headquartered, although not
 in the member countries whose membership was intended to be financed by the Project.
 Since all available funds have been disbursed, the Project is expected to close in June 2015 in line with the request received from Benin authorities, and
 in agreement with ATI. Consistent with the recommendations of the ICR for the first Regional Trade Facilitation Project closed in 2013, implementation
 support missions in the last two years have focused on governance and risk management, particularly the implementation of self-supervision and self-
 correction mechanisms to ensure that the agency's operations remain sustainable after the Project has closed. Measures discussed with ATI
 include the periodic evaluation of its Board's functioning and and performance by specialized external consultants (already implemented), systematic
 oversight of ATI's risk portfolio by a Board Risk Committee (the committee has been established), and the inclusion of independent directors selected for
 their expertise, entrusted to chair key Board Committees.
