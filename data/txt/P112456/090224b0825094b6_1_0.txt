                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Program Development Objective (PDO) remains unchanged from RTFP I, and that is to facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and productive activities
                         through the provision of insurance, coinsurance, reinsurance, financial instruments and related services. The key results expected include:
                         -        Increased trade in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of trade in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by domestic,
                         intra-regional and international).
                         - Increased investment in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of investment in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by
                         domestic, intra-regional and international) ; and,
                         -        Increased private participation through reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships with private and public insurers, measured by the volume of reinsurance
                         obtained.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         This ISR reports the result of the field visit conducted in March 12-21, 2014 in Nairobi, Kenya. The Bank mission was pleased to note progress in the Monitoring and evaluation
                         (M&E) framework. The Bank and ATI teams revamped the project indicators by clarifying the metrics and establishing the end targets. This will allow the teams to better gauge how
                         well RTFP2 is meeting its Project Development Objective (PDO). All PDO and intermediate indicators now appear to be on track to achieving their targets.
