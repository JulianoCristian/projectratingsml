 Introduction
 Under the various Development Credit Agreements and the Agreements Providing for the
 Amendment and Restatement of these Development Credits between AT! and the International
 Development Association (IDA) and each of the African Member States participating in the
 Regional Trade Facilitation Project (RTFP), and the Participation Agreements and the Agreements
 providing for the Amendment and Restatement of the Participation Agreements between AT!
 and each of the African Member States, AT! is required to open and maintain, with a reputable
 commercial bank or banks (Security Trust Account Trustees), US Dollar-denominated Security
 Trust Accounts and Income Accounts on behalf of each African Member State.


 Pursuant to requests from AT! on behalf of each African Member State, IDA disbursed each
 African Member State's credit into their respective Secmity Trust Account. Interest earned by the
 funds deposited in the Security Trust Accounts was deposited in a separate Income Account for
 each African Member State and made available for use by ATI. Except for Madagascar, the legal
 and capital resb·ucturing for all the other African member states has been completed and the
 amounts in the Security Trust account b·ru1sferred to ATI bank accounts;


 The funds in the Security Trust Accounts provided ATI with the underwriting capital n eeded to
 unde~write political and commercial risk insmance, including co-insurance and re-insurance.


 In line with ATI's legal and capital restructuring programme, funds held in the Security Trust
 Accounts on behalf of countries that met the requirements of the Agreements providing for the
 Amendment and Restatement of the Development Credit Agreements between IDA and each
 African Member State, have been fully exchanged for shares in ATI's common equity capital. The
 funds remaining in the Security Trust Accounts are those relating to Madagascar.

      Auditors' Responsibilities

      operation of the Security Trust Accounts and Income Accounts with the terms of the agreements
      listed under management responsibilities above, during the year ended 31December,2014.
      We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing. These standards
      require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform our audit to obtain
      reasonable assurance on the compliance of the operation of the Security Trust Accounts and

      ACCOUNTS (CONTINUED)

      Audit Findings
      The balances in the Security Trust Accounts as at 31 December, 2014 represented the following:

      •       A principal amount of US$450,000 (2013 - US$900,000), disclosed in note 13, relating to the
              amount held pending completion of the legal and capital restructuring by Madagascar after
              which the amount in the Security Trust account will be transferred to ATl's account.

      Opinion
      In our opinion, the Security Trust Accounts and Income Accounts have, in all material respects,
      been operated in accordance with the terms of the ATI Treaty, the ATI/IDA Amended and
      Restated Project Agreement, the ATI/IDA Amended and Restated Development Credit
      Agreement, the IDA/ African Member States' Amended and Restated Development Credit
      Agreements, the ATI/ African Member States' Amended and Restated Participation Agreements,

      between the African Trade Insurance Agency and Security Trust Account Trustees and the
      Insurers, and the Agreement to Amend and Partially Terminate the Insurance Facility Agreement
      between ATI and the Insurers.

      Emphasis of matter

      We draw attention to note 13 to the financial statements which describes the transfer of funds
      from one of the Security Trust Accounts to a general account. Our opinion is not qualified in
      this respect.

  INDEPENDENT ·.AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE AFRICAN TRADE
  INSURANCE AGENCY ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


  We have audited lf1e- accompanying financial statements of the African Trade Insurance Agency
  (ATI), set out on .pages 10. to 46, which comprise ATI's statement of financial position as at 31
  December, 2014, statement· of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of
  changes in equit}r and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of
  sigilificant account:irig policies and other explanatory information.


  Directors' Responsibility for the Finandal Statements

  The Directors are respon.Sible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair
  view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the
  ATI Treaty, and for such ·internal controls as Directors determine are necessary to enable the
  preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
  fraud or error.             ·


  Auditors' Responsibility

  Our responsibilitY is ·to exj>ress ·a n opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
  conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards
  require that we comp~y with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

  An audit involv~s , performing ·procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
  disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment,
  including the assessment . of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
  whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we considered the internal
  controls relevant to the entity's preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view
  in order to design ~udit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
  purpose of expressing·ari opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal controls. An audit
  also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
  of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
  the financial statements.    ·

 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
 basis for our audit.opinion..

ATI currently has 10 African Member States (2013: 10 members) and 8 other shareholders (2013: 7
other shareholders). A new shareholder, Kenya Reinsurance Corporation Ltd., joined ATI in 2014.

ATI has its head office in Nairobi, Kenya. It also has a direct presence in 4 other countries;
Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.


2. Accounting Policies

(a)        Basis of Preparation

ATI's financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial
statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all financial years
presented, unless otherwise stated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The areas
involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3: "Accounting Estimates and
Judgments".

                (i)         New and revised IFRSs that are effective for the year ending 31 December, 2014

     Below is a list of the amendments to IFRSs and the new Interpretation that are mandatorily
     effective for accounting periods that begin on or after 1January2014:

     Amendments to IFRS 10,                           Investment Entities                         l-Jan-14

     •     The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the requirements relating to the offset of financial assets
           and financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments clarify the meaning of 'currently has a
           legally enforceable right of set-off' and 'simultaneous realisation and settlement'. The
           application of these amendments did not materially affect ATI' s financial statements.

     •     The amendments to IAS 36 remove the requirement to disclose the recoverable amount of a
           cash-generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful
           lives had been allocated when there has been no impairment or reversal of impairment of the
           related CGU. Furthermore, the amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements
           applicable to when the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is measured at fair value less
           costs of disposal. ATI has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and none of ATI' s
           intangible assets were impaired in 2014; hence no changes to the financial disclosures were
           required.

     •     The amendments to IAS 39 have no impact on these financial statements as ATI does not
           apply hedge accounting.

     •     Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 are only applicable to investment entities and do
           not apply to ATI.

     •     IFRIC 21 addresses the issue of when to recognise a liability to pay a levy. ATI benefits from
           tax exemptions. No liabilities for levies were identified in 2014 that had material impact on
           ATI' s accounts.

•     The amendments to IFRS 11 provide guidance on how to account for the acquisition of an
      interest in a joint operation in which the activities constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3
      Business Combinations. The amendments should not be applicable to AT! as ATI's current
      investment policy does not allow it to make such an acquisition.

•     IFRS 14 is available only to first-time adopters of IFRSs who recognised regulatory deferral
      account balances under their previous GAAP, hence will not apply to ATI.

               (ii)        New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective (but allow for early application) for
                           the year ending 31 December, 2014 (continued)

    •    IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue
         arising from contracts with customers. Its core principle is that an entity should recognise
         revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
         reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
         goods or services. The application of this new standard is not expected to materially affect
         ATI's financial statements. ATl's main revenues (premiums and commissions) are already
         deferred and are only recognised in the profit or loss account when they are actually earned.

    •    The amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based
         depreciation method for items of property, plant and equipment. These amendments will
         only be applicable to ATI if it makes property investments.

    •    The Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 will apply to a specific sector (agriculture) and will
         not affect ATl.

    •    The amendments to IAS 19 specify that contributions from employees or third parties set out '
         in the formal terms of a defined benefit plan may be recognised as a reduction in service cost
         in the same period in which they are paid, if and only if the contributions are linked solely to
         the employee's service rendered in that period.

    •    The annual improvements 2010-2012 cycle include amendments to the following standards:
         IFRS2 (Share-based Payment), IFRS3 (Business Combinations), IFRS8 (Operating Segments),
         IFRS13 (Fair Value Measurement), IAS16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) and IAS38
         (Intangible Assets), IAS24 (Related Party Disclosures).
             IFRS2, IFRS3, IFRS8 and IAS16 do not apply to ATI.
             The amendments to IFRS13 permit entities to continue to measure short-term receivables
             and payables that have no stated interest rate at invoice amounts, if the effect of
             discounting is immaterial. These amendments are not expected to significantly impact
             ATI' s financials.
             The amendments to IFRS38 clarify the treatment of accumulated amortisation and the
             gross carrying amount of revalued intangible assets.
             The amendments to IAS24 clarify that a management entity providing key management
             personnel services to the reporting entity is a related party of the reporting entity. ATI
             does not currently have such arrangements; hence, no additional disclosures are expected.

    2. Accounting Policies (continued)

    (b)        Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
               (continued)

    •     The annual improvements 2011-2013 cycle include amendments to IFRS 3 (Business
          Combinations), IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement), and IAS 40 (Investment Property-
          interrelationship between IFRS 3 and IAS 40).
              IFRS 3 and IAS 40 do not apply to ATI.
              The amendments to IFRS 13 clarify that, when measuring fair value; the portfolio
              exception can be applied to contracts within IAS 39 or IFRS 9 not just to those contracts
              that meet the definition of financial assets or financial liabilities. The amendments are not
              expected to have material impact on ATI' s financial statements as none of ATI' s assets and
              liabilities are carried at fair value.


               (iii)       Early adoption of standards

    •     ATI chose to early adopt IFRS 9 in 2011.

          The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) completed the final version of IFRS 9 in
          July 2014. This version replaces earlier versions of IFRS 9 and completes the IASB' s project to
          replace IAS 39 in its entirety. The package of improvements introduced by IFRS 9 includes:
               A logical model for classification and measurement driven by cash flow characteristics
              and the business model in which an asset is held, and introduces a new category of assets:
              "fair value through other comprehensive income". The introduction of this new category
              does not affect ATI' s asset classification. ATI exclusively invests in financial assets with
              cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest and its principal objective is
              to hold the financial asset to collect the contractual cash flows.
              A single, forward-looking 'expected loss' impairment model. None of ATI's holdings were
              deemed to be impaired as at 31December2014.
              A substantially-reformed approach to hedge accounting which did not apply to these
              financial statements as ATI had no hedging arrangements in place in 2014.


    (c)        Foreign Currency Translation

    The financial statements are presented in thousands of US Dollars (US$).

    The US$ is ATl's functional and presentation currency. Transactions in currencies other than US$
    are converted into US$ at the spot rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Financial
    instruments and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US$ are
    translated into US$ at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year. Gains and
    losses on currency exchange are charged or credited to the profit or loss in the period in which
    they arise.

     (d)         Underwriting Activities and Reinsurance

              (i)           Premiums

     Gross premiums correspond to premiums invoiced and estimated premiums earned but not yet
     invoiced in the period with respect to both direct insurance policies and inward reinsurance
     treaties. They are stated net of premium cancellations and rebates. Gross premiums include
     commitment fees on loans covered.

              (ii) Unearned premiums

     Unearned premiums represent the prorated portion of written premiums that relates to
     unexpired risks at the year-end. Unearned premiums are calculated individually for each policy.
     The amount charged to the unearned premiums reserve corresponds to the fraction of written
     premiums relating to the period between the year-end and the end of policy period for which the
     gross written premiums were calculated. Unearned premiums are reported as a liability. Changes
     in unearned premiums relating to the period are recognised through profit or loss.

                    (iii)      Deferred acquisition costs

     Acquisition costs, including brokerage commissions and ceding commissions related to inward
     reinsurance, are deferred over the life of the contracts concerned according to the same rules as
     unearned premium provisions. The amount deferred acquisition costs, corresponds to business
     acquisition costs related to the period between the year-end and the next premium payment date.
     Deferred acquisition costs are reported as an asset. Changes in deferred acquisition costs relating
     to the period are recognised through profit or loss.

                    (iv)       Claims paid

     Paid claims correspond to insurance settlements (indemnifications) plus claims handling
     expenses, which include, but are not limited to, any related legal fees.

                    (v)        Claims reserves

     Claims reserves include provisions to cover the estimated total cost of reported claims not settled
     at the year-end (outstanding claims), case reserves, provisions for claims incurred but not
     reported and provisions for unknown claims.

     Provisions for unknown claims are determined based on ATI' s claims provisioning methodology.

                 (vi)         Recoveries

     Recoveries represent estimated recoveries determined on the basis of the total amount expected
     to be recovered in respect of all underwriting periods relating to the claims.

                 (vii)        Outward reinsurance (cessions)

     This represents premiums that are ceded to other reinsurance companies based on existing
     treaties and facultative reinsurance arrangements and in line with the company's capacity limits.
     Gross ceded premiums are accounted for in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
     related reinsurance covers and are earned over the life of the covers. Reinsurers' share of technical
     provisions is determined on the basis of technical provisions recorded under liabilities. Ceding
     commissions are calculated by reference to ceded premiums. They are deferred and changes in
     ceding commissions are recognised in profit or loss on the same basis as ceded unearned
     premiums.

     (e)         One-off Commissions

     One-off commissions are recognised and fully earned when they arise.

     (f)         Other Income

     Other income includes grant income, credit limit income, and any other incidental income earned
     in the normal course of business.

     Grants are recognised as earned income at the same time as the expenses related to or
     reimbursable under the grant are paid or accrued.

     Credit limit income is stated net of any related expenses (purchase of information).

     (g)          Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and at bank, time deposits and short-term
     investments in money market funds, if any. Cash and cash equivalents exclude cash held in
     security trust accounts which is disclosed separately in the statement of financial position.

     (h)        Motor Vehicles and Equipment

             (i)    Initial recognition

     Motor vehicles and equipment are recognised at their acquisition costs and are measured at cost.
     Acquisition costs include the purchase price and any incidental costs such as freight, insurance
     and installation costs. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised
     as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits
     associated with the item will flow to ATI and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All
     other costs, repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in
     which they are incurred.

             (ii) Measurement

      Motor vehicles and equipment are measured at cost. Depreciation is calculated monthly on the
      straight-line basis from the date of purchase to the date of disposal or the expiry of the expected
    · useful life of the relevant asset at the following annual rates:   '

           Motor Vehicles                                                    25%
           Computers and Related Equipment                                   331/3%
           Other Office Equipment                                            20%
           Furniture and Fittings                                            20%

     Items of lasting value with an initial acquisition cost of US$1,000 or above are systematically
     capitalised. Items with an initial acquisition cost of less than US$1,000 are capitalised but fully
     depreciated in the month of purchase. However, depending on their nature, small value items can
     be depreciated over their useful life.

                (iii)       Disposal gains and losses

     Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount
     (net book value) of the assets. These are recognised in profit or loss in the period of disposal.

                (iv)        Impairment

     Motor vehicles and equipment are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Where there is an indication
     that an asset may be impaired, ATI makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. Where
     the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired
     and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss
     in the period in which the losses arise.

     (i)        Intangible Assets

             (i)       Initial recognition

     Intangible assets comprise costs of acquired computer software programs and costs associated
     with developing or maintaining computer software programs.

     Under IAS 38, IT development costs must be capitalised and amortised over their estimated
     useful life when certain criteria are met. In such cases, the entity must be able to demonstrate the
     following:
             the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for
             use or sale;
             its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
             its ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
             how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
             the current and future availability of adequate resources to complete the development and
             use or sell the intangible asset; and
             its ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
             development.

                (ii)        Measurement

     Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life (3 to 5 years) using the straight-line
     method.

                (iii)       Impaimzent

     Intangible assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Where there is an indication that an asset
     may be impaired, ATI makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. Where the carrying
     amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is
     written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss in
     the period in which the losses arise.

2. Accounting Policies (continued)

(j)            Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. As permitted by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), ATI chose the earlier adoption of this standard
in 2011.

         (i)     Initial recognition

All financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a
financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. The
fair value corresponds to the market price (purchase price in the case of a financial asset or
issuance price in the case of a financial liability) at the transaction date.

Transactions are recognised on their settlement dates.

         (ii) Measurement

Financial assets

IFRS 9 divides all financial assets into three classes: those measured at amortised cost; those
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income; and, those measured at fair value
through profit or loss.

ATI classifies its financial assets as to be measured at amortised cost as it exclusively invests in
financial assets with contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest and
its principal objective is to hold the financial asset to collect the contractual cash flows.

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified either at fair value through profit or loss or at
amortised cost. As of 31 December, 2014, all ATI's financial liabilities were measured at amortised
cost.

                 (iii)      Impairment offinancial assets measured at amortised cost

     ATI assesses at the end of each financial year whether there has been a material increase in the
     probability of the occurrence of a default since the initial recognition of each of its financial assets.
     Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to either the 12
     month expected credit losses or the full lifetime expected credit losses if credit risk has increased
     significantly since initial recognition of the financial instrument.

     (k) Taxation

     In accordance with the ATI Treaty, ATI and its assets are not subject to any direct or indirect
     taxation in its Member States.

     (1)    Comparatives

     Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in and maintain
     consistency with the presentation in the current year.


     3. Accounting Estimates and Judgments

     The area that management views as mo~t critical with respect to the application of estimates and
     assumptions is the establishment of its claims reserves. The claims reserves for unknown claims
     (statistical reserves) are determined by product.

     In 2014, a change in statistical reserves of US$0.5M on ATI's commercial portfolio was recorded in
     its accounts which brought the total amount of statistical reserves reported on the Statement of
     Financial Position to US$2.5M.

     Provisions for unknown claims have been estimated on a "best estimate" basis using the
     information available. There can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not differ from
     such estimates.

     ATI has recorded a very limited number of claims since its inception. Because of lack of actual
     claim experience, ATI estimates statistical reserves on its commercial risk portfolio based on
     buyers' internal credit ratings and market information (historical default rates and average
     recovery rates).

     NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     4. Risk Management

     ATI recognises the importance of risk management and the fact that strong systems of internal
     control are essential for effective risk management. It currently has four levels of risk control.

     The first level is the operational permanent controls which are governed by ATI's various policies
     and procedures and are performed by each department.

     The second level is the Enterprise Risk Management framework (ERM) which was implemented
     in 2008 and revised in 2012. The ERM framework involves the staff, the management team and
     the Board of Directors; and, is designed to identify potential events that may affect ATI, and to
     manage risks to be within its risk appetite. Quarterly ERM monitoring is conducted to review and
     assess the framework processes, the key risks and key risk mitigations, and to adjust them if
     necessary. ATI also revises and updates its ERM framework every 3 to 4 years.

     The third level is the internal audits performed by an independent audit firm. The Board has
     chosen to externalize ATI's internal audit function since 2011 . In this regard, a new independent
     audit firm was appointed in 2014.

     The last level is the Board Risk Committee, which was established by the Board of Directors in
     May 2014, with a mandate to identify, assess, monitor and manage underwriting, financial and
     non-financial risks faced by ATL

     As an insurance provider, ATI is exposed to two principal types of risks. The first type of risk is
     the risk inherent to its underwriting activities which encompasses the risk of losses arising from
     claims and the risk of losses arising from the default of its reinsurers (counterparty risk). The
     second type of risk is the risk inherent in its investment activities which encompasses market risk
     (interest rate risk, market price risk, and exchange rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk

     (a)         Underwriting Risk

                 (i)         Risk of losses arising from claims

     The insurance policies underwritten by ATI involve the possibility of insured events occurring
     and the resulting uncertainty of the amount and timing of insurance claims. ATI recognises that
     adequate control of insurance risk is paramount and central to the integrity of its operation as a
     credit and investment insurer. In this context, ATI has established underwriting management
     frameworks and processes designed to effectively identify, measure, control, mitigate, share and
     monitor risks inherent in its underwriting activities, which include the following:

                Country ratings;
                Use of portfolio risk analysis;
                Prudent credit risk assessment and underwriting on individual insured buyers or
                obligors;
                Comprehensive technical and contract risk assessment of political risks;
                Purchase of reinsurance; and
                Selection of strongly rated reinsurers.

In order to prevent excessive risk concentration, ATI sets, among others, exposure limits by
product, country, and project. The table below shows the risk exposure by product and by
country, having regard to the maximum sums insured included in the terms of issued policies
still in force as at 31December,2014 and 2013:

4. Risk management (continued)

(a)         Underwriting Risk (continued)

In 2014, ATI implemented a new reinsurance cover on its stand-alone PV&TS portfolio which
contributed to a reduction of its net exposure by US$86.1M.

            (ii)        Reinsurance counterparty risk

ATI uses reinsurance to enhance its capacity but also to cap its risks. A significant portion of its
insurance risk is ceded to external reinsurers, through a number of reinsurance arrangements that
include quota share, excess of loss and facultative treaties. Most of the treaties are renewed and
reassessed annually. Reinsurance does not, however, discharge ATI's liability as primary insurer.

If a reinsurer fails to pay a claim for any reason, ATI remains liable for the full payment of that
claim to the policyholder. To mitigate the reinsurance counterparty risk, all reinsurers with whom
ATI has reinsurance contracts are required to have a minimum credit rating as stated below
unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors:

Moody's, Standard & Poor' s or Fitch                                       A

    (b)         Investment Risk

    ATI' s investments are exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk:

                market risk is the risk of loss from adverse movements in market variables such as interest
                rates, market prices and currency exchange rates;
                credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from client or counterparty default or downgrade
                and arises on credit exposure in all forms, including settlement risk; and
                liquidity risk is the risk that ATI is unable to meet its payment obligations when due, at a
                reasonable cost.

    ATI' s investment policy defines its broad investment guidelines and strategic asset allocation
    which can be amended from time to time subject to the approval of the Board of Directors. One of
    the main objectives of the investment policy is to seek to preserve capital.

    The Management Investment Committee (MIC) ensures that investments are allocated within
    both the investment guidelines and the strategic asset allocation. On a monthly basis, the MIC
    reviews the portfolio positioning and performance and assesses any new proposed investments.
    The MIC reports to the Board of Directors through its Finance & Audit Committee on a quarterly
    basis.

    Where ATI externalises the management of its assets, the manager has to strictly abide by the
    contractual investment guidelines and strategic asset allocation which are defined in conformity
    with ATI' s investment policy.

     (b)         Investment Risk (continued)

                 (i)         Market risk

     Market risk is the risk that the value of ATI will be adversely affected by movements in market
     variables such as interest rates, market prices and currency exchange rates.

     The risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is limited:
            As of 31 December, 2014, ATI's investment portfolio was comprised of almost 80% of
            fixed-rate instruments which largely covered its fixed-rate borrowings (IDA loan -
            US$9.9M). Therefore, any increase in interest rate should not impact ATI's result
            negatively.
            LIBOR rates remained at very low levels in 2014. Hence the risk of further decrease is
            limited. However, an improvement of the LIBOR rates would allow ATI to improve its
            interest income on the floating rate instruments it holds. The following table shows the
            potential effects of changes in LIBOR rates on ATI's interest income and net result.

     None of ATI's financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss, therefore
     changes in market prices should not have any impact on ATI' s financial position or income
     statement unless the assets are sold before their maturity dates. Apart from the time deposits,
     ATI' s funds are exclusively invested in money market instruments, notes and debt securities
     which are measured at amortised cost. In addition, ATI's investment p olicy does not permit any
     speculative investments.

     ATI's functional and reporting currency is the US Dollar (US$). As ATI carries out the majority of
     its transactions in US$, it has chosen to allocate more than 95% of its investments in this currency
     to minimise exposure to currenetJ risk.

(b)        Investment Risk (continued)

           (ii)           Credit risk

ATI recognises the importance of having a diversified portfolio. To minimise the chances that a
default by a counterparty or an adverse event in any particular country might have a
disproportionate impact on ATI's financial position or profit or loss, ATI has actively diversified
its asset portfolio since 2011 and has increased the number of counterparties from 2 to more than
100.

In addition to the portfolio diversification, ATI permanently seeks to maintain the credit quality
of its assets. The average rating of its portfolio remained in the AA range in 2014 (2013: AA) .

Apart from its financial investments, ATI also monitors regularly its overall assets. The table
below presents ATI's maximum exposure to credit risk as of 31December,2014:

As an insurance provider, in addition to its financial obligations arising from the normal
operating activities, ATI is exposed to calls on its available cash for unexpected losses under
claims settlement.

59.6% of ATI's funds are invested in various instruments with maturities below one year.
Consequently, AT! considers its investment portfolio to be sufficiently liquid to cover its
operating cash flows and any potential claims it may be required to pay.

ATI has to comply with the capital requirements as set out in its Operations Manual. ATI's
Operations Manual, allows it to leverage its capital and reserves up to five times (i.e. up to
US$903.1M). As of 31 December, 2014, ATI's net exposure amounted to US$514.3M which only
represented 57% of its overall underwriting capacity. This compares to a net exposure of

     9. Interest Income (continued)

     Investments in bonds are recognised at their fair value at the purchase dates (which correspond to
     their face value plus any discount, premium, purchased accrued interest and transaction costs, if
     any). Subsequent to their initial recognition, they are individually carried at amortised cost by
     using the effective interest rates. The difference between the coupon and the effective interest rate
     is recognised in profit or loss as 'Bond Amortisation'.

      13. Security Trust Accounts (continued)

      The balances in the Security Trust Accounts represent funds for Madagascar relating to the
      amount held pending completion of the legal and capital restructuring by Madagascar after
      which the amounts in the Security Trust Accounts will be transferred to an ATI account. The
      principal reason for the change compared to 2013 was due to the fact that one of the depositary
      banks erroneously refunded the funds they held through a transfer of the funds to an ATI bank
      account on 31 December 2014. This issue has since been resolved and the funds have been
      transferred back to the same depositary bank.

      Funds held in the Security Trust Accounts are denominated in US$. ATI earns interest on these
      accounts. The effective interest rate as of 31December,2014 was 0.40% (2013 - 0.75 %).
