                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Program Development Objective (PDO) remains unchanged from RTFP I, and that is to facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and productive activities
                         through the provision of insurance, coinsurance, reinsurance, financial instruments and related services. The key results expected include:
                         -        Increased trade in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of trade in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by domestic,
                         intra-regional and international).
                         - Increased investment in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of investment in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by
                         domestic, intra-regional and international) ; and,
                         -        Increased private participation through reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships with private and public insurers, measured by the volume of reinsurance
                         obtained.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Operation was approved by the Board on June 14, 2011. Financing Agreement for Benin was signed on November 9, 2011, and the Financing Agreement for Ghana was
                         signed on August 7, 2012. The Grant No H725-BJ for Benin became effective on October 8, 2012. The The DO and IP ratings have been downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory
                         because of the delays in effectiveness. It took 16 months for the Financing Agreement of Benin to become effective, and it is now 2 years since the project was approved, but the

                         Ghana Financing Agreement (FA) did not become effective. On February 3, 2013, the Bank unilaterally extended the final date for effectiveness to May 3, 2013. The main reason for
                         the delays in effectiveness of the Ghana Credit is that further Cabinet and Parliament review of the ATI Treaty is needed. But approval did not happen during the unilateral extension
                         period and therefore the Ghana portion will be canceled.
