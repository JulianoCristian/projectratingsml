                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Program Development Objective (PDO) remains unchanged from RTFP I, and that is to facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and productive activities
                         through the provision of insurance, coinsurance, reinsurance, financial instruments and related services. The key results expected include:
                         -        Increased trade in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of trade in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by domestic,
                         intra-regional and international).
                         - Increased investment in participating countries, measured by the volume ($) of investment in participating countries insured by ATI policies (disaggregated by
                         domestic, intra-regional and international) ; and,
                         -        Increased private participation through reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships with private and public insurers, measured by the volume of reinsurance
                         obtained.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Operation was approved by the Board on June 14, 2011. Financing Agreement for Benin was signed on November 9, 2011, and the Financing Agreement for Ghana was
                         signed on August 7, 2012 and its effectiveness has been extended to February 4, 2013. The Grant No H725-BJ for Benin became effective on October 8, 2012. The DO and IP
                         ratings have been downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory because of the delays in effectiveness. It took 16 months for the Financing Agreement of Benin to become effective and it

                         is now 18 months since the project was approved but the Ghana Financing Agreement (FA) is not yet effective. The team is working with the Ghanaian Authorities and the ATI in
                         Nairobi to ensure that the FA becomes effective in February 2013 as planned. The team is currently on mission in Nairobi and will prepare an updated ISR early next year to
                         incorporate the findings of the December 2012 mission (and upload the Aide Memoire) and progress towards the Ghana effectiveness. The ORAF will also be updated in that ISR.
