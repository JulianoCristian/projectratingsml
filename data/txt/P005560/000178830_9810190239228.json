The project consists of the\n            following components: (a) field crop development and farm\n            machinery for the first year of the second phase; (b) fruit\n            tree development; (c) construction of farm access roads to\n            serve the project area; (d) strengthening of the extension\n            service and of the organization for project administration;\n            and (e) provision of technical assistance. The project is\n            part of a program that would contribute to the development\n            of rainfed agriculture in Syria by increasing cultivable\n            lands and by building the institutional framework for growth\n            through the extension services and the establishment of an\n            organization for project implementation which could be used\n            as a model in other areas."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
