The proposed project\n            forms part of EEEB's 1979-82 Investment Program, and is\n            aimed at expansion, rehabilitation and modernization of the\n            urban distribution network, including strengthening of the\n            company's distribution planning, design, operating and\n            maintenance practices. The impact of the project on\n            Bogota's development would be considerable; it is\n            estimated that it would supply electricity to an estimated\n            157,000 new residential, commercial and industrial\n            subscribers. About thirty-five percent of the new\n            subscribers are expected to be in the lower income group.\n            The project would also contribute to enhancing the\n            reliability of electricity services throughout the urban\n            area. The project is not subject to significant risks and is\n            expected to be carried out as scheduled. All appropriate\n            provisions have been made to minimize the environmental\n            impact of the facilities."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
