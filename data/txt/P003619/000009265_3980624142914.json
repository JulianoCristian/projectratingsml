This\n            would be achieved through reduction of unit cost and transit\n            time by: (a) upgrading Inland Waterways infrastructure to\n            allow navigation of larger size vessels; (b) increasing\n            shiplock capacity to reduce waiting time; and (c) increasing\n            financial and organizational capacity of IWT agencies. The\n            project components in Guangdong Province include: (a)\n            renovation of Zhaoqing-Huatiaomen and\n            Lianhuashan-Shawan-Ronggui (L-S-R) Waterways; (b)\n            enhancement of maintenance dredging capacity and operational\n            management; (c) technical assistance for institutional\n            development and implementation support and training; (d)\n            resettlement, monitoring and maintenance during\n            implementation; and (e) tax and duties.  The project\n            components in Jiangsu Province include: (a) construction of\n            five shiplocks; (b) technical assistance for institutional\n            development and implementation support and training; (c)\n            resettlement, design, and monitoring; and (d) tax and duties."}, "docdt": "1998-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
