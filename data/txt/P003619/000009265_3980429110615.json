The environmental impact assessment\n            covers the two provincial components--Guangdong Province and\n            Jiangsu Province.  In both provinces, the impact of\n            construction noise will be mitigated by limiting the\n            machines of high noise to work continuously.  Afforested\n            belts will be established along the shorelines sensitive\n            sections to mitigate ship noises.  Impact of suspended\n            substances (SS) from dredging on water quality will be\n            mitigated by executing shore-excavating engineering on land.\n            Construction activities should be stopped when the\n            concentration of SS exceeds controlling standard.  Dumping\n            of waste earth and dredged materials should be conducted as\n            deep as possible in beheaded rivers or low-lying lands.\n            During constructions in Jiangsu, water spraying and speed\n            control of construction vehicles will mitigate the pollution\n            caused by dust.  In Guangdong, reef blasting and dredging\n            during constructions may disrupt the migration route for\n            fish.  Construction period should avoid the migratory\n            season.  Small doses of explosives should be applied to\n            reduce the impact reef blasting produces on nearby\n            constructions.  After the project is completed, flood level\n            is expected to rise.  Observation of the water level should\n            be enhanced."}, "docdt": "1997-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
