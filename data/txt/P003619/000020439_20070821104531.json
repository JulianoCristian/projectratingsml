Some lessons learned\n            included: supporting economic growth by improving the Inland\n            Waterway Sector is essential; avoid conditionality that\n            advocates policy beyond the control of the Project; and\n            permanent government subsidies for transport infrastructure\n            should be avoided but road and inland waterway systems are\n            somewhat exceptional: for the most part - other than busy\n            commercial canals and high density tolled freeways - they\n            are appropriately treated as public goods recovered through\n            taxes and vehicle/registration fees."}, "docdt": "2007-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
