1.3.2 Preparation purposes
The ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION IMPLEMENTATION PLAN is
prepared according to the pollution control and impact retardation measures
in the Project Schemes and the ENVIRONMENT IMPACT REPORTS to
supervise the contractor and owner to execute the pollution MITIGATION
measures, environment management and monitoring plan during construction
and operation and to test the effect of the measures and to adjust and
supplement measures according to environment monitoring results and to
ensure the construction of the Projects and the pollution treatment at the
same time for achieving better economic, social and environment benefits.
6



2.   MAIN ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION OBJECTIVES
2.1 PROJECT' S IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENT
2.1.1   The environment impact of the Projects is positive effect, mainly as
follows:
(1).  The Projects belong to communications basic facility ones,
which will serve the local economic development and possess outstanding
social benefit
(2).  The Projects will greatly change the passive situation of
unsmooth communication due to narrow channels and too long lock waiting
time. The waterway dredge and widening will improve the existing waterway
water pollution situation; the ship lock expansion will shorten the lock waiting
time and reduce the pollutant accumulation pollution at the lock area due to
the ships waiting for lock; the improvement of water body exchange
conditions are good for the dilution and decomposition of the pollutants.
(3).  Local vegetation damage and soil erosion due to waterway
widening and lock room and channel approach dredge will be resumed and
improved by slope protection, revetment and greening and etc..
(4).  The project construction will not have impacts on the historic
spots and scenes within the project area, the waterway realignment will not
be involved in precious and rare animals in imminent danger.
2.1.2 The Project' s disadvantageous impacts on the environment belong to
short term action during the whole construction period, which will disappear
naturally along the completion of the construction. The main impacts are as
follows:
- Impacts on social environment due to the land requisition, house remove
and land covered with abandoned soil;
* Impacts on atmospheric environment due to the dust caused during
construction and abandoned soil transshipment;
* Impacts on water environment due to construction waters SS increase by
the waterway widening and lock room dredge;
* Impacts on the existing communications order during the construction time
period.
2.1.3 Indirect impacts
During the operation period of the Project, the indirect impacts are ship
flow increase, ship pollutants discharge, noise interference and possible
emergency bulk liquid chemicals overflow pollution.
7



2.2 MAIN ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION OBJECTIVES
In accordance with the analysis of impact on environment by the
-Projects , the main ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION OBJECTIVES are
decided.
2.2.1 MAIN ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION OBJECTIVES DURING
CONSTRUCTION
1).   Water environment
Suspended solids caused by underwater dredge, discharge of
construction ship OIL-CONTAINED waste water and constructors' living
waste water.
2).   Atmospheric  environment
Dust caused by earth volume operation and abandoned earth
transport.
3).   Noise
Construction machinery noise
4).   Ecological environment
Farmland covered, land vegetation damage and local soil erosion.
5).  Social environment
House remove and resettlement due to land requisition , short term
impact on normal communication order during construction
2.2.2 MAIN ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION OBJECTIVES DURING
OPERATION
1)   Water environment
OIL-CONTAINED waste water and living waste water discharged from
ships
2).   Noise
Communication noise produced by ships at channel and passing locks
The main environment protection objectives during operation are
8



caused mainly by ships at channels and passing locks and are not caused by
the Project proper.
9



3.   ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND
MITIGATION MEASURES
In order to prevent and treat and lessen the impacts on environment by
the Projects, the environment protection management objectives are decided
for different stages of design, construction and operation of the Projects and
corresponding MITIGATION and impact retardation measures are decided
according to the EIAR of the Projects.
3.1   DESIGN STAGE
3.1.1 The Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment Project
1).  For the channel centerline direction, the existing channel will be
used as many as possible in order to reduce engineering load and to save
land resource.
2).  For the channel required to be widened, the principle is to widen
one side and incline centerline to one side to reduce house remove.
3).  Compared with bank protection and house remove load of both
banks, the bank with less engineering load and less house remove will be
widened.
4).  The channel rerouting principles are less engineering load,
shorter line, less house remove and less land requisition and as far away form
residents' area as possible.
5).   New bank slope shall be reveted to stabilize the bank slope and
to protect farmland and to avoid soil erosion
6).  For the bridges to be revamped along the Projects, they shall
be built according to the Channel Standard, the principle of one bridge
removal and one bridge construction is applied to avoid the impacts on
communications of both banks
7).  The earth volume produced during channel revamping, widening
and dredge shall be piled in waste land for creating farmland and farmland
shall be avoided being buried as much as possible.
3.1.2 THE EXPANSION PROJECT OF SHIP LOCKS AT THE BEIJING-
HANGZHOU GRAND CANAL and the YANGUAN SHIP LOCK PROJECT
OF THE YAN RIVER CONNECTING WITH SEA
1).  The lock location shall be arranged in relatively pivot centralized
area, the new lock location shall be as close to the existing one as possible
for the convenience of smooth ship entrance and exit and lock management.
10



2).  The lock location shall be at the place with good landform
condition and less house remove and less land requisition and as far away
form residents' area as possible.
3).  Channel approaches shall be arranged in a straight line as
possible as we can in order to ensure safe and smooth exit of ships.
4).  Both banks of channel approaches shall be reveted to stabilize
the bank slope  and to avoid soil erosion.
5).  Part of the earth volume by lock digging and dredge will be used
as raw material of brick and tile factory, the other will be used to bury
riverside and waste land for farmland creation and less farmland buried. The
optimized scheme of the abandoned earth area shall be decided during
design period.
3.2 CONSTRUCTION STAGE
3.2.1 CONSTRUCTION PROCESS
3.2.1.1   The Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment Project
Construction lofting shall be carried out after land requisition, house
remove and land leveling.

3.2.2 Environment protection management objectives and MITIGATION
measures
3.2.2.1    The Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment Project
(1).  Construction noise MITIGATION
Construction machinery noise and transport vehicle communication
noise will produce a certain pollution impact, especially the pollution at night is
more serious, measures of requiring contractor to reasonably arrange
construction time and to limit continuous operation of high noise machinery
and to avoid high noise machinery operation at night can be taken to reduce
construction noise impacts.
Operation limit figures of normal machinery is shown in Table 3.2.

in a scope of area, 120m away
from protection objectives
(2).   Earthwork impact on land resource
Part of the earthwork produced during channel revamping, widening
and dredge shall be backfilled at wall rear or for reinforcing dam, the other will
be piled in waste land for creating farmland and farmland shall be avoided
being buried as much as possible. Earthwork piled in rented land will have a
certain disadvantageous impact on land resource, contractors are required to
cover fermented soil on the surface of covered farmland or abandoned earth
piled in waste land is refarmed to reduce the Projects' impacts on land
resource.
Land resource loss by the Projects can be reimbursed to a certain
extent by planned land creation. A certain economic compensation shall be
given according to related regulations of the state and local govemmental
authorities for the land lent for construction . Before contractors return the
land lent for construction, contractors shall clean up the construction residues,
the land can be resumed to the original situation after refarming.
(3).  Abandoned earth area selection and prevention measures
Low-lying land and waste pond shall be selected as abandoned earth
area. Before filling of the underwater earthwork abandoned earth at the
abandoned earth area, a dike shall be built to avoid the filled mud
overflowing , grass and bush shall be planted or earthwork cloth shaH be laid
at outside the dike.
13



In order to avoid secondary pollution by the abandoned soil of
waterway dredge and excavation , an exudate leaching test has been made
for bottom mud sample of each monitoring section of the waterways to be
realigned, only one section Weiting in the Suliu line exceeds total Cu standard
figure, all the other monitoring factors do not exceed the standard. So, as for
the bottom mud of the Weiting section with Cu exceeding the standard in the
leaching test, low-lying land shall be selected with good geological and water
isolation conditions as abandoned earth area, a 40 cm thick clay layer is
rammed as cushion layer and clay is used to make dikes around and 30-50
cm thick fermented soil shall be covered on the surface. The abandoned
earth throwing area shall be over 50m away from the fish pond.
The abandoned earth area water discharge of the underwater earth
volume of the river sections with water intakes of water works shall be over
1 000m away from the water intakes .
(4).  Underwater earthwork dredge protection principles
Contractors are required to take the following measures:
Underwater earth shall be dredged section by section to reduce
suspended solid pollution. With 1 50-200m as a construction section,
compared with construction without sections, the accumulated SS pollution
can be reduced by 30--40%.
Water works intakes river section shall be dredged with cutter sucking
dredgers, grab dredgers shall be used as less as possible, chain bucket
dredgers are not permitted.
The water intakes of the water works in the three waterways to be
realigned are distributed at sub-branches of river approach sections of
waterways, 1 50-350m away from one side of waterway.
Water works intakes river section shall be constructed according to the
following sequence:
Firstly, construction at the place of 50 - 1 00m away from downstream
of sub-branch mouth of river approach section, after the downstream section
is enlarged, then the construction at the place of 200m away from upstream
of sub-branch mouth of river approach section; a dike of water intake shall be
maintained to avoiding impact on water quality during construction; the dike
shall be reremoved at night when it is the low water consumption period and a
temporary anti-pollution curtain at the place of 30m from the inner side of river
approach section shall be set to avoid the suspended particles into the river
approach section to ensure water supply quality of the works.
(5).  Construction dust MITIGATION
14



Dust pollution will be caused by site earthwork construction and the
transport of construction materials and abandoned earth, contractors shall
take measures to spray water for restriction of dust and to control construction
vehicle speed and etc. to effectively control dust pollution.
(6). Disposal of effluents at construction site
The construction site is normally arranged along the channel banks.
Before constructors enter the site, the contractor shall set garbage drum and
temporary water closet in order to effectively treat the living garbage and
waste water produced during construction .
(7). Maintenance of normal communication order during construction
During construction, the river widening, dredge, revetment, bridge
revamping and construction material transport and etc. will have a certain
impact on the land communication and water transportation. Contractor is
required to issue navigation and transport notices during channel construction,
and to reasonably arrange construction time section by section time by time,
and to avoid communication flow peak for the construction material transport
and to build construction passages in order to minimize interference on the
normal communication order due to construction.
3.2.2.2    THE EXPANSION  PROJECT OF SHIP LOCKS AT THE
BEIJING-HANGZHOU GRAND CANAL and the YANGUAN SHIP LOCK
PROJECT OF THE YAN RIVER CONNECTING WITH SEA
The construction scope is only one point or surface, but the
construction scope of the Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment
Project is a section or line, so the EXPANSION PROJECT OF SHIP LOCKS
AT THE BEIJING-HANGZHOU GRAND CANAL and the YANGUAN SHIP
LOCK PROJECT OF THE YAN RIVER CONNECTING WITH SEA shall have
a relatively much smaller impact scope of environment. The main
environment protection and management objectives are construction
abandoned earth dust' s and construction machinery noise' s impact on
environment. The pollution MITIGATION measures during construction are
basically the same with those of the Sunan Backbone Waterway Network
Realignment Project.
3.3 OPERATION STAGE
The pollution during operation will come mainly from ship at channel
and passing locks . The Plan has given out the following ship polluting
environment management objectives and MITIGATION measures according
to the ship pollution features, which shall be followed by ship owners, the port
15



navigation supervision departments along the channel are the supervision
and management authorities for the supervision and management of running
safety and pollutant discharge control of running ships and environment
protection propaganda and education of crew and etc., the Projects owner, i.e.
the Jiangsu Channel Bureau and the channel and lock management
department under its leadership will reserve the right to accuse and to limit
the action of the ship owner causing environment pollution.
(1). Ship pollutants control
Main ship pollutants are ship cabin oil-contained waste water, ship
living waste water and living garbage.
Ship cabin oil-contained waste water is caused due to the oil drops
under the conditions of cooling flushing or incomplete maintenance system
during ship machinery running. For the motor boats still running shall be
equipped with an oil drop dish. It is to strictly manage and supervise tugs and
barges in the waterways and passing through the ship locks. The cabin
bottom oil-contained waste water shall be treated with oil/water separator to
less than 15 mg/I, then discharged. For the ships without waste water
treatment ability, their cabin bottom oil-contained waste water shall be
collected by themselves and treated by the port where the ships arrive .
The living garbage of ships  shall be packed in plastic bags and
collected by arriving port or ship lock for sending to the city garbage
incinerator.
Situation of present ports which can be used to receive ship oil-
contained waste water and solid wastes is shown in Table 3.3.

(2). Ship noise control
After channel is widened, noise pollution will be more serious due to
the increase of ship flow; ship lock expansion and building will create new
noise pollution areas. Following the enlargement of ships, motor boats will be
gradually eliminated, the noise pollution degree will be lessened year by year.
For motor boats, related regulations shall be strictly followed to erect
qualified vent silencer in order to reach a noise less than 97dB(A) of the
whole machine; Greening of trees and grass planting shall be done at both
banks of channels and ship locks to reduce noise pollution via plants'
reflection on sound wave; A low speed symbol shall be set at the channel
section with centralized residents' area to reduce impacts on residents.
3.4  EMERGENCY RISK MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY    PLAN
3.4.1 EMERGENCY RISK MITIGATION MEASURES
When the ships to transport fertilizers, pesticides and petrochemicals
and etc. collide, or are misloaded and misunloaded or have other accidents,
17



the leaked pollutants will seriously pollute the channel Jater body. The
management must be enhanced on the ships with dangerous goods, the
ships passing through locks and in channels shall strictly execute INLAND
RIVER COMMUNICATION SAFETY MANAGEMENT RULES OF THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA and SHIP LOADING DANGEROUS
GOODS SUPERVISION AND MANAGEMENT RULES of the MINISTRY OF
COMMUNICATIONS in order to avoid risk emergency.
The Document No. 5 of the Ministry of Communication of China
specifies" SHIPS WITH HAZARDOUS GOODS SHALL POSSESS SAFETY
AND PROTECTION MEASURES AND SET OBVIOUS'MARKS ACCORDING
TO SPECIFICATIONS". The Jiangsu Ship Lock Management Implementation
Regulations specifies "SHIPS WITH HAZARDOUS GOODS SHALL BE
MOORED AT A SPECIFIED PLACE BY THE LOCK AND SHALL PASS
THROUGH THE LOCK SEPARATELY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE; IF
THESES CAN NOT BE MET, IT SHALL BE ISOLATED WITH OTHER SHIPS
WITH A NECESSARY DISTANCE WHEN MOORED IN LOCK ROOM,
PREVENTION MEASURES SHALL BE ENHANCED TO ENSURE LOCK
PASSAGE SAFETY" and " BESIDES MEETING THE LOAD SAFETY
REQUIREMENT, SHIPS WITH HAZARDOUS GOODS SHALL POSSESS
THE TRANSPORT CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY THE PUBLIC SAFETY
DEPARTMENT OR THE HAZARDOUS GOODS TRANSPORT
CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY THE PORT SUPERVISION DEPARTMENT.
Ships shall satisfy the above-mentioned conditions and then pass the lock.
A special hazardous goods ships mooring zone shall be set in the lock
waiting area and an obvious mark shall be set to avoid other ships entering
the special hazardous goods ships mooring zone or staying in the special
hazardous goods ships mooring zone.
SUPERVISION AND MANAGEMENT WORK SKETCH OF SHIPS
LOADING WITH DANGEROUS GOODS is shown in Drawing No. 3.4-1.
Accident'prevention measures of the above-mentioned ships running
and passing through locks have been strictly followed in the running and
transport of the Jiangsu channel system for many years, hazardous goods
ship transport accidents are basically avoided, till now, there is no record of
such accident.
According to the Document No. (1995) 81 of the Ministry of
Communications   of   China   "   NOTICE   ON   PREPARATION

4.   ENVIRONMENT        PROTECTION        MONITORING        AND
IMPLEMENTATION        PLAN
4.1 MONITORING GOALS
The  Projects will result in pollution impacts on the surrounding
environment during construction and operation, it is to execute the
ENVIRONMENT MONITORING PLAN DURING CONSTRUCTION AND
OPERATION and to assess the impact degrees of the environment protection
objectives by the Projects and to confirm whether the impacts on the
surrounding environment by the Projects meet the function environment
quality grades specified by the local govemment and to judge the
effectiveness of the environment protection measures and to add, reduce or
change the measures.
4.1.1 Monitoring objectives during construction
(1).  Noise
During construction, noise pollution will happen, after the above-
mentioned measures are taken, it basically conform with the NOISE LIMITS
OF CONSTRUCTION SITE BATTERY LIMITS (GB12523-90) , which are
shown in Table 4.1-1
(2).  Construction dust
During earthwork construction in dry season, dust pollution will happen
with main pollution areas of the construction area and abandoned earth area.
Water spraying measure is taken  to solve the problem to make the
construction dust impacts on the sensitive objectives basically consistent with
Grade 2 of the ENVIRONMENT AIR QUALITY STANDARD (GB3905-1996),
which are shown in Table 4.1-2.
(3).  Water quality protection
The underwater earthwork dredge of the Sunan Waterway Network
Realignment Project will have impacts on the water quality of the drinking
water intakes along the Project, contractor is required to strictly take the
above-mentioned measures to ensure the water quality near the intakes to
reach Grade m of the  GROUND WATER ENVIRONMENT QUALITY
STANDARD ( GB3838-88), which are shown in Table 4.1-5.
4.1.2 Monitoring objectives during operation
(1).  Ship noise
The main noise during operation is the motor boat noise. So the
21



emphasis of the noise pollution MITIGATION is to control the motor boat
noise. Following the gradual elimination of the motor boat and the above-
mentioned measures taken, the ship noise impacts on the both sides of
channels and ship locks shall be consistent with Category 4 of the CITY
AREA ENVIRONMENT NOISE STANDARD ( GB3096-93 ), which are shown
in Table 4.1-3., the impacts on environment protection objectives shall be
consistent with or close to the Category 2.
