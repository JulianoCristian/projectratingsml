2.0 GENERAL SITUATION OF THE PROJECT
2.1 PROJECT PURPOSE
According to the plan of the national water transport backbone waterways and
Jiangsu inland river backbone waterways network, the World Bank' s loan has been
planned to be utilized for THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT focuses on solving the
problems: dredging the busy waterways of good benefit, and the "bottleneck" problem of
the ship locks on the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which have no enough capacity to
let the ships pass without delay. The construction of THE PROJECT can promote the
development of local economy, improve the modemization level of Jiangsu waterways
dredging construction and management, and foster a waterways construction and
management team of high quality.
2.2 PROJECT COMPOSITION
The location of THE PROJECT is shown in THE LOCATION DRAWING OF THE
PROJECT.
(1) THE SUNAN BACKBONE WATERWAYS NETWORK REGULATION
PROJECT (shortened as the Waterways Project, SUNAN means the south of Jiangsu
Province) : this sub-project includes dredging three waterways: the Shen--Zhang Line, the
Xi--Bei Line and the Su--Liu Line. During operation of the sub-project, the three
waterways, together with the Sunan section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, the
Yangtse River, and the Su-Shen Line, will form the backbone waterways network, which
are navigable for the ships of over 300t, in the east area of Sunan. Thus the efficiency of
water transport will be promoted to fit in with the needs of Sunan economic speedy
development.
The Shen--Zhang Line (i.e. Shanghai-Zhangjiagang waterway): starts from the joint
with the Neigang Line of the Su--Shen Line in Kunshan City, Jiangsu Province in the
south and meets the Yangtse River in Zhangjiagang City in the north, with a total length
of 114.694 km.
The Xi--Bei Line (i.e. Wuxi--Beiguo, Jiangyin City waterway): starts from the joint
with the Xi-Cheng Canal in Wuxi Citv in the south and meets the Shen--Zhang Line in
Jiangyin City in the north, with a total length of 36,537 km.
The Su--Liu Line (i.e. Kunshan section of the Suzhou-Liuhe,Taicang waterway,):
from Suzhou to Kunshan. connects the Shen-Zhang Line and the Neigang Line of the
Su--Shen Line, with  a total length of 21.8 km.
(2) THE EXTENSION PROJECT OF SHIP LOCKS ON THE BEIJING--Hangzhou
GRAND CANAL (shortened as the Extension Project, the same below): this sub-project
is to expand the "bottlenecks" at the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. The purpose of the
sub-project is to fit in with the needs of developing inland provincial resources. It will



also meet the needs on energy of the Yangtse River Delta' s economic development.
The five ship locks , at which the ships have to wait for a long time before passing,
will be extended, it will ensure the main waterway at the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal
unlocked.
The construction of the Subei (i.e. the north of Jiangsu Province) section of the
Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal will be able to make four ship locks be navigable for the
ships of 2,000t: they are Xietai NO. 2 ship lock, Suqian NO. 3 ship lock, Huaiyin NO. 3
ship lock and Huai' an NO. 3 ship lock.
The construction of the Sunan section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal will be
able to make a ship lock be navigable for the ships of I ,000t: it is Jianbi NO. 2 ship lock.
(3) THE YANGUAN SHIP LOCK AT THE YANHE RIVER CONNECTING
WITH SEA (shortened as the Yanguan Ship Lock Project, the same below): this sub-
project is located in Guannan County, which is the poorest county in Jiangsu Province.
Yanguan ship lock will connect the YANHE RIVER and the GUANHE RIVER. The
construction of the sub-project will be able to provide a convenient waterway to the sea
for the resource development and transport of the inaccessible and undeveloped Huai
River basin. After being built, Yanguan ship lock will be navigable for the ships of 500t.
(4) Purchase Of Equipment: The modem equipment for the construction of the
waterways and ship locks will be purchased through open biddingding, it will improve
the modernization level of maintanance, construction and management.
(5) Personnel Training: In order to meet the needs of the market economic
development of China, and study the same trade and occupation' s successful experiences
in management and finance etc., personnel training will be done to build a waterways
construction and management team of high quality.
2.3  CONSTRUCTION SCALE AND STANDARD OF THE PROJECT
The construction scale and standard of THE PROJECT is determined according to
"INLAND RIVER NAVIGABLE STANDARD" of the People' s Republic of China and
the developing trend of the volume of goods transported on the waterways or through the
ship locks. The construction scale and standard of THE PROJECT are shown in Table
2.3.

4.2 CURRENT SITUATION OF WATER ENVIRONMENT QUALITY
4.2.1 Sunan waterways
The water environment qualities of the Shen--Zhang Line, Xi--Bei Line and Su-Liu
Line are basically meet the ASSESSMENT standard.
The main monitoring indexes of the eight protected water sources basically meet
Class III of THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY STANDARD OF GROUND WATER.
4.2.2 Current situation of water pollution in the areas where the ship locks are located.
The main pollutants to affect the water environment in these areas are oils and
BOD5. The average values of most monitored points exceed Class III standard, and part
of them exceed Class IV standard.
The main sources of the oils and BOD5 are the sewage with oils and resident swage
discharged b)y the ships and boats passing through the ship locks.
4.2.3 The river sections of the Ship Lock Projects (short for the Extension Project and the
Yanguan Ship Lock Project, the same below)
The main pollution is oils and organic matters. The water quality situation of each
section is as follows:
Xietai NO. 2 ship lock section: lower than Class III standard

4.3 CURRENT SITUATION OF ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT
4.3.1 The day time noise value on Sunan waterways is between 45 - 71 dB(A), the night
noise value is between 38 - 52 dB(A). The standard-exceeded points are mostly on the
sides of main highways and railways. The main noise sources are the traffic noise from
highways, railways and waterways.
4.3.2 The Ship Lock Project
According to the monitored data, both day and night noise values of the points 0 m
away from Huaiyin NO. 3 ship lock chamber and Jianbi NO. 2 ship lock chamber exceed
Class IV standard, it is resulted from the ships and boats passing through the ship locks;
the day noise values of the points 20 m away from the ship locks both meet Class IV
standard, and the night noise values both exceed the Class IV standard.
Analyzed according to the above data,. the day noise values of the areas 20 m away
from the ship locks meet Class IV standard, the night noise values exceed Class IV
standard, but both of them haven' t exceeded the limit value--90 dB(A) at operation spots
of GBJ87--85.
The day and night noise values of the Yanguan Ship lock area and the waterway
banks meet Class IV standard.
4.4 CURREN'T SITUATION OF ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY
4.4.1 Current Situation of Terrestrial Ecology
4.4.1.1 Sunan Waterways
(1) Current situation of terrestrial vegetation
There are plants of 1,447 species of 180 families along the banks of the three
waterways, they are mainly pteridophyte, gymnosperm, dicotyledon and monocotyledon.
No precious and ancient tree was founded by investigation.
Along the waterways, the main agricultural crops are rice, wheat, soy bean, sweat
potato, com, etc., the main industrial crops are cotton, rape, peanut, as well as vegetable
and melon and fruit.
(2) Current situation of terrestrial animals
15



Along the three waterways there are various kinds of animals of 206 species of 12
class of 4 phylum, namely annelid phylum, mollusk phylum, arthropod phylum and
chordate phylum.
(3) Current situation of soil
The content of the factors: pH, Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr, Hg and As of the soil on both
sides of the three waterways and Zhangjiagang ship lock were monitored, and the
monitored results were evaluated by Grade II of "SOIL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY
STANDARD"(GB15618-1995). The above mentioned factors of these areas meet Grade
II standard.
4.4.1.2 The Ship Locks Project
(1) Current situation of terrestrial ecology
The main tree species are Chinese white poplar, red leaves plum, cedar, metasequoia,
Chinese little leaf box, cypress etc. in the ship lock areas (short for the areas where the
ship locks to be extended or built are located, the same below). In the areas of present
ship locks, greening area is 80% - 85% of the total area.
(2) Current situation of soil
The content of the factors: pH, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni, As and Hg of the soil of the ship
locks areas were monitored, and the monitored results were evaluated by Grade II of
"SOIL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY STANDARD"(GB 15618 - 1995). The above
mentioned factors of these areas meet the ASSESSMENT standard.
4.4.2 Current Situation of Waters Ecology
4.4.2.1 Aquatic animals and Plants
(I) In the Shen--Zhang Line, Xi--Bei Line and Su--Liu Line, there are altogether 107
species of fish, they belong to 23 families of 13 orders, among them 61 species are carps,
making up 57.01%.
In the Tai Lake, where the Shen--Zhang Line, the Xi--Bei Line and the Su--Liu Line
meet each other, there is no rare aquatic animals and plants.
(2) In the waterways of Xietai NO. 2 ship lock, Suqian NO. 3 ship lock and Jianbi
NO. 2 ship lock. there are fewer kinds of fish, they are mainly grass carp, round head carp,
variegated carp, silver carp, carp, crucian carp , etc..
(3) In the waterways of Huaiyin NO. 3 ship lock, Huai' an ship lock and the Yanguan
ship lock, there are more kinds of fish, they are mainly eel , grass carp, round head carp,
variegated carp, carp, crucian carp, loach. catfish, black carp. etc.
The waterways involved in THE PROJECT are mainly for water transport. irrigation
and flood prevention, but not for fish habitat. The fish culture and fishing mostly gather
in the lakes. The construction of THE PROJECT will not affect the aquatic animals and
plants in the lakes.
16



4.4.2.2 Bottom mud
On the three waterways and at the Zhangjiagang ship lock 14 bottom mud
monitoring sections were set up. The monitored results of the factors: Hg, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd,
Oils, DDT and Ati*  indicate that the content of the factors basically meet Grade II
of "SOIL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY STANDARD.
In order to avoid a second time pollution from the abandoned earth of the
construction, a leaching experiment has been done to the effusion of the collected bottom
mud above mentioned. only the total Cu at one or two sections at Weiting section of the
Su--Liu Line exceeds the standard, all other factors of each section don't exceed the
standard. It has been suggested that the abandoned soil from Weiting section of the Su--
Liu Line should not be recultivated.
The monitored factors at Subei section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and
Jianbi section of the Sunan Canal basically meet Grade II of "SOIL ENVIRONMENT
QUALITY STANDARD. As the Extension Project is to newly excavate the waterways,
there is no bottom mud in this sub-project and its abandoned earth will not pollute the
environment.

5.0 ENVIRONMENT IMPACT OF THE PROJECT AND
POLLUTION PREVENTION AND MITIGATION MEASURES
5.1 ENVIRONMENT IMPACT TYPES
5.1.1 The Construction of THE PROJECT will benefit the environment.
(I) THE PROJECT, a traffic infrastructure construction project, will serve local
economic development and bring obvious social benefits.
(2) THE PROJECT will greatly change the passive situation that the waterways are
too narrow to be unlocked and the ships and boats have to wait for a long time to pass.
After the waterways being regulated, the present water pollution situation will be
improved; After the ship locks being extended, the ships and boats will wait for a shorter
time to pass through the ship locks, it will reduce the pollutants discharged by the waiting
ships and boats; The improvement of the water exchange condition will benefit the
degradation of the pollutants.
(3) The construction of THE PROJECT will partly damage the vegetation around and
result in soil erosion, but they will be improved and recover by slop protection, revetment
and greening etc.
(4) The construction of THE PROJECT will not affect any historical and cultural
human landscapes. The aquatic animals and plants environment will not change.
5.1.2 During construction. THE PROJECT will affect the environment, but only for a
short time. as the pollution will disappear during operation is finished.
(1) The land requisition. removal and land occupation will affect social environment.
(2) Dust during construction will affect the atmospheric environment.
(3) The widening of the waterways and the extension of the ship locks will increase
SS and affect the water environment.
(4) The present traffic order will be affected during construction.
5.1.3 Indirect Impact
The indirect impacts include: the increasing of the ships flow, the pollutants
discharged by the ships, noise pollution, bulk liquid chemical products, ships risk
accidents pollution.
5.2 SOCIAL IMPACT
5.2.1 Impact on Agriculture
The construction of THE PROJECT will occupy land resources.
The land borrowed by THE PROJECT is mainly for piling up earth and construction
I8



spots. ror me temporaniy Dorrowea rarmianas, meir rernuly wiu uecr=sc a JiLUc UjL,
because their used way has changed. Usually, it takes several years to recover them. For
the temporarily borrowed bottom-lands, low-lying lands and unused ponds etc., the
abandoned earth piled on them will become new land resources. For the temporarily
borrowed land for piling up the abandoned earth, in order not to destroy the farmland, the
contractors are required to cover mellow soil on the land during operation and to adopt
protection measures on the recultivation of the abandoned earth piled on the wasteland.
By this way, the impact on the land resources will be reduced. Before returning the
temporarily borrowed farmland, the contractors must clear up the construction remains on
the land. After being recultivated, the farmland will be able to recover to the same as
before.
The land resources loss caused by the land requisition will be partly made up by
bringing barren lands under cultivation. For the borrowed land, certain economic
compensation will be given according to the relevant rules of State and local
govermnents.
5.2.2 Impact on Fishery
EIAR points out that the Ship Locks Project will hardly affect fishery. For the
Waterways Project, only in the Bacheng Lake and Kuncheng Lake where the Shen-Zhang
Line passes by, there are a little purse net fishery, but they are not within the waterway.
The construction of this waterway is suggested to try its best to avoid the fish growth
active period. In order to avoid affecting fishery, the construction should be done in
winter.
5.2.3 Land Requisition and Removal
The principle of the land requisition and removal of THE PROJECT is to occupy
farmland as little as possible and remove houses as few as possible. Under this
circumstance the design schemes should be compared scientifically, the land should be
utilized reasonably, the right rights and interests of the affected people by the land
requisition and removal should be safeguarded according to relevant laws. They should
get appropriate arrangement. Those will keep the construction of THE PROJECT
stepping forward smoothly, and local economy of the areas along the waterways and
around the ship locks will develop more quickly, in the mean time the water transport
will be improved. it will increase local people' s living level.
The land requisition and removal will altogether involve 10 cities and counties, 41
towns, among them 7 cities and counties and 35 towns involved in the Waterways Project,
3 cities and counties and 6 towns involved in the Ship Locks Project.
THE PROJECT altogether requisitions 559.81 ha. of land, among them 427.3 ha. for
the Waterways Project and 132.5 ha. for the Ship Locks Project.
THE PROJECT temporarily borrows 892.2 ha. of land, among them 577.5 ha. for the
Waterways Project and 314.6 ha. for the Ship Locks Project. Generally the land will be
borrowed for two years.
THE PROJECT removes 738,015.74 m2 of houses, among them 633,060 m2 for the
Waterways Project and 104,955.72 m2 for the Ship Lock Project.
19



The land requisition and removal involves 216 households of residence and 519 units,
among them  1,590 households of residence and 459 units involved in the Waterways
Project, 571 households of residence and 60 units in the Ship Locks Project.
The basic data of the land requisition and removal are shown in Table 5.2-1 -  5.2-3.

The construction of the Yanguan Ship Lock Project will perfect the area' s water
transport network, be good for promoting the development of water transport on the
YANHE RJVER and the GUANHE RIVER. It will also change the current situation of
goods transport of the cities and counties along, quicken the area' s goods and materials
turnover and promote the area' s economic development.
5.3 IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENT DURING CONSTRUCTION AND
POLLUTION PREVENTION AND MITIGATIONMEASURES
5.3 .1 Noise Impact
During construction the construction machines and vehicles will cause noise
pollution, and the pollution is more serious at night. EIAR suggests that the contractors
should reasonably arrange construction time, limit the machines of high noise to work
continuously, and avoid that the machines of high noise work at night etc. as to reduce
construction noise impact.
The common indexes to limit construction machines are shown in Table 5.3

5.3.2 Impact on Water Quality
Underwater dredging -will cause impact on water quality of the construction waters.
EIAR points out: In the course of underwater dredging, the waters will be disturbed, the
concentration of SS and turbiddingity degree will obviously increase, and those will
cause disadvantageous impact on the water quality, aquatic animals and plants, the
drinking water sources and industrial water of the cities and towns along. There are
drinking water intakes in the branches of the waterways. In order to reduce the impact on
the drinking water sources, the construction of each sections should adopt the following
measures: 1) First construct the section 50 - 100 m away downstream the branch
entrance, and then construct the section 50 m away upstream the branch entrance after the
downstream section has been broadened; 2) Keep the dike of the branch of drinking water
intakes to ensure that the construction will not affect the water quality of the drinking
water intakes; 3) Quickly demolish the dam at night when it is not water-using peak;
while demolishing the dam, build a temporary anti-pollution curtain inside the branch at
30 m away from the branch entrance. By this way, the water quality of the drinking water
intakes can be ensured.
5.3.3 Impact on Atmospheric Enviromnent
EIAR points out the main pollution on atmospheric environment is dust during
construction.
At the construction spots the process of excavation and filling and transport vehicles
will produce dust pollution. In order to effectively reduce dust pollution, the contractors
should adopt such measures as spraying water and controlling the speed of the vehicles
etc.
5.3.4 Impact by Abandoned Earth
The abandoned bottom mud produced by underwater excavation will affect its
surrounding environment. EIAR suggests that the bottom mud should be covered up at
proper places such as beheaded river, low-lying land etc. Before the chosen places are
filled with the bottom mud. an earth dike should be set up first to prevent the bottom mud
overflowing. Outside the earth dike grasses and bushes should be planted.
For Weiting cross section, because the content of Cu contained in the bottom mud
exceeds the standard, a depression of good geological and water proof conditions should
be chosen for filling the bottom mud there. The bottom mud should be first covered with
a layer of clay which is 40 cm thick and pounded, and then covered with mellow soil
which is 30 - 50 cm thick. The depression should be over 40 m away from fish ponds.
5.4 ENVIRONMENT IMPACT DURING OPERATION AND POLLUTION
PREVENTION AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Wlhen the regulated waterways and extended ship locks being used, the pollution
mainly comes from the communications noise and cabin oil sewage by the ships and
boats running on the waterways and passing ship locks.
27



5.4.1 Communications Noise
According to EIAR, current noise value of the areas along the waterways and ship
locks is standard-exceeded. When the regulated waterways and extended ship locks being
used, because the number of the ships on the waterways has increased, the noise pollution
by the ships will also increase. But with the gradual and natural elimination of the paddle
power boats-the main noise sources and with the fleet becoming larger and larger, the
noise pollution will gradually decrease and be up to the ASSESSMENT standard at last.
In order to reduce noise pollution, EIAR puts forward some practical and effective
measures: set up an greening zone on each bank of the waterways and ship locks, set up a
sign to ask the ships and boats to run at lower speed at the river section with crowd
residence on both banks, ask the paddle power boats must install qualified exhaust gas
silencer.
5.4.2 Cabin Oil Sewage
EIAR points out: the waters of the waterways and ship locks have been polluted in
some degree by the industrial and resident sewage from cities and towns, but the water
quality is basically meet the ASSESSMENT standard. During operation of THE
PROJECT. the water discharge of the waterways will increase, the time for the ships and
boats passing through the ship locks will be shorter, the ships will become larger,
therefore, the oil sewage and resident sewage discharged by the ships will just do a little
pollution on the water quality, less than present pollution. The pollution will gradually
decrease year by year.
Because the waters have been polluted now, the water quality will deteriorate if the
pollutants discharged by the ships and boat aren' t be effectively controlled. THE
ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT puts forward some measures: before
discharged. the cabin oil sewage must be treated to fit in.with the standard or collected
and sent to the harbor for treatment. EIAR also suggests the relevant management
departments must enhance supervision and management to ensure the above mentioned
measures to be actuallv carried out.
The situations of the harbors which are able to accept cabin oil sewage and solid
wastes are shown in Table 5.4.

6.2 ENVIRONMENT MONITORING
6.2.1 The environment monitoring includes the routine monitoring made by each
involved local environment monitoring station and the periodical environment
monitoring specially for the construction of THE PROJECT.
6.2.2 The routine monitoring made by each involved local environment monitoring
station is the people' s governments' legal action. The different waters have different
function and their environment quality have different requirements. In the involved
Suzhou City, W'uxi city, Xuzhou city, Suqian City, Huaiyin city, Lianyungang city and
Zhenjiang city. there are routine monitoring cross sections and atmospheric monitoring
stations.
The local environment monitoring stations will complete their routine monitoring
according to the arrangements of the environment protection and management department
of the governments.
6.2.3 For the periodical environment monitoring specially for the construction of THE
PROJECT, the contractors will have them made by entrusting during the construction,
and the waterways management departments will have them made by entrusting during
operation. The environment protection plan of THE PROJECT offers two altemative
environment monitoring organization schemes. namelv, 1) The environment monitoring
institutions; or 2) The local environment monitoring stations of the province and cities
involved.
