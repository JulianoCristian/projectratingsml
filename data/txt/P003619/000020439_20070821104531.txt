F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the project was to provide more efficient and productive inland
waterway transport (IWT) services which would be more competitive than the current
services. This would be achieved through reduction of unit cost and transit time by (a)
upgrading inland waterways infrastructure to allow navigation of larger vessels, (b)
increasing shiplock capacity to reduce waiting time, and (c) increasing financial and
organizational capacity of IWT agencies.

  The key indicators for monitoring and evaluating performance were (a) reduction in
cost (per ton-km), (b) increase in average vessel size (dwt), (c) shiplock waiting time



                                              ii

(hours/vessel), and (d) financial ratios that included working ratio, self-financing ratio
and debt-service coverage ratio.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The development objective remained unchanged throughout the implementation of the
Project.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
China has some 5,800 rivers that are navigable for 110,200 km, 15 rivers over 1,000 km
long and 12 lakes with an area greater than 1,000 sq. m. The country has a long history of
utilizing its extensive waterway network with the excavation of the Grand Canal for
navigation first beginning around 480 BC. The country currently has five major Inland
Water Transport (IWT) systems, Yangtze River, Pearl River, Grand Canal, Heilong Jiang,
and Huaihe. The Yangtze is the largest system in length, depth and traffic.

Significant under-funding had caused the country's waterway infrastructures to
deteriorate, reducing the net size of the navigable network from 172,000 km in 1960 to
110,200 km in 1993. Under the 9th Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), China decided to
develop the Pearl River in Guangdong Province and the Grand Canal in Jiangsu Province,
the second and third largest IWT systems. Around 1997, China sought the Bank support
for this initiative which culminated in this Project, the Second Inland Waterways Project
(Loan 4328-CHA). These developments represented a continuation of the Bank's first
IWT project in China, the Inland Waterways Project (Loan 39106-CHA). Bank support
for the IWT developments was in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of
reducing infrastructure bottlenecks through modernization of the provinces' inland
waterways systems, as presented to the Board on March 18, 1997 and further discussed in
the Progress Report (CAS document number R98-107) of May 28, 1998. It also met the
government's objective of providing better access to the interior to facilitate the economic
development of the western regions.

IWT demand increased at an average of 7% annually for the period 1990-1994 with
major cargoes carried being coal, ores and construction materials. Inland water transport
is the least costly, least energy consuming and least hazardous mode of transportation.

Considerable progress on institutional reforms had been made in the IWW sector. IWW
management was decentralized from the central government to the provincial
governments. IWT services such as cargo handling, shipping, freight forwarding and
shipbuilding were commercialized. Waterway tariffs were partly liberalized. These
reforms started to create a more competitive environment for the sector. Although
provincial waterway bureaus were still a part of the provincial government, they were
generally financially autonomous and undergoing further reform such as the
commercialization of dredging operations and the implementation of more market-based
pricing and rationalization of user charges. Providing more efficient and productive
inland waterway transport (IWT) services which would be more competitive than the
current services was the rationale for the Bank's intervention under this Project. This
objective was to be achieved through the reduction of unit cost and transit time by (a)
upgrading inland waterways infrastructure to allow navigation of larger vessels, (b)
increasing shiplock capacity to reduce waiting time, and (c) increasing financial and
organizational capacity of IWT agencies.




                                              1

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
The objective of the Project was to increase the efficiency, productivity and
competitiveness of inland waterways transport in the provinces of Guangdong and
Jiangsu (the Project Provinces) through the upgrading of inland waterways infrastructure
and the institutional strengthening of the provincial inland waterway agencies. The key
indicators for monitoring and evaluating performance were (a) reduction in cost (per ton-
km), (b) increase in average vessel size (dwt), (c) shiplock waiting time (hours/vessel),
and (d) financial ratios that included working ratio, self-financing ratio and debt-service
coverage ratio.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The development objective remained unchanged throughout the implementation of the
Project. There was also no revision of the key indicators, however, the quantum of
reduction in transport cost and transit time mentioned as a measure of achievement of the
Project's development objective in the main text of the PAD was not quantified and
included Annex1A: Performance Indicators. (See also section 3.2).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
The main beneficiaries were the inland waterway operators, ship-owners and shippers
using the waterways, and the project provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu as well as the
inland provinces of Shandong, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Henan, Yunnan, and Guangxi. It was
estimated that about 57 million people in these provinces would directly benefit from the
Project (about 20% of the population of Guangdong and Jiangsu and 5%-10% of the
inland adjacent provinces). Benefits would derive mainly from (a) a reduction in
transport cost by using larger vessels, (b) a reduction of shiplock waiting time and (c) a
reduction in congestion in other modes.

Guangdong Provincial Waterway Bureau (GPWB) and Jiangsu Provincial Waterway
Bureau (JPWB) would also benefit directly from having their waterway infrastructures
upgraded and from the measures taken to strengthen institutional capacity at the two
bureaus.

1.5 Original Components
The Project had two parts.

Part A: Guangdong Province consisting of
    · the upgrading the Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen (Z-H) and Lianhuasahan-Shawan-
       Ronggui Waterways (L-S-R) (US$121.3 million),
    · enhancement of maintenance dredging capacity and operational management
       (US$17.7 million), and
    · technical assistance for institutional development, implementation support and
       training (US$2.4 million).




                                               2

Part B: Jiangsu Province consisting of the
    · construction of shiplocks at Xietai, Suqian, Huaiyin and Huaian on the North
        Grand Canal and Jianbi on the South Grand Canal (US$97.6 million),
    · provision of machinery/equipment for the five shiplocks (US$7.6 million), and
    · technical assistance and training to support and enhance project implementation
        and institutional development (US$1.7 million).

1.6 Revised Components
There were no changes in project components.

1.7 Other significant changes
Minor changes in the scale of technical assistance (TA) and training were made in the
course of implementing the Project. TA and training in both provinces were increased as
funds became available as cost savings arising from procurement were realized. Loan
funds were re-allocated to meet the increased expenditure in TA and training.

Institutional reforms initiated by the State not long after the loan became effective
affected the scope of the institutional development component of the Project in
Guangdong. The commercialization of GPWB's dredging operations in 1998 rendered
superfluous the study on the commercialization of its dredging department. A national
policy change in 2000 restricted the ability of provincial governments to raise revenue in
the IWW sector, rendering ineffectual the agreement reached with GPWB to prepare and
implement a plan for the collection of additional revenue, which included a channel
construction fee. As a result the study and the preparation of the plan were no longer
relevant. Financial ratios developed on the basis that GPWB and JPWB had the
flexibility to raise revenue also became meaningless and new financial ratios had to be
determined to assess the financial performance and management capacity of the
implementing agencies. (See section 2.3)

Loan savings were significant and the original loan amount of $123 million was reduced
thrice at the request of the Borrower. First, on June 11, 2003 an amount of $17 million
was cancelled from the loan to Jiangsu; second, on February 10, 2004 $20 million was
cancelled from the loan to Guangdong; and third, on March 27, 2005 an approximate
further $3.21 million of the loan to Jiangsu was cancelled upon the completion of the
Jiangsu component of the Project. At Project close there remained approximately $3.11
million undisbursed against the formally revised loan amount of $82.79 million for a total
disbursed amount of approximately $79.68 million.

While the Jiangsu part of the Project was completed and its part of the loan closed as
scheduled, Guangdong requested an extension in order to complete its component. The
loan closing date for the Guangdong part of the loan was extended from June 30, 2005 to
December 31, 2006. (See section 2. 2)

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Initial preparation of the Project by Guangdong and Jiangsu commenced in 1995 based
on feasibility studies undertaken by the waterway design institutes of the two provinces.
The Bank's preparation of the Project began in 1997, with an identification mission to
Jiangsu in April and to Guangdong in May. This was the Bank's second IWT project in
China. The first project was still ongoing and proceeding satisfactorily although TA
components such as institutional reforms were less well executed than the physical
aspects. Taking this into account, TA components in this Project were designed to be
more practical, modest, and realistic.

In light that Bank-wide experience in the sub-sector was limited, project preparation took
into consideration findings from OED's analysis of 35 projects in the port sub-sector, in
particular, (a) the under-estimation of the complexity of civil works and the period
required for construction and (b) lower than expected benefits due to over-optimistic
traffic forecasts. To mitigate the risk that similar problems would occur in the Project,
comprehensive investigations and engineering designs were undertaken. Major technical
concerns in the Guangdong component such as silting and changes of water level
following channel deepening/widening were studied using both physical and
mathematical models as well as pilot dredging at the channel entrance to verify the
applicability of the mathematical model. Unnecessary complication of engineering
works was avoided. Learning from past experience, the Bank task team took a
conservative approach in traffic forecasting, ensuring that they were compatible with
current expectations of national, regional and provincial economic development. As the
social impact of the Project was mainly related to land acquisition, extensive
consultations with stakeholders were undertaken in arriving at the design and
resettlement planning along the channel alignments to minimize impact.

Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and Environmental Action Plans (EAP) were
prepared in accordance with national procedures including Circular on Strengthening
Environmental Impact Assessment Management for Construction Projects Financed by
International Financial Organizations (June 1993, NEPA).

A contributor to the achievement of the project development objective depended on the
use of larger vessels on the waterways. An increase in the size of vessels was essential to
achieve greater productivity and the reduction of shipping cost. As the type and size of
vessels used on the waterways was market driven and outside the control of the
implementing entities, there was a risk that ship-owners might not respond positively (in
time and in fleet replacement) to the improvements. To mitigate the risk, a study to
promote the use of larger vessels was included in the technical assistance sub-component
of the Jiangsu part of the Project.

While the primary purpose of the Project was to improve waterway infrastructures,
sustainability of the Project necessitated improved waterway management, operation, and
capital investments. The Project aimed to strengthen the institutional capacity of



                                               4

implementing entities and implement user charges that would cover costs and provide for
investment funding while maintaining competitiveness with other transport modes.

Project preparation was efficient. The Project was identified in April/May 1997, pre-
appraised in October 1997, appraised in February 1998, and the loan of US 123 million
was approved in May 1998.

The Borrower displayed a strong commitment to the Project and had included it in the 9th
Five Year Plan. The Ministry of Communications (MOC) which was responsible for
coordination of the Project concretely supported it by organizing workshops to assist
Guangdong and Jiangsu in the preparation of the Project. The Project Provinces' sense of
ownership was evident by their expediency in preparing the Project and their
commitment of counterpart funds.

Quality at entry was rated satisfactory by QAG. (See also 5.1)

Project preparation, design, and quality at entry on the whole were satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation
Both the implementing entities, the Guangdong Provincial Waterway Bureau (GPWB)
and the Jiangsu Provincial Waterway Bureau (JPWB), displayed a strong sense of
ownership. Early in the project cycle, each implementing agency established a project
management office (PMO) adequately staffed with experienced engineers and various
other specialists to manage the implementation of the Project. As this was the first World
Bank financed IWW project for both provinces, prior to the commencement of project
implementation, project management staff from each of the PMOs were sent to other
provinces where the Bank's first financed inland waterway project was in progress to
familiarize them with the Bank's procedures. Preparation for project implementation
included English language training for PMO staff. As a result of the preparation, project
implementation on the whole proceeded well and effectively.

A combination of conservative engineer's cost estimates and a competitive construction
market led to cost savings. Engineer's estimates were based upon norms published by
the Ministry of Communications. These norms were and are still updated annually based
upon an index which reflects fluctuation in the market. (Over the last several years the
Bank has been encouraging government entities to adopt market prices as a basis for cost
estimates.) At the time that the estimates for this Project were developed, the late 1990's,
the construction costs of civil works were dropping rapidly due the evolution towards
more autonomous and, therefore, competitive construction companies and the adoption of
more competitive procurement practices. The published norms did not reflect these
lower costs. The result is that actual Project construction costs were lower than estimated
costs and Project loan savings were realized.

Decisions were made to use some of the resulting savings to extend the scale of technical
assistance and training. The original training sub-component in Jiangsu comprised 8
overseas training programs. These were completed in 2001. Another seven programs
were added and these were completed by May 2005. In Guangdong, the sub-component


                                              5

originally included 10 training programs and 2 technical studies. Unallocated loan funds
funded an additional study and another 12 training programs.

Jiangsu Province: Civil works in Jiangsu commenced with the construction of the Jianbi
Second Shiplock on June 3, 1999 shortly after the loan became effective on March 16,
1999 and ended with the completion of the Suqian Shiplock in May 2005. The quality of
the construction in all 5 locks was highly satisfactory. Two of the shiplocks won awards
from the State and the provincial government for quality construction. All civil works
contracts were awarded under ICB procedure.

Equipment (gates, hoists and computerized control and operating systems) were procured,
concurrent with the progress of civil works, to ensure that the shiplocks could commence
operation as soon as their construction (civil work) was completed.

Guangdong Province: Project implementation in Guangdong was adversely affected by
unusual weather conditions. Heavy flooding of the Xijiang in 1998 and 1999 resulted in
severe scouring of the riverbed and the erosion of riverbanks on the lower reaches of the
river and led to major design changes on 2 contracts for channel regulatory works
(dredging and bank protection). The Zhaoqing contract suffered a delay when the site for
the terminal and maintenance station for Gaoming had to be substituted due to the
construction of a water intake adjacent to the original site.

An unforeseen external factor in the form of a large increase in the price of construction
material throughout China from 2000-2005, especially steel, affected the contracts for the
installation of channel markers and the construction of the terminals and maintenance
stations at Jiangmen and Chencun. These contracts, awarded under NCB procedure on a
fixed cost basis, had no provision for price escalation. Contractors confronted with
financial difficulties took a longer time to complete the contracts.

GPWB's response to a recent MOC initiative to develop model waterway projects that
exhibited technological innovation led to a revision of specifications for the supply of
equipment for channel telemetry and monitoring to include a remote monitoring system
and accompanying civil works in the monitoring centers. This revision delayed the
completion of the contract and, together with the delayed completion of the Zhaoqing
contract, accounted for the extension of the loan closing date.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The Project was designed with the expectation that transport cost would be reduced
through the use of larger vessels, and improved vessel turn-round through minimizing or
eliminating waiting time at shiplocks. Indicators for performance monitoring and
evaluation were (1) reduction in transport cost, (2) the average size of vessels using the
networks of waterways of the project provinces and (3) waiting time at project shiplocks.
Given the purpose of the Project, the indicators were appropriate. However, the extent of
reduction in transport cost was not specified in project appraisal documents. To ascertain
the degree, a determination of transport cost before and after the project was undertaken
for the ICR.



                                              6

Investment cost recovery was to be monitored and evaluated through several financial
ratios including working ratio, self-financing ratio and debt service coverage ratio.
GPWB and JPWB were expected to meet financial targets represented by these financial
ratios. The ratios were determined on the underlying assumption that deepening national
reform would consolidate the financial autonomy of the implementing entities to raise
revenue to meet financial obligations. Instead, a major policy change by the government
(GOC) in 2000 to promote the use of IWT reduced the channel maintenance fee by 25%
to lighten the financial burden on IWT operators. The policy shift removed flexibility
that GPWB and JPWB might have in revenue generation.

Although the financial ratios established for the Project were regularly furnished for
review, they became meaningless. Monitoring and evaluation of the implementing
entities' financial capacities focused on their ability to meet their financial obligations
rather than in the context of meeting the agreed financial ratios. Early in the
implementation the task team missed an opportunity to initiate the process of amending
the loan in order to replaced the original indictors with more realistic indicators. This
oversight could possibly be explained by the twice change in task team leadership during
implementation.1 For the ICR, the Bank task team and the implementing entities
mutually agreed on new financial ratios to assess the performance of the latter. The
revised ratios were cost-based, relating the waterway bureau's annual expenditures and
budget allocation to the total volume of freight that passed through the bureau's
waterways.

Mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the Project included the review of
quarterly reports and a mid-term report on the progress achieved in carrying out the
Project furnished by the implementing agencies. The review of the reports concluded
that project implementation was proceeding satisfactorily and no revision of the project
implementation plan was necessary.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard and fiduciary compliance was satisfactory. Project financial management by
the implementing entities met acceptable standards. Comments of independent auditors
on annual financial statements, when they arose, were satisfactorily explained and
clarified. Procurement was undertaken in strict compliance with Bank procurement
guidelines.

Environmental monitoring during project implementation, in accordance with the
Environmental Action Plan, was undertaken in Jiangsu by municipal environmental
monitoring centers of cities in the project areas and, in Guangdong, by the Scientific
Institute of Pearl River Resources Protection. PMOs reported the monitoring results to
the Bank on a quarterly basis and these were reviewed, commented upon by the Bank,
and corrective action taken where necessary. The favorable outcome of environmental



1Mr. Toshiro Tsutsumi was the task team leader from inception until November 2006 replaced by Mr.
Graham Smith who was the task team leader until July 2004, followed by Mr. John Scales until completion.




                                                  7

safeguard measures taken in Jiangsu was visible and appreciated. Shiplock areas became
parks and gardens for local public enjoyment as a result of landscaping prescribed in the
EAP.

Environmental safeguards in the case of Guangdong were concerned mainly with
environmental management around construction sites and water quality downstream of
construction sites. Most of the safeguard measures were included in the civil works
contracts and were satisfactorily implemented. Water quality standards were generally
met, minor exceptions being the presence of coliform bacteria and ammonia nitrogen and
traces of oil found in two sections of the project waterways in April/May 2005. Measures
were quickly taken to reduce contaminants. The end-of-project environmental
monitoring report prepared by the Scientific Institute of Water Resource Protection of
Pearl River Monitoring Center of Pearl River concluded that environmental safeguard
measures for the Project had been complied with satisfactorily. Environmental
monitoring during the construction phase ceased in July 2005 but monitoring for the
operational phase would continue for the next three years in accordance with the EAP.

Resettlement, externally monitored by The Second Harbor Engineering Investigation and
Design Institute of MOC, was kept to a minimum at shiplock sites. Basic data on land
acquisition, relocation and resettlement affected by the construction of the five shiplocks
showed the following:

  Project Site                         Relocation                  Land Acquisition
                              Households       Enterprises          Farmland (ha.)

  Xietai Second Shiplock           0                3                      0
  Huaiyin Third Shiplock          147               5                    16.07
  Huai'an Third Shiplock           90              15                      0
  Suqian Third Shiplock            6                2                     0.07
  Total                           367              46                    16.14

Land acquisition generally took longer than expected and contributed to some extent to
the late commencement of work on the terminals and maintenance stations at Chencun,
Ronggui, Jiangmen and Zhaoqiang.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The project waterway and shiplocks, upon their completion, have been satisfactorily
operated and maintained by the two provincial waterway bureaus through their respective
sub-bureaus. The satisfactory performances of the implementing agencies are evident in
the revised financial ratios developed to measure performance (see following table and
section 2.3).

An audit report received by the Bank mid-year 2006 for the year end December 31, 2005
raised a question regarding the utilization of the suction hopper dredger procured in the
Guangdong component of the Project. A general requirement of the Loan Agreement
states that equipment purchased with the proceeds of the loan was to be used only for the



                                              8

project waterways. Entrusted to the Nansha Waterway Bureau (NWB), a sub-bureau of
GPWB, in September 2004, the dredger had been used outside the project waterways, as
work on the project waterways was ongoing, but on waterways maintained by GPWB.
The purchase of the dredger was intended to provide GPWB with a minimum in-house
capability for emergency channel dredging (not necessarily only of the project
waterways), notwithstanding the assumption at the time of appraisal that dredging
operation in general would eventually be commercialized. It was agreed by the Bank
task team that it was reasonable to use the dredger wherever there was a need and
accordingly to enable GPWB to deploy the dredger outside the project waterways.

During the implementation mission of October 2006, the Bank task team suggested that
GPWB sought a waiver of the Loan Agreement to allow it to continue to use the dredger
in a manner that would justify its investment. After consultation with the legal
department it was decided not to process such a waiver, given that the suggestion came as
the Project was nearing completion and since it did not affect the ultimate objective of the
Project nor the appropriate use of the Project investments.

The study on the optimization of vessel size, conducted under the Project, established
that:

    · inland water transportation of low-value commodities such as coal, ore and
       construction materials had a distinct cost advantage over other modes for
       distances less than 400 km; and
    · the average cost per ton of cargo carried was comparable to other countries that
       use inland water transportation extensively.

Actual traffic on the project waterways and shiplocks exceeded expectations. Economic
benefits were achieved as forecasted. Institutionally, implementing agencies were
strengthened. Hence the Project is likely to be sustained.

A follow-up project financed by the Bank is currently under implementation in
Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Further improvements on Jiangsu's waterways,
mainly in the southern trunk waterway network of the Yangtze River and in the Grand
Canal, estimated at US$ 1.5 billion, have been planned for implementation between 2006

and 2012. Guangdong has similar plans for further upgrading of its inland waterway
infrastructures.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The development objective of the Project was to increase the efficiency, productivity and
competitiveness of inland water transport in the Provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu
through the upgrading of inland waterways infrastructure and the institutional
strengthening of the provincial inland waterways agencies.

Supplementing the primary objective of increasing the efficiency, productivity and
competitiveness of inland water transport, the Project was designed to support policy and
institutional reforms in the commercialization of dredging operations and cost recovery
of investments in the IWW sector, specifically in Guangdong. This was in line with the
government's strategy for improving the delivery of transport services. IWW functions
had been decentralized from the central government to provincial governments and
provincial waterway bureaus were being further reformed by having their commercial
activities such as river port operation, waterway dredging, design and construction
separated from their regulatory functions.

The Project's development objective remains relevant in the context of China's present
transport needs. IWT is a viable mode of transportation, demonstrated by its increasing
share of the freight market. Between 1998 and 2005, IWT traffic increased 13.8%
annually compared to the annual increase in total freight traffic density of 11.2%
surpassing the growth in traffic density of road (6.8%) and rail (7.4%).

In addition, IWT is the least energy intensive, most cost effective, and lowest contributor
to green house gases of all transport modes. Inland water transport is also essential to
promoting greater efficiency, productivity and competitiveness in the use of
Guangdong's and Jiangsu's inland water resources. As such, the Project has met the
strategic objective of Pillar 3 (Managing Resource Scarcity and Environmental
Challenges) and Pillar 4 (Financing Sustained and Efficient Growth) of the Bank's
Partnership Strategy for China for 2006-2010.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The benefits of the Project would accrue mainly from the operation of larger vessels on
the waterways, and in addition, in Jiangsu, from the reduction or elimination of delays at
shiplocks. Based on the key performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation, the
Project had fully achieved its original objective (see Data Sheet, F, Results Framework
Analysis).

The average size of vessels using Jiangsu's waterways increased steadily during the
period of project implementation from 84.2 dwt in 1998 to 162 dwt in 2005, exceeding
significantly the target of 96 dwt established at the time of appraisal. Guangdong's
average size of vessels at 420 dwt was 142% larger than the average size in 1998 and
only marginally less than the target size of 436 dwt.

Vessel waiting time at shiplocks, averaging from 0.6 to 1.1 hours per vessel at the time of
appraisal (1998), was eliminated. The average size of vessels passing through the
shiplocks increased from 66 dwt in 1998 to 300 dwt in 2005.

The computation of transport cost representing situations before and after the Project
showed that a reduction in transport cost, the planned primary outcome of the Project,
was achieved.

3.3 Efficiency
The investment in the Project was efficient. The economic rate of return (EIRR) was
close to the estimated rate (20.8% vs. 21.4%) with the financial rate of return (FIRR)
matching the target (8.4% vs. 8.3%).

Economic Rate of Return: The EIRR of the entire project was estimated at 20.8%, and the
net present value (NPV), at a discount rate of 12 percent, was estimated at RMB 1,374.4
million compared to the PAD estimate of 21.4% and RMB 1,713 million, respectively.
The post completion EIRR of the Jiangsu component, estimated at 29.9%, compared
favorably with the PAD estimate of 21.9%. Guangdong had an estimated EIRR of 14.2%,
compared to the PAD estimate of 21.0%. Details of the economic analysis are found in
Annex 3

Jiangsu: The recalculated EIRR and NPV of the Jiangsu component were higher than
anticipated at appraisal mainly because of: (a) the lower economic cost (about 5.7 percent
less than the PAD estimate), and (b) the higher shiplock traffic (about 70 percent higher
than the PAD estimate).

Guangdong: The recalculated EIRR of 14.2% was lower than the PAD's estimate of
21.0% mainly due to (a) the higher economic cost (7.7%) and (b) the delay in completion.

Financial Rate of Return: The reevaluated FIRR of the entire project was 8.4% with a
NPV (4.6% discount rate) of RMB 1,204 million. Jiangsu was estimated to have a FIRR
of 7.0% and Guangdong 9.7% compared to the PAD's estimate of 7.8% and 9.3%
respectively. The detailed financial analysis in Annex 3 is summarized below.

Both the Jiangsu and Guangdong inland waterway bureaus are public service agencies
with responsibility for the day-to-day management, operation and maintenance of the
inland waterway transport systems in their provinces. Their main financial incomes are
the regulated fees imposed on the inland waterway's operators and budgetary allocations
from the provinces. The two inland waterway bureaus planned to use their financial
incomes to cover their financial obligations, including the Bank and domestic loans.
Based on the current operation which generates a healthy cash flow, in spite of regulatory
changes that reduced opportunities for revenue generation, the two inland waterway
bureaus are not expected to have any difficulty in financing the operation and
maintenance of their waterway infrastructures as well as their debt obligations.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall the outcome of the Project was rated satisfactory based on
(a) the satisfactory achievement of its objective,
(b) the consistency of the project development objective with the Bank's strategy for
improving transport services to alleviate bottlenecks and China's policy and plan for
increased economic development in interior regions,
(c) the attention given to lessons learned from the previous inland waterway project and
other transport projects, and
(d) compliance with Bank's safeguard policies.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Sector Development
The impact of the project on sector development was very positive. As had been
experienced in the previous inland waterway project, with improvements in the
navigational channels and increased capacity of the shiplocks, larger vessels were being
used. Measures to speed up the transition to larger vessels and discourage the use of
smaller vessels were implemented and the construction of standardized vessels,
influenced by the Project technical assistance recommendations implemented by the
Ministry of Communications, was evident. Single self-propelled vessels were beginning
to be replaced by tows of two to three barges, a more efficient and cost effective form of
operation. A shift from small family-based ownership to larger business enterprises was
evident.

(b) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted in the Project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low or Negligible
The risk to development outcome was negligible to low. Central and project provincial
governments' commitment to the Project were strong, economic conditions in the country
and the Project Provinces remained robust, PMO staff were adequately trained to
implement Bank financed projects, and counterpart funds were available throughout the
implementation of the Project. Traffic on the project waterways exceeded expectation,
reflecting improvement in services and reduction in transport cost. Budgetary provisions
for maintenance were adequate and had been increasing in recent years in the Project
Provinces. The risk that the development outcome will not be sustained, externally in
terms of the demand for the facilities provided and internally in terms of the ability and
capacity of the project entities to properly manage, operate and maintain them, is low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory. The Project was
technically sound. Lessons learned in past Bank financed projects were taken into
account. Risks were identified and appropriate measures were taken to mitigate them.
Care was exercised to prepare the PMOs for project implementation. The failure to
specify the extent to which reduction in transport cost was expected seemed an oversight.
Not quantifying this target did not hinder the ability to monitor and evaluate the
achievement of its development objective but did contribute to what otherwise could be
considered highly satisfactory quality at entry.

Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) contained elaborate processes for consultation and
participation of the various stakeholders in the planning, adverse impact analysis, legal
framework for resettlement, strategy and implementation program for compensation,
relocation and livelihood development, monitoring and airing and resolution of
grievances.

QAG's assessment of quality at entry found that out of nine constituent elements, seven
(the Project/operation's concept objectives and approach, technical and economic aspects,
environmental aspects, poverty and social aspects, financial management aspects, risk
assessment and sustainability, Bank inputs and processes) were satisfactory; one
(readiness for implementation) was highly satisfactory; and one (institutional analysis)
was marginally satisfactory, on account that there was no clear indication how the Project
would address the issue of freight tariff regulations that affect inter-modal competition, a
comment which in hindsight, with the change in national policy, appears misguided.




                                             14

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The quality of Bank supervision was satisfactory.

Regular implementation review missions, focusing on the timely completion of works
and their impact on the achievement of the development objective, were conducted
throughout the period of project implementation. Changes in national policy beyond the
control of the Project limited the ability of the waterway bureaus to collect revenue and
rendered the intermediate financial outcome indicators and related covenants meaningless.
The task team missed the opportunity to initiate an amendment to the loan agreement and
possibly agree on replacement indicators. Nonetheless, these changes did not adversely
affect the outcome of the development objective (also see Section 6, Lessons Learned)
but did contribute to downgrading what otherwise could be considered highly satisfactory
quality of supervision.

Otherwise, issues that emerged during implementation were attended to efficiently and
promptly. For example, the Bank proactively and in a timely manner responded to the
request to use unallocated loan funds to increase the scale of technical assistance and
training. Other issues such as land acquisition difficulties, shiplock operating
performance, questions raised by auditors, and extension of the loan closing date for the
Guangdong part were all handled efficiently and effectively. Though there was no
explicit arrangement for social impact monitoring, compliance with safeguard and
fiduciary policies was closely monitored and recommendations for improving the
implementation of the EAP and the RAP were readily given. Environmental assessments
(EA) of the project components were satisfactorily carried out by the Scientific Institute
of Pearl River Water Resources Protection for the Guangdong component and by the
Second Harbor Engineering Investigation and Design Institute of MOC in association
with Hehai University for the Jiangsu component.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory based on its performance in preparing and
supervising the Project. Project preparation was efficient in terms of time. The design of
the Project was relevant to the developmental needs of the Project Provinces.
Supervision during project implementation was regular and constructive.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Government performance was satisfactory based on its level of commitment to the
Project. MOC was strongly supportive of the development and had organized workshops
to assist Jiangsu and Guangdong in the preparation of the Project. MOC followed the
Project closely during implementation, and on several occasions participated with the
Bank task team in review missions, particularly in the early stages of the implementation
of the Project.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Implementing
Agencies             Performance

                     On the balance the performance of both implementing agencies was
Guangdong            satisfactory. Co-operation between the implementing agencies and the
Provincial           Bank was very good, consultations were extensive and meaningful and
Waterway Bureau
and                  issues were promptly raised and jointly resolved. Both implementing

Jiangsu Provincial   agencies discharged their fiduciary responsibilities conscientiously and
Waterway Bureau      correctly. Compliance with Bank's requirements during project
                     implementation was highly satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory. Government support was forthcoming.
The Project was, though not perfect, well prepared. The design was appropriate in the
context of the development objective. The implementation plan was well conceived.
Implementation was generally satisfactory. The Project was completed with outputs in
excess of planned targets and at a cost that was less than estimated. Traffic on the project
waterways and shiplocks significantly exceeded expectation testifying to an improvement
in the quality of the facilities and services provided by the implementing agencies. The
project clearly achieved its objective.

6. Lessons Learned
Supporting economic growth by improving the Inland Waterway Sector, replicating
Project outcomes ­ Inland waterways often are the first link in transport chains especially
for low-value commodities in large consignments from and to origins alongside or near a
river or inland waterway. Users of China's inland waterways are aware of the benefit of
using larger vessels for such cargo and, as this Project demonstrates, respond positively
to improvements in inland waterway infrastructures that promote their use. Measures to
increase efficiency and cost effectiveness in the sector are also well received by the
market, though limited government intervention may be necessary to ensure a balance
with other transport modes. Investments in and upkeep of navigation infrastructure
(dredging, navigation aides, locks, etc), similar to the Project investments, can be
replicated building on experience gained in inland waterway network planning, macro-
economic considerations, technical design, safety provisions and environmental and
social safeguards.

Avoiding conditionality that advocates policy beyond the control of the Project -
Government, and for the matter the Bank's, transport policies often change unexpectedly
in the course of project implementation as they did for this project in relation to user
pricing. The implementing entities' progression towards an institutional capacity to set
direct user charges to cover cost and provide for investment funding while maintaining
competitiveness with other modes seemingly suffered a setback when a national policy
change restricted the ability of government waterway entities to directly collect fees from
waterway users. The national policy was aimed at balancing the use of inland waterway


                                               16

sector with other modes. The revenue loss was substituted by an increase in budgetary
allocations.

Throughout the world, most waterways tend to be owned and administered as public
goods. Cost recovery mechanisms are rarely sufficient to cover all costs, but these costs
are usually very small compared to other modes in either absolute terms or in proportion
to traffic handled. In general, permanent government subsidies for transport
infrastructure should be avoided but road and inland waterway systems are somewhat
exceptional: for the most part ­ other than busy commercial canals and high density
tolled freeways ­ they are appropriately treated as public goods recovered through taxes
and vehicle/registration fees. In this light, and given inland waterways greater energy
efficiency and smaller environmental footprint, this national policy appears appropriate.2
Unfortunately, the original Project design included covenants and performance indicators
based upon policy that was beyond the ability of the Project to control and appear, at least
in hindsight, to support a narrow interpretation of the benefits of self-generated revenue.
In designing project conditionality it is important to take a broad informed perspective,
reflect the fluidity of national policy in a developing country, and remain within the
limits of the Project to control.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Implementing Agencies
1. It is suggested a flexible disbursement policy of the use of loan savings be adopted, e.g.
increasing the amount for financing of civil works from 62% to 100%.

Unallocated loan funds by mutual consent of the Bank and the Borrower may be used to
finance additional works and services. Major revision of project scope may require some
form of appraisal of the additional work/services. Present Bank policy allows a revision
of the disbursement rate. The possibility of increasing the disbursement rate for civil
works in the Guangdong component to fully make use of the loan amount was discussed
in one of the project review missions. This was eventually discounted in light that the
amount of remaining works was negligible relative to the expected loan savings.

2. Prepare supplemental subprojects at project appraisal stage rather than in the middle
of project implementation for use of unallocated loan funds.

In light that competitive bidding may lower project costs and loan savings may arise, the
suggestion merits thoughtful consideration.

3. To improve the implementing agency's project management capability, it is suggested
that the Bank, prior to project implementation, help to arrange for 2-3 of the agency's
staff to work in an overseas Bank-financed project where English is a working language.

The idea is worth exploring. Much depends on whether the overseas implementation unit
would be prepared to accommodate the visitors. The issue of funding also arises.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic and financial evaluations of the two major components: (a) the five ship locks
for the inland waterway system in Jiangsu Province and (b) the two main waterway
channels in Guangdong Province were separately undertaken. Each evaluation covers all
sub-components. Evaluation for the entire project combining the two main components
as well as all other components is also undertaken.

The Jiangsu part of the Project included a minor component that was intended to facilitate
an increase in average vessel size, as well as a major component to increase the number
of chambers on the most congested shiplocks on the Grand Canal. In the economic
evaluation these two components were evaluated together, and it appeared that the
projected increase in vessel size was attributed to the reduction in congestion at the
shiplocks whereas the two outcomes were independent of each other. In the re-evaluation
of the shiplock (Jiangsu) component, the benefits of the shiplock expansion were
separated from that of the policy to increase vessel size, to take account of the actual
increase in freight on the Grand Canal as well as the actual increase in vessel size and
changes in ship operating cost.

Both costs and benefits in the evaluation reflect December 2005 prices. Assumptions of
traffic and the results of evaluations are tabulated below.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

                                        A Jiangsu

1. Introduction
The Jiangsu component of the project was undertaken in accordance with the national
and provincial waterway transportation plan to alleviate bottlenecks at shiplocks on the
Grand Canal and enhance regional economic development. This was Jiangsu 's first
inland waterway project and the second in the transport sector financed by the Bank.
Initial preparation for the project commenced in 1995. The loan was negotiated in
December 1998 and closed on June 30, 2005. All components in the project were
completed satisfactorily.

2. Project Objectives
The objective of the development in Jiangsu were to provide more efficient and
productive inland waterway transport services through increasing shiplock capacity to
reduce waiting time and to increase the financial and institutional capacity of JPWB.
Although inland waterway transportation was known to be the least costly, the least
energy consuming, and least hazardous, this mode of transportation had been losing
market share in the 1980s and early 1990s. To overcome the decline, the government
decided to rehabilitate the major corridor for waterborne transportation from the north to
the south by building a number of dual or third line shiplocks on the Grand Canal,
including the five shiplocks in the Jiangsu component of the Project.

3. Project Description
The Jiangsu component of the project included

    · Construction of five shiplocks on the Grand Canal, consisting of


      Jianbi Second Shiplock: 23m wide×230m long×4m

      Huaian Third Shiplock: 23m wide×260m long×5m

      Huaiyin Third Shiplock: 23m wide×260m long×5m

      Suqian Third Shiplock: 23m wide×260m long×5m

      Xietai Second Shiplock: 23m wide×230m long×5m

    · Training of JPWB's staff in various aspects of waterway management,
        construction and, maintenance; and
    · Technical Assistance for undertaking a study on the optimization of vessel size
        and development of a Management Information System (MIS).




                                             27

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs:
The objectives of the project were fully achieved. All components in the project were
completed satisfactorily. The five shiplocks were constructed as planned. The study on
the optimization of vessel size resulted in recommendations for the standardization of
vessels using the waterways. A Management Information System was developed for the
whole of Jiangsu's network of waterways. Oversea training for 145 persons and domestic
training for 76 persons was completed.

5. Project Planning and Design
A Project Administrative Office (PAO) was established with sufficient experienced and
qualified managerial personnel and engineers to manage all aspects of the project, from
engineering design, preparation of bidding documents to reporting to the Bank.

6. Project Implementation
The implementation of the project was directly managed by PAO in close cooperation
with relevant authorities in the project areas. A local office was also established for the
management of each sub-component. The whole component was successfully completed
by the end of May 2005.

1) Civil Works:
Each shiplock works consisted of four contracts (one each for civil works, gates and
valves, hoists and electrical equipment). All civil works contracts were procured through
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and machinery for the shiplocks (gates and valves,
hoists, and electrical equipment) were purchased through International Competitive
Bidding (ICB). The completion of each sub-component was as follows.
    a.  The construction of Jianbi Second Shiplock commenced on June 3, 1999 and was
        completed in March 2003. It won the Quality Prize Award from MOC and the
        Yangtze Prize Award from Jiangsu Province in 2003 and the Silver Quality Prize
        from the State in 2004.
    b. The construction of Xietai Second Shiplock commenced in December 1999 and
        was completed in November 2003. It also won the Quality Prize Award from
        MOC and Yangtze Prize Award from Jiangsu Province in 2003.
    c.  The construction of Huaian Third Shiplock commenced in September 2000 and
        was completed in January 2005.
    d. The construction of Huayin Third Shiplock also commenced in September 2000
        and was completed in January, 2005.
    e.  The construction of Suqian Third Shiplock, commenced in October 2001, and
        has been has been in trial operation for about a year without any problem.

2) Technical Assistance:
The study on the optimization of vessel size and the development of a Management
Information System (MIS) was completed and the final report was submitted to the
World Bank in December 2002. Consultants for the study were selected on QCBS basis.
The report's recommendations for standardization of vessels using the shiplocks and
waterways were adopted. The MIS is being used in the daily management of Jiangsu 's
waterways.



                                             28

3) Training Programs:
Originally there were eight overseas training programs in the project covering various
aspects of policy support, implementation support and institutional development. This
was later enlarged to fifteen programs with the approval of the Bank. All the 15 training
programs had been completed satisfactorily; the last being in May 2005.

7. Land Acquisition and Resettlement:
Land acquisition and resettlement were executed in accordance with the Resettlement
Action Plan and monitored by Second Harbor Engineering Investigation & Design
Institute who prepared five monitoring reports during the period of implementation of the
project. Basic data on land acquisition, relocation and resettlement affected by the
construction of the five shiplocks are shown in the following table:

8. Environmental Protection:
Environmental protection was an important aspect of project implementation. PAO
entrusted the municipal environmental monitoring centers of the respective cities in the
project areas with the monitoring of environmental changes during the entire period of
project implementation. Quarterly reports on the results were submitted by PAO to the
Bank. Contractors were required to pay particular attention to the work-sites, living areas
and surrounding vegetation. The Project did not have any adverse impact on the local
environment; rather, the landscaping and the planting of trees had improved the
environment of the project areas by turning them into beautiful parks and gardens.

9. Cost and Financing:
The original loan amount for the Jiangsu component was US$53 million. Due to
reduction in prices of major materials and competitive bidding, the cost of the project was
greatly reduced and US$17 million of the Bank loan was cancelled in June 2003. The
loan financed 100% of the procurement of all the machinery, technical assistance and
training and 62 % of the cost of civil works. JPWB funded the remaining 38% of the cost
of civil works and 100% of the costs of land acquisition, resettlement, environmental
protection and domestic training.

10. Performances of Contractors and Consulting Engineers
a) Contractors:
There were 20 contracts for civil works and equipment. All contracts progressed on
schedule and were completed according to design and specifications without any delay.
All contractors' performances were rated satisfactory.

b)Consulting Engineers
Supervision engineers were experienced and familiar with FIDIC conditions of contract.
Their performances were rated satisfactory.

11. PAO's Performance
PAO was committed to the project from the beginning to the end of project
implementation, fully prepared the project, coordinated with different departments of the
provincial and municipal governments and worked closely with World Bank at all times.
PAO established four local construction units to manage the daily engineering tasks as
well as to coordinate with relevant authorities in the project areas. The performance of
PAO was highly satisfactory.


12. Bank Performance
a) Project Preparation:
The Bank's performance was satisfactory. From 1995 to 1998, the Bank dispatched a few
missions to help JPWB identify, prepare and formulate the project. The Bank missions
and JPWB had discussions on a wide range of issues relating to feasibility studies,
economic analysis, engineering design, methods of procurement, construction
supervision, environmental protection, disbursement, technical assistance and
training, land acquisition and resettlement.

b) Project implementation
During the implementation of the project, the Bank dispatched two missions a year to
review the progress of the project. They gave a lot of constructive advice. JPWB was
greatly satisfied with the performances of the World Bank's missions.




                                             30

c) Cooperation between PAO and the World Bank
The World Bank and PAO had a close and pleasant work relationship. Bank officials
were always ready to help PAO resolve difficulties and problems that were encountered
during the implementation of the project

13. Lessons Learned
Early in the preparation of the Project, JPWB organized several study tours to other
provinces such as Zhejiang who had implemented projects financed by the World Bank to
learn from their experiences. Some key staff appointed to work in PAO also intensified
their learning of the English language so as to be able to understand the World Bank
guidelines and procedures better. These efforts proved to be very valuable in managing
the implementation of the project. A strong, responsible and experienced project
management team was found to be essential for the successful implementation of the
project.


14. Suggestions:
It is suggested that a flexible disbursement policy on the use of unallocated loan funds be
adopted. As an illustration, the loan saving of US$17 million could have been put to use
by increasing the financing percentage of civil works from 62% to 100%. It is also
suggested that supplemental sub-components be appraised and included for financing
under the loan in the event that funds are available from loan savings in the original
components. To improve the implementing agency's project management capability, it is
suggested that the Bank, prior to project implementation, help to arrange for 2 or 3 of the
agency's key staff to work 3 to 6 months in an overseas Bank-financed project where
English is a working language, such as in India and the Philippines. By this arrangement,
the staff of the implementing agency will learn not only the management of the project
but also improve their proficiency in the English language.

In order to meet the increasing demand for inland waterway transportation, improve the
South Jiangsu trunk waterway network in the Yangtze River Delta, and increase the
capacity of the Grand Canal, the central and provincial governments plan to invest a total
of RMB12.4 billion (equivalent to some USD1.5 billion) between 2006 and 2012 to
rehabilitate Jiangsu's waterway infrastructures. JPWB would like the World Bank to
continue to finance the development of province's waterways with another loan of
USD200 million.


                                        B. Guangdong

1. Introduction
The Guangdong Component of China Second Inland Waterway Project comprised
waterway regulation works on the lower reaches of Xijiang River ( Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen
Waterway) and the Lian-sha-rong Waterway. The Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen Waterway (Z-H)
is navigable for seagoing vessels up to 3,000 dwt and plays an important role in the
economic development of the Pearl River delta. The Lian-sha-rong Waterway (L-S-R), a
key channel connecting the eastern to the western part of the Pearl River delta, is also the




                                             31

trunk channel that connects the Xijiang River and the Shiziyang Waterway, the two major
inland water routes of the province.

The Project is Guangdong's first IWT project to be financed by the World Bank. Initial
preparation of the Project commenced in 1995. In December 1998, a delegation
consisting of representatives from the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of
Communications, Guangdong Finance Department, Guangdong Communications
Department, Guangdong Financial Department, and Guangdong Provincial Waterway
Bureau (GPWB), visited the headquarters of the World Bank in Washington to negotiate
the Loan Agreement and Project Agreement. The Ministry of Finance of the People's
Republic of China signed the Loan Agreement and Project Agreement with the World
Bank. The loan of $ 70 million to Guangdong Province became effective on March 16,
1999.

2. Project Objective
The objective of the Guangdong component of the Project was to upgrade the Zhaoqing-
Hutiaomen Waterway and the Lian-sha-rong Waterway to allow navigation of larger size
vessels, and (b) to improve the financial and organizational capacity of GPWB.

3. Project description
The Guangdong component of the project included the following:

    · Regulation works on the Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen Waterway ( 168 km) and the Lian-
       sha-rong Waterway (90 km), specifically to a standard of 100m×6m×650m
       (width×depth×bending radius) for the former and 80m×4m×500m for the latter
    · Personnel Training: including policy support, implementation support and
       institution development; transfer of waterway construction technology and
       maintenance techniques, and
    · Technical assistance: comprising the development of a Management Information
       System and a study on navigational aids development.

The main works of improving the waterways consisted of dredging, bank protection,
short-cutting, shoal blasting, channel marking and telecommunication.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs:
All the components have been successfully completed and all the objectives have been
fully achieved. Outputs achieved included:

    · Completion of regulation works on Lower Reach of Xijiang River and
       Liansharong Waterway;
    · Completion of a comprehensive study that resulted in the "Study Report on
       Navigational Aids Development for Xijiang Lower Reach and Liansharong
       Waterway", the development of a Management Information System (MIS) and
       Vessel Data Base for Guangdong Waterway Bureau headquarters, and a
       feasibility study on electronic mapping of the provincial waterways;




                                            32

    · Completion of overseas training of 197 persons and domestic training of 188
       persons.

5. Project Planning, Design and Implementation
In order to successfully complete the project, GPWB established the Project Management
Office (PMO) as the implementing agency and assigned and recruited to it sufficient
experienced and qualified managerial personnel and engineers to manage all aspects of
the project.

All works under the project were completed by May 2006 except for the construction of
the terminal and maintenance station in Zhaoqing and the development of the channel
marker telemetry system, estimated to be completed by end April 2007.

Civil Works: The project was implemented through 25 contracts: 17 for civil works, 7 for
equipment procurement, and one for construction supervision. Among them, 4 civil
works contracts and 3 equipment contracts were procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB). Of the remaining13 civil works contracts, 10 were awarded
following national competitive bidding. The rest were non-Bank financed.

Equipment: Major items of equipment were procured through ICB.

Technical assistance and Training: Overseas training was originally planned for138
persons, covering such areas as policy support, implementation support and institution
development. With the concurrence of the Bank the training program was expanded to
include Inland Waterway Development, Planning and Policy Study; Inland Waterway
Management and Vessel Operation; Environmental Monitoring and Protection;
Waterway Construction and Maintenance; Waterway Design Optimization; Construction
Supervision; Procurement and Contract; Financial Management; Economic Analysis and
Evaluation; Project Management; Human Resource Management and 59 more people
were trained. In addition, with Bank approval, a feasibility study on electronic mapping
was undertaken. Consultants were selected according to their quality. All training
programs have been completed successfully and the last training program (human
resource) was completed by end 2004.

7. Land Acquisition and Resettlement
Land acquisition and resettlement were completed satisfactorily.

8. Environmental Protection
Environmental protection was an important aspect of the Project. PMO entrusted
Scientific Institute of Pearl River Resources Protection to conduct environmental
monitoring. Environmental monitoring results were reported to the Bank in accordance
with the Environmental Action Plan on a quarterly basis. Environmental monitoring
ceased in the third quarter of 2005 upon the completion of waterway regulation works.




                                            33

9. Cost and Financing:
The original loan amount for Guangdong was US$70 million. Due to price reduction of
major materials and competitive bidding under the Bank's procurement guidelines, the
cost of the project was greatly reduced and US$20 million of the loan was cancelled in
Feb. 2004, reducing the loan amount to US$50 million. The Bank loan financed 100% of
the procurement of all the gates, hoists, equipment and technical assistance and overseas
training, and 62 % of the cost of civil works. GPWB funded 38% of civil works and
100% of the costs of land acquisition, resettlement, environmental protection and
domestic training. All expenditures were audited annually by the Guangdong Provincial
Auditing Department and the auditor's annual reports were furnished the Bank on a
timely basis.

* Actual cost was converted from RMB to US$ at the exchange rate of 7.82 prevailing at
the date of loan losing.

10. Performances of Contractors and Consulting Engineers
1) Contractors: Most of the contracts progressed as scheduled and completed according
to design and specifications except for a few that were delayed because of contract
variations, protracted processing for construction approval and adjustments for escalation
in steel price. Contractors' performances were generally satisfactory.
2) Consulting Engineers: Consulting services for construction supervision were not
financed by the loan and were procured following national procedure. Supervision
engineers were experienced and familiar with the international practices. They were
highly responsible and discharged their responsibilities in construction management,
quality control, and control of contract progress payments competently. They played a
key role in assuring the quality and progress of the project.

11. PMO's Performance
The PMO was fully committed to the Project. It prepared the Project; coordinated with
different departments of provincial and municipal governments and managed the
implementation of the project. PMO worked closely with the World Bank task team in
the preparation and implementation of the project.

12. Bank Performance
The World Bank provided a wide range of assistance and advice in project identification,
preparation and formulation. The Bank's contribution made the success of the project
possible. During the implementation of the project, two missions a year from the Bank
review the progress of work. Cooperation between PMO and the World Bank was good.



                                             34

13. Lessons Learned
This was the first Inland Waterway Transport Project in Guangdong and the second
transport project in the province financed by the World Bank. In the course of preparing
and implementing the project, a lot of experiences and lessons were learned:

    · A comprehensive preparation for project implementation including sending
        project staff to other provinces such as Zhejiang to learn from their experiences
        and familiarize themselves with Bank procedures in the early stage of the project
        cycle helped to ensure an efficient management of implementation of the Project.
    · Knowledge of the English language was essential to the understanding of the
        Bank's guidelines and procedures particularly those relating to procurement.
    · A strong, responsible and experienced project management team guaranteed the
        successful implementation of the project.
    · Competition through the application of Bank procurement guidelines and
        complying with them strictly was one of the best ways of reducing project costs.
    · The implementation of the project exposed a large number of engineers of GPWB
        to international practices (FIDIC) in contracting and consulting.
    · The overseas training programs were very useful for the engineers to learn and
        understand the design, construction and, in particular, the management of projects
        in western countries.

14. Suggestions:
As loan savings often occur, it would be good for both the Bank and the Borrower to
have a flexible disbursement policy on the use of possible savings and unallocated loan
proceeds. The Bank may provide two options in the legal documents to allow the
unallocated loan funds to be disbursed rather than cancelled:

    ·    Increase the financing percentage of civil works from 62% to 100% if savings are
        identified.
    ·    Prepare supplemental subprojects at the project appraisal period rather than in the
        middle of the project implementation that could be, partly or entirely financed
        from loan savings.

To facilitate the management of projects in the future, it is suggested that the Bank help
to arrange for 2 or 3 key staff of the project implementing agency at early stage to work
for 3 to 6 months on an overseas World Bank financed project where English is a
working language such as India or the Philippines. In this way, these key staff will not
only learn about project management, but will improve their proficiency in the English
language as well.
