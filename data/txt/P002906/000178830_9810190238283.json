marketing phosphates in the East African Region\n            and in the Asian Subcontinent, and the technical, financial\n            and economic possibility of investing in the phosphate\n            fertilizer sector and to explore the possibilities of equity\n            participation by foreign phosphate fertilizer companies in a\n            resulting full-scale investment in the phosphate
