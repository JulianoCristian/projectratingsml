I. 
Key Development Issues and Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
Country Context
As a country emerging from 15 years of civil war, Liberia is extremely susceptible to the 
consequences of high food price inflation, including a very real risk of reversal of recent 
progress in restoring peace and the nascent economic recovery.  The impacts of the increases 
in world foods prices are already evident in the domestic economy since food is such a large 
share of consumption.  The consumer price index (CPI 
–
in which food carries a weight of 
45%) increased 14% in March 2008 – consequently a typical food basket now costs 25% 
more than in January 2007.  Higher food prices will push more people below the food 
poverty line. As reported in the recent Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ), 
poverty remains endemic with an estimated national poverty rate of 64%.  Moreover, 48% of 
the population is indigent, being unable to meet their basic food needs.  The implications of 
the food price increases on the poverty levels of Liberia are severe.  Based on the results of 
the Liberia Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey, it is estimated that a 20% 
increase in the price of rice could lead to an increase of 3 to 4 percentage points to the 
headcount poverty rate. This price increase has already taken place in Monrovia. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement
Increasing world food prices threaten to undermine recent progress towards the millennium 
development goals (MDGs) by reducing household and national food security and 
threatening macroeconomic stability.  In post-conflict and fragile states, social unrest and 
instability is a real prospect.  Global price increases have reached crisis proportions in 2008:  
wheat prices rose from US$375 per metric ton (mt) in January to US$440/mt in March while 
Thai rice export prices increased from US$365/mt to US$562/mt over the same period.  The

pass-through of high world food prices is compounded by the increase in fuel prices, which 
adds to distribution costs and is resulting in high food price inflation in many countries. 
The Bank has recently put forward a new Global Food Crisis Program (GFRP) which aims to 
allow a comprehensive response to the crisis across a range of different instruments.  GFRP 
provides an overall framework for the Bank to coordinate its own contribution to addressing 
the crisis in partnership with other multi-lateral organizations and donor agencies.  The initial 
approach will be to facilitate a rapid Bank response with all available tools as soon as 
possible, while supporting the evolving coordination role of the United Nations Task Force 
on the Global Food Crisis established recently in Berne.  Eventually, it is envisaged to have a 
more comprehensive partnership modeled along the lines of the Global Program on Avian 
Influenza.   
II. Proposed 
Objective(s) 
 
This aims to reduce the food vulnerability of women and children from poor counties 
targeted by the program.  The component would finance:  (i) school feeding on a daily basis 
to pre-school and primary school children; (ii) take home rations for girls in grade 4 to 6, as 
an additional incentive to encourage greater attendance by girls, (iii) rations for pregnant and 
lactating women (PLW) attending clinics and hospitals; and (iv) the administrative cost of 
the World Food Program (WFP) and its partners to administer the program including 
monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the program. 
WFP have an existing national school feeding program covering all Counties and urban and 
rural communities.  Over 2005 and 2006, over 600,000 children in over 2,300 schools were 
assisted with one school meal per day and 28,000 female children received take-home 
rations.  The target for 2007 
–
2009 is 450,000 in year one and 400,000 in year two.  A recent 
survey conducted by WHP identified nine Counties where chronic malnutrition rates are 
‘critical’ – in excess of 40%.  Consequently, WFP have proposed a special program for 
identified five Counties in the south-east Liberia which fall within these nine, and have 
proposed a special program specifically for those counties.  Bank support will not displace 
other WFP resources but rather will allow WFP to focus on the five most vulnerable counties 
without scaling back its support in other vulnerable areas.   
III. Preliminary 
Description 
 
The project will provide financing for a focused school feeding program in five Counties in 
the south-east of Liberia which exhibit the most severe chronic malnutrition rates.  It will 
assist about 10,000 vulnerable women and children over two years by providing one school 
meal per day and take-home rations for female children.  It will also provide food 
supplements for pregnant and lactating women.  The program is a focused program and 
builds on the success of the national school feeding program that has been implemented by 
WFP since 2005.

Piloting the Use of Borrower Systems to Address Environmental 
and Social Issues in Bank-Supported Projects (OP/BP 4.00) 
[
]
[] 
 
This project triggers no environmental and social safeguards issues and is rated as category 
C.  However, the project has been designed to take account of concerns regarding social 
equity and targeting of food aid to the poorest and most vulnerable.  In this regard, the 
project focuses in the five counties of Maryland, Sinoe, Grand Kru, Grand Gedeh, and River 
Gee in the poorer and more remote south-east areas of Liberia and is strategically designed to 
ensure appropriate targeting.
