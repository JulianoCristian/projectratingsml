CHILDREN", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Food Support\n            for Vulnerable Women and Children Project for Liberia were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a number of\n            lessons have emerged from implementing the project. A\n            central lesson is that emergency projects with simple\n            designs and straightforward objectives are highly likely to\n            be implemented successfully. A strong commitment from\n            government and partners, including the Bank, is also needed\n            to prepare and implement emergency programs speedily and\n            effectively. Fostering intersectoral linkages could enhance\n            the prospects of achieving high levels of impact. Promoting\n            concepts such as World Food Program (WFP's) Purchase\n            for Progress (P4P) could help grow the agriculture sector,\n            promote local purchases, and nurture a home-grown school\n            feeding program. Because the effectiveness of interventions\n            such as WFP's school feeding program, which involves\n            bulk haulage of stock, depends on the quality of roads and\n            bridges, linkages with future investments in rural\n            infrastructure could have a significant, positive impact on\n            WFP's activities."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
