Liberia Emergency Food Crisis Response Program consisting\n            of (i) additional financing to the Liberia Emergency\n            Agriculture and Infrastructure Development Project, (ii)\n            additional financing for the Second Liberia Community\n            Empowerment Project, and (iii) a grant for a new Liberia\n            Emergency Food Support Project for vulnerable women and\n            children. These are to be made available from the new Global\n            Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (FPCRTF). This\n            additional financing and financing of the new project, will\n            constitute the Bank's overall support of the Republic\n            of Liberia's Food Crisis Response Program (LFCW). The\n            proposed Liberia Food Crisis Response Program (LFCRP) will\n            help finance activities to mitigate both the short-term and\n            the medium-to long-term impact of rising food prices in\n            Liberia as a result of the global food price trends. The\n            proposed interventions will support the Government of\n            Liberia's (GoL's) national strategy to maintain\n            and enhance food security. It includes support to: (i) the\n            implementation of social safety net measures to maintain\n            access to food among the most vulnerable households; and\n            (ii) expedite a supply response of agricultural production\n            through the implementation of measures to raise the yields\n            and consequently the production of staples. The government\n            focuses on three pillars: (a) mitigating the domestic\n            pass-through of global price rises and ensuring consistent\n            supply of imported foods in the future. Measures include:\n            (i) removing tariffs on rice imports; and (ii) reducing the\n            risk of supply interruptions by negotiating supply contracts\n            with friendly governments; (b) maintaining access to food\n            among vulnerable households by a combination of direct\n            assistance to severely vulnerable households (including\n            IDPs) and targeted feeding programs such as school feeding\n            and supplementary feeding for pregnant and lactating\n            mothers. Government will also develop/expand a food-or\n            cash-for-work scheme to provide additional income-generating\n            opportunities during the lean season for under-employed\n            households, primarily financed by donors; and (c) expediting\n            a supply response by promoting food crop production through\n            distribution of essential planting materials (mainly seeds\n            and fertilizer), improved post-harvest systems (basic\n            processing technology such as rice millers and improved\n            storage facilities) to reduce post-harvest losses.\n            Government will also further encourage expansion of\n            agricultural production into new lands including through\n            incremental expansion of small-holders as well as\n            large-scale commercial farming."}, "docdt": "2008-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
