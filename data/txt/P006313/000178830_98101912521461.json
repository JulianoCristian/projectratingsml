increase annual\n            alcohol production in Brazil to about 10.7 billion liters by\n            the end of 1985, equivalent to 148,000 barrels per day of\n            petroleum. Of this production, 9.2 billion liters would be\n            used to substitute for 45% of projected 1985 gasoline\n            consumption, and the remainder would be used for chemical\n            feedstocks. The project consists of three components: (a) a\n            production component comprising about 250 alcohol units\n            (distilleries and related agricultural facilities) expected\n            to be approved by the Brazilian Government during 1981-83\n            and coming on-stream during 1983-85. These units would\n            provide additional production capacity of about 5.6 billion\n            liters, of which 95% is expected to be sugarcane-based and\n            5% cassava-based. This component would also include units to\n            demonstrate the feasibility of new technology, such as\n            alcohol production from wood; (b) a technology development\n            component to support basic and applied agricultural and\n            industrial research related to production and use of biomass\n            energy; (c) a monitoring and evaluation system to analyze\n            the impact of the Alcohol Program on the agricultural,\n            transport and industrial sectors, rural employment, and the\n            environment, in order to identify any needed corrective\n            measures and facilitate planning."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
