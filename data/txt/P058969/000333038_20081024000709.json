Project for Azerbaijan were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: engaging communities in economic and\n            social activities around cultural heritage sites in\n            particular proved to be one of the keys to the success of\n            the project. No other activities have been as successful in\n            building widespread understanding, stewardship and real\n            commitment to conservation. The experience has also\n            demonstrated that community driven development is possible\n            even in a difficult context such as Azerbaijan. The project\n            faced several misunderstandings at different levels\n            primarily due to the lack of a well planned and resourced\n            communication program. A two-way communication program,\n            aimed at providing complete information to local communities\n            and engaging them in providing timely feedback to the\n            project, will have helped to build stronger ownership and\n            enthusiasm about the work, and more importantly, to convey\n            very delicate changes of concepts involved in managing\n            effectively cultural heritage resources. Finally, the\n            success of the project in preventing corruption and\n            accumulating a high amount of savings due to very stringent\n            procurement rules also shows the importance of adapting\n            procurement rules to country circumstances, as well as\n            strengthening the Bank's fiduciary role in monitoring\n            of contracts in the context of poor governance."}, "docdt": "2008-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
