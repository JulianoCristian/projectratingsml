                         five project components. However, the Prime Minister Office's review of TA activities under the project, coupled with the Government's decision to finance the development of the
                         personified recordkeeping software with the state budget in order to meet the January 1, 2013 deadline for the introduction of personified record-keeping, resulted in the proposal to
                         remove from the Procurement Plan a number of activities originally envisioned to be financed under the loan and have them financed through different sources. The Government
                         proposed to reallocate the bulk of those funds towards the establishment of additional Integrated Social Services (ISS) offices under the project's first component, and introduce
                         several new activities under the labor and pensions components. The team received a proposed list of new activities on October 4 in order to provide an informal opinion. It has been
                         agreed that: (i) the project counterparts will provide additional information on several activities which need further elaboration by October 11, and the team would respond to the
                         Government by October 14; (ii) the Minister of Labor and Social Issues will inform the Bank in writing of the proposed new activities by October 25, based on which the team will
                         process a Level-Two restructuring.

                         On Disbursement: Loan disbursement rate is has increased from only 4.25% to 9% in early October. The team expects disbursement to pick up in the coming months with expected
                         contracting of civil works for renovation of ISS offices.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is financed by two separate credits/loans: the original credit in the amount of US$5.15 million and the additional financing loan in the amount of US$5 million. The original
                         loan has disbursed 100% and the Additional Financing disbursement reached 9.1%. The project shows significant progress towards its development objectives and the latest project
                         monitoring and evaluation report shows that the targets for the majority of PDO indicators have been met or exceeded. The Prime Minister Office's review of TA activities under the
                         project, coupled with the Government's decision to finance the development of the personified recordkeeping software with the state budget in order to meet the January 1, 2013
                         deadline for the introduction of personified record-keeping, resulted in the proposal to remove from the Procurement Plan a number of activities originally envisioned to be financed
                         under the loan and have them financed through different sources.
