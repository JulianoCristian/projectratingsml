F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document, Page1
The development objective is improved performance (efficiency, effectiveness, quality) by
the labor and public employment, pension and social assistance agencies in providing
services to the population. 1

Revised Project Development Objectives
(as approved by original approving authority) 2
The development objective is to improve performance (efficiency, effectiveness, quality) by
public employment, pension and social assistance agencies in providing services to the
population.

  Page 5 of the PAD gives a slightly different version of the PDO: “The development objective is improved performance
(efficiency, effectiveness, quality) by the public employment, pension and social assistance agencies in providing services
to the population.” In the IDA DCA, yet another wording appears (p. 13): “the objectives of the Project are to improve the
Borrower's capacity to provide a more efficient and sustainable system of labor and public employment, pension and social
assistance to enhance social protection to poor and vulnerable population groups”

2
    AF PP (p. 4) and AF IBRD Loan Agreement (p. 4) provide a consistent wording of the PDO

  No target values were set at the time of the initial project (Phase 1) for the PDO level indicators, target values were only
set in the AF Project Paper
4
  The first PDO indicator “evidence of eligible beneficiaries receiving accurate and timely pensions and social assistance”
(Supplementary Letter Two to the Development Credit Agreement) was composite. For clarity it has been broken down
into four indicators, since each result was tracked separately.
5
  This outcome indicator has not been set as part of the PDO or Component level indicators in the PAD or the AF PP. It
was given as an example (in fact the only example) in the “Economic and Financial Analysis” of the PAD (Annex 9, p. 44)
for the type of measurable improvements the project would achieve. It is for this reason, that the indicator is included on
this level.
6
  This indicator was not included in the Project’s Results Framework, but has been included to show improvements in job
placement for youth.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of Appraisal of the Social Protection Administration Project (SPAP, the
Project) in 2004, Armenia had witnessed several years of fast and increasing macroeconomic
growth. In 2003, the GDP growth rate reached 13.9 percent compared with 12.9 percent in 2002.
Successful stabilization policies, since the mid-1990s, coupled with significant advances in
structural policies aimed consistently at growth promotion, job creation and public management
of resources had taken place. Nevertheless, Government’s reforms and resulting economic
growth had not led to significant social achievements. About 48 percent of the population
remained below the poverty line, and poverty remained a key development issue in Armenia.
Economic risk remained a major feature of life, indicating the need for a strong formal social
protection system to help households manage risk.

2.      Although relatively well targeted, Armenia’s social protection system existing at the time
of Appraisal was modest. Its main components were a labor pension and a last resort social
assistance program (the Family Benefit Program, FBP). Benefits were low, but nonetheless an
important source of family income, particularly for low-income families. Annual budget spending
on the benefits averaged 4.8 percent of GDP.

3.      The Government of Armenia (GOA, the Government) had prepared, together with civil
society partners, and approved a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2003. The PRSP
was a comprehensive program that recognized the priority of ensuring sustainable growth,
increased employment, productivity and incomes as a means of promoting poverty reduction. At
the same time, the PRSP highlighted the need for putting in place an efficient social protection
system that could provide meaningful protection to the poor and most vulnerable groups.

4.       Faced with severely constrained pension revenues and fiscal resources that limited the
scope to increase benefit levels, the GOA was pursuing a strategy aimed at increasing the
efficiency in the use of program resources that would then allow it to increase benefit levels and
ensure that the most needy individuals and households were supported. Better results with
poverty reduction were also constrained by weaknesses in social protection administration,
including: (i) lack of coherence and coordination in the performance of tasks; (ii) lack of a
comprehensive approach in business planning and control; (iii) administrative procedures and
rules that were not systematically scrutinized, streamlined and rationalized; (iv) no clear
distinction between management processes and operational processes; (v) operations offices were
not managed by coherent and integral management concepts; ad hoc management was more
regular than exceptional; (vi) modern principles of human resource management and
development were not fully applied; (vii) lack of training of staff members in information
communications and technology (ICT) applications; (viii) no clear unified approach for
addressing the deficiencies in the operations of local offices; (xi) lack of management information
systems; (x) cost accounting did not comply with International Accounting Standards (IAS); and
(xi) budget preparation and implementation procedures were inefficient.

5.      The GOA was planning to carry out a range of actions aimed at increasing efficiency,
effectiveness and sustainability of its social protection programs. For social assistance, priorities
included: (i) use of the family benefit program to reduce poverty among the most vulnerable
people through substantial enhancement of targeting towards extremely poor households and by



                                                 1
ensuring that their consumption levels were not below the food poverty line; and (ii) providing
high quality targeted services to categories of population in need of special protection, such as
handicapped persons, orphans, refugees and displaced people in view of substantially meeting
demands for such services. For social insurance, priorities included: (i) reducing the number
poor pensioners and increasing pension rates to bring them above the general poverty line, rating
pensions on the basis of pension investments and period of employment; and (ii) comprehensive
reform of the mandatory social insurance system, including enhancing its efficiency, substantial
review of principles of appointing pensions and ensuring financial stability and sustainability of
the system. For employment policies, the priority was to replace the inefficient policies of
unemployment insurance and transition to active employment policies.

6.       The Rationale for World Bank involvement with the Project was strong. Modernization
of social protection administration was an important priority for Armenia, and the World Bank
was uniquely placed to support the GOA in its efforts with IDA resources. The implementation
of Armenia’s social reform program (including the PRSP) required strong administrative
capacities both at the central and local government levels. The World Bank had extensive
international experience in supporting social protection reforms, coupled with a strong
understanding of the social protection system in Armenia that was developed through an
extensive dialogue with the authorities on poverty and social protection. The GOA counted on
significant donor support for the implementation of social protection reforms, but that support
often focused on individual institutions, without taking a systemic approach to social protection
administration. The Project was designed to add value to then ongoing donor activities by
supporting the development of the cross institution management systems and by addressing
management information system development needs in key social protections institutions such as
the Ministry of Labor and Social Issues (MLSI), the State Social Insurance Fund (SSIF), the State
Employment Services Agency (SESA), as well as their regional bodies. The development of a
nation-wide social protection information system was expected to act as a catalyst for further
reforms aimed at improvements of social services delivery. The Project was expected to serve as
an umbrella facility for other donor support.

7.       The SPAP was fully aligned with the Government’s PRSP 7, and with the World Bank’s
2005-2008 Country Assistance Strategy for Armenia. 8 . Specifically, the Project’s objectives
align with two of the PRSP’s five themes defined as priority areas of action, including: (i)
enhancing human development and improving social safety nets; and (ii) improving core public
sector functions. The PRSP recognized social insurance and social assistance as key elements of
the poverty reduction framework. Targeted cash family poverty benefits—one of the then most
successful poverty alleviation programs in the region—were a major pillar of Armenia’s safety
net. The PRSP envisaged several measures aimed at further improving the administration of
those benefits, including better monitoring and evaluation (M&E), more streamlined appeal
procedures, and a more active role for territorial centers in providing social assistance that
reached out to the poorest. For social insurance, the PRSP focused on completing the
introduction of individual contribution records in the pension system, better collection of social
insurance contributions and an increase in pensions. In the area of employment, the PRSP
focused on the increase of employment as the most socially acceptable and economically efficient

means of poverty reduction, as well as on increased efficiency of employment programs and
services. The World Bank’s CAS, based on the PRSP, highlighted the following objectives in the
area of social protection: (i) reduce poverty primarily through private sector growth; (ii) reduce
inequalities of consumption and access to services; and (iii) improve human capital by ensuring
that Armenians have skills and health to take advantage of employment opportunities. The
project aimed to address one of the “principal problems” addressed in the CAS (“improvement of
the administration of social protection”)

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.      The SPAP’s Development Objective was improved performance (efficiency,
effectiveness, quality) by the labor and public employment, pension and social assistance
agencies in providing services to the population.9

9.      The Key Indicators identified to measure progress towards achieving project outcomes
were the following: 10

     •   Evidence of eligible beneficiaries receiving accurate and timely pensions and social
         assistance payments;
     •   Evidence of improved job placement, especially among the disabled and young workers;
     •   Evidence of improved user satisfaction regarding service delivery related to pensions,
         employment services and social assistance

10.    Output indicators for the main project components were also defined in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). These are presented in Annex 10.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification


11.     The Additional Financing (AF) approved on February 25, 2010 (Section 1.7) did not
modify the SPAP’s PDO fundamentally. However, the PDO defined in the Development Credit
Agreement was revised under the AF, as well as in the Loan Agreement for the AF, to make it
consistent with the wording in the original PAD approved by the World Bank’s Board: “The
development objective is to improve performance (efficiency, effectiveness, quality) by public
employment, pension and social assistance agencies in providing services to the population.”




9
  This was the PDO as described in the PAD (p. 4). The Credit Agreement (p. 13) has a slightly revised wording: “The
objectives of the Project are to improve the Borrower’s capacity to provide a more efficient and sustainable system of
labor and public employment, pension and social assistance to enhance social protection to poor and vulnerable
population groups. The wording in the Credit Agreement was revised under the AF to make both consistent (Section
1.3).
10
   An additional indicator (“Improved collections in the pension system”) was included in one annex of the PAD
documents (Annex 3 of the 2004 PAD), but neither the Development Credit Agreement, nor Section 2 or the Table
(Results Framework and Monitoring) in Annex 3 of the Project Appraisal Document include this as a Key Outcome
Indicator. This indicator is, however, included as an Intermediate Outcome under Component 3, which is its most
appropriate location given the overall project context.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

12.      Three groups of beneficiaries can be discerned for the project activities of SPAP. On the
first level, the projects activities aimed to benefit the: (i) institutions of the social protection
sector in Armenia. Across the components of the Project, the technical capacity equipment and
physical infrastructure of MLSI, SESA and SSSS has been strengthened. In addition, the creation
of new institutions has been supported, such as the Integrated Social Service Centers. Secondly,
the project benefited the (ii) experts and front-line staff in the social protection agencies through
professional development (e.g. social worker professional standards), study tours and capacity
building. Lastly, the Project benefited the (iii) beneficiaries of the social protection programs,
through improved and more accurate payment (a key outcome indicator of the results framework),
better accessibility and reduced hassle-cost through integrated service centers (not measured in
results framework) and better services in the respective specialized agencies.

1.5 Original Components (as approved) 11

13.     The SPAP comprised five components, which would finance small works (refurbishment
and minor repair) and provision of equipment, materials, technical assistance and training, as
follows:

Component 1: General Support to the Social Protection Sector (US$ 4.26m Total Project
Cost, including contingencies and US$ 1.76m IDA Financing)

14.      This component would help develop a comprehensive management information system
(MIS) for the creation, acquisition, storage, maintenance and exchange of digital information
required for the operation of an effective social protection system. The component included four
sub-components: (i) development of a communications network for transmission of information
between and within the different social protection programs and training specialists on the
maintenance of the network; (ii) the establishment of a related technology platform; (iii) review
of existing MLSI programs for adaptation to the new network structure; and (iv) upgrading the
existing programs operated by MLSI offices and related agencies, integrating them into the
national information network, and training staff on their use.

Component 2: Improving Labor and Employment (US$ 1.59m Total Project Cost, including
contingencies and US$ 1.24m IDA Financing)

15.      This component would help to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the SESA in labor
market intermediation and support labor reform in the country. The component included the
following four sub-components: (i) development of a MIS that would form part of the national
information network (Component 1); (ii) introduction of labor market monitoring and piloting a
series of programs including new programs to improve the employment processes in selected
local employment services; (iii) establishment of a training, advisory and job rehabilitation center
for disabled unemployed; and (iv) establishment of a professional orientation center for youth on
a pilot basis. It would also provide assistance to MLSI for the implementation of the Labor Code,
once adopted.




11
     All financial information as given in Annex 1



                                                     4
Component 3: Modernization of Pensions System Administration (US$ 2.46m Total Project
Cost, including contingencies and US$ 1.20 IDA Financing)

16.     This component aimed to create a modern pension administration. It included the
following sub-components: (i) operational improvements in key business processes—
contributions collections and revenue/expenditure monitoring, audit/inspection, pension
management and customer services; and (ii) strengthening of the institutional capacity of SSIF,
including general and financial management and actuarial forecasting. Improvements in these
areas were expected to be underpinned by (iii) installation of a central register-related system
based on a client data-base of individual records (a central register) containing pertinent
information on all insurance system clients.

Component 4: Improvement of Social Assistance (US$ 0.94m Total Project Cost, including
contingencies and US$ 0.67m IDA Financing)

17.     This component would help to improve poverty targeting by supporting community-
focused household surveys and developing in-depth monitoring and evaluation of the
effectiveness of poverty targeting. The Project would support improvement of poverty targeting
mechanisms through: (i) conducting community surveys; (ii) developing capacity for in-depth
monitoring and evaluation of the efficiency of targeting; (iii) upgrading equipment used to target
family poverty benefits; and (iv) providing training to social assistance staff.

Component 5: Project Management (US$ 0.82m Total Project Cost, including contingencies
and US$ 0.50m IDA Financing)

18.     This component would ensure professional implementation of the Project by using
appropriate mechanisms of project management, and proper tools of project monitoring and
evaluation.

19.     A detailed description of the original Project’s components is provided in Annex 2.


1.6 Revised Components

20.       The Project’s original components were not revised, although several activities were
incorporated and/or eliminated under the components under the AF, and the sources of funding of
some activities were modified (Section 1.7). Subsequently, during the MTR in June and July
2012, the MLSI informed the World Bank that it intended to cancel three activities under
Component 2, namely: (i) refurbishment, equipping and training of staff of a regional office of
“Youth Professional Orientation Center” (activities for the Yerevan office had been completed);
(ii) further modernization of the information system of the SESA; and (iii) improvement of the
information system of the State Labor Inspectorate. The first activity was cancelled due to
institutional policy changes amid the new ISSC concept, in accordance with which this Center
would be transformed into the methodical center for youth professional orientation (Section 3.2).
The latter two were put on hold, and therefore eliminated from the Project, until the development
of new strategies for the employment services and labor inspection had been completed. These
and other changes did not lead to a restricting of the project because the overall PDO remained
relevant.

1.7 Other significant changes
21.     On October 23, 2007, Schedule 1 to the Credit Agreement was amended and the Credit’s
original December 31, 2007 Closing Date was extended by 18 months to June 30, 2009. The
amendment to Schedule 1merged categories of disbursements (except for Category 4 “Training
and Study Tours”) into one disbursement category, and reallocated remaining funds into the new,
single category.      The amendment was expected to provide an opportunity for faster
implementation of the remaining project activities, as well as to effectively utilize project savings
gained because of US dollar depreciation and to partially cover the shortage of funds for civil
works financing that arose because of the dramatic increase of prices for rehabilitation works and
construction materials. The Closing Date extension would help to achieve fully the PDO,
especially as it related to the establishment of the MIS for Armenia’s social protection sector,
which was still in process of design completion and equipment procurement. Also, it would
allow the World Bank to continue providing advice and technical assistance to the GOA on the
future role and functions of the SSIF, for which discussions were ongoing at the time and a
decision by the GOA was expected in late 2007. As such, the Closing Date extension was seen as
important to the success of Armenia’s plans for pension reform.

22.     On December 16, 2008, the Closing Date was again extended, this time for six months,
until December 31, 2009, to provide continuing support to the MIS for social protection and to
the MLSI, also for developing and improving its information system.

23.      A third, five-month Closing Date extension of the Credit Agreement, until May 31, 2010,
was approved on October 1, 2009. This extension was approved to ensure continuity and
successful completion of then ongoing activities while at the same time allow sufficient time for
the GOA and World Bank teams to prepare an Additional Financing (AF) that would scale up the
Project.

24.      A World Bank Loan for AF in the amount of US$5.0 million was approved on February
25, 2010. 12 The AF extended the May 31, 2010 Closing Date by three years to May 31, 2013. It
aimed to help the GOA enhance the sustainability, impact and development effectiveness of the
original, then ongoing, Project, and continue with institutional capacity building for efficient and
effective social service delivery for the population. The AF was to scale-up activities under the
Project in support of its original development objective. The GOA’s Second PRSP (also known
as the Sustainable Development Program), approved in 2008, reaffirmed its commitment to
poverty reduction, and the need for an efficient social protection system that would protect
Armenia’s poor and vulnerable populations. The reforms under the Project had led to significant
achievements, but gaps in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the social protection
administration remained. The global economic crisis had presented additional challenges to the
GOA, especially in terms of mitigating the consequent economic and social impacts, and laying
the foundations for an efficient and effective post-crisis social protection system assumed
increased importance. The fiscal constraints resulting from the crisis added impetus for reforming
the pension system, enhancing the efficacy of social assistance programs, integrating social
services and strengthening systems for monitoring and evaluation.

25.     Although the PDO remained the same, some of the approaches and institutions involved
in implementing the Project under the AF were modified. Since approval of the SPAP, the GOA

                                                         6
had moved towards a unified revenue collection system for pension contributions and income
taxes. The new State Revenue Committee (SRC) was charged with managing this unified
revenue collection system. A more efficient, unified and user-friendly administration of revenue
collection and reporting for personal income taxes, pensions and other social insurance
contributions was expected to improve tax compliance and state revenue. The AF would support
the SRC by improving its personified reporting and record-keeping system under Component 3.

26.      With respect to implementation arrangements, at the beginning of 2008 the GOA
transformed its SSIF into the State Social Security Services (SSSS) under the auspices of the
MLSI. Although the main functions of the agency were essentially unchanged (i.e., effective
implementation of the state social protection programs), social insurance contributions had
become a revenue source of the central budget. Consequently, all social protection programs
were now financed from the Government budget, a shift that was expected to result in greater
consistency in social protection policy formulation and implementation. The changes in the
governance structure of social protection were expected to help improve efficiency and quality of
service delivery through a more efficient organization of work, strengthened information base and
improved accountability and transparency in service delivery. The transformation of all local
social protection offices into Integrated Social Services Centers (ISSCs) or “one-stop-shops”,
supported by a corporate network of information flows for the social protection sector, was
central to this new model.

27.      The AF incorporated new activities intended to deepen the Project’s sustainability
and development impact. Several outstanding activities that were considered essential for
further improving and maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of the social service delivery
system were included under the Project, including those directed towards: (i) rehabilitating the
remaining regional social service offices; (ii) ensuring the sustainability and widespread use of
the network of information flows; (iii) introducing personified reporting and record-keeping for
pensions, other social insurance and unified income taxes; (iv) addressing the institutional and
reform bottlenecks for rural employment; (v) improving the coverage and administration of the
Family Benefit Program; and (vi) integrating social service delivery. New output indicators were
added to its Results Framework to monitor progress with these activities (Annex 10 highlights the
new indicators).

28.     Then, in late 2011, the GOA requested that several of the activities described above
incorporated under Components 2, 3 and 4 of the Project be financed under the State Budget
instead of Loan financing (Section 2.2). In a Level 2 restructuring, the corresponding funds were
reallocated towards the integration of social services at the local level through ISSCs in the
crosscutting Component 1. Although this reallocation was fully consistent with the PDO, the
Project’s Results Framework was not restructured to eliminate output indicators that were no
longer supported by activities financed. On April 6, 2012, the World Bank approved the
requested reallocation of loan proceeds, reallocating US$545,000 from Category 2 (Goods,
Consultants’ Services and Training for Component 3 of the Project) to Category 1 (Goods, Works,
Consultants’ Services, Incremental Operating Costs and Training for Components 1, 2, 4 and 5 of
the Project).

29.     On June 24, 2013, the amount of SDR 2,509.59 remaining undisbursed in the Credit
account was cancelled effective May 31, 2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

30.      Project preparation was expeditious and responsive to the GOA’s request for assistance to
support its social reform program (including the PRSP). A SIL was selected as the most
appropriate instrument in support of institutional strengthening and related investments.
Although this was the first social protection project supported by the World Bank in Armenia, the
preparation team incorporated lessons from similar projects in other countries in its design.
According to the PAD, stakeholders (the GOA through the MLSI, the SESA and the SSIF) were
full partners in developing the Project, and beneficiary consultations were taken into account in
its design, based on: (i) findings of then recent poverty assessments; (ii) periodic social
assessments of local governments and communities carried out by the Armenia Social Investment
Fund; (iii) rapid assessments of pensioners and families with children; and (iv) NGO and donor
forums.

31.      Preparation (of both the Project and the AF) identified four main risks: not effectively
applying the MIS, shortages in counterpart funding, weak government commitment, and
ineffective coordination between the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in MLSI and the Foreign
Financing Projects Management Center (FFPMC) of the Ministry of Finance and Economy
(MOFE).

32.      Preparation of the AF took into consideration experience with implementation of the
Project, new macroeconomic realities that the GOA faced and several reforms that it had put in
place since the Project’s approval that impacted implementation and other arrangements. In spite
of this, and with the benefit of hindsight, several aspects of the Project’s design impacted its
implementation. These included: complexity and lack of flexibility, and the formulation of its
Results Framework.

33.      The Project was undoubtedly complex and ambitious. With multiple agencies
implementing separate and inter-related components, including development of information
systems and improvements to monitoring and evaluation (which are notoriously complex), its
initial three and one-half year planned implementation was overly ambitious. The use of the
FFPMC to support project administration by these agencies was positive, but could not substitute
for actual implementation of the Project by each of the responsible agencies in view of the fact
that this was fundamentally an institution strengthening project. The fact that the Project was
implemented during a period where the GOA was continuously implementing reforms to its
system of social protection, that on occasion impacted its implementation arrangements directly,
only compounded its complexity. Perhaps a greater propensity to adjust the results framework of
the Project and its components might have mitigated the impact of this constantly evolving
environment, which had implications for the Project’s Results Framework, both as originally
approved and amended in AF’s Project Paper.

34.     The definition of the Project’s Results Framework, both at Appraisal and during
processing of the AF presented several issues. PDO indicators defined in the PAD and
maintained for the AF measured user satisfaction and share of pension and social assistance
beneficiaries receiving payments timely and fully, which were not dependent only on the
components’ activities. Several baselines were not provided in the PAD--they were only
provided after the first year of implementation. When the AF was approved, the PDOs as defined
in the PAD, as measured by the Key Outcome Indicators, had largely been achieved; the
percentage of satisfied pensioners and beneficiaries had jumped from around 20% to 80%, in part


                                                8
due to an increase in the size of payment (not related to service delivery). Other PDO indicators
originally introduced in the PAD and retained in the PP for the AF were problematic (Section 2.3).

2.2 Implementation

35.     The Project’s implementation was impacted by several factors that in large part resulted
in the processing of the AF and then the Level 2 restructuring described in Sections 1.6 and 1.7.
These factors included the framing of the Project within a comprehensive program of World Bank
assistance and the GOA’s continued commitment to reform of its social protection sector, the
global financial and economic crisis, the resulting changes to the Project and its implementation
arrangements.

36.      The Project was the World Bank’s first in support of Armenia’s social protection sector,
but it built upon an extensive dialogue on poverty and social protection that had begun in the
preparation of the country’s PRSPs in the early 2000s, developed over the years, and was
implemented in a program of World Bank assistance that emerged over time. On a broader level,
through a series of four PRSCs starting in 2004 13 , the World Bank supported policy and
institutional reforms for implementation of the GOA’s PRSP that included, inter alia,
improvements in the coverage and targeting of the FBP and the development and implementation
of foundations for a new multi-pillar pension system. Starting in 2009, a programmatic series of
three Development Policy Operations (DPOs) supported the GOA’s reform program in
addressing vulnerability by protecting the poor in face of the global crisis (see below), and
strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of social nets. 14 Specifically, the DPOs aimed to
contribute to improved social outcomes in the face of the economic slowdown by maintaining
social safety net spending and (further) improving the targeting and coverage of the FBP program.
However, the Implementation Completion and Results Report for the DPO series reports that the
outcome targets were not met although some progress was made. 15 Analytical work also
supported the dialogue with the GOA on social protection. This included: poverty and social
assessments, economic reports and programmatic public expenditure reviews that focused, inter
alia, on the efficiency of social protection programs. Finally, the World Bank also assisted in
mobilizing grant funding in specific areas that complement activities supported by the Project.
These include a US$430,000 IDF Grant for Pension Public Awareness and Literacy in Armenia:
Building MLSI Capacity, to create capacity (i.e., pension internet portal, pension telephone
hotline, equipped pension reform trainers) to inform, educate, and familiarize broad public with
pension reform process in Armenia, signed by World Bank on January 15, 2013, and a US$2.7
million JSDF Grant for Strengthening the Livelihoods and Voice of Vulnerable and Disabled
Persons in Armenia, approved in early 2013.

37.      Armenia was one of the countries hardest hit by the 2008-09 global economic crisis. Its
economy contracted by over 14 percent in 2009, exposing weaknesses in the policy and
institutional spheres, and disrupting the earlier momentum in poverty reduction that had resulted
in a decline from 56 percent to 23.5 percent in poverty incidence between 1999 and 2008. For the
first time since the late 1990s, poverty incidence increased in 2009 by an estimated three
percentage points 16. The GOA responded aiming to mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis on
the poor and vulnerable, with measures that included protection of public spending on social
safety net programs, re-prioritization of government expenditures towards programs that
protected or created jobs in the short term, and improvements in the targeting of the FBP,
although as mentioned above, these were not entirely successful.

38.      The crisis introduced greater urgency for defining and securing approval of reforms
aimed at further strengthening its social protection programs, and increasing the efficiency of
government expenditures for those programs. The reforms designed and approved since that time
include: a comprehensive pension reform (including modified institutional framework for
revenue collections, etc.), a new strategy and approaches for employment, and the adoption of a
new model of integrated social service provision that envisages the functional integration of four
existing agencies (responsible for pensions, social assistance, employment and disability
certification) under one roof in all marzes (“provinces”) across the country. While not all of these
reforms were directly supported by the Project, the fact that they often impacted the Project’s
institutional framework, or the GOA’s priorities for external funding, on occasion led to
implementation delays (pension reform) and the need for a modification of implementation
arrangements (e.g., the inclusion of State Revenue Committee (SRC) in the AF) as described in
section 1.7.

39.     In part precipitated by the above, the Project’s implementation witnessed several
revisions to the activities financed by the World Bank credit and loan. The AF already included
several new or revised activities and implementation arrangements (Section 1.7). Later, less than
one year after approval of the AF in October 2011, the Prime Minister initiated a review of all
World Bank financed technical assistance activities with the aim of rationalizing the many donor-
funded TA activities involving international consultants. TA activities that were to be financed
under loans required specific approval from the Prime Minister’s office. Further, the timing of
the GOA’s constantly evolving reform agenda precipitated the need to move ahead expeditiously
with activities in support of some reforms (such as pension modernization under Component 3)
with more agility than would have been possible following World Bank requirements, while it put
on hold the implementation of activities under other Components (such as those focused on labor
and employment under Component 2) as new strategies and approaches that were then under
development, and that would impact the need for project activities, took longer than expected to
materialize. In view of the above, a large portion of the TA activities under the social assistance,
pensions and labor components was eliminated from the Project to be financed under the State
Budget. At that stage, funds were reallocated towards integration of social services
(encompassing social assistance, pensions and employment services) at the local level through
expansion of ISSCs in a pilot phase under the cross cutting component. This activity was
considered fully consistent with the PDO. However, the Project was not restructured to amend the
Results Framework, and activities financed by the World Bank became more oriented towards
provision of infrastructure, that involved a need for closer supervision through rolling action

plans that were prepared and agreed to keep implementation on schedule during the Project’s
final years.

40.      Throughout, there was very strong coordination of donor assistance in response to GOA
priorities and funding availability, not only with the GOA in the driver’s seat, but among the
donors themselves as well. This emerges as a very strong point of the Project and goes well
beyond what usually could be described as “donor coordination” but could be classified as an
integrated partnership network of donors with GOA/MLSI at the center. This view was strongly
endorsed by the Minister of Labor during the ICR interview. In no instance did the ICR team
encounter any indication of turf-wars, duplication of activities etc. between the main partners
World Bank, USAID and UNICEF. On the contrary, throughout the Project, the main
protagonists in the named agencies continuously updated and aligned their work programs,
decided on appropriate division of labor and executed accordingly in partnership with MLSI.

41.      The review of TA activities in 2011 described above is an example of the leadership in
coordination by the GOA. At the time, the GOA required a review of all loan-financed TA
activities, leading to a partial halt of TA in some of the World Bank-financed projects. While this
caused initial inconvenience for project execution, it emerged as a constructive checkpoint to
avoid duplication of TA activities between line agencies. The collaboration of UNICEF and
USAID on the evaluation of the ISSC pilots and the proposed continued financing of the PCU in
MLSI by USAID (during the transition period until the proposed World Bank financing of
SPAP2 is approved) are other examples of coordination among donors. Additional instances of
donor coordination and financing of GOA social protection programs and the Project are
described in Section 3.2.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

42.     The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) specified that monitoring and evaluation of
outcomes/results would be based on data generated by qualitative surveys to be carried out by
MLSI, SSIF (later SSSS) and SESA on the impact of project interventions on beneficiary
populations, and that staff of these agencies at headquarters and in local offices would be trained
in the application of monitoring and evaluation techniques and the adaptation of policy and
programs strategies to their findings. A consulting company on behalf of the Project
Implementation Unit in MLSI produced comprehensive annual M&E Reports. This company
also conducted the beneficiary assessments used to monitor progress towards the Project’s Key
PDO Indicators.

43.     Monitoring of the Project’s outcomes and outputs presented several challenges. The
outcome indicators as originally defined were composite indicators (e.g., “eligible beneficiaries
receiving accurate and timely pensions and social assistance payments” 17), which were then split
and tracked separately in the AF. Baselines and targets for each of the Key Indicators (Section 1.2,
Annex 10) were not specified in the PAD; baselines were introduced in the first year of
implementation. Further, it is not clear that progress towards the outcomes, as defined by the
indicators, would be attributable solely to activities supported by the Project.

44.      The Project Paper (PP) for the Additional Financing maintained the outcome indicators
defined in the PAD, but included additional output indicators under each of the components to
reflect progress of activities directly attributable to the additional financing.

45.      The revisions in activities financed under the Project throughout 2011 (Section 2.2)
presented a further challenge to monitoring of the Project’s outcomes and outputs. With the
removal of several activities from the Project, World Bank financing was reallocated towards the
integration of social services at the local level under Component 1, an activity that was fully
consistent with the SPAP’s PDO. However, the Project’s Results Framework was not amended
to reflect the new reality. As a result, several Intermediate Outcome Indicators were no longer
supported by the Project’s activities and were no longer monitored. Several new Intermediate
Outcome Indicators began to be monitored, yet the World Bank’s team opted to not restructure
the Project’s Results Framework in view of the limited time remaining until closing, since
apparently the team felt that this would take time and resources away from the critical project
implementation activities remaining to be completed.

46.      The first outcome indicator states that it is tracking the share of "eligible" pension or
social assistance beneficiaries receiving their benefits "timely and fully." Since the PDO aims to
improve efficiency, effectiveness and quality of agencies in providing services, this was
interpreted by the team and counterparts as an indicator to track improvements in service delivery
to those pension or social assistance beneficiaries actually receiving benefits. However, the
indicator could be interpreted as aspiring to capture both the improvement in the agencies'
performance in delivering services for actual beneficiaries and the reduction in the gap between
eligible and actual beneficiaries - i.e. improving coverage of the pension and social assistance
programs. A few activities under the social assistance component could have contributed in a
minor way to increasing coverage of the Family Benefit Program (reducing application
documentation burden, increasing cross-checks to reduce inclusion errors, and communications
campaigns), but the Government of Armenia has been clear that it does not aim to give Family
Benefits to all poor (as defined by the World Bank) but rather only to the most vulnerable among
them. Hence, both the team and counterparts were using the outcome indicators to track service
delivery as a contribution towards the PDO and the project is being assessed using this
interpretation in this ICR. Furthermore, tracking an outcome related to 'eligible' beneficiaries
would have been nearly impossible, because the identification of the eligible who are not covered
is constrained by data availability. In fact, the eligibility criteria for social assistance in Armenia
is complex (see p.23 below), as it depends on multiple factors beyond income, which the national
household survey does not monitor. Such an interpretation of the indicators was not intended
under this project.

47.     There were other issues with respect to the selection of indicators and targets, once these
were established. Progress towards outcome indicators was tracked with a very small sample of
beneficiary surveys (quantitative, with a sample size of about 400), while tracking of other
indicators was based on official documents with no reference to beneficiaries. The values of
several indicators jumped after the second year, and continued to climb, even though there had
been few, if any, completed project activities to support continued increases (in user satisfaction).
This may, in part, reflect factors exogenous to the Project that impacted improvements in some
indicators. For example, the percentage of satisfied pensioners and beneficiaries jumped from
around 20 percent in 2005 to 97 percent in 2011, most likely due to an increase in the size of the
payment as opposed to a result of improved service delivery.




                                                  12
48.       At the time the AF was approved, the Project’s expected outcomes had largely been met.
While some target values were increased a bit, no new outcome indicators were added. As a
result, it was not clear how, for example, user satisfaction with social services, already at almost
100 percent, could be increased by additional project activities. Other indicators presented
similar issues, for example, the intermediate outcome “number of complaints that receive a
positive resolution” that was already 100 percent at baseline and not supported by any activities
financed under the Project. In other cases, the indicators served to monitor pure outputs (like
number of people trained), in spite of the availability of a monitoring system capable of tracking
outcomes (young people placed in jobs).


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

49.     Fiduciary (Procurement and Financial Management) functions were implemented by the
Foreign Financing Projects Management Center (FFPMC) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), in
coordination with the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the MLSI. Created in 1993 and charged
with similar functions for numerous projects funded by IDA Credits and a variety of trust funds,
the FFPMC had solid experience in managing the fiduciary aspects of World Bank-financed
projects in accordance with the World Bank’s procurement guidelines and financial management
requirements.

50.      The World Bank’s implementation support teams carried out procurement post reviews
periodically and findings were generally positive. Recommendations were mostly of a procedural
nature (e.g., use of Standard Bidding Documents for Non-Consulting Services for the
procurement of the internet portal for the SSSS instead of the Standard Bidding Documents for
the supply and installation of information systems, the fact that procurement issues on post
review contracts need not be sent to the World Bank for review and no objection, etc.). Delays in
procurement were mostly the result of broader delays in adopting key decisions (e.g., adoption of
the ISSC model, transfer of ownership of buildings for ISSCs, etc.) or the result of changing
priorities for World Bank financing that resulted in numerous adjustments to the Project’s
procurement plans.

51.     The Project’s financial management arrangements and requirements (including flow of
funds, staffing, accounting, planning and budgeting, reporting and auditing) were also reviewed
periodically through implementation support, and found to be highly satisfactory throughout.
Sound internal control procedures were in place throughout implementation, and audit reports
were received in a timely manner, with unqualified auditors’ opinions on the Project’s financial
statements. Towards the end of implementation FFPMC shifted effectively to the World Bank’s
E-disbursement system of disbursements.

52.     Although the Project included minor civil works for the refurbishment and rehabilitation
of buildings, no significant environmental impacts were expected; as a result, the Project and the
AF was classified as an environmental Category C and none of the World Bank’s Safeguard
Policies were triggered, owing to the mainly refurbishment nature of the work in existing
buildings.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

53.      The GOA remains fully committed to the Project’s PDOs and to sustain the reforms and
institutional capacity that it supported, both with and without World Bank financing. The GOA
has requested a follow-up project that would continue supporting the reforms initiated under the


                                                13
SPAP. A follow-up project has been included in the World Bank’s CPS, and a Concept Review
was held on September 12, 2013. The objectives of the proposed project would be to: (i) improve
efficiency of social protection service delivery for social protection beneficiaries and (ii)
strengthen analytical and monitoring and evaluation functions of the agencies delivering social
protection benefits and services. Based on the experience under the SPAP, the follow-on project
would roll out the model of integrated delivery of pensions, social assistance, employment and
disability certification through functional integration within the Integrated Social Service Centers
(ISSC), now called Integrated Social Protection Centers (ISPC) from 19 ISPCs piloted so far to
an additional 37 ISPCs, effectively providing this service model across the country. The
proposed project would also provide continuing support for: (i) implementation of the new
employment strategy, including the building of nationwide career orientation service,
strengthening SESA’s capacity, piloting of one or more active labor market policies, and
evaluating the impact of new employment programs. It would also provide continuing assistance
to SSSS in improving its core business processes. Specifically, this assistance would focus on
strengthening SSSS’ technical capacity through completing its electronic document management
system, intranet and internet services, building analytical, forecasting, and statistics capacity
supporting the MLSI policymaking activities, introduction of the risk-based supervision of
insured individuals’ statuses and providing information to the insured individuals on covered
service periods on a 24/7 basis. Finally, the proposed project would support the strengthening of
MLSI’s analytical capacity and monitoring and evaluation, and developing an integrated system
of monitoring and evaluation of social protection benefits and services.

54.     Further support to FBP, especially insofar as identifying possible reform options aimed at
expanding the coverage of the poor and further improving targeting efficiency, would be provided
under the World Bank’s planned Armenia Development Policy Operation (DPO) and the ongoing
Social Inclusion and Labor Knowledge for Reforms, Operations and Advancing Dialogue
Technical Assistance. During the design phase of the DPO, it was expected that the number of
beneficiary households would reach 104,000 by May, 2015, and reflecting the GOA’s
commitment, this target has already been met.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

55.      The Project’s objective was relevant when it was approved, and its relevance increased
throughout implementation. The GOA was committed to the SPAP’s PDOs when it was
approved, and increased its commitment to these objectives in the aftermath of the global
financial crisis that, in view of the severe contraction in the economy, resulted in a jump in
poverty incidence (from 28 percent in 2008 to 36 percent in 2011). This commitment, and the
priority the GOA assigns to the Project’s objectives, is reflected in the “Armenia Sustainable
Development Strategy 2025”. 18 In that document, the overarching objectives are defined as
creating jobs, enhancing human capital, improving social protection and modernizing the public
administration and governance. These are all, directly or indirectly, objectives supported by the
Project’s PDO.

56.    The Project is also consistent with the World Bank’s draft Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for FY14-17 that focuses on the integrated social protection service reform while also

                                                      14
supporting the GOA’s pension, employment and social assistance reform agenda. Within the
draft CPS’ second cluster—improving efficiency and equity in social services—the draft CPS
supports selected elements of the GOA’s programs aimed at increasing efficiency and equity,
inter alia, in the area of social protection.

57.      The SPAP’s design fit within the context of a program of assistance and was relevant at
Appraisal and approval, but began to lose relevance during implementation in view of the fact
that the GOA pursued an ambitious reform agenda, especially in the area of pensions, and opted
to finance several key activities outside the scope of the Project. This was the result of exogenous
factors, especially the global financial crisis, and the GOA’s commitment to mitigating its effects
on the population. The GOA’s resolve to move ahead with reforms to its system of social
protection increased, and it sought to carry out some of the reforms and activities originally
envisaged under the Project through alternative means. Further, several of the initial activities
financed under Component 3 became somewhat irrelevant, although during the ICR mission the
MLSI highlighted that the experience gained by the staff in the process improved their capacity to
address later the greater challenges they were to face with implementing the pension reform.
Similarly, one could argue that the redefining of the Youth Professional Orientation Center’s
mandate as a methodological center affected the relevance of financing the initial operations and
programs. Nevertheless, the new Professional Orientation Methodological Center (POMC) has
refurbished offices, and through experience gained initially as an orientation center is in a
stronger position to jump-start its new mandate.

58.     The Project increased its relevance during implementation, especially through changes
introduced in the AF and the refocusing of project activities in 2011 that ensured its continued
relevance, albeit not formally reflected in a project restructuring. The AF and the project
modifications (Section 1.7) were timely, and presented appropriate responses towards
maintaining the Project’s continued relevance in the context of an agenda that was moving
forward rapidly to further the Project’s PDO.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


59.     The Achievement of Project Development Objectives, as measured by the defined Key
Outcome Indicators (Table 1), is considered to be Moderately Satisfactory. It is obvious that the
Social Protection sector in Armenia is undergoing a major transformation process, a process that
began in 2004 supported by the Project, and took on added impetus with the economic crisis and
the GOA’s resolve to accelerate this process to protect an increasing number of the population
that came to depend on the system to escape poverty.

60.      The Project had an important role in this process, in part as an investment vehicle that
touched on almost every aspect of social protection, and in part as a catalytic program to organize
some of the reforms of the sector in a more integrated fashion. Together with assistance provided
by other donors, the Project helped address the GOA’s investment priorities in what proved to be
an ever changing agenda. Directly the Project contributed to achieving improved performance
(efficiency, effectiveness, quality) by the public employment, pension and social assistance
agencies in providing services to the population. For instance, the establishment of management
information systems for both social assistance and SESA were important contributions to the



                                                15
modernization of SP administration and service delivery, even if they fell short of the envisaged
“national social information system”. The individual reforms pursued by the Government cannot
be attributed entirely to the Project, also because GOA decided to finance on its own budgetary
resources several of the Project’s original activities. Further, several of the activities supported
by the Project were carried out in the final years of implementation, and their impact on the
achievement of the objectives will likely only materialize in the coming years. Yet, some of
those activities, specifically piloting a model for ISPCs that will now be rolled out throughout the
country, have had a major impact on redefining the model of SP service delivery in Armenia, in a
manner consistent with the Project’s objectives (i.e., improved performance in delivering services
to the population in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and quality). In any event, the Project did
have an important role, together with other World Bank-financed operations including the DPO
series and analytical work, in providing broad support to the GOA’s ambitious social protection
agenda, and to the overall positive results that it has achieved thus far.




61.     While the indicators in the Project’s Results Framework did not prove sufficient to track
the Project’s impact (Section 2.3) the collected intermediate indicators and the M&E system put
in place in MLSI allow to reconstruct actual progress in most areas. These results were achieved
through activities carried out under the Project’s five components, financed both with the original
IDA credit and the AF.

   This outcome indicator has not been set as part of the PDO or Component level indicators in the PAD or the AF PP.
It was given as an example (in fact the only example) in the “Economic and Financial Analysis” of the PAD (Annex 9,
p. 44) for the type of measurable improvements the Project would achieve. It is for this reason, that the indicator is
included on this level.

   This indicator was not included in the Project’s Results Framework, but has been included to show improvements in
job placement for youth.

General Support to the Social Protection Sector
Intermediate Result: Targeting and delivery of social protection services coordinated

62.      The Project contributed to improved coordination in the targeting and delivery of social
protection services, although it did so in a manner that differed from that envisaged when it was
approved. In fact, in part through the AF, the Project’s impact on this intermediate result actually
went beyond what had been expected. Although actual outcomes resulting from increased
coordination are yet to materialize, several outputs supported by the Project are expected to have
a positive impact on these in the future in terms of improved effectiveness, efficiency and quality
of service delivery. These outputs include activities aimed at improving the availability,
accessibility and compatibility of information, improving working conditions, and designing and
introducing a model of integrated social services delivery at the local level.

63.      With respect to improved information flows, the Project financed the development of
social protections corporate information and communication network, including provision of
computer, network and related equipment, complete automation of business processes within the
social protection system, and integrated within an MIS linking central and regional agencies of
social protection sector, the majority under WEB technologies, and training of users of systems to
operate software and information systems. The original proposal for establishing a CNIF
(Corporate Network of Information Flows), based on broad band system of interconnectivity,
became a bottleneck, in part because of evolving technology that eventually resulted in dropping
this activity from the Project and moving towards the present system of web-based technology.

64.     The Project also financed improved working conditions of central and regional social
protection offices through refurbishment of offices and procurement of office furniture (34
regional offices and one central office of social services).

65.     More importantly, however, for purposes of eventually achieving a coordinated system of
targeting and social services delivery, the GOA in 2012 issued a Decree on the Approval of the
Operational-Structural Model of Comprehensive System of Integrated Social Service Provision,
setting out a clear concept of a model of integrated social service provision and a proposed
implementation plan, with a clear division between piloting and roll-out phases. Financing for
the design and initial piloting of this new service delivery model was provided under the AF.
Specifically, this included: design (including preparation of alternatives and legislative backing)
and introduction of integrated social services delivery model involving pensions, social assistance,
employment and disability certification by specialists under one roof, as Integrated Social
Services Centers (ISSCs), or “one-stop-shops”, and piloting this first under four sites, and
subsequently in another 15 sites; adjusting the MIS in these centers to establish linkages with
MLSI and other databases; preparing design-cost estimates of the refurbishment of 19 pilot
centers and actual refurbishment (following a somewhat lengthy delay to transfer ownership of
the spaces); provision of furniture and IT equipment to pilot centers as well as software, a new
information system, that integrates multiple information systems needed by the ISSCs, including
beneficiary intake and follow-up, and queuing machines that allow monitoring of services
provided, analysis and calculation of numbers of visitors, and time spent on provision of services.

66.     The experience with these 19 pilots is being evaluated in the context of SPAP2
preparation. The expectation is that this integration of services under one roof will allow the
delivery of effective and coordinated social services that meet beneficiaries’ needs in an efficient
manner. The first ISSC has been in operation for only seven months; it is still too early to
evaluate its experience. However, preliminary findings suggest the following points:



                                                18
    •   The need for a functional model that ensures consistent management control for the
        realization of efficiencies and improved beneficiaries services
    •   The commitment by the GOA to finance operating costs of the ISSCs
    •   The balance between front and back office functions needs to be monitored carefully and
        calibrated, aiming for a leaner intake function and integrated specialist delivery.
    •   Careful monitoring of the management model, with specialist staff reporting formally to
        their centralized units, and only indirectly to ISSC Directors will need to be monitored
        closely and adjusted to ensure the full benefits of service integration.
    •   Challenges towards full integration apply especially to SESA staffs that see their
        beneficiaries and roles as more complex than those of their colleagues.
    •   It will be important to provide support for system for monitoring, work flow and
        intermediate processing to support ISSC operations, especially since ISSC Directors are
        starting to produce these analyses on a manual basis.
    •   The databases for Social Assistance and SESA remain separate, and the extraction of data
        for policy analysis cumbersome. These will need to be reconfigured to support an
        integrated case-management centered business process, once this is fully spelled out

67.      As provided in the Decree, the GOA plans to establish a total of 56 ISSCs (now called
ISPCs) (including the 19 under the pilot phase), based on the model defined and piloted under the
Project. About 181 regional bodies and committees will be unified under one roof at the
community level, will have unified reception areas, similar information systems and operate
according to unified methodology. The new ISSC model is expected to improve coordination of
social protection service delivery by following a “case” approach, with the complete assessment
of beneficiaries’ social needs and the development and delivery of a unified program for
satisfying those needs.

Improving Labor and Employment
Intermediate Result: Employment services provide diversified job search assistance

68.      The Project made an important contribution to SESA’s ability to deliver employment
service that provides diversified job search assistance. This was achieved this through a mix of
activities aimed at both strengthening SESA’s ability to deliver effective and quality employment
services in an efficient manner and the initial implementation and piloting of several active
employment projects. The national unemployment rate in Armenia has remained stubbornly high
between 2009 and 2012 (17.4 percent in 2012), and the majority of the unemployed are new labor
market entrants, or persons without previous work experience, mostly youth. Facilitating labor
market entry, particularly by easing the school-to-work transition through active programs, is a
relevant intervention to tackle unemployment. In this difficult labor market environment, the
improvement of the placement rate of jobseekers by SESA from 7% in 2005 to 16% of 2012 can
be interpreted as supportive evidence of the increased effectiveness of the institution. The rate of
satisfaction of SESA users also improved slightly, from 77% in 2005 to 82% at closure.

69.     The GOA’s development of a new labor and employment strategy starting in 2011 and
leading to 2013 resulted in the elimination from the Project of several activities that had been
envisaged under the AF. A proposed new Employment Law has been approved by the
Government and is awaiting parliamentary consideration. The new strategy, reflected in the draft
law, promotes greater emphasis on active as opposed to passive labor market policies, and
provides SESA with greater flexibility in determining those policies in response to emerging
labor market realities. Therefore, the promising experience with employment activities under the




                                                19
Project provides relevant input to the further development of active labor market policies to be
supported under a follow-up project.

70.      The development of a new, real-time, information management system for State
Employment Services Agency (SESA) has strengthened its ability to carry out its mandated
functions, while improving the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of its services for
beneficiaries. SESA’s new “Gorts” internet-based system provides a comprehensive search
engine that allows the exchange of information on job vacancies (including for remunerated
public works) and on job seekers (including information on education, experience, etc.), on a
regional basis. The system allows the users to update data on persons receiving unemployment
benefits. The system also tracks participation in active labor market programs and placement
rates, as well as refused job offers, thus supporting at all stages the implementation of the
employment legislation. SESA’s central and 51 regional employment centers are connected to the
system in real-time, and data is input by staff in regional offices. In all, about 180 staff of SESA
has received training on use of the system.

71.      Initial data provided by SESA with respect to outcomes is promising. The number of
youth job seekers placed in a job as a share of registered job seekers in the Yerevan SESA offices
increased from 15 percent in 2007-2008 to 23 percent in 2012-2013. Support for further
improvements to the “Gorts” system will be provided under the proposed SPAP2 project,
especially in terms of providing linkages with other social protection systems. A system for
monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of projects implemented in the employment sector
is being developed as part of unified system of monitoring and evaluation of social services in the
sector (see below). Finally, SESA has invested in training of staff and managers in 51 regional
centers through the delivery of 16 seminars using a train the trainers’ model; SESA now has 23
qualified trainers on its staff to replicate this training on an ongoing basis.

72.      Various new, pilot programs were carried out successfully, and while the effectiveness of
these in terms of outcomes has not been evaluated, SESA has institutionalized these models as a
basis for future activities. These include the organization of 37 job fairs in 15 cities across
Armenia, with the participation of about 1,500 employers and 71.5 thousand job seekers from
2007-2013. Also, following the training of SESA staff and refurbishment of premises, three pilot
job clubs were established, providing consultancy to about 950 visitors, 115 of which were
employed and 123 were involved in professional training programs. These include the
organization of 3 job markets in Yerevan, Abovian, Goris, with the participation of about 7,000
thousand job seekers and 120 employers. USAID has provided funding to expand the number of
job clubs from 3 to 12 adjacent to the employment centers and all these clubs continue to operate
so far. Beginning from 2009 this project acquired the status of a state program, and within its
framework during 2009-2012, 25 job fairs in various cities across Armenia were organized with
the participation of about 52.7 thousand job seekers and more than 1,000 employers.

73.      A Center for Professional Orientation and Vocational Rehabilitation of Disabled
(CPOVRD) in Gyumri, was established under the Project, including the development of programs
preparing disabled to enter the job market, refurbishment of the center and training of staff.
Since it began operations in 2009, the center’s 16 employees have been provided professional
training, advisory services and job rehabilitation (either at the center or at their homes) to about
3,000 disabled. In 2013, 16.3 percent of the registered disabled registered in the Gyumri SESA
Office were placed in a job, up from 5.5 percent in 2005. The operating costs of the CPOVRD
are now funded by the state budget.




                                                20
74.      As envisaged, the Project supported the establishment of an experimental Youth
Professional Orientation Center (YPOC) in Yerevan, through financing of rehabilitation of the
center at the selected location, development of guidelines for its operation and training of staff. It
also provided for the development of a web-based electronic testing system on professional
orientation that would help youth determine best career aspirations; and films explaining the
requirements and responsibilities of ten different professions. The Center began operations
providing group and individual consultations to youth, although the effectiveness of their
operations has not been monitored. In December 2012, the Government issued a decree
reforming the YPOC into the Professional Orientation Methodical Center (POMC). The POMC,
now funded by the GOA budget, is still in the stage of developing its methodology and
procedures, but it will no longer work directly with youth. Instead, in an attempt to increase
effectiveness and efficiency by multiplying the impact of its operations, it will work with SESA
regional staff in ISSCs, schools, etc. to distribute and disseminate the professional orientation
materials that it prepares. By the time the ICR team visited the center its operation as an
orientation center had stopped, and it was not possible to assess the soundness of the Center’s
approach to orientation or its impact.

75.      Finally, SESA has invested in training of staff and managers in 51 regional centers
through the delivery of 16 seminars using a train the trainers’ model; SESA now has 23 qualified
trainers who were selected from its staff and trained to replicate this training on an ongoing basis.

Modernization of Pensions System Administration
Intermediate Result: SSIF applies better processes and procedures to administer the public
pension system

76.      The Project supported the implementation of several activities aimed towards improving
SSIF’s (later SSSS, see below) processes and procedures. These included the development of
proposals on adoption of necessary legal acts for improvement of mandatory social insurance
system, on improvement of financial management systems, on improvement of services provided
to beneficiaries, introduction of information systems for electronic archiving and procurement of
information technology equipment, etc., but many activities were dropped from Project (and
funded mostly with state budget) and the impact of most of the activities that were financed
became minor inputs in the face of the major pension reform enacted by the GOA in 2010.
Perhaps the most relevant input in terms of increasing the efficiency of the SSSS was the
development and introduction of the inner information portal, introduced in May 2013. This
portal, that operates in real-time, regulates information flows, presents data in any requested
format, assures effective cooperation between different agencies and employees and increases
employees’ involvement in the decision-making process. Attribution of progress towards the
Project’s respective outcome indicators to activities financed by the Project alone is not always
straightforward. For instance, the improvement in pensioners’ satisfaction with the pension
system (to 95 percent by the end of the project) could be a reflection of the increase in the amount
of pension payments in 2008. On the other hand, improvement in the outcome indicator related to
timely and complete payment of pensions could be more directly related to multiple interventions
under the project to improve the administration of the pension benefits.

                       Figure 1: PDO Indicator for Pension Component




77.       With or without World Bank financing, the GOA has made significant progress in reform
and rationalizing its public pension system, and the Project—but one component in an integrated
program of World Bank assistance—provided a vehicle, among others, through which the World
Bank provided technical and advisory support to the GOA on pension reform. Specifically, the
GOA’s reform of the public pension system was enacted through a set of laws focusing on state
pensions (pay-as-you-go pillar), fully funded pensions (the second pillar), unified income taxes,
personified recordkeeping, and investment funds. With this reform, SSIF was transformed from
an independent pay-as-you-go pension agency with its own contribution collection, individual
recordkeeping, and pension payment capacity to the State Social Security Service (SSSS), as a
department of the MLSI. With social insurance contributions amalgamated into the personal
income tax, revenue collection transferred to the SRC, and personified monthly tax report
introduced and administered by the SRC, the SSSS will redirect capacity to strengthening its core
business processes and client relations. Important aspects of this reform had been defined at the
time the AF was approved, and selected inputs, e.g., the system for personified reporting and
recordkeeping, had been included for financing by the World Bank under the AF. Nevertheless,
in view of the ambitious timetable for introducing the new system (January 2014), the GOA opted
to finance even those inputs with state budget in view of the perceived possible delays that could
result if it were to contract the works following the World Bank’s procurement procedures.

Social Assistance

78.      The GOA took several actions to improve the administration and the targeting of its
social assistance benefits. The outcome indicators tracked the former aspect, and show a steep
improvement in the timeliness and accuracy of payments among the beneficiaries of the Family
Benefits Program (reaching 93% by closure). Several of the activities also contributed to
achieving higher targeting performance (see figure 2 below) which can be defined as the
percentage of the target population (such as the percentage of the target population within the
total beneficiaries. This was achieved through two complementary channels: by improving the
ease of application, and by increasing the capacity to screen for ineligible households. Easing
application was achieved through the development and 100 percent use of the electronic MIS for
all applicants by the end of the project (as shown in result framework). The reduction of inclusion
error was achieved through the enhancement of cross-checks and the integration of various
government databases for the purpose of income verification, which led to the disqualification of
many ineligible households. The efforts to increase targeting accuracy led to a reduction in total


                                                22
beneficiaries, including of poor families (from 43 percent in 2008 to 36 percent in 2010), because
the strict eligibility criteria was not relaxed to allow more households into the program. However
broadening of coverage was not the objective of the project, as the PDO aimed at improving the
performance (efficiency, effectiveness, quality) by the three agencies in services delivery.

Conditions Surveys 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011

79.      Finally, an input towards better targeting of social assistance is the capacity to monitor
and evaluate the benefit system, and the Project made an important start in putting this capacity in
place, as described below. Starting with a baseline household survey starting in December 2005,
the Project financed several consultancies aimed at evaluating the efficiency of targeted social
programs, recommending improvements to the FBP monitoring system, procurement of IT
equipment, modernizing the MIS to allow for exchange of other MLSI databases for the purpose
of eligibility determination, and training of staff to utilize the new system. In 2007, and later in
2009, the GOA enacted decrees aimed at improving the FBP’s targeting mechanism, by
modifying the formula for determining family vulnerability and benefit amounts, leading to
improved targeting performance. Eligibility is determined through a family vulnerability score,
calculated in accordance with a formula that takes into account the social group of each
household member, the number of household members incapable to work the domicile, dwelling
conditions, average monthly income of the household, etc.

80.     The Project also supported the development of the Institute of Social Worker, a virtual
mechanism, as opposed to a “structure” per se. For this, the Project supported the analysis of
different categories of social work in social protection sector, identification of problems faced by
social workers, professional compliance, skills required, contractual regulations, and the
preparation of professional job-descriptions of social work and criteria for training. Training
programs were delivered to 350 social work specialists in 19 of MLSI’s regional centers.

81.      Although a full M&E system could not be completed under the Project given time
constraints, MLSI has made important strides in developing a tested methodology for a structural-
functional model for monitoring and evaluation of social services, and trained specialists that will
use it in its Monitoring Department. This activity was implemented in three phases. In Phase I,
the existing capacity for M&E was analyzed, together with the legislative requirements. For
Phase II, a functional model of M&E developed for all MLSI programs, together with a proposal
for phasing in the methodology across 84 of the MLSI’s programs. Finally, in Phase III, training
was provided for the methodology to be tested and applied to the following five programs: (i)
“Employment Pensions”; (ii) “Services with Cash Support to Pensioners, Honorary Pensions and
Payments under Other Programs” (relating to employment pensions); (iii) “Organization of
Training for Unemployed Job Seekers”; (iv) “Child Care and Protection Services in Boarding

Schools”; (v) “Provision of Prosthesis/Orthopedic Appliances and Rehabilitation Technical
Means to Disabled and their Repair.

82.      The GOA now plans, with budgetary resources to roll out the M&E of all budget
financed programs, by applying the revised methodology and taking into account the lessons it
learned in the five pilots. MLSI has identified challenges to be addressed in the further expansion,
including: development of monitoring indicators; the need of methodology of research on
collection of qualitative indicators; introduction and further adjustments of MIS; and
dissemination/public awareness of M&E results. The RoA Minister of Labor and Social Issues
issued an order endorsing the concept paper on introduction of the M&E system for programs
implemented in the area of social protection, furthermore permanent M&E responsibilities within
MLSI were established ensuring the continuity and expansion of M&E of the programs
implemented in the social sector.

3.3 Efficiency

83.      From the outset of the Project, the economic efficiency and benefit estimates werevery
rudimentary. Neither the PAD, nor the Project Paper (PP) for the AF gave any concrete targets
that were then related to the results indicators. Assessment of efficiency was further complicated
by the fact that the focus of the Project changed over time. Some efficiency projections given in
the PAD and related to improved social insurance contribution collection have become obsolete
in light of the outright abolishment of social insurance contributions in favor of a unified tax and
contribution collection system.

84.     While assessment of efficiency on the basis of the project documents is nearly impossible,
a set of top-down estimates can be established for the efficiency of the individual components.
The ICR team was able to gain an impression of the institutional quality and professional capacity
of the social protection agencies and their staff. When faced with technical questions or request
for performance data in Yerevan or in field offices, staff of the ISSCs or the SES was able to
provide these data and rely on systems to generate them.

85.     The efficiency effects of the Project are expected to unfold over a wide area of
administrative units and agencies, building on improved IT systems, office equipment and
training of staff. With 2.2 percent in administrative costs as a share of total program costs, the
FBP was already the most efficient last resort social assistance program in the Europe and Central
Asia Region in 2006, according to a regional study currently being finalized.23 Information on
costs in later periods is not available, and it is not clear whether the improvement of the
administration system had an impact on cost-effectiveness; however, the integration of databases
reduced the burden of documentation for application to individual citizens.

86.     Another key efficiency dimension of the Project lies in the set-up of the ISSCs, Integrated
Social Service Centers. At this point in time, it will be too early to assess any efficiency effects of
the ISSCs, as their management and control model still needs to be finally decided and firmed up.
Similar experiences in the region and in the OECD context have yielded substantial
improvements in staff efficiency (either via reduced staffing numbers for the same amount of

cases or via increased citizen face-time for case workers) in one-stop-shop operations. In an
example from Ukraine, processing time for applications dropped from 4.5 hours in 2005 (prior to
the introduction of integrated centers) to 1 hour by 2012. 24 In case Armenia opts for an effective
management control model of its ISSCs and ensures spatial co-location of staff in all localities,
similar efficiency gains could be expected.

87.     On the citizen-side, improved efficiency arises from a unified collection of tax and social
insurance contributions, easing filing burdens on workers and employers. For users of ISSCs,
time efficiencies arise from the single-location approach and single application form for different
services. The ISSCs chosen and inspected during the ICR missions were all located in central and
accessible locations (municipality, close to bus routes, etc.), enabling citizens to engage with
ISSC staff easily.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.      The Project’s Overall Outcome Rating is Moderately Satisfactory. The relevance of the
Project’s objective is unquestionable. Its design, both in terms of institutional arrangements and
activities financed lost relevance somewhat during the project period, but throughout
implementation support and flexibility ensured that its design at closing continues to be
particularly relevant to the GOA’s social protection agenda at present and in the future. Despite
problems with the Results Framework, the accomplishment of the Project’s objective of
improving performance in social protection service delivery was largely met, and the full extent
of the direct impact of project activities on this improved performance on beneficiaries will
require further time to materialize and measure, along with continued efforts to roll out the new
service delivery model. The GOA remains committed to sustain these efforts (Section 4), and the
World Bank is planning to provide further support for this (Section 2.5). Actual measures of the
Project’s efficiency are difficult to measure at this stage, but the new model of social assistance
delivery is definitely expected to impact efficiency in the social protection sector in the
foreseeable future.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

89.      Overall the project deign did not include gender-specific components and targets, which
is reflected in the absence of gender disaggregated indicators. An exception was the satisfaction
surveys conducted among beneficiaries of SESA, published in the M&E report 2011-2012 25. This
survey showed that 76percent, of female beneficiaries were satisfied or mostly satisfied with the
services received, compared to 15percent among male beneficiaries.

impact on longer-term capacity and institutional development is mentioned throughout Section
3.2.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

92.    A beneficiary survey element was included in the general household survey of the
National Statistical Office. Results are given in Annex 5.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible

93.     The Risk to Development Outcome is rated Negligible. The GOA’s commitment to
continuously improving its system of social protection is unquestionable. The Minister of MLSI
confirmed to that World Bank that the Ministry would finance any parts of contracts under the
Project that are not completed by the Closing Date with their internal budget. The activities
carried out under the Project, and those that the GOA opted to finance with budgetary funds have
been implemented by Government agencies that have counted on institutional strengthening, and
those ministries and agencies have internalized those activities. The GOA is financing the
operating costs of project-supported agencies on a routine basis, and will continue to do so. A
cross-sectoral steering committee is in place to oversee the implementation of integrated social
protection reform. Finally, the GOA continues to seek, and given its strong commitment and
record, should continue to count on continued external funding, including from the World Bank,
to support its social assistance reform priorities (Section 2.5).


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94.     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory. (This
section addresses Quality at Entry of the Project, as appraised in 2004; the processing and
approval of the AF is described in Section 5.1(b) below). This was the World Bank’s first
engagement in support of Armenia’s social protection sector. The Project was timely and
responsive to the GOA’s request for assistance, and was grounded in strong analytical work. At
the same time, being a first engagement, the Project was unquestionably ambitious, both in terms
of the number of components, stretching across all of the domains of an effective social
protection system, except health, and in terms of the number of activities under each of those
domains. The project size was relatively low (US$5 million): this amount could be justified
given that this was the first engagement of the Bank in the sector, and that the policy objectives at


                                                 26
start were less ambitious than those that later emerged. Yet, the Project’s Results Framework
presented important challenges, as described in Section 2.3 and were it not for the ample evidence
of the Project’s pivotal role in support of the GOA’s many and continuously evolving reforms, it
would be difficult to evaluate the achievement of its objectives through the chosen indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.     The Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Over its nine-year
implementation period, the Project was supervised by four Task Managers and their teams
supported by Country Office staff. A strong local presence provided continuity in the dialogue
with the GOA, as well as strong Headquarters-Country Office communication and coordination,
including with the several World Bank task teams responsible for other social protection sectors
tasks.

96.      During the ICR mission, the GOA commented on the World Bank’s receptiveness to
requests for and strong analytical capacity of advice provided by its high-level specialists in
response to their evolving priorities, and highlighted their strong collaboration and especially the
GOA’s ability to count upon an open and constructive dialogue in areas of priority to them.
Especially important to the GOA was the World Bank’s adaptability to the changing environment
and sectoral priorities, including the processing of the AF, where the World Bank teams first
attempted to understand the impact of changes in Government policies and strategies on the
Project, then arrange to provide best-practice knowledge and advice in the area, and finally adjust
the Project to reflect the GOA’s changed priorities.

97.      The World Bank’s supervision was implementation-focused, especially towards the end
of implementation, when the World Bank’s team worked on an almost daily basis with PIU and
FFPMC, with detailed, weekly reports to monitor progress and ensure completion of the ISSC
pilots, thereby ensuring almost complete utilization of AF funds. The World Bank’s team also
worked closely with the GOA, starting with the processing of the AF and later during a somewhat
delayed but nevertheless comprehensive Mid-Term Review, to adjust the Project, in coordination
with donors, in response to the Government’s evolving funding priorities in the sector. Some
activities were withdrawn from the Project to ensure completion as per the Government’s
mandated timetable (e.g., developing the system of personified record keeping), since following
the World Bank’s procurement procedures would have required much longer lead times and
thereby put in jeopardy completion by the required date.

98.      Yet, the World Bank’s decision not to restructure formally the Project’s Results
Framework and indicators following the Mid-Term Review, when it became clear that the GOA’s
priorities for World Bank financing had evolved, was probably not the best decision, particularly
at the AF stage, when the PDO level indicators were confirmed in spite of the fact that most had
been achieved, Further, the large increase in the amount of civil works for rehabilitation of the
ISSCs suggests a revised environmental classification may have been warranted, but there is no
documentation of any discussion of this topic, under a joined effort of the client and the World
Bank to ensure tangible project achievements by the projected closing date. Nevertheless, the
supervision team was faced with the decision of either responding to the GOA’s changing priority
(e.g., piloting the ISSC concept) and providing intensive support for making it work during the
slightly more than one year of implementation remaining, or of devoting what would have been a
considerable part of this remaining period towards negotiating and seeking external and internal
approval for a project restructuring that might then not have had sufficient time to produce results.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.     Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on the ratings for
Quality at Entry and Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

100.     The Borrower Performance was Satisfactory. For purposes of this Section of the ICR,
Government is taken to be the broader GOA, including the MOFE and MLSI, at the highest levels.
This Project, together with the many adjustments it witnessed, definitely had strong Government
ownership and was adjusted during implementation to adapt to its ambitious social protection
reform agenda. The GOA’s commitment to the SPAP’s objective of achieve improved
performance (efficiency, effectiveness, quality) by the public employment, pension and social
assistance agencies in providing services to the population was unwavering throughout, and even
intensified in light of the economic crisis that affected the country starting in 2009, despite
constrained finances. Throughout the implementation period, Armenia had three Prime Ministers
(of the same party) and six Ministers of Labor and Social Issues (of several parties, often different
from that of the Prime Minister), yet commitment to the Project and its objectives was maintained
throughout.

101.     The GOA continuously sought to optimize the use of external assistance to meet its
evolving priorities, by reviewing and making compatible its internal, budget and external funding
to its needs, although in retrospect, one could question whether, at the time the AF was approved,
the GOA did not envisage the then imminent policy changes and financing priorities for those
changes, which could have avoided use of project resources on a few activities that later became
irrelevant. The decision to carry out within the Government many of the most knowledge
intensive components of the Project demonstrated strong ownership over policy-making, but it
was difficult for the team to assess whether the opportunity to incorporate global knowledge into
strategic policy planning was not sacrificed in the process. In any event, the GOA continues to
have an ambitious social protection agenda, and has been very engaged in designing a follow-up
project. For this it is actively seeking to evaluate activities under the Project to extract lessons
relevant to the “next step”, especially with respect to the experience with pilot ISSCs.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

102.      The implementing Agencies’ Performance is rated Satisfactory. As a result of the
Project’s broad scope across the domains of the social protection sector, its activities were
implemented by several implementation agencies, including the PIU in MLSI, the SESA, and the
SSIF (later SSSS), and lastly by ISSCs piloted during the final year of implementation. In
general, these implementation agencies demonstrated strong commitment to the Project and its
objectives, as well as to the GOA’s evolving priorities and ensuring that the activities financed by
the Project were consistent with those priorities. Implementing agencies assigned highly capable
staff to the Project’s implementation that sought advice when needed. Although there were some
changes in the staff of these agencies throughout implementation, as might be expected, their
impact on the Project’s implementation were negligible. FFPMC provided instrumental support



                                                28
to the carrying out of the Project’s fiduciary aspects and compliance with the World Bank’s
fiduciary requirements, and collaborated closely with the PIU in MLSI to ensure the
responsiveness to project priorities. The effective coordination between FFPMC and the PIU,
strengthened throughout implementation, was especially important to the strong implementation
performance during the Project’s last year or so of implementation.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

103.  The Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on the ratings for
Borrower and Implementing Agency Performance.


6. Lessons Learned

104.     Client capacity-building for M&E should have priority over use of external
contractors. The Project aimed to strengthen monitoring and evaluation of social protection
programs, in general, and through the design and implementation of information systems needed
for this purpose. As this capacity was being developed by the client, the task of routine project
monitoring was outsourced to an external contractor, based mostly on information provided by
the PIU. In retrospect, little, if any, value-added was provided by this external contractor, other
than compiling and formatting data for the beneficiary surveys. When even a minimal capacity
for monitoring is in place, the World Bank should opt instead for financing the training and
employment of specialized staff within the client agencies to fulfill project monitoring
functions, thereby increasing capacity, as opposed to “contracting out” those functions.

105.     Management model and staffing arrangements of the ISSCs need to be geared
towards efficiencies and effectiveness. The current management and staffing arrangements of
ISSCs are centered on a “coordinator” model in which staff of the four specialized services
(pensions, social assistance, labor/employment, and disability) operates in a matrix relationship to
both their functional units and to the “coordinator” of the ISSC. Coordinators lack formal
management control over the total number of staff in the ISSC and have difficulties raising
efficiencies and improving service quality for citizens. Generally, management control for
coordinators appears to be limited to the front-office/reception part of the ISSC and to any staff
they might have managed as part of their legacy function within one of the four domain services.
It is important to continuously review these types of operational issues and have the government
take decisions towards a stronger mandate of the ISSC management. For the model to improve
effectiveness and efficiency, the ISSCs need to provide more than simply the sum of their four
functional parts.

106.    An investment loan can be a powerful vehicle for sector policy dialogue. It is
unquestionable that the GOA made steady progress in practically all of the areas of social
protection during the Project’s implementation period. In part because of the Government’s
strong commitment to putting in place an efficient, effective and high quality social protection
system, and in part because of the strong program of technical assistance, the lending and the
technical advisory services provided both the World Bank and other donors showed to be
complementary and mutually reinforcing. In retrospect, two strong lessons derive from the
World Bank’s experience with the Project (and the broader sector dialogue that accompanied its
implementation). First, even if an activity/reform (e.g., pension, FBP) is not financed directly by



                                                29
the World Bank, involvement through a project can provide a vehicle, together with others,
through which advice and be provided and supported if need be. Second, this involvement is as
important for the reforms and activities that can be supported, as for those that through
implementation support and other forms of advice, clients decide against.

107.    Mid-Term Reviews (MTR) should not be delayed just because projects have not
reached the expected “mid-point” of their implementation. In fact, especially when projects are
not implementing as scheduled, the MTR can provide an opportune venue for identifying issues
impeding implementation, redefining priorities and reexamining expected results to put a project
back on schedule. All MTRs should as a matter of routine reexamine the project’s original
Results Framework, both in terms of its quality at entry as well as its continued relevance,
including that of feasibility of data collection to show progress towards results.

108.     When disbursement plans are shifted, the project needs to be restructured. Task
teams should be reminded of the need to continuously reexamine projects’ results frameworks,
and adjust them as soon as problems with those frameworks are identified, either due to poor
initial design or changes in project activities and focus. It would have been relatively easy to
process a restructuring of the Project’s Key Indicators, especially in cases such as that of this
project, when policy performance is good, the clients’ reforms dynamic, and the Project’s
Development Objective(s) remains unchanged. An early MTR could have reduced the pressure
on the task team to tradeoff between last-year disbursement performance and formal restructuring.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

109.    The team discussed with the borrower’s project implementation team the content of the
ICR during a dedicated mission. Minister Asatryan submitted written comments to the draft ICR
on October 2013. The main points raised are summarized below and the author’s response is in
brackets.


   i.   Suggested minor changes to the tables A and B of Annex 1, consisting of an update of the
        final expenses at the time of project closing, based on the accounts of the RoA Ministry
        of Finance Foreign Financing Projects Management Center.
        [Annex 1 currently reflects the changes proposed by the borrower].

  ii.   Table A. Basic Information, “Co-financiers and Other External Partners” should specify
        that the RoA government was involved as a co-financier and show the amount of its co-
        financing.
        [Included]

 iii.   Suggested adding additional detail on sustainability of some activities (training, job
        market fairs, job clubs) conducted in Component 2 – Improving Labor and Employment -
        [Included]

 iv.    Suggested adding narrative describing the adoption of the M&E system, developed as
        part of the project, into the MOLSI regular monitoring process of programs.
        [Included in revised version]



                                              30
  v.   The RoA Ministry of Labor and Social Issues highly appreciated the effective
       performance of the World Bank team under the program and propose to assess it as
       “Satisfactory” rather than “Moderately Satisfactory”.
       [Authors explained to the borrower the rationale for the ratings but agreed to raise this
       point during the Decision Meeting and finalize the ratings following the meeting]

(b) Co-financiers

110.    No co-financiers collaborated in the project. The cooperation partners of the World Bank
(mainly USAID and UNICEF) lauded the excellent collaboration with the World Bank.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

111.   No other non-commercial and non-government partners were involved in the
implementation of the project.

        Borrower Completion Report

    1. OUTPUTS OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT PER COMPONENTS

        Component 1: General Support to the Social Protection Sector

        (Actual amount is USD 3 011 819.32, which makes 51.3 % of total disbursed amount)

                For the creation of CNIF preliminarily provided was appropriate consultancy for
technological platform for provision of IT, and also implemented were the works for preparing of
ToRs on provision of consultancy for IT business processes, and for modernization of IS. The
activity “Consulting services for the development of CNIF” (network design) was fulfilled within
the period of September, 2007-June, 2008. The other works (technical provision, connection of
channels, training and re-training of employees), envisaged for the creation of CNIF were
planned to be implemented together with RoA Ministry of Territory Management in the scope of
“Modernization of State Sector” project, as the funds envisaged under SPAP were not sufficient
for the fulfilment of works of such a volume. However, as a result of a new policy, adopted by the
RoA Government, it was decided to develop the private sector of telecommunication, particularly
of internet provision thus enlarging the coverage and ensuring the cooperation of the State and
private sector in this issue. As a result the funds for 2 projects, envisaged for CNIF were re-
disbursed in 2008. It should be noted, that within 2008-2013 Armenia recorded a great progress
from the viewpoint of internet coverage and capacity building, and as of the closing date of SPAP
almost all organizations of SP sector were provided with internet or /and intranet and the
overwhelming majority of information systems are operated under WEB technologies.

                In the scope of SPAP voluminous procurements were made for the provision of
computer, network and related equipment for the offices of central and regional agencies of SP
sector. Particularly, under Component 1 procurements were made for MLSI, SSSS,”Nork”
information-analytical centre, MLSNI, regional agencies/ committee of SP sector (55
SSRAs/SSRDs, 51 SSSS RDs, 51 EMCs/ERCs, 25 MSECs), and delivered were servers,
computers, monitors, notebooks, UPSs, printers, multifunctional devices, cameras. Created are
also local computer networks for the offices of mentioned regional agencies. Mentioned
deliveries went on also in the scope of SPAP AF assuring a great progress for the quick
development of IT substructure of SP sector. At the same time, in the scope of the Component,
designed and created was the local phone-network of MLSI, which is successfully operated
ensuring efficient and cheap service.

               In the scope of works for improvement and modernization of information
systems a task was set to ensure combined and automated use and exchange of data between
operating ISs of SP sector, and also the input and use of data in a real regime. However, for the
immediate operation of created new tools the channels, which would connect regional offices
with central offices, were missing. Later, associated with problems arisen in the course of
reforms, the approaches of using modernized systems were changed. Particularly, in the scope of


                                               48
pension reforms it was decided to develop and introduce a new state pension electronic system,
which was implemented in the course of 2011-2013, and currently the new “Electronic Pension”
system is successfully operated by the SSSS. As a result of introduction of a new system of
identification cards in Armenia, the MLSI stopped the operation of “Social Security Card” IS. In
RoA, in the scope of ispection reforms it was required to develop and introduce a new IS ensuring
inspections based on risk assessment, and the operation of developed and modernized system
became inexpedient. The introduction of CSS unified system under AF resulted in new tasks of
integration and combined use of data, which were mainly implemented through the development
and introduction of a new information system of ISS. As a result, ensured was the comined and
online use of data from 18 ISs. So, it should be noted that the information systems, modernized in
the scope of SPAP 1st phase, are used partially, however the task of assuring of integrated
informational environment and automated data exchange is mainly implemented as a result of
works supported by SPAP AF and RoA State Budget.

                 One of the most important activities for the development of ICT subsystem of SP
sector was the training and re-training of users of ICT subsystems , in the scope of which almost
all employees of 55 SSRA/SSRDs, 51 SMC/SRCs, 51 SSSS RDs, and also of MLSI were trained
in order to be able to operate softwares and currently operating information systems. Mentioned
trainings granted the opportunity to use the existing and newly created ICT resources more
efficiently thus increasing the quality of general management and service provision. At the same
time trainings were conducted for the employees of SP departments of Local Self-Governing
bodies.

        The following activities were fulfilled for the improvement of working conditions of
central and regional offices of SP sector:

      1.     Refurbishment of offices of regional agencies of SP sector (SSRAs/SSRDs,
EMCs/ERCs, SSSS RDs) and SLI central office,
      2.     Procurement of office furniture for offices of regional agencies of SP sector
(SSRAs/SSRDs, EMCs/ERCs, SSSS RDs).

                During the first phase of the Project in general 34 regional officies and one
central office of SS providing agencies of Yerevan and marzes of Aragatsotn, Gegharqunik,
Vayots Dzor were refurbished, including:
        i.   15 regional centers of SESA,
       ii.   12 regional departments of SSSS,
     iii.    7 offices of SSRA/SSRD,
      iv.    SLI central office.

         As a result of refurbishments the working conditions are essentially bettered, and also
SSRAs offices were centralized under one roof as much as possible. Mentioned policy assured an
important basis during SPAP AF for CSSS introduction from the viewpoint of providing SSs at
unified receptions.
         3.     One of the most important activities of improving of working conditions of SS
providing regional offices was the procurement of office furniture for refurbished 6
SSRAs/SSRDs, 15 EMCs/ERCs, 10 SSSS RDs. Many of mentioned offices were still using the
furniture from Soviet Union period. A small quantity of furniture was procured also for MLSI.




                                               49
        Component 2: Labor and Employment
        (Actual amount is USD 1 012 335, 29, which makes 17,24 % of total disbursed amount)

As a result of implementation the following outputs and developments are available:
                The internet system “Gorts”, which regulates Employment sector, is operated by
51 regional centers of SESA thus assuring the input and use of data in a real regime; the exchange
of data on vacancies and job-seekers between the offices; efficient supervision over implemented
works; conduction of statistical analysis; and fulfillment of other functions of SESA;
                There are highly-qualified specialists, who operate the information system
“Gorts”;
                The regional and central offices of SLI operate in good working conditions. The
technical means, required for the organization of works, are available;
                The organization of job-fairs is considered one of the most important activities of
Employment sector supported by RoA State Budget. Within the period of 2007-2013, 37 job-fairs
were organized in 15 cities of the republic, per 5 times in each, including in Yerevan, Gyumri and
Vanadzor. About 1500 employers and 71.5 thousand job-seekers participated in those job-fairs.
                In 2009-2010 mentioned 3 job clubs provided consultancy to about 950 visitors,
115 of which were employed and 123 were involved in professional training programs. At the end
of the project in 17 regional centres of SES operated job clubs. All means acquired for the
operation of job clubs are used according to the objective. At the beginning of the project
trainings were organized for 55 employees of SESA on the operation of mentioned new
employment technologies. In the premises, refurbished in the scope of CSSS introduction, the
conditions required for the operation of job clubs are available and will be operated in parallel to
the complete introduction of the system.
                The CPOVRD of Gyumri, established under the RoA Government Decree of
April 15, 2010, successfully operates being financed out of RoA State Budget proceeds. As of
Project closing date, 16 people are employed by the Center, 11 of which work according to their
specialty. Within 3.5 years of its operation the CPOVRD fulfilled professional work with 3
thousand people, the 847 of which within the period of July 1, 2012-July 1, 2013 (with 733
people they worked at home and with 114 at the center). Since the establishment, as a result of
CPOVRD consultancy 43 disabled have been employed for the first time.
                By 2013 the YPOC successfully operated being supported out of State Budget
proceeds. Under the Decree N1549-Ն, dated December 13, 2012, the center was reformed into
the “Professional Orientation Methodical Center” SNCO principally changing its functions.
Currently 17 employees are employed at the center, 11 of which are specialized employees. The
capacity and means acquired in the scope of SPAP are being completely used.
                The SESA currently has 361 employees, 338 of which are highly-qualified civil
servants. 43 people work at the Agency, 35 of which are civil servants, who fulfil professional
work. According to the annual State Employment Program, the Agency fulfils 13 state projects.
Besides, the SESA cooperates also with a number of international organizations and is currently
implementing different projects with 5 such organizations. In the final phase of SPAP a new stage
of reforms launched in the state employment regulation sector, the mission of which is to assure a
new progress in the sector through the introduction of new flexible and active employment
projects. The activities implemented within 2005-2013 in the scope of SPAP are important basis
for the implementation of mentioned reforms.
                For the perfection and improvement of Labor Legislation developed were
conceptual approaches on the amendments to RoA Labor Legislation, submitted were a number
of legislative drafts and expertise conclusions regarding a number of legislative drafts developed
by the MLSI. Mentioned proposals were mainly applied by the MLSI.

        Component 3: Modernization of Pension System
        (Actual amount is USD 326 540,11, which makes 5,56 % of total disbursed amount)

          In the course of the Project the outputs of this activity were used partially conditioned
with legal and SSSS status changes, and also with launching of new pension reforms. Particularly,
the majority of legislative and financial management documents and proposals were not applied
as the RoA State Social Insurance Fund was reformed into the RoA State Social Security Service
(the Statute and staff structure were approved under the RoA Government Decree N1531-Ն,
dated December 27, 2007) operating in the management sector of RoA Ministry of Labor and
Social Issues under the RoA President Order N305-Ն, dated December 24, 2007. The information
system of electronic archive was not operated as SSSS regional department were not provided
with channels, and the electronic archive had been developed as a WEB operated system. Besides,
within 2011-2013, a new electronic pension IS was introduced in the SSSS, which efficiently
fulfils the electronic archiving of documents. The proposals regulating archiving processes were
not applied as unified archives for 4 SSs operating under one roof, were established in CSSRCs in
the scope of CSSS introduction and consequently required were quite different approaches for
archiving of documents. In addition, the personified reporting system is currently being operated
by the SRC and this has significantly cut down the volume of SSSS paper documentation. It
should be noted that some of outputs of implemented activities, for instance the proposals on
improving the ITs, some proposals on inner regulation, training activities and printed materials
have had their impact and have been used for a certain period of time. The voluminous and
fundamental pension reforms, launched since 2010, resulted in a new situation and new solutions,
which were partially implemented in the scope of SPAP AF.

        At the expense of initial Project’s savings ICT equipment were procured for SSSS, which
are being operated according to the objective.

         Some activities of this Component were removed from the Procurement Plan associated
with the process of reforms and new situations. Particularly, it was envisaged to develop a new IS
for personified recording, however the function of operating mentioned system was planned to
transfer to the SRC, which then was realized in the scope of pension reforms and the PRS was
developed and operated out of RoA State Budget proceeds.

        Component 4: Improvement of Social Assistance System
        (Actual amount is USD 366 533.95, which makes the 6.24% of total disbursed amount)

                In March-October 2006 “Economic Development and Research Center” NGO
conducted household survey to a) evaluate social services provided to RoA public and define
priority of the required services, b) evaluate needs of households, c) develop alternative ways of
social assistance, d) adjustment of poverty evaluation formula of families.
         As a result following tree analytical reports were developed:
         1.      “Overall picture and classification of communities in Armenia”.
         2.      “Needy families and social services in Armenia”.
         3.      “Improvement of social assistance targeting in Armenia”, which includes policy
recommendations for organizing family allowance system and improvement of poverty
evaluation formula.

              In 2007-2008 local and international consultants conducted works for evaluation
of efficiency of targeted social programs and improvement of monitoring system (“Family
Benefit” program (FBP)).



                                               51
         •       International consultant Miroslav Beblav provided consulting services for
improvement of FBP monitoring and evaluation efficiency. Consultant submitted 3 reports, which
reflected:
         1.      International leading experience in the field of social systems programs
implementation, monitoring and evaluation efficiency assessment based on evaluation of family
neediness system.
         2.      Analysis of FBP monitoring and evaluation system and recommendations for
system improvement.
         3.      Outputs of the seminar conducted for the presentation of FBP monitoring and
evaluation system improvement results for corresponding departments of MLSI staff and social
service regional offices employees.

        •       In May 2007-June 2008, the consortium of local consultants “Avag Solutions”
LLC and “Lisam” LLC provided consulting services for improvement of FBP monitoring and
evaluation system. As a result

         1.       A report on “Analysis of current system of FBP” was submitted,
         2.       A methodical manual, named “Organization of FBP monitoring and evaluation
activities” was developed for the professionals involved in monitoring and evaluation of social
assistance programs,
         3.       Training was conducted for the staff involved in monitoring and evaluation.
         Based on the proposals made as a result of above mentioned surveys, on December 27,
2007 and January 15, 2009 RoA Government adopted N 1530-Ն and N 39-Ն Decrees aimed at
clarification of targeting mechanisms of social assistance services. Under the mentioned decrees
the points of some social groups and the income formula were changed.

         The outputs of mentioned consultancies were mainly used in the course of SPAP. As a
result the FBP is considered one of the programs of social network in European and Central Asian
territory (ECA), which have the best targeting.

        Component 5: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation

       (Actual amount is USD 1 154 172.06 which makes the 19.66 % of total disbursed
amount)

        It should be noted that the capacity of all major social protection agencies (SESA, SSSS,
Ministry of Labor and Social Issues (MLSI)) has been substantially improved under the Project.
Social assistance benefits and pensions are paid on timely manner; targeting of social assistance
benefits and services has also improved. Overall satisfaction of beneficiaries with the social
service and benefit provision has increased. Recommendations to improve monitoring and
evaluation of the Family Benefit Program and its targeting efficiency has been implemented; the
Program has been judged as one of the best targeted social safety net programs in the ECA region.
These achievements have led to better performance by the public employment, pension and social
assistance agencies in providing services to the population.

    2.   THE OUTPUTS OF THE SECOND PHASE OF THE PROJECT

Component 1: General Support to the Social Protection Sector
(Actual amount is USD 3 808 743.6, which makes the 68 % of total disbursed amount).

        The following activities were implemented in the scope of Component 1 of Additional
Financing:

        Working-out of social services joint package and structural-functional model of
        joint ystem of complex provision of social services (SSICJS)
        On the 22nd of July, 2011 a contract was signed with “Harmonic Society” NGO, who
had submitted a bid together with the “International Fund for Social Services” of Switzerland.
The works fulfilled within the period of July, 2011- September, 2012 and submitted 3 reports
allowed the MLSI to make appropriate decisions and take measures for the possible directions
and models of introduction of Complex (Integrated) Social Services System in Armenia and for
the steps and required means to reach the latters. Various possible models for integration were
submitted as a result of which 52 CSSRCs with 56 unified receptions will be established in
Armenia. About 181 SS providing regional bodies and committees (55 SSRA/SSRDs, 51
EMC/ERCs, 51 SSRDs, 23 MSECs) will be unified under one roof at community level, will have
unified receptions, unified informational environment and will operate according to unified
methodology. Particularly, important is the institute for the conduction of a social case in the
scope of which a complete assessment of social needs of beneficiaries will be carried out and a
unified program for satisfying those needs will be developed and operated. One of the most
important problems of CSSS is the formation of social network and the centralization of possible
resources for solving of various problems that the vulnerable groups of population face.

         The following Decrees were adopted for the introduction of SSICJS:

         1.      On the 3rd of June, 2010 RoA Government adopted protocol N21 “On the
approval of concept of organizing the process of provision of integrated social services”.
         2.      On the 23rd of December, 2010 RoA Government adopted protocol N 50 “On the
approval of conceptual approaches of structural-functional model of joint system of integrated
social services’ provision”.
         3.      On the 24th of March, 2011 RoA Government adopted protocol N11” On the
approval of Plan-Schedule of activities of introduction of joint system of integrated social
services’ provision”.
         4.      On the 26th of July, 2012 the RoA Government adopted a Decree (N 952 - Ն)
“On approving the program of the introduction of integrated social services system in the
Republic of Armenia”. The latter also stipulated the pilot project of social services integrated
provision, which was implemented in Ararat marz.
         5.      In order to ensure the effectiveness of integrated social services pilot project, a
special working group responsible for implementation of the pilot project was created by the
order of the Minister of Labor and Social Issues (N 82, A / 1 - September 18, 2012), as well as
executives were appointed to be responsible for 4 Complex Social Services Regional Centers in
RoA Ararat marz.
         6.      On the 22nd of Mach, 2013 according to the N 44- A/1 order of the RoA Minister
of LSI on “Designing of Complex Social Services Regional Centers (CSSRC) and appointment of
coordinators for the CSSRCs” other 15 CSSRSs were designed and coordinators were appointed.
The 19 centers to be refurbished and furnished in the scope of SPAP Additional Financing by
May 31, 2013 were simultaneously being involved in the introduction process of Complex Social
Services System.


                                                53
        The introduction of CSSS is one of the priority issues for the RoA Government and in the
scope of SPAP AF actually 19 CSSRC were established and a new methodology and tools were
operated for the provision of CSS. The mentioned phase of SPAP, perhaps, is the initial phase of
CSSS introduction in the course of which the new system still need a period to be corrected and
perfected. The deadline of the pilot project was extended by the RoA Government for October,
2013 and based on the outputs of the latter the RoA Government will adopt a final Decree on the
final CSSS model in Armenia.

        Preparation of design-cost estimate documents of regional (integrated) services’
        offices of social protection field and implementation of technical and author's
        supervision

         In August 2011 contracts were signed with 2 companies for the fulfilment of works. The
works on preparing of design-cost estimate documents and also interior design projects were
fulfilled by the latters in 25 CSSRC (Ararat, Masis, Vedi, Artashat, Armavir, Baghramyan,
Tshambarak, Noyemberyan, Charentsavan, Nairi, Maralik, Ashotsq, Avan, Norq-Marash,
Nubarashen, Ajapnyak, Davitashen, Erebuni, Vardenis, Talin, Aparan, Tsaghkahovit, Ashtarak,
Vanadzor and Akhuryan).

         Only in 19 of the mentioned 25 designed centers, it was possible to implement
refurbishment works, because it was decided to postpone the refurbishment works of the other six
centers (CSSRCs of Vanadzor, Akhuryan, Talin, Aparan, Tsagkahovit and Ashtarak) due to the
lack of time and other resources.

         It is notable that during the refurbishment of those 19 centers, the client, the Contractor,
as well as the designing and supervising organizations raised several issues, which have led to
changes in the projects and budget estimates. Those were mainly connected to the ambiguities in
the model of complex social services (CSS); to the design and construction of large-scale projects
in a short period of time; to the depreciation of buildings and the resultant numerous problems
arising in the process of construction.

         Within one year (June 1, 2012- May 31, 2013), over 25 Centers were designed and 19
were refurbished, which though had to be implemented within three years. The design and
construction works were accepted and launched by the request of WB only after the Decrees of
community councils and the Government were adopted on area allocations, as well as after the
Decree of the RoA Government on the introduction of the complex social services system (except
for the three pilot centers of Ararat Marz – Ararat, Masis and Vedi, tenders for which started
earlier). As of May 31, 2013, the design works of all 25 centers, as well as the technical and
author’s supervision of refurbishment works in 19 centers were completed.

        It should be noted that one of the most important achievements of the Project is the
making of decision on the right to unlimited and free of charge use of areas of CSSRCs. Before
the implementation of reforms, different agencies of SP system occupied the offices, in general,
under temporary renting contracts, which sometimes resulted in various obstacles. The right to
unlimited and free use of areas assures stable basis for the reforms of CSSS introduction and for
the long-term impact of implemented contributions.

        Implementation of refurbishment of regional (integrated) services’ offices of social
        protection field

         In 2010-2012, a research on possible locations and conditions of regional bodies and
centers of SP sector was conducted. Proposals on the problems of organization of works and on
suitable centers that are subject to refurbishment were presented; as well as visits to the
appropriate centers were carried out. At the same time, with the support of the Ministry of
Territorial Administration and cooperation of local authorities, works on bringing the centers
under one roof and positioning of integrated receptions had being implemented.

        17 contracts had been concluded with different companies, who implemented the
refurbishment works of 19 complex social services regional centers (CSSRC). The mentioned
centers were located in Ararat, Masis, Vedi, Artashat, Armavir, Baghramyan, Tchambarak,
Vardenis, Noyemberyan, Charentsavan, Nairi, Maralik and Ashocq, as well as in Avan, Norq
Marash, Nubarashen, Ajapnyak, Davitashen and Erebuni administrative districts of Yerevan. As
of May 31, 2013, all the refurbishment works of 19 complex social services centers were
completed.

        Provision of information and telecommunication systems for SSICJS
        The following works were fulfilled for the implementation of envisaged activities:

        Procurement of SSICJS network technical equipment

       The specifications of servers required for the operation of centralized informational
system were worked out.

        However, the RoA Government provided two powerful servers to the MLSI, as a result of
which this activity was removed from the procurement plan and the procurement amount was
reallocated. The procured servers currently ensure the smooth operation of ICT systems of SP
sector.

        Procurement of computer and other technical equipment for regional (integrated)
services’ offices of social protection sector

         Preliminary estimations for technical equipment required for ISS unified receptions were
prepared. In the framework of development of the model “Harmonik Society” NGO implemented
inventorization of technical conditions of currently functioning regional centers providing SSs
(SSRBs, EMCs/ERCs, SSSS RC, MSECs). Based on that, it was possible to calculate the cost of
and the quantity of the required technical equipment for Complex Social Services Regional
centers (CSSRC) to be established.

        In order to obtain digital queuing machines and electronic information terminals, a
contract was signed with “Lime Tech” LLC in March 27, 2013. As of May 31, 2013 all the
equipment required for 25 Centers were delivered by the latter.

        In order to obtain Household Appliances, TV sets and Conditioners, 3 contracts were
signed with “Aray” LLC in February 6, 2013. Contract terms were prolonged till May 20, 2013,
as the installation of the latter was directly related to the completion of refurbishment works.
During the mentioned period, the delivery and installation of the equipment of 19 CSSRCs were
made.

“Ino-Technology LLC (January 31, 2013) and “Fine” LLC (February 1, 2013). Significant part of
computers for Masis, Vedi and Ararat centers were delivered in March 26, 2013; while the other
part of the equipment was delivered in the period of April-May, 2013. The delivery of computer
equipment for the other 22 centers was delivered in few stages and completed by “Fine” LLC in

        As of December 19, 2012, “Microring” company had already delivered the scanners and
multifunctional devices required for SSSS.

         As a result all technical conditions required for the operation of CSSRCs are assured in
order to fulfil the works more efficiently and to increase the quality of provided SSs through up-
to-date ICT means. The queuing machines allow not only regulating the service provided to
citizens, but also carrying out some analysis and calculations regarding to the number of visitors,
provided services, the time spent on the provision of services, etc. And the electronic terminals
allow visitors to solve their problems through self-service.

        SSCPJS software assuring activities
        Contracts were signed with “Harmony” IT and Education Development Fund in January

integrates over 18 different information systems, is operating in CSSRCs. Through the latter
implemented are also the unified acceptance and addressing of applications, recording of data
required for the conduction of the social case, formation of social passport. Mentioned
information system assures stable basis for the operation within integrated informational
environment according to unified methodology in CSSRCs and this is a key prerequisite for the
provision of complex SSs.

         Procurement of furniture for CSSRCs
                 The furnishing works for all refurbished 19 Centers were carried out within

         ***
         The two activities envisaged under mentioned component aimed at raising public
awareness on SSCPJS and training of specialists were removed from the procurement plan based
on the assignment of the Prime Minister of RoA. The awareness campaign is envisaged to be
implemented in the scope of upcoming projects in parallel to the introduction of CSSS. The
training of specialists of established CSSRCs were conducted under the Component 4 of the
Project.

Component 2: Labor and Employment
(Actual amount is USD 28 839.39 which makes 0,51 % of total disbursed amount)

        The fundamental changes envisaged in Labor and Employment sector lead to resigning of
the main part of activities envisaged under SPAP AF. The funds were reallocated to the
introduction of CSS system. This was implemented according to the RoA Prime-Minister's
assignment. Particularly,
        1.      The contracts signed for the implementation of activities “Study of RoA labor
market, including the assessment of possibilities of youth employment and integration of disabled
to employment” and “Situational study of labor and salary sphere” were terminated.



                                                56
       The following activities were removed from the Procurement Plan:

         2.       “SESA (of MLSI of RoA) capacity building for organization of and control over
short-term professional trainings for job-seekers and unemployed”,
         3.      “Training of agricultural and market-oriented professions to job-seekers with
rural inhabitation”,
         4.       “Consultancy and organization of practical training for unemployed having
profession but no record of professional work”,
         5.      “Training and re-training of cadres of labor and employment sector”,
         6.       “Refurbishment of one regional representation office of "Youth Professional
Orientation Center" SNCO”,
         7.       “Procurement of furniture and computer equipment for one regional
representation office of Youth Orientation Center”,
         8.       “Training of staff of one regional representation office of Youth Orientation
Center”.
         Last 3 activities were removed from the procurement plan, because, according to RoA
Government Decree N 1549-Ն, dated December 13, 2012, on “Renaming the “Youth
Professional Orientation Center” SNCO” and making amendments to the RoA Government
Decree N 1915-Ն, dated December 14, 2006” the “Youth Professional Orientation Center” SNCO
was renamed as “Methodological Center for Youth Orientation” SNCO, which should not have
regional representation offices.
         9.       “Development of system for monitoring and evaluation (MES) of effectiveness
of the projects implemented in the employment sector”,
         10.      “Development and introduction of electronic system for monitoring and
evaluation of effectiveness of the projects implemented in the employment sector”.
         These 2 activities were removed from the PP and the fund was reallocated between the
“Development of a system of monitoring and evaluation of efficiency of social services” and
“Development and introduction of electronic system of monitoring and evaluation of efficiency of
social services” activities. This change is due to the new approach of the MLSI of the RoA and
the adoption of new conceptual documents in the field of social services, according to which a
unified system of social services Monitoring and Evaluation of Effectiveness (MES) should be
created in Social Protection sector.
         11.      “Modernization of “Gorts” internet system fulfilling the functions of the RoA
Employment sector”
         12.      “Development and installation of a new information system of State Labor
Inspectorate of MLSI of RoA”.
         These 2 activities were removed from the procurement plan due to the development of
new strategies and approaches in Employment sector and in the course of inspection reforms. In
the current stage of reforms, when not all problems and approaches are clarified yet, it is
inexpedient to implement the procurement of the creation or modernization of IT tools.
         13.     “Printing of information materials for Labor and Employment sector”.
         This activity was removed from the procurement plan as active reforms were taking place
in Labor and Employment sector, which though have not been completed yet, and the elucidation
of the latter would be a waste of time.

        In the scope of Component 2 of SPAP AF actually implemented are 2 activities:

        1.      “Development and introduction of electronic testing system for Youth
Professional Orientation and Professional Career”,
        2.      “Preparation of 10 films about specialties for the youth”.



                                              57
         The outputs of mentioned 2 procurements are efficiently used by the “Youth Professional
Orientation Center” SNCO (currently “Methodological Center for Youth Orientation” SNCO). It
should be noted that the introduction of CSSS has had a great impact on the capacity of
Employment sector, as currently the needs of job-seekers are completely assessed and a complex
social program is developed and implemented for satisfying the latters. It should also be recorded
that the problem of employment of population still remains one of priority issues for Armenia.

        Component 3: Modernization of Pension Sector
         (Actual amount is USD 824 150,02, which makes 14.71 % of total disbursed amount)

         Under this component the AF supported the Government’s efforts to improve the
administration of the pension system, (in particular as it relates to reporting and record-keeping
for unified revenue collection) (the function of the SRC) and state pensions administration
(function of the SSSS)). The following activities were initially included in the scope of AF
activities: (i) development and installation of software and provision of IT equipment for
personified reporting (registry) and record-keeping system at the SRC; (ii)
development/improvement of the MLSI’s software and provision of IT equipment for pension
determination and 'pay-as-you-go (PAYG)' ( payment of taxes during getting the salary) database
management; (iii) increasing the quality of customer services in SSSS; and (iv) training the staff
of MLSI, SSSS and SRC engaged in new processes. The development and installation of software
of the inner portal of SSSS, the procurement of hardware, related digital equipment and furniture,
training and study tours were supported under SPAP AF.

        A number of activities under this Component were also removed from the Procurement
Plan for various reasons, and new activities were added to the same Component. Particularly, the
following activities were removed from the Procurement Plan:

2010. By the help of the clients - MLSI and State Revenue Committee, in support with
USAID/PALM - before and after the approval of Reform Package, works were carried out
towards the development of the appropriate ToR. Since this activity was planned to be
implemented through international tender, which presupposed a quite long procedure and since
the system would have to be introduced by the January, 2013, RoA Government made a decision
according to which the project had to be implemented by the means of the State Budget in order
to make the entire implementation process more effective and fast. Corresponding resources were
allocated from the State Budget for the implementation of current activity and the fund envisaged
under SPAP AF was reallocated.

        On the 24th of September, 2011 a contract was signed with “IU-network” company
which was selected through a tender to develop a ToR for the implementation of “Development
and installation of software packages (including the ones, ensuring data exchange between
Personalized Reporting (registry) System and other informational systems) assuring the

State Revenue Committee. The Company had already completed the implementation of the works
and the system is already operating.
