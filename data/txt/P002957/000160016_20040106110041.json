{"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory,\n            with project sustainability likely. The overall performance\n            of both the World Bank and the Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. These are the some of the lessons identified\n            from this project. Proper demand assessment would have led\n            to curtailing the over-design of systems. Project design and\n            costing needs to include mechanisms for financing\n            connections to ensure adequate secondary and tertiary\n            distribution infrastructure is developed from the outset, a\n            large customer base, and a balance between production and\n            distribution - linking investments with cost recovery,\n            revenue generation and debt service. Lending large amounts\n            of capital for investments to a utility requires full\n            technical, financial, economic and institutional analyses as\n            a basis for justification. Quality assurance during\n            preparation is key--this may have helped define clearer\n            objectives, addressing the mismatch between the components\n            and objectives, preparing more appropriate levels of\n            investment and better demand assessment. Collect adequate\n            baseline data and information to allow for a clearer\n            assessment of project impacts. Small towns should be treated\n            as simplified urban utilities rather than as an upgraded\n            rural system. Application of the water user association\n            (WUA) model in urban towns is inappropriate because: the\n            demand responses in urban town, however small, call for more\n            commercial management of different service levels  not\n            anticipated in the original design; governance arrangements\n            at Town Council level introduce complications in ownership\n            of assets, management oversight and day-to-day operation of\n            the systems.. WUAs need to be strengthened with adequate\n            resources and manpower to provide more structured and timely\n            support and to guide Urban Water Authorities in the\n            planning, design, construction and regulation of operation\n            and maintenance and supervision of the Private operators.\n            To avoid delays in project implementation, conditionality,\n            which is outside the control of implementing agencies,\n            should be avoided. The requirement to formalize the\n            existence of Water User Groups, Water User Associations, and\n            Water and Sanitation Committees required the enactment of\n            the Water Statute by Parliament; this condition led to a\n            15-month delay in project effectiveness.  Financial\n            viability of a utility and sustainability of services\n            delivery depends on appropriate dimensioning and balance\n            between production, secondary and tertiary infrastructure,\n            coupled with sound commercial and financial management.\n            Monitoring and evaluation systems need to be developed for\n            the operational and financial performance of the town water\n            authorities, in order to review accuracy of data, and to\n            prepare short-term financial forecast and action plans and a\n            feedback mechanism to improve management especially at this\n            stage when the Towns Boards are in their nascent stage.\n            Good quality preparation, vigilance of the engineering\n            consultant and the project management team throughout the\n            project cycle are important elements that guarantee quality,\n            limit delays and over design of systems, and provide a good\n            basis for sustainable operations. scope and size of\n            investments should consider the viability of the utility and\n            the impact of the investment on its balance sheet. Timely\n            review of projects performance and progress is needed to\n            take corrective measures. Task teams should take advantage\n            of project restructuring as an opportunity to fundamentally\n            improve projects including re-definition of objectives,\n            components and to request necessary assessments that would\n            make for better project outputs, outcomes and impacts."}, "docdt": "2003-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
