                         The project's development objective is to significantly increase the number of 6-14 year old children, especially from special focus groups,
                         enrolled, regularly attending and completing elementary school and                                          demonstrating basic learning levels.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         India's Right to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act passed in 2009 promises to change the education landscape of India and aims to ensure the realisation of the access,
                         equity and quality goals of SSA. The Mission notes with appreciation the work done to align Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) with the RTE. The revised SSA norms which have been
                         approved and those under consideration have takenon board the implementation challenges of the RTE. The Mission acknowledges that it may take a few years before the education
                         systemacross all levels understands, appreciates and internalises the letter and spirit of the RTE. While it is premature to comment on the harmonisation process, the start is indeed
                         promising.

                         The SSA Results Framework indicates impressive progress in achievement ofall SSA goals related to access, equity and quality, and the Mission recognizes the enormous efforts
                         made by MHRD and the States toachieve this progressover the last few years. The shift in focus of SSA to emphasize improved student learning through multi-yearcomprehensive

                         quality improvement programs is noted at both National and State levels, which is most encouraging; MHRD's leadershipin this regard is to be commended. The Actions Taken
                         Report (ATR) provided to the Mission demonstrates laudable efforts by MHRDand the States to implement the eighteen (18) major recommendations made by the 11th JRM in
                         January 2010, and the Mission sees measurable progress on almost all these recommendations. For FY2010-11, the approved outlays for SSA for all States have increased
                         substantially relative to FY2009-10 (overall by 75%), offering a truly significant opportunity to further consolidate and extend the activities,outputs and outcomes of SSA. At the same
                         time, such a massive expansion raises certain issues related to implementation capacity ina more general sense which MHRD and some States need to address.
