                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has made remarkable progress in improving access to elementary education, bridging gender and social gaps in enrollments and in ensuring more
                         children complete primary and elementary cycles of education. The progress has been more notable in States and districts which were lagging in education development. The 14th
                         Joint Review Mission undertook a desk review of the progress of SSA as it completed a decade of implementation and also one year as vehicle to implement Right to Education
                         (RTE) provisions and noted the reforms in policy sphere as in implementation arrangements.

                         Enrollments at primary level has increased from 134 million in 2007-08 to 135 million in 2010-11 while the same at upper primary levels have gone up from 51 million in 2007-08 to 57
                         million in 2010-11. During the same time, 0.5 million additional children with special needs (CWSN) were enrolled in schools. Already shares of girls, SC and ST children in primary
                         grades are reflecting their shares in population, a target set by SSA; and at upper primary level, they are moving close to the targets of shares in population. Primary to upper primary
                         transition is 83% in 2010-11 which is close to the project end target of 85% by 2011-12. On quality related indicators, the national students learning achievement surveys using

                         improved internationally acceptable methods are being carried out as targeted. Grade V round III study is under review and the grade VIII round III assessment is underway as
                         targeted. It is also important to note that the preliminary results of the National students Learning Achievement Surveys using the improved internationally acceptable methods for
                         Grade V is now available, the insights of which is going to help the quality related interventions. In addition, teacher education is given a renewed thrust to improve teaching quality,
                         and the launch of a national eligibility test for teacher recruitment is a new step in this direction.

                         The project focus in the following months will be (a) to address the special needs (participation, classroom experiences etc.) of the last mile children (such as urban, slum children,
                         children with special needs , children belonging to SC, ST and minority groups); (b) address the quality of learning and learning levels; (c) following up and supporting efforts of
                         different states in teacher development, particularly those states with greater deficiency of teachers both in terms of numbers and in terms of skills, and the North-East; and (d)
                         strengthening the monitoring and supervision aspects of program implementation, especially those related financial management, procurement.
