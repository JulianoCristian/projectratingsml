                         The project's development objective is to significantly increase the number of 6-14 year old children, especially from special focus groups, enrolled, regularly attending
                         and completing elementary school and demonstrating basic learning levels.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), India's flagship program for improving elementary education access, equity and quality, is also now designated as the vehicle to implement the Right
                         to Education (RTE) Act. SSA has contributed tremendously to (a) improve access to primary and upper primary education, and hence increased enrollments; (b) closing gender and
                         social gaps in enrollments; (c) ensuring improved student retention and completion of elementary cycles of education; and (d) initiate several interventions aimed at improving various
                         aspects of quality. While doing so, the program has also helped in an accelerated manner, the lagging states and districts to improve their education sector. The Right to Education
                         (RTE) Act has raised the bar. The 15th Joint Review Mission assessed the progress of SSA in the context of success so far and challenges ahead on the basis of findings from visits

                         The SSA interventions have been directly benefiting around 130 million children enrolled in government schools and 17 million enrolled in government-aided private schools. The
                         beneficiaries include 71 million girls, 27 million children from India's disadvantaged groups, 15 million tribal children and 2.8 million children with special needs. The shares of girls as

                         well as that of children from marginalized communities (scheduled castes and scheduled tribes) in elementary enrollments are now on par with their shares in respective child
                         population. Apart from these direct beneficiaries, through the curriculum/ textbooks reforms, the program has been indirectly benefiting an additional 45 million students, enrolled in
                         private schools. There is a renewed thrust on (a) providing special training for newly enrolled out of school children to enable them to attend age-appropriate classes, (b) rationalizing
                         existing teacher posts and appointing qualified teachers (as evident from the Central Eligibility Tests carried out), (c) ensuring adequate physical infrastructure for schools; and (d)
                         curricular and examination reforms. However, improving quality and learning levels remains the toughest challenge. The improved National Assessment Survey (NAS) using the item
                         response theory (IRT) analysis have provided some useful information about key aspects of student learning.

                         The project is fully disbursed now. The Bank would continue with its implementation support till the legal closing date of September 2012, as agreed with the Government of India.
