The sarva shiksha abhiyan (SSA) program, backed by\n            funds from the World Bank\u2019s International Development\n            Association (IDA), boosted the enrolment of children from\n            poor families, marginalized, and tribal groups, and those\n            with special needs. Around 54 percent of the children\n            enrolled between 2003 and 2011 were girls. Now, the focus is\n            on boosting the quality of education, as well as ensuring\n            access for all. While the Bank\u2019s financial support for SSA\n            ends in 2012, the government will keep supporting SSA at\n            least until 2017."}, "docdt": "2012-05-09T05:13:00Z"}
