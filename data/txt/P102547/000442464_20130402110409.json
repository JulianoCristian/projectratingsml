for the Second Elementary\n            Education Project for India were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: strong political commitment and\n            ownership are critical for successfully steering a centrally\n            sponsored scheme. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) provided\n            development partners (DPs) with a viable platform to provide\n            consistent and concordant support to the program under a\n            common results framework, jointly designed with the\n            Government. A realistic assessment of the capacity is\n            important to inform the design and sequencing of the reform\n            programs for optimal impact. Regular diagnostic assessments\n            for tracking student achievement are good initial steps\n            towards improving student learning outcomes. Availability of\n            timely and reliable data is essential for choosing the\n            results indicators to measure the achievement of the\n            development objectives. Communication is a key to successful interventions."}, "docdt": "2013-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
