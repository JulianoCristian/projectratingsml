More specifically, the additional financing\n            will enable expanded activities related increased access at\n            upper primary level (grades 5-8), increased completion rates\n            and improved learning outcomes for the full elementary cycle\n            (grades 1-8), and enhanced ability to undertake national\n            student learning achievement surveys in grades 3,5 and 8.\n            The expected outcomes of these activities are a greater\n            percentage of children attending and completing elementary\n            education, and demonstrating satisfactory learning levels,\n            across all socio-economic categories."}, "docdt": "2010-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
