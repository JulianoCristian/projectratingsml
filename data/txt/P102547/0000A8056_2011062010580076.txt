                         Implementation Status Overview
                           SSA's progress towards SSA goals related to access, equity and quality are notable. The Actions Taken Report (ATR) provided to the 13th Joint Review Mission demonstrates
                         laudable efforts by MHRD and the States to implement recommendations made by the 12th JRM in July 2010, and the Mission sees measurable progress on almost all these
                         recommendations. The Central and State governments are trying to address the varied issues in implementing the program in a contextual manner. The shift from addressing access
                         and quality in a sequential manner to a more holistic approach towards addressing the issues of quality, equity and access in a comprehensive framework is giving the program the
                         right impetus. The focus on improving student learning outcomes through multi-year comprehensive quality improvement programs being developed at both national and state levels,

                         imbibing the spirit of National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 is highly encouraging.
                         While considerable progress is noted in meeting access goals at primary level, the challenges remain at upper primary level in a few States. MHRD is addressing this issue by

                         sanctioning more upper primary schools / sections in States with huge upper primary gaps - West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Rajasthan. More and more girls and children from
                         marginalized groups are now enrolled; so are children with special needs (CWSN). However, enrollment of CWSN with severe problems is still an issue. The issue of CWSN's
                         education is now being addressed by several States and MHRD through alternative modes of education (for example, home based education) and increasing the provisions for
                         inclusive education and recruiting more resource teachers and inclusive education volunteers. The challenge of retaining children in school and getting them regularly attend classes
                         remain a challenge in many parts of the country. Interventions to address this issue include provision like separate girls# toilet and female teachers are provided to ensure adolescent
                         girls' attendance at upper primary level and text books and other incentives to address quality issues. The measures to improve quality processes are on track, and new national
                         assessment system addresses issues of quality in a more diagnostic manner. Various studies so far by NCERT and other Civil Society Organizations show low learning levels and
                         need to improve learning outcomes, prompting States to prepare multi-year comprehensive quality improvement programs. However, there is a greater need to ensure that the vision
                         and its implementation strategies filter down to the district and sub-district level functionaries for its meaningful integration at the school level. While several states have already
                         developed State specific curriculum framework taking the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 as the benchmark, and have also developed related syllabi and rolled out text
                         books, many other States are in the process of doing so. There is a need for encouraging the remaining states who have not initiated the process to accelerate development of child
                         friendly curricular materials based on the NCF 2005, at the earliest.
                         Overall, while the progress towards universal quality elementary education is positive, MHRD and State SSA societies are addressing the issues in a more serious manner under the
                         new Right to Education. SSA has been designated as the vehicle to implement India's Right to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE). SSA norms have been revised to be in
                         synchronization with RTE. States are in the process of formulating model rules for implementing and monitoring RTE. It may take a few years before the education system across all
                         levels in the country understands, appreciates and internalizes the RTE in letter and spirit, and this is acknowledged by both the MHRD and the Development Partners.

                         The total outlay approved for SSA for the year 2010-11 has been increased to Rs. 45,747 crore after the approval of supplementary plan for Rs. 8563 crore in November 2010. This
                         additional provision of resources were made in order to implement RTE. Government of India has also made provisions for 2.31 lakh crore rupees (around 5000 billion USD) to SSA
                         to implement RTE in 2010-11 to 2014-15. As this offers a significant opportunity to further consolidate and expand the activities, outputs and outcomes of SSA, MHRD and State
                         governments are also trying to address the issues related to implementation capacity.
