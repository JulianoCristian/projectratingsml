 Striving For Quality and Universal Elementary Education Through a
 Flagship Government Program


Overview
A flagship government education program in India, the largest of its kind in the world, has
succeeded in bringing more than 17 million children to school who had previously been left
outside the school system. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) program, backed by funds from
the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), boosted the enrolment of
children from poor families, marginalized, and tribal groups, and those with special needs.
Around 54 percent of the children enrolled between 2003 and 2011 were girls. Now, the focus
is on boosting the quality of education, as well as ensuring access for all.


Challenge                                               MULTIMEDIA
India, a country with over a billion people and a
per capita income of less than US$1,000 has
managed to reduce poverty from 46 percent in
the mid-1980s to around 34 percent in 2004-05;
this is still high and continuing this improving
trend poses a huge challenge. Similarly, illiteracy
has come down from 35 percent to 26 percent
between 2001 and 2011. The ability for many to
find work or gain an education has been
hampered by physical, social, and economic
barriers, marked by regional variations and
socio-cultural biases. Policies on various aspects      MORE
of education (for example, teacher recruitment

needed to be addressed with special initiatives.

Results
In order to ensure quality education of eight years at
elementary level for all children in the 6-14 years age group, the SSA program focused
broadly on (i) improving access to schools and facilities, (ii) providing more and better quality
teachers and building their capacity; (iii) various facilities and incentives to students, including
text books; (iv) revising curriculum, and text books, and strengthening academic support
mechanisms; and (v) special programs targeted at girls, children from marginalized groups,
children with special needs, and the improvement of quality and learning.
    1. SSA directly benefits around 130 million children currently enrolled in government schools, and partially
       helps another 17 million enrolled in government-aided private schools. The beneficiaries include 71
       million girls, 27 million children from India’s disadvantaged groups, 15 million tribal children and 2.8
       million children with special needs.
    2. The number of out-of-school children in the age group of 6-14 years has fallen from 32 million in 2001 to
       8 million in 2009, and enrolments climbed from around 160 million in 2002 to 193 million in 2011.
    3. The proportion of girls in school improved from 44 percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2011, a level that is
       equal to their proportion of the child population. Enrolment of children from marginalized groups
       increased from 18 percent in 2003 to 19 percent in 2011, and those from tribal communities edged up to
       11 percent from 10 percent during the period. The enrolment of minority communities increased from nine
       percent of the child population to 13 percent. According to two independent evaluations, the share of out-
       of-school children among girls declined from 7.9 percent to 4.6 percent, and among marginalized groups,
       it declined from 8.1 percent to 5.9 percent. For tribal groups, it declined from 9.5 percent to 5.0 percent
       and among religious minorities, it declined from 10 percent to 7 percent).
    4. The number of children with special needs identified and enrolled in schools or provided with home-
       based education has increased from just 500,000 in 2002-03 to 2.9 million today.
    5. The average annual dropout rate at primary school, was over 15 percent in 2002-03 but this had fallen to
       6.8 percent in 2010-11.
    6. The pupil-to-teacher ratio improved from 43:1 in 2004 to 31:1 in 2010-11 thanks to the appointment of
       1.8 million teachers since 2002.
    7. Around 150,000 new primary schools and 93,000 upper primary schools were opened, 1.3 million
       additional classrooms were built, 210,000 schools were provided with drinking water facilities and
       420,000 with toilet facilities since the beginning of the program in 2003.

Bank Contribution
The Government of India and state governments together invest around US$5 billion in the
SSA program every year, while development partners together fund less than five percent of
the total cost. On average, around half the funds go to boost education quality, and 30-40
percent toward improving school infrastructure. The rest goes for various other initiatives,
including access and retention, among others. Through IDA, the World Bank contributed
US$500 million for SSA in 2004 and US$600 million in 2008, with an additional financing of
US$750 million since 2010.

Partners
India’s SSA program is collectively supported by IDA, the European Commission (EC), and the
U.K.’s Department for International Development (DFID). In the program’s first phase, while
India’s central and state governments contributed the lion’s share—about US$2.5 billion - the
EC and DFID together contributed over US$500 million. In phase two, the Indian government
invested more than US$6 billion, while the EC and DFID together contributed almost US$400
million. In the additional financing phase, DFID contributed US$165 million. In addition, the
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is very active in some of India’s less-developed
states, helping government education departments implement the Elementary Education Project
at the state and district levels. IDA, DFID, the EC, as well as the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and UNICEF also collaborate to share best
practices that support improved educational quality and teacher effectiveness.

Toward the Future
With SSA having made great strides in bringing more children to primary education, especially
girls and those from marginalized groups, the focus is now on including the so-called “last mile”
children, and improving the quality of education, with a special focus on learning
improvements. In 2009, India passed the historic Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act,
declaring that quality education is a right of all children, and enshrining the SSA as the vehicle
to deliver it. Going forward, with larger numbers of children completing their primary education,
there is an urgent need to increase the number of secondary schools, and their educational
quality needs to improve. In response, a new initiative - Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan
(RMSA) – has begun and it takes a similar approach as the SSA. While the Bank’s financial
support for SSA ends in 2012, the government will keep supporting SSA at least until 2017.
