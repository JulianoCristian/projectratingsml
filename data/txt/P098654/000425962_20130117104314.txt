﻿THERMAL POWER EFFICIENCY
RESTRUCTURING PAPER
A. SUMMARY
1.   This paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to make the following
changes to the China Thermal Power Efficiency Project (the Project): (1) trigger a new
safeguard policy - Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37); (2) amend the intermediate output
indicators; (3) adjust the project components; and (4) adjust the implementation
arrangement to include new implementing agencies. The proposed adjustment of the
project components include: (1) the scope of Part A of the Project is reduced due to
cancellation of two activities (closure of small power plants and CHP online monitoring
system in Shanxi province); and (2) the scope of Part B of the Project is expanded to
include the rehabilitations of three additional power plants, including: Weihai power
plant in Shandong province, Wuxiang Power Plant and Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant in
Shanxi province. As a result, part of the GEF grant is reallocated from Part A to Part B of
the Project. The proposed changes are in response to the request of the Government of
China (GoC) made through three letters from the Ministry of Finance dated November 3,
2011, February 7 and November 9, 2012 1.
2.   Prior to the request, the project closing date has been extended from December 31,
2012 to December 31, 2013 through a CD-approved level II restructuring. Further
extension of project closing date is not requested in this restructuring.
B. PROJECT STATUS
3.   The objective of the Project is to reduce coal consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions per unit of electricity production in Shanxi Province, Shandong Province, and
Guangdong Province. The project restructuring does not result in any change in the
project objective.
4.   The project was approved by the Board on May 5, 2009, and the legal documents
were signed on June 21, 2009. Project implementation was delayed at the early stage, and
the disbursement of the GEF grant was less than 20% by the end of June 2011 after the
project had been effective for more than one and half years. Progress has been made since
June 2011, with the improvement of project management and enhanced project
supervision: (a) total disbursement plus the pending expenditures to be reconciled
reached about 70% by the end of September 2012; (b) an implementation plan was in
place and agreed with the Bank team; and (c) the requests for project restructuring were
submitted for the Bank's consideration. The rating of the project implementation was
upgraded to moderately satisfactory in November 2012 and there are no outstanding
issues from Financial Management perspective. Provided the project restructuring can be
1 As the proposed changes of project scope involved two provinces and national government, the
preparation status for each proposed change varied. These changes were confirmed by the Ministry of
Finance through the letters received.
6


﻿approved and the project is implemented following the agreed plan, the project
development objective continues to be achievable.
C. PROPOSED CHANGES
*  Results/indicators
5.   No change is proposed for the PDO level indicator. However, the intermediate
output indicators for each component were modified to adapt to the changes of project
components, as listed in Annex 1.
* Components
6.   The changes of the project activities aim to provide timely support to the GOC's
priority actions in improving the efficiency of thermal power in China. The government
put closure of small generation units as a priority action in its 11th Five-Year period
(2006-2010) and aimed to complete the rehabilitation of medium-size coal-fired thermal
power plants in its 12th Five-Year period (2011-2015). The re-allocation of the GEF grant
in the proposed project restructuring is consistent with the GOC's priority actions in both
periods.
7.   The proposed changes are made to both Part A and B of the Project, including
removal of two activities under Part A. 1 and A.2, modification of project activities under
Part A.3, and expansion of Part B of the Project, as elaborated below:
(a) Support to closure of small coal-fired generation units in Shanxi province under
Part A. 1 has been proposed to be dropped. The closure of small generation units
in Shanxi province was accelerated by the provincial government during the
11th Five-Year period (2006-2010), and additional financial incentives were
provided by both the central and provincial government. The anticipated social
risk caused by the closure of small units (mainly loss of jobs and financial
losses for the investors) were mitigated. So the provincial PMO proposed to
drop this activity from GEF Financing and reallocate this part of the GEF grant.
(b) Establishment of the CHP online monitoring system in Shanxi province under
Part A.2 has been proposed to be dropped. The provincial government
considered not to establish such a monitoring system as the amount of existing
CHP units had been reduced substantially after most of the small coal-fired
units were closed. So the provincial PMO proposed to drop this activity and
reallocate the associated part of the GEF grant.
(c) Part A.3 was expanded from  establishment of provincial-wide electronic
bulletin systems regarding emission allowances of small generation units being
closed to support the pilot emission trading systems in both Shanxi and
Shandong provinces. The provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs)
in both Shandong and Shanxi province accelerated their steps to promote the
emission trading systems in order to meet the stricter targets of pollutants
emission reduction imposed by the central government. The project activities
7


﻿under Part A.3 were modified to fulfill the needs of both EPBs through
provision of technical assistance.
(d) Rehabilitation of three existing power plants has been added to Part B of the
Project, including Weihai Power Plant in Shandong, Wuxiang and Taiyuan No.
1 Power Plant in Shanxi province. The selection of the power plant candidates is
based on the demonstration technology for rehabilitation, environmental and
social impacts, as well as sustainability and replication potential in the province
and country, to maximize the value added by the available GEF grant resources.
The agreed investment activities include: (i) addition of peak cooling capacity in
Wuxiang Power Plant to existing 2x600MWe coal-fired units to reduce the
capacity losses in summer and improve the overall thermal efficiency; (ii)
integrated rehabilitation in Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant including installation of
phase-transition heat exchangers to recover waste heat from flue gas to pre-heat
combustion air and reduce coal consumption; and (iii) integrated rehabilitation
in Weihai Power Plant including installation of variable speed drives (VSDs) for
primary fans, secondary fans and induced draft fans.
Safeguards
8.   Although the project does not finance the construction of any dams, both the
Wuxiang Power Plant and the Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant to be rehabilitated under the
project will withdraw water from reservoirs formed by two existing dams: Guanhe and
Jinyanghu. Therefore the OP 4.37, Safety of Dams, is triggered considering the size of
the two reservoirs.
* Institutional and implementation arrangements
9.   Three new implementing agencies (IAs) are included to be responsible for the
rehabilitation of the three additional power plants under Part B of the Project, namely
Weihai Botong Heat and Power Co., Ltd., Wuxiang Hexin Power Generation Co., Ltd.,
and Guodian Taiyuan No. 1 Electricity Generation Co., Ltd.. A Subsidiary Grant
Agreement will be signed between each IA and its Provincial Financial Bureau after the
Grant Agreement is amended.
10. Early in the project implementation period, Part A of the Project (Closure of Small
Coal-fired Generation Units) met with serious delays and it was decided that some
activities under this component would be dropped. In June 2011, the National PMO
proposed to shift part of the GEF funds from Part A to Part B of the Project
(Demonstration of Power Plant Efficiency Improvement). From June 2011 to November
2012, both Shanxi and Shandong PMOs carried out the identification, preparation and
government approval processes of alternative subprojects. The Bank team reviewed and
appraised these subprojects including from fiduciary and safeguard perspectives. As
some of the new subprojects completed the Bank appraisal earlier than others, they
started implementation in parallel to the finalization of the appraisal of the remaining
subprojects. The Bank team supervised the implementation of these subprojects on an
ongoing basis and confirmed that the work and expenditures which have been incurred so
far are in compliance with the Bank's policies and guidelines. Government approval has
8


﻿now been obtained for all subprojects and the final scope of the project restructuring has
been agreed and included in this RP. In order to account for the early commencement of
implementation of some subprojects, retroactive financing is deemed necessary dating
back to October 1, 2011.
Financing
o Project Costs and Financing Plan
11. The total project cost was reduced from US$108.96 million to US$ 83.15 million
based on the latest estimate. The cost reduction was contributed by (i) excluding part of
the planned co-finance to support the closure of small generation units due to drop of
some activities under the Component; and (ii) cost savings from existing subprojects. The
details of the project cost are illustrated in Table 1.

o Disbursement arrangements
12. Total disbursement of GEF grant resources amounted to US$ 10.29 million as of
September 30, 2012. If the eligible expenditures for the three additional power plants are
included, total disbursement of the GEF grant plus the pending expenditures to be
reconciled amounted to US$ 13.87 million, 70% of the total Grant. The estimated
disbursement of the GEF grant is expected to be US$ 14.01 million by December 31,
2012, US$ 17.07 million by June 30, 2013 and US$ 19.70 million by December 31, 2013.
o Reallocations
13. Reallocations of the GEF grant are proposed as follows: (a) US$470,000 from
Category 3.c MCSU Grant is reallocated to Category 3.a Goods; (b) US$59,714 from
Category 4.b Operation Costs and US$3,000,000 from Category 4.c MCSU Grant are
reallocated to Category 4.a Goods; and (c) US$859,885 from Category 5 Unallocated is
reallocated to Category L.a Goods. The detailed reallocated Categories are illustrated in
Annex 2.

﻿* Financial management (FM)
14. A financial management assessment has been conducted by the Financial
Management Specialist regarding the new proposed sub-projects under Part B of the
Project. The same FM arrangement (funds flow, internal control, and reporting) that was
agreed in 2009 will be followed. The national PMO and provincial PMOs will provide
practical and focused training to the new lAs to ensure that staffs understand the FM
requirements and disbursement procedures. The FM assessment also concluded that the
FM arrangement including the new sub-projects will satisfy the Bank's minimum
requirements under OP/BP 10.02.
* Procurement
15. A procurement capacity assessment has been conducted by the Procurement
Specialist regarding the three new lAs and they are considered to have adequate
procurement capacity to implement the project. The provincial PMOs will facilitate the
lAs' carrying out of the procurement activities to ensure the Bank's procurement
guidelines are followed. Furthermore, a procurement plan including the packages for the
three new sub-projects was reviewed and agreed.
D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
16. The Bank team has conducted due diligence work for the three new proposed power
plants since June 2011 and considers they are acceptable. The environmental
management plans and due diligence reports have been disclosed locally and in the
InfoShop. Based on the Bank team's review of the required preparation documents and
different implementation schedules of the three subprojects, retroactive financing is
proposed to be effective as of October 1, 2011.
17. Triggering the new safeguard policy (Safety of Dams, OP/BP 4.37) has been
consulted with the Regional Safeguard Secretariat and clearance was issued on
November 29, 2012 to proceed to appraisal from the safeguards perspective for the
proposed restructuring.
* Economic and financial analysis
18. The economic and financial analysis was conducted for the three additional power
plants to examine their economic and financial viability. The same methodology was
adopted to calculate both the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial
internal rates of return (FIRRs).
19. The EIRRs for Weihai, Wuxiang and Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant are 32.8%, 25.1%
and 16.4% respectively, exceeding both the hurdle level acceptable to the Government of
China - the 8% discount rate for investment project recommended by NDRC in 2006,
and the 10% EIRR benchmark that is normally applied to Bank's investment projects.
The FIRRs for the three sub-projects are 25.4%, 13.0% and 7.7% respectively, which are
attractive for the investors. The sensitivity analysis was conducted for both EIRRs and
10


﻿FIRRs to consider the uncertainty of investment cost and performance of the
rehabilitation. The results show both the economic and financial returns are robust.

Taiyuan No.1        7.7%                6.2%              5.2%
* Social
20. Most of the proposed project activities are for technical assistance and will not
involve major civil works, except the rehabilitation of the additional three power plants in
both Shanxi and Shandong Province, which include mechanical engineering works within
the plant facilities and small civil works within the plant boundary. There are no
resettlement or Indigenous Peoples related issues.
* Environment
21. The project is still classified as a "Category B" project according to the magnitude
of the environmental issues involved, the coverage area and the nature of the project
activities associated with the thermal power plant efficiency improvement.
22. The rehabilitation of the selected power plants under Part B of the Project will
result in significant benefits to the natural and socio-economic environment in the project
areas, including avoided coal handling and combustion due to efficiency improvement in
power generation and with consequent reductions in emissions of PM10, C02, SOx and
NOx. No serious adverse or irreversible environmental impacts are envisaged. The
adverse environmental impacts identified are very limited, temporary and localized
(mainly the noise and dust near to construction sites within the power plant during the
construction phase) and can be avoided or mitigated to acceptable levels, provided the
mitigation measures developed in the EMPs are properly implemented.
* Safety of Dams
23. The two reservoirs have been operated satisfactorily and safely. The dam owners
and management teams put strong emphasis on dam safety and the inspectors have more
than ten year of experience. The dam safety was enhanced with the completion of
rehabilitation of Guanhe reservoir in 2004 and the ecological restoration for Jinyanghu
11


﻿Lake in 2012. The dam safety performance can meet practical operation requirements for
both power plants.
24. For the purposes of ensuring safety of Jinyanghu and Guanhe Dams in relation to
the Wuxiang Hexin Power Generation Co.,Ltd and Guodian Taiyuan No.1 Electricity
Generation Co.,Ltd. under Shanxi Respective Parts of the Project, it was agreed that
Shanxi shall:
(a) Prepare a dam safety report, as a part of the Project progress reports, which shall
include, inter alia, the actions related to dam safety measures already taken and
such actions planned to be taken in the next phases; the safety status of the dams;
and the operation and maintenance status (including emergency preparedness);
and
(b) Provide support to the World Bank to enable it to visit the dams' sites when
necessary and provide relevant information concerning the dams' safety to the
World Bank upon request."
(c) Take promptly any additional safety measures, and carry out promptly any
remedial work, recommended by the government and the World Bank in related
to the dams.
