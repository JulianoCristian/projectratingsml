for\n            China received a satisfactory outcome rating with moderate\n            risk to global environment outcome. Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower received moderately satisfactory ratings for their\n            performances. The project was restructured three times. The\n            first restructuring extended the closing date by one year to\n            allow the project implementing agencies to complete the\n            planned project activities and achieve the project\n            development objective. The second restructuring included the\n            following changes: (1) amend the intermediate output\n            indicators; (2) adjust the project components; and (3)\n            adjust the implementation arrangement to include new\n            implementing agencies. The adjustment of the project\n            components included: (1) the scope of Part A of the Project\n            was reduced due to cancellation of two activities; and (2)\n            the scope of Part B of the Project was expanded to include\n            the rehabilitations of three additional power plants. As a\n            result, part of the GEF grant was reallocated from Part A to\n            Part B of the Project. The third restructuring saw the\n            closing date extend by another six months in order to\n            complete the pending national level studies and maximize the\n            influence of the project. The following lessons were learned\n            from this project: (1) Strong government commitment is\n            critical for project success, and the GOC has shown strong\n            ownership of the promotion of energy conservation to reduce\n            overall energy intensity. (2) Project design aligned with\n            country priorities. (3) Strong technical and financial\n            capacity of implementing agencies. The results of the plant\n            thermal efficiency improvement component are considered\n            highly satisfactory because the measured results indicators\n            well exceed the original targets. (4) Significant\n            demonstration effect of rehabilitation as a result of the\n            proper selection of technology (based on its competitiveness\n            and replication potential) and extensive dissemination\n            activities. (6) Although the two PDO level indicators are\n            appropriate for measuring the success of the aggregated\n            efficiency improvements and GHG impacts in the power sector\n            in the three provinces, additional indicators would have\n            provided more precise measurement of the output of the\n            project to enhance attribution, as the size of the GEF\n            project was quite small compared to the size of the sector\n            in the three provinces. (7) Flexibility is required to adapt\n            project implementation to evolving government priorities."}, "docdt": "2015-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
