This project restructuring\n            does not result in any change in the project objective. The\n            restructuring makes the following changes to the Project:\n            (1) trigger a new safeguard policy - Safety of Dams (OP/BP\n            4.37); (2) amend the intermediate output indicators; (3)\n            adjust the project components; and (4) adjust the\n            implementation arrangement to include new implementing\n            agencies. The proposed adjustment of the project components\n            include: (1) the scope of Part A of the Project is reduced\n            due to cancellation of two activities (closure of small\n            power plants and CHP online monitoring system in Shanxi\n            province); and (2) the scope of Part B of the Project is\n            expanded to include the rehabilitations of three additional\n            power plants, including: Weihai power plant in Shandong\n            province, Wuxiang Power Plant and Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant\n            in Shanxi province. As a result, part of the GEF grant is\n            reallocated from Part A to Part B of the Project. The\n            proposed changes are in response to the request of the\n            Government of China (GoC) made through three letters from\n            the Ministry of Finance dated November 3, 2011, February 7\n            and November 9, 2012. The changes aim to provide timely\n            support to the GoC's priority actions in improving the\n            efficiency of thermal power in China. The government put\n            closure of small generation units as a priority action in\n            its 11th Five-Year period (2006-2010) and aimed to complete\n            the rehabilitation of medium-size coal-fired thermal power\n            plants in its 12th Five-Year period (2011-2015). The\n            re-allocation of the GEF grant in the proposed project\n            restructuring is consistent with the GOC's priority\n            actions in both periods."}, "docdt": "2012-12-25T00:00:00Z"}
