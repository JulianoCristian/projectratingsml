F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project development objective is to reduce coal consumption and GHG emission per
unit of electricity production in Shanxi Province, Shandong Province and Guangdong
Province in China, through (i) mitigating the financial barriers of closing inefficient
small-sized coal-fired units; (ii) demonstrating the viability of investments in efficiency
improvements in existing mid-sized thermal units; and (iii) developing effective
regulations to implement the pilot ESD programs and conducting studies to support the
transition to efficient generation dispatch.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Predominance of Coal in China’s Energy Mix. When the project was conceived
in 2006, China was the world’s second largest energy user. Since 1990, energy
consumption had been increasing on average at 5.8% per year. China’s rising energy
demand had been met largely by domestic coal. Coal consumption reached about 1.7
billion tce in 2006, accounting for 69% of the country’s total energy consumption.
Various projections showed that coal would still constitute 60% or more of China’s
primary energy consumption by 2020.

2.      Coal had been the dominant source of electricity generation in China. Thermal
power generation capacity reached 484 GW in 2006, accounting for about 78% of the
622 GW total installed capacity and generating 83% of the 2,834 TWh total electricity
output in China. Of this thermal generation capacity, 422 GW was coal-fired, accounting
for about half of the country’s 2006 total coal consumption. The rapid expansion of
installed thermal power generation capacity and its primary reliance on coal had
contributed significantly to adverse environmental impacts in China.

3.     Low Efficiency of Coal-fired Power Generation. China’s coal-fired power plants
consumed considerably more coal per kWh of electricity supplied than the international
average. In 2006, coal-fired generation in China consumed an average 366 gce/kWh,
compared to a 300 gce/kWh benchmark in Japan or Europe. The main factors
contributing to China’s low power generation efficiency were: (i) China’s large share of
generation by inefficient small units; (ii) generation dispatch not optimized for achieving
maximum efficiency; (iii) small Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units operating for
power generation only; and (iv) old mid-sized coal-fired units operating at relatively high
coal consumption rate.

4.      Government Strategies. Chinese authorities at the highest levels had recognized
that a business-as-usual approach in the energy sector would lead to unacceptable
environmental consequences and strain the coal supply chain on an unprecedented scale.
The Government initiatives intended to improve efficiency and reduce coal consumption
in China were contained in its 1lth Five Year Plan (2006-2010), issued in early 2006 that
called for a 20% reduction of energy consumption per unit output of gross domestic
product (GDP) by 2010; and in the Medium and Long Term Energy Conservation Plan
issued in 2004 by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which
targeted a reduction of energy intensity from 2.68 tce per RMB 10,000 of GDP output in
2002 to 2.25 tce by 2010 and 1.54 tce by 2020.

5.      Specific GOC strategies to improve coal-fired thermal power generation
efficiency included: (i) closure of inefficient small coal-fired units and the addition of
new high-efficiency large-sized thermal units; (ii) introduction of efficient generation
dispatch, known as the Energy Saving Dispatch (ESD); (iii) adoption of new clean coal



                                             1
technologies such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC); (iv) investment in
energy efficient systems and the rehabilitation of existing generation units; and (v) scale-
up of renewable power generation.

6.      The GOC’s strategy for reducing the capacity share of inefficient small coal-fired
generation units sought to close down 50 GW of these units by 2010. Plant closure goals
for 2010 were negotiated in 2007 and NDRC signed agreements with 30 provincial
governments and seven major power companies for their closure goals. Early results had
been favorable, with 14.38 GW of small units closed by the end of 2007, exceeding the
national 2007 target of 10 GW. However, most of the units closed belonged to large
power generation companies which had the financial, institutional and technical capacity
to address the financial and social impact of such closures. Those units remaining to be
closed in 2009 and 2010 were smaller and mostly owned by municipal and county level
small power companies. These companies were less likely to be able to address the
financial and social impacts of closure in the allotted time without additional financial
support.

7.      Another element of the GOC's strategy for improving thermal power sector
efficiency was the replacement of existing dispatch practices with the ESD. This required
generation dispatch to follow a merit order of units, determined by their efficiency and
emission levels. The ESD would commence with pilots in five selected provinces, with
the intention later of being implemented nationally. The change in dispatch practice
would significantly reduce coal consumption for power generation. However, this would
also have a critical impact on the financial viability of less efficient units (due to the
reduction in generation), rendering these units unable to recover fixed costs at current
generation tariffs. Additionally, the ESD pilot required new technical regulations on
access, disclosure and verification of generation efficiency data that to date had not been
available at dispatch centers or used for dispatch. Although the startup of the pilot was
scheduled to commence by early 2008, it had been delayed until adequate regulation and
financial compensation mechanisms were implemented to address the associated
technical and financial barriers.

8.      Rationale for Bank involvement. Continued progress on improving coal-fired
power generation efficiency was vital if the GOC’s planned for a 20% reduction in GDP
energy intensity by 2010 was to be realized. Drawing from its international experience
and knowledge of similar undertakings, the Bank was well positioned to assist in
resolving the policy and technical issues associated with the GOC’s sector strategy.

9.      The proposed project continued and expanded the Bank’s support of the
Government’s efforts to develop policies that would help achieve environmental
sustainability of the energy sector. These efforts had included lending projects, analytical
and advisory activities and economic and sector work. More recently the Bank had been
working with the Government on the development of a new investment framework which
would promote clean energy and energy efficiency by combining carbon finance, Global
Environment Facility (GEF) funds and the newly established Climate Investment Funds
into lending operations. The GOC had requested this GEF project, and considered that it



                                             2
would provide a good opportunity to benefit from the Bank’s experience in its efforts to
improve the power sector efficiency in China.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

10.     The project development objective (PDO) was to reduce coal consumption and
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission per unit of electricity production in Shanxi province,
Shandong province, and Guangdong province in China, through (i) mitigating the
financial barriers of closing inefficient small-sized coal-fired units; (ii) demonstrating the
viability of investments in efficiency improvements in existing mid-sized thermal units;
and (iii) developing effective regulations to implement the pilot ESD programs as well as
conducting studies to support transition to efficient generation dispatch.

11.     Key performance indicators included: (i) average efficiency and GHG emissions
from coal-fired electricity generation in Shandong, Shanxi, and Guangdong provinces;
(ii) cumulative capacity of small coal-fired power generation units closed in Shandong
and Shanxi; (iii) thermal efficiency and GHG emission reduction from the units #1-4 of
Yangguang Thermal Power Plant in Shanxi; (iv) thermal efficiency and GHG emission
reduction from the units #7-8 at Huangtai Thermal Power Plant in Shandong; and (v)
thermal efficiency and GHG emission reduction from the units #5-6 of Jinan Beijiao
Thermal Power Plant in Shandong.

1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

12.    The GEO is the same as the PDO for the Project, and the PDO was not revised.

13.      The PDO level indicators were not changed. However, the intermediate outcome
indicators were revised to adapt to the changes in project sub-components, as a result of a
level I and two level II project restructurings. The changes to the intermediate outcome
indicators are summarized below:

       (i)        Removal of one sub-indicator—cumulative capacity of small-coal fired
                  power generation units closed in Shanxi province—as the sub-
                  component was dropped; and

       (ii)       Addition of the thermal efficiency improvement and GHG emission
                  reductions for three newly-added power plants under Component 2
                  (Guodian Taiyi and Wuxiang Hexin plants in Shanxi and Weihai
                  Botong power plant in Shandong).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.    The target beneficiaries were not described explicitly in the PAD. Based on the
description of the project components in the PAD, the main beneficiaries of the Project
included government agencies, owners of associated power plants, and three provincial




                                              3
power grid companies (Shandong, Shanxi, and Guangdong). Overall, the actual main
beneficiaries of the project included:

   (i)     Project implementing agencies (IAs) for a total of 15 power plants (6 for
           rehabilitation and nine for closure) and two provincial grid companies: (a) the
           rehabilitations were implemented in six coal-fired power plants owned by
           Huangtai Thermal Power Co., Ltd (in Shandong); Jinan Beijiao Thermal
           Power Co. Ltd (Shandong); Weihai Botong Heat and Power Co., Ltd
           (Shandong); Yangguang Thermal Power Co., Ltd (Shanxi); Wuxiang Hexin
           Power Generation Co., Ltd. (Shanxi); and Guodian Taiyi Power Generation
           Co., Ltd. (Shanxi); (b) the closure of small power plants were implemented in
           nine power plants in Shandong owned by six companies, namely Feicheng
           Company, Dongyue Company, Taishan Yangguang Company, Laiwu
           Xingyuang Company, Taishan Paper Manufacture Company, and Yichou
           Cement Company; and (c) both Shandong and Guangdong power grid
           companies;

   (ii)    National government agencies (MOF, National Energy Administration (NEA),
           State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) and Ministry of
           Environmental Protection (MEP)), and both Shandong and Shanxi provincial
           government agencies (Financial Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau
           (EPB), and Economic and IT Commissions); and

   (iii)   Investors of coal-fired power plants who benefited from the dissemination
           activities included in the Project.

1.5 Original Components

15.     The project had five components: (i) mechanisms to support the closure of
inefficient small coal-fired generation units; (ii) demonstration of power plant efficiency
improvements; (iii) transition to efficient generation dispatch; (iv) technical assistance for
project implementation; and (v) project management.

16.     Component 1: Mechanisms to Support the Closure of Inefficient Small Coal-
fired Generation Units (GEF Grant US$9.50 million and counterpart funds US$26.92
million). This component was planned to support the closure of inefficient small thermal
units and GHG emission reduction in Shandong (4,300 MW) and Shanxi (2,870 MW), by
2010. Both provinces had adequate capacity reserve and committed investment in new
generation capacities, which would ensure reliable power and heat supply along with the
closure. The capacity of small units to be closed exceeded, by 300 MW and 200 MW
respectively, the current provincial targets agreed with the NDRC. Out of the total target,
the GEF project was expected to support the closure of 2,910 MW in 2009 and 2010
(1583 MW in Shandong and 1327 MW in Shanxi). The component would support the
establishment and pilot operation of a transparent and effective financial incentive
mechanism for the closure of small units (MCSU). This would assist the small county
and municipal power companies in Shanxi and Shandong to recover part of the costs of



                                              4
closure, mainly the cost of addressing the social impact of the closure; establishing CHP
On-line Monitoring Systems to facilitate enforcement of government regulations for CHP
unit operation; and establishment of bulletin systems to enable the trading of emission
allowances entitled by small units closed on schedule. These revenues could be
complementary to the MCSU to partially offset the closure costs; and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) and knowledge sharing to facilitate replication of successful
experiences in other provinces of China.

17.     Component 2: Demonstration of Power Plant Efficiency Improvement (GEF
Grant US$3.59 million and counterpart funds US$52.77 million). This component was
planned to demonstrate plant efficiency improvement and GHG emission reduction
through three different types of investment activities: (i) conversion of mid-sized power
generation only units into CHP units, at Huangtai Thermal Power Plant in Shandong; (ii)
waste heat recovery at thermal power units and utilization for district heating, at Jinan
Beijiao Thermal Power Plant in Shandong; and (iii) improvement of power generation
efficiency resulting from plant energy audit recommendations, at Yangguang Thermal
Power Plant in Shanxi. Each project had been designed to improve the efficiency of
power and heat supply during the remaining life expectancy of the generation units. To
ensure successful demonstration, sustainability and replication, support would also be
provided for: (i) monitoring and assessment of the effectiveness of the three
demonstrative projects, knowledge sharing and publications; and (ii) establishment of
standard plant energy audit procedures and processes for identification and assessment of
efficiency improvement investment activities and best practices of plant operation and
maintenance (O&M).

18.     Component 3: Transition to Efficient Generation Dispatch (GEF Grant
US$4.07 million and counterpart funds US$3.23 million). This component was planned
to reduce system-wide coal consumption and GHG emission for power generation by
supporting the transition from current system dispatch practices to an efficient generation
dispatch optimized for coal savings. Firstly, support would be provided for the pilot
implementation of ESD in Guangdong Provincial Power Grid, including development or
improvement of the detailed regulations required to commence the piloting. This would
cover regulations for ESD financial compensation mechanisms, methodology and
procedures for monitoring thermal efficiency and emission levels of units required to
prepare the ESD merit order, and procedures for information disclosure to improve the
ESD transparency and monitoring; and a simulation system to test improvements in the
Guangdong Provincial Power Grid. Subsequently, the component would provide
continued support for the improvement of the approach and regulations for generation
dispatch and replication to other provinces. This included: (i) a comprehensive
assessment of the pilot ESD in all of the five pilot provinces after their first 12 months of
operation, to identify recommendations on further improvement of the dispatch approach
and regulations; (ii) key studies on generation pricing and tariff reform to phase out the
ESD financial compensation mechanisms and to make the development of power markets
compatible with the transition to efficient generation dispatch; and (iii) knowledge
sharing and consensus building to support the improvement of the dispatch approach,
regulations and replication.

19.    Component 4: Technical Assistance for Project Implementation (GEF Grant
US$1.27 million and counterpart funds US$0.59 million). This component was planned
to support the hiring of international and local consultants for operational management,
technical advisory, procurement and financial management (FM) at various implementing
agencies (IA) to support project implementation, M&E and replication of successful
experience and practices.

20.    Component 5: Project Management (GEF Grant US$0.41 million and
counterpart funds US$1.51 million). This component provided budget support for the
incremental operating costs of various IAs resulting from the project implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

21.  Project components were not revised but sub-components were changed for
Component 1 and 2 as the results of three project restructurings.

22.       The changes made for Component 1 and 2 were as follows:

         Sub-component “support to closure of small coal-fired units” was canceled in
          Shanxi and reduced in size in Shandong because both provincial governments
          accelerated the closure of small coal-fired units for 2006-2010. Substantial
          financial incentives (more than expected by the Bank team at appraisal) were
          provided by both provincial and central governments to the affected power
          companies. The anticipated social risk caused by the closure of small units
          (mainly loss of jobs and financial losses for the investors) were mitigated.

       Sub-component “establishment of a CHP online monitoring in Shanxi” was
        canceled as the Shanxi provincial government decided not to establish such a
        monitoring system as the amount of existing CHP units had been reduced
        substantially after most of the small coal-fired units were closed.

         Sub-component “support to the establishment of electronic bulletin systems for
          emission allowances of closed small coal-fired units in Shandong and Shanxi”
          was modified to support the pilot emission trading systems in both Shandong and
          Shanxi province. The provincial EPBs in both provinces ramped up their efforts
          to promote the emission trading systems to meet the stricter targets of pollutants
          emission reduction imposed by the central government.

         Component 2 was expanded from supporting the innovative rehabilitations of
          three power plants to six power plants. To further showcase the commercial
          viability of selected innovative rehabilitation technologies, three additional
          thermal plants were selected for the pilot technology demonstration. The power
          plants were selected based on the demonstration technology for rehabilitation,
          environmental and social impacts, as well as sustainability and replication



                                               6
        potential in the province and country, to maximize the value added by the
        available GEF grant resources.

1.7 Other significant changes

23.     The project closing date was extended twice from the original December 31, 2012
to June 30, 2014, through two Level II project restructurings.

24.  The GEF grant was reallocated to cover the changes of Component 1 and 2, as
summarized in Table 1 below:

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

25.     The background analysis for the project design (Section 1.1) was sound and
adequately identified the issues and barriers to be addressed. Sector analysis together
with consultations with key stakeholders in the sector had positioned the project at the
right entry points. Taking into account the prevailing context in China during project
preparation, the three specific strategies of the GOC in improving efficiency of coal-fired
power generation were analyzed: (i) closing down inefficient small coal-fired units; (ii)
investment in rehabilitation of existing generation units; and (iii) support for the pilot and
later replication of ESD.

26.     The project was expected to support the Government of China in meeting its
energy intensity target by addressing key barriers/issues prevailing in China’s power
sector. The removal of those barriers and issues is essential to the success of China’s
power sector energy efficiency strategy and reducing the reliance of power generation on
coal. The Bank’s prior experience with small mine closures, the rehabilitation of thermal
power plants, and power sector reform put it in a good position to support the GOC in
achieving its objectives.

27.     In addition, the project directly supported Pillar 3 of the Bank’s Country Strategy
Partnership for China (2006-2010), the Bank Climate Change Strategy, and the Bank’s
strategy in promoting carbon reduction. It was also consistent with the Strategic
Objective of the GEF Interim Strategy under which the retrofit of power plants was
supported.

28.     The project design was generally sound. The objective of the project was highly
aligned with China’s energy intensity reduction target. The project targeted three strategic
areas that could significantly contribute to the achievement of the government’s national
target for its 11th FYP. The GEF project was prepared to align its support to address the
various identified technical, financial, and social barriers in the three areas. In addition,
the design of the project also incorporated a combination of lessons emerging from
international experience related to the rehabilitation of thermal power plants and lessons
from earlier Bank operations related to mine closures and power sector reform in China
and other countries (such as Russia and Poland).

29.     The first component (1) of the GEF project was designed to leverage the GEF
grant to facilitate the closure process in Shanxi and Shandong. It aimed at setting a
national example of sound social and financial management for the closure of small
thermal units. However, in hindsight, the design underestimated the government’s
commitment to these closures during the 11th FYP, and overestimated the GEF resource


                                              8
required to reach the target of this component. This was due to the fact that GOC raised
its compensation standards and provided more-than-expected social protection measures
to resettle workers affected by the closures during the project implementation period, and
the expected major social risks related to the closures were thus largely mitigated. As a
result, the project was restructured to reallocate the GEF grant to support more innovative
rehabilitation technologies under Component 2 to meet the same project objective.

30.     The second component (2) on power plant rehabilitation was well designed. It
showcased a holistic approach to improve the efficiency of thermal plants by (i) using
energy audits to identify areas for efficiency improvement, (ii) piloting leading energy-
saving technologies, and (iii) promoting best practice for plant operation and maintenance.
The piloting technologies were competitively selected based on energy saving potential
and potential of replication. Knowledge dissemination was given a priority in the project
design to bring about demonstration effect.

31.     The design of the third component (3) was well thought-through as it aimed to
address a number of technical and financial barriers that could have led to delays or
failures for the pilot ESD. While the pilot ESD simulation system helped identify optimal
dispatch rules to improve the operation of the existing ESD in Guangdong, the upstream
policy studies targeted key policy gaps for sustaining ESD and for its national roll-out.

32.     There were clear indications of strong GOC ownership and commitment to
improving the thermal efficiency of the power sector. The central government had issued
several new sector regulations during project preparation and signed agreements on
closure targets with the provincial governments and major power companies. Its
commitment to the closures was also reflected in the accelerated work by the Shanxi
provincial government, which led to the cancellation of subcomponents for Shanxi under
Component 1.

33.      In 2007, the central government issued the ESD principles and called for an ESD
pilot in five selected provinces. The activities supported under the GEF project were
complementary to the GOC’s own initiatives.

34.    Most risks were adequately identified and rated. The overall rating of risk to
achieving the PDO was modest at appraisal. Table 2 summarizes the risks envisaged at
appraisal along with a brief review of them at ICR.

                     Unfamiliarity with Bank requirements

35.   Most of the risks envisaged at appraisal did not materialize. These include weak
government enforcement capacity and risks associated with the closures and delayed
ESD implementation, which were rated as either modest or high at appraisal.

36.     Some of the risks materialized but did not hamper the PDO. For component 1, the
preparation of the operational manual to guide the closure of small thermal units was
delayed and support under component 1 was reduced. The manual, however, was later
used as an input by MOF to issue a national policy. For component 3, the study on
financial compensation regulation under the ESD did not lead to the issuance of an
anticipated national policy, as the issuance of this policy is strongly linked to several
ongoing power sector reforms (e.g., pricing reform), which are outside the control of the
Bank and the Project. The weak capacity of some project implementing agencies and
unfamiliarity with Bank requirements also hampered the project implementation and
resulted in extension of the project closing date by one and half years.

2.2 Implementation

37.    The project implementation in the three provinces followed generally the planned
schedule and the planned targets were achieved:

   (i)     Project targets under Component 1, Closure of Small Units, were achieved in
           both Shandong and Shanxi province much earlier than expected due to the
           strong government commitments. The achievement reduced the need of GEF
           grant to support the closure of small units under Component 1. Timely project
           restructuring was made to reallocate the GEF grant to support more innovative
           rehabilitation technologies under Component 2 to achieve the same project
           objective.



                                           10
   (ii)    The implementation of Component 2, Demonstration of Power Plant
           Efficiency Improvement, was implemented as planned and the expected
           results were achieved. With the project restructuring, additional activities
           were supported under the component to finance the rehabilitation of three
           additional power plants and demonstrate the EE potential of the identified
           technologies.

   (iii)   The planned activities under Component 3, Transition to Energy Saving
           Dispatch, were all completed with some delays. This was caused by
           unfamiliarity of Bank’s procedures of the PMU and inadequate
           communication among different parties at the early stage of project
           implementation. With the enhanced project supervision by the Bank team, the
           issue was addressed and the implementation of the Component was
           accelerated.

38.     The project was once rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory due to the slow
disbursement, though this issue was resolved with the completion of project
restructurings, enhanced project supervision and capacity building of the NPMO and
PMUs. The main factors caused the project at risk included mainly:

   (i)     Slower than anticipated project implementation was highly linked to weak
           project management capacity of the NPMO/PMUs. At the outset of project
           implementation, the weak project management capacity of the NPMO/PMUs
           was mainly due to their lack of experience with GEF/Bank projects. This issue
           was addressed by the Bank’s intensified supervision. The results were
           encouraging as the commitment and disbursement rates of the GEF grant
           climbed up markedly. During middle and later stages of the project,
           implementation suffered from frequent staff turnover in Shandong PMU (once
           every one or two years) and key personnel (executive director) changes in the
           NPMO. The frequent and key staff changes weakened management capacity
           of the NPMO and the Shandong PMU, which in turn prevented the project
           from being rated fully satisfactory on implementation progress.

   (ii)    Insufficient communication between the Bank team and NPMO/PMUs
           adversely affected project progress during early stages of implementation. The
           NPMO/PMUs were new to the GEF project and needed proper guidance from
           the World Bank to implement the project. The issue was addressed quickly
           with the intervention of the Bank management together with more enhanced
           and flexible supervision adopted by the Bank team.

39.     Intensified project supervision was adopted to accelerate the project
implementation. Following the first mission, an intensified supervision strategy was
adopted by the Bank team to speed up implementation. In addition to the bi-annual
supervision missions, the Bank team conducted frequent missions to meet the clients’
needs, in particular during 2011-2012. The missions provided timely, flexible and



                                            11
adaptive guidance to the NPMO/PMUs to strengthen their procurement and financial
management capacities, and enhanced their coordination for dissemination of project
outputs at the national level. Considerable progress was achieved and total disbursement
went up from negligible in the 2nd quarter of 2010 to around 65 percent in the 2nd
quarter of 2013.

40.     The Project underwent three restructurings – two level II restructuring to extend
the project closing date by a total of 1.5 years (from December 31, 2012 to June 30,
2014) and one level I restructuring to change the project component 1 and 2 and
reallocate the GEF grant in January 2013. No changes to the PDO or GEO were made.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.     M&E design. The GEF project was designed to reduce coal consumption and
GHG emission per unit of electricity production in Shanxi province, Shandong province,
and Guangdong province in China. Therefore, the two quantitative PDO level indicators
selected for the project were fully aligned with the PDO and designed as reduction in
average coal consumption per kWh output (coal-fired units) and reduction of GHG
emission per kWh output (coal-fired units) in the three provinces. During the project
restructuring, the PDO level indicators were kept unchanged, while the intermediate
indicators were modified (see Section 1.3).

42.      M&E implementation. To measure progress towards the targets of the original
indicators, the required data were collected semiannually by the provincial PMUs and
assessments were documented in project progress reports. All required data and
information were collected when the provincial statistical data was available; the annual
statistical data for the provinces normally is available to the public in the second half of
the following year. The quality and reliability of the data used in the ICR is consistent
with agreed methodologies.

43.     M&E utilization. All PDO level indicators exceeded their original targets and
intermediate indicator targets were mostly met, with minor shortcomings. The
satisfactory results of the project were broadly communicated to a wide range of
stakeholders, in particular in the case of the thermal plant rehabilitation components. The
significant demonstration effect, via extensive dissemination activities, led to a wide
replication of the GEF-supported energy-saving technologies, resulting in greater energy
savings on a much broader geographic scale. The selected demonstration technologies,
including conversion of power plants to combined heat and power generation in Huangtai
plant, utilization of waste heat in Beijiao plant, and application of variable frequency
control technology in Yangguang plant, have been widely utilized in the power sector in
China; the later-on demonstration of peaking cooling technology in Wuxiang plant and
installation of phased heat exchanger to recover waste heat in Taiyi plant were also listed
as recommended technologies in Shanxi province to meet the provincial EE target in
power sector in 2014.




                                             12
44.     At the national level, the achievement of satisfactory energy-saving results, along
with targeted policy studies, contributed to the issuance of several national policies on EE
in thermal plants such as Adminstrative Measures on Fiscal Incentives on Energy-saving
Technologies, issued by MOF and NDRC in 2011, and Notice on Undertaking
Comprehensive Upgrading of Coal-fired Power Plants, issued by MOF and NDRC in
2012.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

45.     Environmental. The Environmental Assessment safeguards policy was triggered
and the project was classified as a “Category B” project. Environmental Management
Plans (EMPs) were prepared for the nine closed small power plants and the six existing
plants for rehabilitation following an approved Environmental Management Framework.
Overall environmental performance of all concerned thermal power plants was
satisfactory. Environmental monitoring of noise, dust, waste water, and solid waste
during project implementation was carried out regularly to ensure EMPs were followed.
The monitoring data showed that the plants fully complied with relevant environmental
standards and met the standards set in the Environmental Management Plan.

46.     Social. The Involuntary Resettlement safeguards policy was triggered. The
implementation of involuntary resettlement was rated satisfactory as the approved
Resettlement Plan Framework and resettlement plans associated with the nine closed
small power plants had been followed. The support to the closure of the nine small
thermal plants was completed in June 2013. Adequate compensation and social protection
measures for settlement of affected workers were provided. The post evaluation activity
did not identify any remaining social issues.

Fiduciary

47.     Procurement. Procurement performance was rated as satisfactory. Procurement
was carried out generally in accordance with Bank procurement policies and procedures.
No major issues were encountered. However, the prior and post review identified some
minor procurement issues. In 2010-2011, some individual consultants and suppliers
experienced delayed payments. In addition, the Shandong PMU was found to
insufficiently maintain the record of procurement documents. Furthermore, Shandong
PMU procured some contracts not in line with the agreed procurement plan. The above-
mentioned issues were successfully addressed with proactive actions by Bank team.

48.     Financial management. Financial management performance under all three
components was moderately satisfactory. The financial reports were submitted timely
generally and all audited financial reports were unqualified. Several minor issues were
identified during the project implementation. These issues included (i) implementing
agencies (in all three provinces) initially did not follow MOF Circular #13 to set up a



                                            13
separate project ledger; (ii) the NPMO and Shanxi PMU initially did not carry out project
accounting and financial reporting in accordance with MOF Circular #13; (iii) Shanxi
PMU charged operating expenditures to the Designated Account (although small amounts,
this is an ineligible expenditure per grant agreement); (iv) supporting documents for
disbursement related to the closure of the small coal-fired plants in Shandong were
insufficient to ensure the fund was used for its intended purpose; (v) record keeping of
original supporting documents and accounting records was not well maintained by the
Shandong PMU; and (vi) a second RMB account, in addition to the Designated Account,
was created by Shandong Provincial Financial Bureau, which was not allowed without
the Bank’s permit. The Bank team provided several trainings and the above-mentioned
issues were addressed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

49.    This section discusses the sustainability and replicability of Project interventions.

50.     Sustainability. The project supported closure of small power plants and
demonstrated rehabilitation of coal-fired thermal power plants to improve their
efficiencies, as well as the associated studies and dissemination activities. The policies
derived from these activities, including (i) national fiscal incentives to phase out
inefficient capacity during the 12th FYP (2011-2015), (ii) fiscal incentives to promote
further rehabilitation to upgrade existing coal-fired thermal power plants, and (iii)
dissemination materials to summarize the good practices of power plant rehabilitations,
contributed to the continuous actions in power sector in China to close inefficient power
plant and improve the efficiencies of existing coal-fired power plants after the project
closure.

51.     The ESD system in Guangdong province is kept operation after the closure of the
Project. The ESD simulation system has been used to improve the real-time ESD
operation in the province.

52.   The National PMO got trained through the implementation of the Project, and has
worked with the Bank team in preparing another GEF project – GEF Establish M&V
System for Energy Efficiency in China Project.

53.     Replicability. The project was focused in three provinces, but the good practices
and experience learned from the Project were disseminated to wider audiences (both
government agencies and power enterprises) through the dissemination activities under
the Project. The power plants supported under the Project were visited frequently as show
cases of the good practices in improving the efficiency of coal-fired power plants, then
replicated across the country. The innovative technologies were replicated, such as
conversion of power plant to combined heat and power plants, utilization of waste heat
for heating or power purpose, and application of variable frequency control technology.

54.     A sub-component under Component 1 was to support the pilot SO2 emission
trading in both Shanxi and Shandong province, including the design and trial operation of



                                            14
the pilot trading system. This work served as a key test towards the national pollutants
emission trading scheme, and led to the issuance of Guidance Note on Further Promotion
of Paid Use of Pollutants Emission Allowance and Pilot Trade by the State Council in
2014, in which the experience collected under the Project was expanded to more
provinces.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

55.     The objectives of the GEF project—reductions of coal consumption and GHG
emissions per unit of coal-fired electricity production—not only are still highly relevant,
but also have become essential as China continues to move aggressively in energy
conservation, climate change mitigation, and pollution control during its 12th FYP period
(2011-2015). As part of its 12th FYP, the GOC is targeting to further reduce energy
intensity by 16 percent at the end of 2015, relative to the 2010 level.

56.      The project’s design and implementation remain highly relevant as closure of
inefficient coal-fired units, thermal plant rehabilitation, and pollutants emission control
are still considered high priorities in China’s 12th FYP (2011-2015). For this 12th FYP
period, GOC planned to (i) close another 20 GW of inefficient thermal generation units
by 2015; (ii) encourage energy efficient rehabilitation related to CHP, variable frequency
motors, and waste heat recovery (also the focus of rehabilitation supported by the GEF
project); (iii) reduce SO2 emissions by 8 percent from the 2010 level; and (iv) reduce coal
consumption per unit of coal-fired electricity production to 325 gce/kWh, a reduction of 8
percent compared to the 2010 level.

57.     The project’s objective and design remain consistent with the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS, FY2013-2016) for China. The China CPS supports shifting to a
sustainable energy path as one of the supporting pillars. It is also in line with the WBG
energy sector strategy, designed to help client countries secure an affordable, reliable,
and sustainable energy supply needed to end extreme poverty and promote shared
prosperity. Therefore, the relevance of objectives and design is rated as Satisfactory.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

58.    The PDO and GEO of the GEF project are the same: to reduce coal consumption
and GHG emissions per unit of electricity production in Shanxi province, Shandong
province, and Guangdong province in China.

59.    The GEF project contributed to the achievement of the PDO through (i) closing
down inefficient small coal-fired units. The small generation units had a high coal
consumption rate per electricity output and the project clearly contributed to the closure
of small units in Shandong province; (ii) demonstrating the viability of energy-saving
technologies in thermal plants. The project directly supported the rehabilitation of six




                                            15
coal-fired power plants and widely disseminated the knowledge for replication; and (iii)
supporting the transition to energy-saving dispatch in Guangdong.

60.       All PDO level indicators well exceeded the original targets in all three provinces.

         The average coal consumption per unit of coal-fired electricity output in three
          provinces was reduced to a level below the project target level. In Shanxi, it was
          reduced from 373 to 347 gce/kWh, while the project target was 354 gce/kWh; in
          Shandong, it went down from 382 to 332 gce/kWh (project target was 366
          gce/kWh); and in Guangdong it was reduced from 342 to 299 gce/kWh, while the
          target was 330 gce/kWh.

         GHG emissions per unit of coal-fired electricity output in the three provinces also
          dropped to levels below the project target. In Shanxi, it was reduced from 1,020 to
          951 kgCO2/MWh, while the target was 970 kgCO2/MWh; in Shandong, it went
          down from 1,045 to 909 kgCO2/MWh, while the target was 1,002 kgCO2/MWh;
          and in Guangdong it was reduced from 935 to 815 kgCO2/MWh, with a target of
          900 kgCO2/MWh.

61.    Achievements in intermediate outcomes were also satisfactory. The GEF project
prepared a transparent financial incentive mechanism to guide the closure of small
thermal power plants. The mechanism provided technical inputs to the issuance of a
national policy, Central Government Fiscal Incentives to Phase out Inefficient Capacity,
which was issued by MOF in 2011 and guides the further closure of 20 GW in inefficient
capacity during the 12th FYP period.

62.     The project also demonstrated the commercial viability of six rehabilitation
technologies and brought about significant demonstration effect. Most of the technologies
have become standard industry practice in today’s thermal plant rehabilitation. Two
technical studies, which complemented the demonstration project, contributed to the
issuance of two national policies regarding plant rehabilitation in China, i.e.
Administrative Measures on Fiscal Incentives on Energy-saving Technologies issued
jointly by MOF and NDRC in 2011, and Notice on Undertaking a Comprehensive
Upgrading of Coal-fired Power Plants issued jointly by MOF and NDRC in 2012.

63.     The ESD simulation system developed under the Project and the associated
equivalent financial compensation mechanism (the generation from the less efficient
power plants was reduced but these plants were compensated from their provision of
additional auxiliary service) became an essential tool to improve the actual ESD dispatch
rule in Guangdong. The system is expected to continue to play an important role because
the ESD model will likely be continued under the 13th FYP in Guangdong.

64.     Based on the evidence of the results of the project, the efficacy of the operation is
rated as Satisfactory.




                                               16
 3.3 Efficiency

 65.     The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of
 return (FIRRs) were recalculated based on the same methodology applied at appraisal,
 using actual costs and benefits. The EIRRs were estimated using a cost benefit analysis,
 while the FIRRs were estimated through a cash flow analysis. Costs included investment
 and O&M cost, while the economic benefits included coal savings and environmental
 benefits. The results of the calculation at ICR and appraisal are summarized in Table 3
 and detailed in Annex 3. Based on the results of the project and anticipated risks
 associated with the demonstration of pilot technologies, the efficiency of the operation is
 rated as Satisfactory.

 66.    For Huangtai, Beijiao, and Yangguang thermal power plants, the EIRRs and
 FIRRs are all higher at ICR compared to appraisal because actual capital expenditures
 were significantly below the levels anticipated at appraisal. In addition, Yangguang
 thermal plant saved more coal than estimated at appraisal, resulting in greater savings
 from the reduction of coal expenditure.

 67.     For Wuxiang, Taiyi, and Weihai thermal power plants, the EIRRs and FIRRs are
 all lower at ICR compared to appraisal/restructuring stage because of the decrease in coal
 price, which has reduced the benefit of the coal savings. In addition, the actual coal
 savings for both Taiyi and Weihai power plants were lower than expected.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The GEF project successfully implemented three targeted interventions that were
in line with government priorities during the 11th FYP. Those targeted areas of
interventions remain priorities on the government energy conservation agenda for the 12th
FYP.

69.     All PDO level indicators well exceeded the original targets in all three provinces
and achievements in intermediate outcomes were also satisfactory. In summary, the GEF
project played an important role in the thermal efficiency improvement in the three
provinces and also promoted the efficiency improvement at the national level through its
support to the national policy development and dissemination activities. At the project
closing, all three major components have been implemented satisfactorily and the
PDO/GEO has been achieved and surpassed. All the PDO/GEO indicators have well
exceeded their original targets. Therefore, based on a Satisfactory rating for the relevance
of objectives and design, Satisfactory rating for efficacy and Satisfactory rating for
efficiency, the overall Satisfactory outcome rating is justified.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.     Social Development. The closure of small units involved the envisaged
unemployment of substantial amount of workers, and this issue was paid high attention in
both the project design and implementation. Total affected workers amounted to 1,160
from the nine closed power plants under Component 1 of the project. Following the
MCSU manual, the resettlement of the affected workers were handled and monitored. All
affected workers got their new job as staff in other power plants or associated business
operated by the original owners of the closed power plants after training. Third-party
monitoring was arranged and monitoring report was prepared for each power plant. The
findings showed that the social issue was handled satisfactorily.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

71.    The GEF project has substantially strengthened the institutional capacity of the
following key stakeholders:

     Government Agencies (MOF, NEA, SERC): The project has improved the capacity
   of government agencies in developing an enabling legal, policy, and regulatory
   environment related to thermal power efficiency through introduction of international
   experience and dissemination of valuable experience from the GEF project.

     Thermal power plants (Shanxi and Shandong): By piloting leading energy-saving
   technologies, the project successfully raised awareness among the six thermal



                                            18
   generation companies of the energy saving potential of EE measures. At least three
   companies have used their own funds to continue with EE retrofit following the GEF
   project. In addition, the project also improved the plants’ technical capacity in
   implementing EE measures.

     Thermal power industry: Through a variety of dissemination activities on the
   successful rehabilitation experience of the thermal plants and through
   seminars/workshops on the plants’ standard energy audit procedure and O&M best
   practices, the GEF project has brought about remarkable demonstration effects. The
   demonstration effects have raised awareness in EE and improved the technical
   capacity of thermal power plants, mainly in Shanxi and Shandong, in implementing
   EE retrofits.

     Guangdong Power Grid Corporation: The GEF project has strengthened the
   technical capacity of the Guangdong Power Grid Corporation in improving and
   optimizing energy-saving dispatch in Guangdong. This was accomplished by
   financing the development of the ESD simulation system, an information disclosure
   system, and the CHP online monitoring system.

     Shandong Power Grid Company: The GEF project has enhanced the technical
   capacity of Shandong Power Grid Company to enforce government policy on
   monitoring heat supply from CHP plants and support the provincial government
   authority in allocating planned generation for CHP plants based on their heat supply
   data.

     Provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs in Shanxi and Shandong:
   The project directly contributed to the development and strengthening of technical
   capacity of Shanxi and Shandong EPBs in designing and operating SO2 emission
   allowance trading systems. It also enhanced EPB capacity in effectively regulating
   and controlling total pollutants emissions at the provincial level. The project
   indirectly developed and improved the technical capacity of EPBs of other provinces
   via study tours and seminars on the experience in Shanxi and Shandong.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

72.     In the project design, one activity under Component 1 was to study and support
for trading of emission allowances, specifically (i) bulletin system for trading of SO2
emission allowance for those small units to be closed, and (ii) assessment of SO2
emission allowance trading. During the project implementation, the Bank team noted that
the SO2 emission allowance trading had been moved more advanced than planned. Per
discussion with both province government agencies, the activity was adjusted to support
the design and trial operation of the SO2 trading system in both provinces. The
achievement was satisfactory and the SO2 emission trading scheme in Shanxi ranked the
top among all pilot provinces. This work served as a key test towards the national
pollutants emission trading scheme, and led to the issuance of Guidance Note on Further




                                          19
Promotion of Paid Use of Pollutants Emission Allowance and Pilot Trade by the State
Council in 2014.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

73.     Based on the speech made by high-level government officials in the closing
workshop and consultation with the IAs during the ICR mission, all parties commended
the significant contributions of the project to the achievement of China’s national target
of energy intensity reduction, and also highlighted that the GEF project successfully
targeted the three strategic areas in line with government priorities for energy
conservation in the 11th and 12th FYPs. The IAs also mentioned that their participation
raised their awareness of the energy-saving potential of rehabilitation technologies while
they appreciated the Bank’s support, and some of them also expressed intentions to
continue collaboration with the Bank to further improve their plants’ thermal efficiency.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low to Moderate

74.   The overall risk to sustaining the development outcome of the GEF project is low-
to-moderate.

75.     The government of China set a national target to close down 50 GW of inefficient
small thermal units during 2006-2010. This target was surpassed by 25% at the end of
2010. The anticipated social and financial risks associated with the closures were largely
mitigated as the central and provincial governments raised their compensation standards
and provided sufficient social protection measures to resettle affected workers. Moving
from the 11th FYP (2006-10) to the 12th FYP (2011-2015), the central government
planned to close down another 20 GW of inefficient capacity, an indication of sustained
government commitment to the optimization of the country’s power generation mix. Thus,
the risk to the development outcome of component 1 is low.

76.      The GEF project piloted six EE retrofit technologies, demonstrated their
commercial viability, and supported the issuance of national policies on thermal plant
rehabilitation. It provided a holistic approach to efficiency improvements in thermal
plants. The project brought about significant demonstration effects as the supported
retrofit technologies are currently widely used in thermal plant rehabilitation. During the
12th FYP, thermal plant rehabilitation continues to be a top government priority. The
strong government commitment to its energy intensity target ensures that thermal
efficiency rehabilitation in power plants will continue on an increasing scale. As a result,
the risk to the development outcome of component 2 is low.

77.    Guangdong piloted ESD operation under the 11th FYP and continued it under the
  th
12 . ESD operations are also very likely to be continued into the 13th FYP. The
continuation of the ESD policy in Guangdong will sustain the important role of the ESD
simulation system in improving and optimizing the actual ESD dispatch rules. The risk to
the development outcome of component 3 is low.



                                             20
78.    The risk to the development outcome of component 3 at the national level,
however, is moderate, as the decision whether to roll out ESD at the national level has not
yet been made. The project supported a comprehensive evaluation of ESD pilots in five
provinces. The results showed that the overall contribution of ESD to coal consumption
reduction per kWh (as measured before and after the ESD pilot operation) is moderate,
with the ESD contribution varying among provinces in a range from 0.7 gce/kWh in
Guizhou to 3.98 gce/kWh in Sichuan (1.0 gce/kWh in Guangdong).

79.     The GEF project also supported a number of policy studies to create an enabling
environment for ESD, in particular addressing the compensation mechanisms for less
efficient thermal plants that would suffer financial loss under the ESD. However, none of
the policy studies have led to the issuance of national policies or regulations. This is
because issuance of those policies or regulations is strongly linked to much broader
power sector reforms, including pricing reform. The uncertainties in other key sector
reforms may slow down the promotion of ESD at the national level.

80.    Based on the above analysis, it is concluded that the overall risk to sustaining the
development outcome of the GEF project is low to moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

81.    The Bank’s support for the project was built upon a solid rationale and Bank
performance in ensuring quality at Entry is considered satisfactory. The background
analysis was sound and enabled the project to be positioned in line with key aspects of
the government’s plan for improving sector efficiency.

82.     The design was generally appropriate. The project concept was well aligned with
the government’s top priorities for energy conservation and emission reductions in its
11th FYP. These areas continue to be the priorities during the 12th FYP. Lessons learned
from previous Bank-financed projects in mine closures and rehabilitation of thermal
power plants in a number of countries were taken into account during the project
preparation. Problems encountered during the implementation were identified and
solutions were proactively sought and implemented to enhance the probability of success
for the project. However it should also be noted that the allocation of GEF grant for each
component could be re-balanced as the resource required for Component 1, Closure of
Small Units, was overestimated in the project design though it was adjusted through
project restructuring.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                   21
83.    The overall performance of Bank’s supervision of the GEF project was
moderately satisfactory. Intensive and flexible project supervision was adopted during the
major part of the project implementation period when an earlier stage inadequate
communication was notified by the Bank management and prompt action was taken in
the Bank side.

84.     Following the first supervision mission, intensified supervision was adopted by
the Bank team and close communications with the NPMO/PMUs were established to
speed up project implementation. In between the formal biannual supervision missions,
the Bank organized a number of technical assistance missions to provide timely guidance
and financial management and procurement trainings to the NPMO/PMUs whenever
necessary. The NPMO gradually improved its management effectiveness and enhanced
its coordination with provincial PMUs. The PMUs also developed adequate management
capacity. As a result, project commitment and disbursement rates rapidly increased.

85.     The Bank team also showed flexibility and willingness to make timely
adjustments to adapt the project to the shifting provincial priorities. This is evident from
the project restructuring, in which cancellation of the sub-component for the closure of
small thermal units in Shanxi (a result of the rapid progress made by the provincial
government) and the resources earmarked for the closure were re-allocated to other
emerging government priorities, including the pollutants emission allowance trading
system and innovative rehabilitation demonstration of an additional three thermal power
plants. These changes kept the project objective achievable during the whole project
implementation period.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.     The Bank team concentrated on development effectiveness and sustainability of
thermal efficiency of the power sector. The team also demonstrated flexibility to meet the
client’s demand during project implementation, provided intensive guidance and trainings
to the NPMO/PMUs, and made best efforts to provide timely solutions to major issues
encountered though the communication with the PMO/PMUs could be improved at the
early stage of the project implementation. Overall, the Bank performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

87.    The GOC showed strong commitment to and ownership of thermal efficiency
improvements in the power sector. From 2006-2010, China achieved a stunning 19.1
percent energy efficiency improvement; 76 GW of small inefficient coal-fired units were
closed down, an increase of 50 percent compared to the original target of 50 GW of
closures. Sufficient fiscal incentives were provided to support EE rehabilitation of


                                             22
medium- and large-size thermal units in the 11th FYP. The rehabilitation of thermal plants
continues to be a top priority during the 12th FYP. In addition, ESD was successfully
piloted in five provinces. An evaluation was carried out to distill lessons learned, which
has provided recommendations for the further improvement of ESD operations.

88.     During project implementation, government officials requested the GEF project
for a range of analytical and advisory studies as inputs to the government’s EE policies
and regulations in the power sector. Both deputy director generals of the International
Department and the Economic and Construction Department (both at MOF) attended the
project closing workshop and acknowledged the remarkable contributions of the GEF
project to China’s thermal efficiency improvement in the power sector.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately to Highly Satisfactory

89.    Overall performance of implementing agencies is rated as satisfactory. Individual
IA performance, however, varies.

90.     The performance of the six thermal power companies is rated as highly
satisfactory. The six thermal power companies mobilized sufficient funds of their own to
ensure the timely completion of their rehabilitation. The companies also have adequate
technical capacity to ensure the successful completion of their rehabilitation.

91.     The performance of the Shanxi EPB is rated as highly satisfactory. Shanxi EPB
played a strong leadership role in advancing the agenda for SO2 emission allowance
trading at the provincial level and the trading volume has been growing since the
inception of the trading system. The Shanxi model has become a good example for other
provinces to follow.

92.     The performance of the Shanxi PMU and Guangdong PMU is rated as satisfactory.
Despite a lack of experience with Bank projects at an early stage of the project, the PMUs
quickly improved their project management capacity. Shanxi PMU successfully
coordinated project implementation with Shanxi EPB and the three thermal power plants.
The progress of project implementation at the later stage of implementation was
satisfactory. In addition, Guangdong PMU had adequate capacity to manage the project.
The provincial PMU satisfactorily delivered the project on time and within budget.

93.     The performance of the NPMO is rated as moderately satisfactory. The NPMO
could have performed better in disseminating the knowledge and experience associated
with thermal efficiency improvement at the national level. This would have increased the
project’s impact on the issuance of the national policies. In addition, activities at the
national level suffered from a key personnel change, which slowed down project progress
and directly led to the third project restructuring to extend the closing date by half year.

94.     The performance of Shandong PMU is rated as moderately satisfactory. Similar to
Shanxi PMU, Shandong PMU also suffered from a lack of capacity to manage Bank
projects at project outset. Although Shandong PMU gradually improved its management


                                            23
capacity, capacity remained weak due to frequent staff turnover and project
implementation was slowed down. On the other hand, Shandong PMU performed well in
closing down nine thermal plants in Shandong. The post-evaluation report showed no
unresolved issues associated with the closures.

95.    The performance of the owners of the nine closed small power plants, namely
Feicheng Company (Dafeng, Caozhuang plants), Dongyue Company (Yangzhuang,
Guozhuang, Taoyang plants), Taishan Yangguang Company (Laiwu plant), Laiwu
Xingyuang Company, Taishan Paper Manufacture Company, and Yichou Cement
Company (Luozhuang plant), is rated as satisfactory, as the plants were closed effectively.
Evaluations of both the environmental and social safeguards were satisfactory.

96.     The performance of Shandong EPB is rated as moderately satisfactory. The
Shandong EPB completed the establishment of a SO2 emission allowance trading system
in Weifang city and made efforts to disseminate its experience. However, only virtual
trading transactions occurred in the secondary market in Weifang city.

97.    The performance of Shandong Power Grid Company is rated as satisfactory. The
corporation completed the establishment of the CHP online monitoring system on time
and effectively used the monitoring data to inform its discussion with the relevant
government authorities on the scheduling of the power dispatch with CHP plants in
Shandong.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.     Despite the difficulties encountered during the project implementation, especially
at early stages of the project, the borrower and implementing agencies showed strong
commitment to thermal efficiency improvement in the power sector and took full
ownership of the project. All government agencies and grant beneficiaries allocated the
needed efforts and resources to deliver the project outputs and surpass its target indicators
though the overall project implementation period was extended by one and half years.
The Borrower’s performance is therefore rated as moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

99.     Strong government commitment. Strong government commitment is critical for
project success, and the GOC has shown strong ownership of the promotion of energy
conservation to reduce overall energy intensity. This strong commitment has led to
sufficient legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks to create an enabling environment for
thermal efficiency improvement in the power sector. During the 11th FYP, the central
government set the ambitious target to close inefficient small thermal units to optimize
the power mix, provided financial compensation for plant thermal efficiency
rehabilitation, and piloted ESD in five provinces. The resulting financial and non-
financial incentives, along with the enabling environment for thermal efficiency
enhancement, contributed to the success of the GEF project.



                                             24
100. Project design aligned with country priorities. The GEF project targeted three
strategic areas that were identified by the GOC in pursuing its energy conservation
objective. During the11th FYP, the central government created an enabling environment
for the implementation of the GEF project. Relevant government authorities and
implementing agencies were highly motivated to implement the GEF project as it was
aligned with country priorities. This made it easier to disseminate the outputs, including
guidelines, tools and knowledge, to a much broader range of stakeholders due to the
project’s high relevance to national priorities.

101. Strong technical and financial capacity of implementing agencies. The results
of the plant thermal efficiency improvement component are considered highly
satisfactory because the measured results indicators well exceed the original targets. The
successful demonstration of rehabilitation is largely attributable to the strong technical
capacity of the six thermal power plants. In addition to the GEF grant, sufficient
counterpart funds were set aside by the thermal power companies to ensure the timely
completion of the rehabilitation. This experience illustrates that strong technical capacity
and good financial standing of the involved thermal power generation companies is
essential for effective and efficient plant rehabilitation.

102. Significant demonstration effect of rehabilitation as a result of the proper
selection of technology (based on its competitiveness and replication potential) and
extensive dissemination activities. The GEF project achieved a significant
demonstration effect as the six thermal plants collectively hosted more than 30 study
tours for staff from other thermal plants located both inside and outside their respective
provinces. This is an indication of the strong interest by the other thermal power plants,
which regarded the rehabilitation technologies highly relevant to their operations. To
ensure that the GEF-supported technologies had this high relevance, the Bank team
selected technologies competitively based on cost-effectiveness and replication potential.
Following the successful demonstration, the GEF project undertook extensive
dissemination activities of various forms to widely convey the experience to a broad
range of stakeholders. The achieved demonstration effect is critical to guarantee a
satisfactory outcome of the project. As a result, several demonstrated technologies (CHP,
waste heat utilization, variable frequency control, etc.) have been turned into standard
industrial practices.

103. Attribution of PDO Indicators. Although the two PDO level indicators
(electricity supply efficiency in gce/kWh and GHG emission factors in ton CO2/MWh)
are appropriate for measuring the success of the aggregated efficiency improvements and
GHG impacts in the power sector in the three provinces, additional indicators would have
provided more precise measurement of the output of the project to enhance attribution, as
the size of the GEF project was quite small compared to the size of the sector in the three
provinces. The additional indicators could be selected as weighted electricity supply
efficiency (in gce/kWh), total energy savings contributed by the GEF project directly
(tce), avoided GHG emissions (ton CO2), or a weighted emission factor (ton CO2/MWh).




                                             25
104. Flexibility is required to adapt project implementation to evolving
government priorities. The government of China was moving fast with the closure of
small coal-fired units during its 11th FYP. The rapid government interventions, along
with the project delay at the outset of the project, necessitated a revision to the sub-
components to adapt to the fast closures. The flexibility of the Bank team led to
satisfactory results. This flexible approach can be particularly helpful in countries where
project ownership is particularly strong.

105. Capacity building for PMO/PMUs and IAs through close communication
between the Bank team and client agencies is an indispensable part of project design
and implementation, especially for those agencies new to the Bank projects. The
capacity building is especially important at the early stage of project implementation in
order to enable the IAs to start the project implementation quickly, as well as building the
trust between the Bank team and IAs.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

106. The borrower’s contribution to the ICR was shared with the World Bank in June
2014 and is summarized in Annex 7. It provides a summary of the key outputs and
outcomes of the project, implementation status of each project component, and
assessment of the experience and lessons. These inputs have been incorporated into the
ICR.

107. The draft final ICR was also circulated to the Ministry of Finance and
implementing agencies (coordinated by the national PMO) for comments in January 2015.
It was considered to reflect fairly large project results in accordance with the tasks
initially established. The results mentioned and conclusions presented demonstrate that
the project has achieved its objectives, though the national PMO proposed to rate its
performance as Satisfactory rather than Moderately Satisfactory.

Closure of nine small coal-fired plants in Shandong

2.      The closure of nine coal-fired plants (225 MW in total) was successfully
completed. Results of a post-completion survey show that the closure was well
implemented. The social and financial impacts of the closure on those that were affected
by it were largely mitigated by the provision of vocational trainings and the delivery of

                                            29
3.     The CHP online monitoring system played an important role in helping Shandong
government authorities enforce their regulations for CHP plants. The system was put into
operation in 2007 and continues to undergo improvements. At the end of 2012, the
Shandong Provincial Economic and IT Commission issued a regulation to improve the
accuracy of data collected by the plants. The provincial authorities have thus far invested
over RMB 12 million, including RMB 6 million in 2014 alone, to strengthen the
functions and features of the CHP online monitoring system.

4.     The CHP online monitoring system has also expanded its coverage to include 136
base-load units and 548 backup units in Shandong. State Grid set a target to implement
CHP online monitoring within all its power grids by the end of 2014.

5.     The technical design and specification of the Shandong CHP online monitoring
system provided inputs to the State Grids’ technical specification of the CHP online
monitoring system.

SO2 emission allowance trading component (Shanxi) by Shanxi Environmental
Protection Bureau

6.     The project supported the design, development, and operation of the Shanxi SO2
emission allowance trading system by strengthening trading design and planning
frameworks, and financing the development and installation of corresponding hardware
and software.

7.      The test operation of the SO2 emission allowance trading system occurred in 2011,
with official operation starting in 2012. Since the system’s inception, emission trading
has intensified. The number of transactions in the first 9 months of 2014 (Jan.-Sept.)
reached 360, an increase of 33 percent compared to the 2013 level and 87 percent
compared to 2012. The transaction volume during the first 9 months of 2014 amounted to
RMB 500 million, 2.3 times the 2013 level (RMB 212 million) and nearly 6 times the
2012 volume (RMB 84 million).

8.       Two salient trends have emerged: (i) transactions among binding companies
dominate the secondary market; the transaction volume accounted for 39 percent of the
total in 2012, climbing to 73 percent of the total in 2013, and hovering around 70 percent
in 2014; and (ii) the transaction scope was broadened to cover city-level companies.
From 2012 to June 2014, transactions were limited to provincial level companies, but
since July 2014 emission trading has included city-level companies.

9.      The demonstration effect of this sub-component is remarkable because of the
successful operation of the emissions trading system, as evidenced by the intensified
trading transactions over the year. Thus far, more than 20 provinces have organized study
tours to Shanxi and four provinces have followed the Shanxi practice to establish
independent emission allowance trading centers to manage emission control. About 10
provinces adopted an “IC Card” mechanism that was pioneered by Shanxi province to
regulate total pollutants emissions.



                                            30
10.     Going forward, the pollutants emission allowance trading system will play a more
important role in regulating pollutants emissions due to (i) tightened emission regulations
in the new Environmental Protection Law to be effective in January 2015, and (ii) new
additions of thermal capacity. Shanxi provincial authorities are aiming to add a total 21
GW of thermal capacity with low-calorific value coals as fuel and already have approved
90 percent of the target. The new capacity additions will produce more polluting
emissions, creating a huge burden on the existing provincial emission control agenda.

SO2 emission allowance trading component (Shandong) by Shandong Environmental
Protection Bureau

11.     The planning, design, and system establishment of the SO2 emission allowance
trading system in Weifang city in Shandong Province were completed. Continued and
ongoing efforts are made to disseminate the experience. Since the establishment of the
trading system at the end of 2012, the Weifang government has been allocating quota to
the local enterprises in the primary market, with results publicly disclosed. Actual
transactions in the secondary market, however, have been put on hold as a national policy
for a pollutants emission allowance trading system is not available.

12.    This situation, however, is expected to change soon, as a result of the central
government’s issuance of a relevant national policy in July 2014, providing a clear
market signal. Following this new policy, the Shandong provincial authorities have been
developing supporting policies at the provincial level to promote the trading.

13.    This move sets the stage for upcoming transactions in the secondary market in
Weifang. The pilot trading system supported by the GEF grant is expected to play a
leading role in pollutants emission allowance trading not only in Weifang but across
Shandong province.

Component 2: Demonstration of Power Plant Efficiency Improvement

Peak Cooling Technology by Wuxiang Hexin Thermal Plant

14.     Prior to 2011, thermal power plants in water-scarce regions such as Shanxi, Inner
Mongolia, Hebei, and Shaanxi often used direct air-cooling technology. This technology,
however, was found to result in sub-loading in the summer when ambient temperature is
high, causing uneconomic generation under high back pressure. The peak cooling
technology employed by Wuxiang Hexin Power Generation Co., Ltd can solve the sub-
loading issue by enhancing the load-bearing capacity of generators in the summer, thus
improving the thermal efficiency of the power plant.

15.     The pilot project was the first to demonstrate the use of peak cooling technology
in summer for thermal plants situated in water-deficient regions. Despite an increase in
water consumption, the post-retrofit total water consumption remains below the limit set
by the government. The pilot’s successful operation corroborated the technical and



                                            31
economic feasibility of the application of such technology in China’s northern part where
water resources are limited. In addition, the project provided valuable experience in
solving the sub-load issues that confronted direct air-cooling generators in the summer.
The project sets an example for other similar thermal plants that adopt the direct air-
cooling technology, in particular in water-deficient regions.

16.     Project experience has been disseminated by the NPMO via various seminars and
at the Green Expo; the plant also organized a number of inter- and intra-provincial study
tours to showcase the pilot project. The dissemination activates brought about significant
demonstration effect. Thus far, six thermal plants in Shanxi and three in other provinces
have either started a peak cooling project or are formulating their retrofit plan.

Integrated Plant Efficiency Rehabilitation at Shanxi Yangguang Thermal Plant

17.     The project at Yangguang thermal plant showcased the practice of plant
efficiency rehabilitation based on the recommendations of a standard plant energy audit.
The project also demonstrated three efficiency-enhancing retrofit technologies that were
relatively new at the outset of the project.

18.     The three efficiency-improving technologies include (i) high-voltage variable-
frequency speed control system for primary fan of boilers; (ii) vapor seal retrofit of
turbine blade and shaft; and (iii) adoption of a real-time plant efficiency monitoring
system.

19.      The company applied a patented vapor seal retrofit technology on the #4
generator. The post-retrofit operation began in March 2008. The retrofit achieved its
intended objective: the unit efficiency rose from 35.3% to 39.5% relative to the pre-
retrofit level, while coal consumption of a single unit declined by 4-5 g/kWh, according
to a test report by the China Electric Power Research Institute. A number of
dissemination and promotional activities were carried out by both NPMO and the
company. This technology now has been used for 300 MW thermal units across the
country.

20.      In 2007-2008, high-voltage variable-frequency speed control systems for large
thermal units were rarely seen due to their perceived technical risks. Demonstration of
this technology in 2008 would have created significant demonstration effect, but the
retrofit work was delayed until 2012 because its implementation was contingent upon
another retrofit activity that was technically challenging. As a result, the demonstration
effect for this technology was significantly reduced.

21.     According to Yangguang company, the real-time plant efficiency monitoring
system allows the plant to manage its thermal units more efficiently because of the early
identification of issues and the software’s intelligent function contributing to a timely
resolution of those issues. According to the Shanxi PMU, the monitoring software has
now been adopted by 70% of thermal power plants in Shanxi.




                                             32
Waste Heat Recovery (Phased Heat Exchanger) at Taiyi Thermal Plant

22.     The project at Taiyi thermal plant is the first project to demonstrate the
application of a phased heat exchanger to recover waste heat from thermal power plants.
The demonstrated technology is a major innovation as it successfully solves a number of
technical issues facing the traditional phase-change heat transfer technology used in
many plants. The technology reliably controls the wall temperature of the side gas heaters
during the entire process, from unit start-up to close-down, and thus ensures a safe and
efficient recycling of the heat of waste gas. The technology was jointly developed by the
Guodian Taiyi Power Generation Co., Ltd. and the Process Engineering Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.

23.    The project supported the recycling of the waste heat from boiler #4 using this
technology. The post-retrofit operation satisfactorily achieved its intended objectives,
including an efficiency improvement in terms of a reduction of 2.24 gce/kWh of coal
consumption for power generation, and annual reductions of 241.3 tons of SO2 emissions;
178.4 tons of NOx emissions; 11,502 tons of CO2 emissions; and 1,749 tons of ash
emissions.

24.    NPMO and the company have undertaken a number of activities to disseminate
the successful results of the pilot, including workshops, seminars, and study tours.
Already five thermal plants in Shanxi have either started to implement this technology or
have already adopted it. In addition, NEA organized an evaluation panel to assess and
evaluate this innovative technology. The technology was also recently included in the
“National Near-zero Emission Technology Catalogue 2014” as one of the leading
technologies to be promoted at the national level.

Waste Heat Recovery at Jinan Beijiao Thermal Plant

25.     In 2008, recovery of heat wasted in the condensing and cooling process of CHP
units and the use of circulating water for district heat supply were not common practice in
thermal plants, but the GEF practice at the Jinan Beijiao thermal plant has shown its
commercial viability. The GEF grant co-financed the transformation of condensers and
circulating water systems of units #2 and # 5, the construction of the heat transfer station
in the plant area, and the transformation of the urban heat supply network. The retrofit
was completed at the end of 2009.

26.    The retrofit project achieved good social benefits. It helped expand the heat
supply area by 2 million square meters and improved the stability and efficiency of the
heat supply network’s operation by transforming it from a steam network to a water
network.

27.    The project also achieved economic benefits. Thermal efficiency was significantly
enhanced, going from 57% (prior) to 77% (post) for unit #2, and to 78.57% in unit #5.
Actual coal savings for the winter heating season amounted to 0.03 million tce per annum,




                                            33
exceeding the target of 0.02 million tce per annum. GHG emissions were reduced by
0.069 million tons per year, surpassing the target of 0.053 million tons per year.

28.     Early completion of the project brought about significant demonstration effect.
Staff from about 14 to 16 other thermal plants visited the Beijiao thermal plant to learn
from the plant’s experience. The rehabilitation technology supported under the project is
now widely used in the rehabilitation of thermal plants.

29.     In addition, the social and economic benefits from the project have spurred a great
interest at the Beijiao thermal plant to continue to explore and implement other energy
efficient technologies beyond the technical scope of this project. The Beijiao thermal
plant recently collaborated with the Energy Institute of Tsinghua University to evaluate
the technical and financial viability of flue gas heat recovery technology to further
enhance the thermal efficiency of the plant.

Conversion into CHP Operation at Huangtai Thermal Plant

30.     The conversion of power generation only units into CHP operation was an
innovative process in 2007-2008. The GEF grant was used to support this rehabilitation
with the clear objective to initiate a wide replication of this conversion across the country
via the pilot demonstration. The conversion at Huangtai thermal plant was completed in
2008.

31.    The project achieved its intended objective. Thermal efficiency of the plant
increased from 40.3% (prior) to 56.4% (post). Annual coal savings amounted to about
64,000 tons and associated GHG emission reductions reached about 160,000 tons.

32.     The project created significant demonstration effect due to the successful and
early completion of the rehabilitation. Nationally, about 40-50 thermal units (300
MW/600 MW) have adopted Huangtai’s technical design to convert to CHP operation in
their thermal plants.

33.      The positive feedback and economic benefits have led Huangtai thermal plant to
continue its thermal efficiency retrofit. So far the plant has invested over RMB 120
million in a retrofit of the heat supply for unit #8. The work is expected to be completed
in late 2014.

Integrated Rehabilitation at Weihai Botong Thermal Plant

34.     This project supported a suite of rehabilitation technologies, covering (i) an
upgrade of the efficiency of four boilers by increasing steam temperature; (ii) retrofit of
the turbine flow path; and (iii) the installation of 13 high voltage variable speed drives.
The boiler retrofit was completed for two boilers while the remaining work for the other
two boilers is to be completed soon. After the first batch of 11 variable speed drives was
installed in November 2012, the encouraging results led to the installation of an
additional two variable speed drives. The retrofit for the turbine flow path was ongoing



                                             34
and expected to be completed in 2014. The post-retrofit thermal efficiency in 2013
amounted to 72.84 %, a bit lower than the target indicator (74.14%). With the completion
of the retrofit for the turbine flow path in the plant, the thermal efficiency would be
expected to achieve the target.

Component 3: Transition to Efficient Generation Dispatch

ESD Simulation System

35.    The ESD simulation system has been put into operation since its establishment.
According to staff of the Guangdong Power Grid Corporation, the ESD simulation
system has been an effective analytical instrument to identify gaps between actual and
ideal ESD operations. The system is also helpful in pinpointing underlying factors that
contribute to the gaps, with results of the gap analysis used to improve the actual ESD
dispatch operation, monthly or quarterly, to exploit the full potential of the ESD.

36.    In addition, to quantify the incremental energy saving potential of the Guangdong
power grid, an assessment report was recently produced based on the 2013 actual
dispatch data. The report provided strong analytical underpinning to the sustained
improvement of energy-saving dispatch in the province.

37.     As a result of the sustained improvements, this sub-component has achieved its
intended objective. It is also confirmed that the energy-saving dispatch will continue to
be the dispatch model in Guangdong, which means that the effectiveness and usefulness
of the ESD simulation system supported by the GEF grant will be sustained.

CHP Online Monitoring System

38.      The Guangdong CHP online monitoring system has been in operation since its
establishment in 2011. Since then, its coverage has been expanding. In 2011 only four
CHP plants were connected to the monitoring system; this number is expected to increase
to 17 at the end of 2014, covering all existing CHP plants in Guangdong. Going forward,
it will be mandatory for all new CHP plants to be commissioned to be connected to the
CHP monitoring system.

39.     The CHP monitoring system has been effectively collecting real-time operational
data from the CHP plants in Guangdong and results of the data analysis are used to
inform policy decisions on power dispatch between China Southern Grids and relevant
provincial authorities. As such, this sub-component has achieved its intended outcome.

Information Disclosure System

40.    An information disclosure system was established based on actual ESD operation
in Guangdong. The system provides an open platform for data collection, analysis,
exchange, inquiry, and management. Guangdong Power Grid Corporation is developing a
brand new Operation and Management System (OMS). Once this system is established,



                                            35
the existing information disclosure system will be integrated into the OMS and perform
its functions using the OMS platform.

41.     The project indicators were illustrated in table A2.2 below.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(Including assumptions in the analysis)

Economic Analysis

1.       Economic analyses of investment sub-components were conducted at appraisal to
justify their economic viability. This applied to the sub-components for the first three
power plants including: (i) Jinan Beijiao thermal power plant, (ii) Huangtai thermal
power plant in Shandong, and (iii) Yangguang thermal power plant in Shanxi.
Rehabilitation of three more power plants was added during the project restructuring.
Cost-benefit analyses were carried out to estimate the EIRRs of the six sub-projects.
Using the same methodology, i.e., cost-benefit analysis, the EIRRs were recalculated at
the time of ICR.

2.      Jinan Beijiao Thermal Power Plant: At ICR, the EIRR was recalculated at 76.8
percent, tripling the estimate made during project preparation (26.7 percent). The increase
is mainly caused by: (i) significantly lower CAPEX, as capital investment decreased from
RMB 159 million at appraisal to RMB 23.6 million at ICR; and (ii) lower incremental
costs of electricity consumption for heat. The increase is partially offset by lower than
estimated coal-savings and consequently lower environmental and global benefits.

3.      Huangtai Thermal Power Plant: The EIRR at ICR was recalculated at 176.2
percent, significantly higher than the estimated EIRR during project preparation (20.4
percent). The increase in EIRR is mainly caused by significantly lower CAPEX, as
capital investment decreased from RMB 191 million at appraisal to RMB 21.6 million at
ICR. The increase is partially offset by lower than estimated coal-savings and
consequently lower environmental and global benefits.

4.      Yangguang Thermal Power Plant: The EIRR at ICR was recalculated at 85.7
percent, higher than the estimated EIRR at project preparation (78.7 percent). The
increase is mainly a result of a (i) CAPEX at ICR about 5 percent lower than at appraisal,
and (ii) more coal savings achieved at ICR compared to the savings anticipated at
appraisal.

5.      Using the same methodology, the EIRRs at ICR for Wuxiang Hexin plant, Taiyi
Power Plant, and Weihai Botong plant were calculated at 20.8, 11.3, and 31.2 percent
respectively, all three below the estimated EIRRs at restructuring, which respectively
were 25.1, 16.4, and 32.8 percent. This is mainly a result of the decrease in coal price,
which has led to a reduction in the coal saving benefit. In addition, the actual coal savings
for both Taiyi and Weihai power plants were lower than expected.

Financial Analysis

6.      The financial analyses of the six investment subcomponents were carried out
using the same methodology adopted during the project preparation, namely cash flow
analysis, and the FIRRs were recalculated. It was found that:



                                             39
          At Jinan Beijiao Thermal Power Plant, the FIRR of rehabilitation was recalculated
           at 91.79 percent, significantly higher than the estimated FIRR at project appraisal
           (16.96 percent).
          At Huangtai Thermal Power Plant, the FIRR of retrofit was recalculated at 186.77
           percent, significantly higher than the estimated FIRR at project appraisal (23.73
           percent).
          At Yangguang Thermal Power Plant, the FIRR of retrofit was recalculated at
           90.91 percent, slightly higher than the estimated FIRR at project appraisal (88.69
           percent).
          At Wuxiang Hexin, Taiyi, and Weihai Botong plants, the FIRRs of rehabilitation
           were calculated at 11.9, 5.3, and 20.1 percent respectively, lower than the
           estimated FIRRs at project restructuring, which had been 13.0, 7.7, and 25.4
           percent respectively.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      The Bank team collected feedback from a variety of project beneficiaries at a
project closing workshop and during a follow-up ICR mission in October 2014. This
Annex presents a summary of the feedback. Although the summary of beneficiary
feedback does not constitute a beneficiary survey, it is still valuable as it provides
interesting insights into the perspectives of a wide range of stakeholders involved with
the GEF project.

Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

2.     Feedback from a variety of project beneficiaries was collected at a closing
workshop and during a follow-up ICR mission, providing insights into the perspectives of
a wide range of project beneficiaries. The feedback can be summarized as follows:

      Closing workshop: High level government officials attended the project closing
       workshop and commended the project for its significant contributions to the
       achievement of China’s national target of energy intensity reduction. They also
       highlighted that the GEF project successfully targeted three strategic areas in line
       with government priorities for energy conservation in the 11th and 12th FYPs.

      Follow-up ICR mission: the six thermal power plants, two provincial grid
       companies, and involved government agencies in both Shandong and Shanxi
       expressed their appreciation for the GEF support. They stressed that a key value-
       added of the GEF grant was that the project raised their awareness of the energy-
       saving potential of rehabilitation technologies. The satisfactory results spurred
       their interests in continuing the plant retrofit using their own funds. Some of the
       thermal plants clearly expressed an intention to continue collaboration with the
       GEF/World Bank to further improve their plant’s thermal efficiency.

Part I: Closing Workshop

3.   High level government officials attended the project closing workshop. Their
comments on the GEF project are briefly summarized as follows:

      The project has made significant contributions to help the GOC achieve its
       national target of energy intensity reduction via energy efficiency improvements
       in the power sector.
      The project successfully targeted three strategic areas of improvements that are in
       line with government priorities in energy conservation during China’s 11th and
       12th FYP.
      In particular, the energy-saving technologies demonstrated in the project have had
       wide demonstration impacts on promoting energy efficiency technologies in
       China’s power sector.
      The ESD simulation system is essential to sustained operational improvements of
       the pilot ESD.


                                            43
Part II: Follow-up ICR mission

4.     In October 2014 an ICR mission held meetings with project beneficiaries in three
provinces to assess the benefits of the GEF project to sub-grant recipients.

5.    During the meetings, the following questions were raised to beneficiaries and
PMUs:
    What was the value-added that the GEF project brought to your company?
    In which areas could the Bank team improve for better performance?
    From your perspective, what are lessons learned during the project
      implementation?

6.       The feedback to these questions is summarized below by province.

Shanxi Province:

7.       Wuxiang Hexin Power Generation Co., Ltd
        The Implementing Agency (IA) expressed its appreciation towards Shanxi PMU
         and the Bank team for their timely provisions of assistance and guidance
         throughout project implementation.
        The IA has significantly improved its procurement and bidding practices because
         of the experience with this Bank project.
        The IA stressed the importance to have third-party post-completion evaluation, as
         conducted under the Project. This evaluation was required by the Bank team and
         conducted by the PMU. The evaluation was supported by a consultant hired by
         the PMU.

8.       Shanxi Yangguang Power Generation Co., Ltd
        The IA benefitted from undertaking the GEF project. It has strengthened its
         working flow management and improved its procurement procedures.

9.       Shanxi Project Management Unit (PMU)
        The Shanxi PMU commended that the GEF grant effectively promoted adoption
         of efficiency-improving technologies in thermal plants by reducing the upfront
         capital costs and sharing technical risks.
        The PMU stressed that the demonstration effect of plant rehabilitation is
         significant in Shanxi province.
        The PMU benefited greatly from the management of the GEF project. The project
         experience has sharpened the PMU’s project management skills and contributed
         to an accumulation of experience with procurement, contract management, and
         financial management.
        The PMU attributed the project delay to the lack of guidance during the early
         period of project implementation prior to the first Bank supervision mission.




                                             44
         The PMU also expressed its appreciation for the intensified supervision efforts led
          by the existing Bank team since the first mission, following the change of TTL on
          the Bank’s supervision team.

10.       Shanxi Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB)
         EPB pointed out that the GEF project played a critical role in helping Shanxi EPB
          advance the pollutants emission control agenda in Shanxi province.
         EPB expressed its appreciation for the Bank team in providing strategic guidance
          on how to shape up the trading system and which direction to follow in the future.
         Shanxi EPB benefited from the Bank’s sound project management system. The
          EPF significantly improved its project management skills and gained valuable
          experience.

Guangdong Province

11.    Guangdong Power Grid Corporation provided a few lessons learned and a
suggestion for the project.

12.       Lessons Learned:
         Prolonged project preparation undermined the added-value of the ESD simulation
          system to the pilot ESD in Guangdong. The corporation had expected to have the
          ESD simulation ready before the pilot ESD, so findings from the ESD simulation
          system could be integrated into the real ESD. However, the ESD simulation
          system was ready only after the pilot ESD had started.
         Strong management-level commitment and good coordination among the various
          departments are pre-conditions to project success.
         Quality staff in the project management units is important for successful project
          delivery.
         Effective project management and supervision helps support smooth project
          implementation.
         The World Bank’s flexibility in project management is a key to success.

13.     Suggestion: Sufficient measures need to be in place to hedge foreign exchange
risks to mitigate the potential adverse financial impacts on project implementation.

Shandong Province

14.   Shandong PMU (Coordinating the closure of nine small coal-fired plants in
Shandong)
     The PMU attributed the implementation delay in closing down small inefficient
      plants in Shandong to the delayed preparation of the Operational Manual.
     The PMU acknowledged the Bank’s intensified efforts in project supervision
      following the first mission. In their view, these efforts are key to the successful
      closure of the nine thermal plants, given the rapidly evolving external
      environments.



                                              45
15.       Jinan Beijiao Power Generation Co., Ltd.
         The IA is encouraged by the benefits associated with the rehabilitation.
         The positive results led the company to collaborate with the Energy Institute of
          Tsinghua University to undertake additional efficiency enhancement measures.

16.       Huangtai Power Generation Co., Ltd.
         The IA thanked the GEF for its financial support during the period it was
          struggling financially due to the rapidly rising price of coal.
         The company explicitly expressed its intention to continue the cooperation with
          the GEF/World Bank in the fields of waste heat recovery and district heat supply.

  2.     The Recipient Completion Report is summarized as follows:

  3.      Outcome: The GEF project contributed to the improvement of thermal efficiency
  in the power sector via three strands of targeted support. The outcomes of the individual
  components are briefly summarized as follows:

  Component (1): Mechanisms to Support the Closure of Small Inefficient Generation
  Units

  4.      Mechanism to close small thermal plants: A transparent and efficient fiscal
  incentive mechanism was established. This mechanism successfully supported the closure
  of nine small thermal plants in Shandong and contributed to the issuance of a national
  policy in 2011, titled “Central Government Fiscal Incentives to Phase out Inefficient
  Capacity.”

  5.      CHP online monitoring system: The developed CHP online monitoring system
  provided technical inputs to the verification of thermal efficiency of CHP units. It helped
  formulate a merit order table of thermal units for the grid company dispatch center to
  follow. It also facilitates the enforcement of government regulation on heat supply for
  CHP units.


                                              51
6.     SO2 emission allowance trading system: An SO2 emission allowance trading
system was established in Shanxi and Shandong, contributed by the GEF project to its
development and improvements of the trading mechanism. The output of the project
provided technical inputs to the formulation of a national SO2 emission allowance trading
system.

Component (2): Demonstration of Power Plant Efficiency Improvements

7.      The thermal efficiency rehabilitation projects at six thermal plants in Shanxi and
Shandong achieved or exceeded the intended energy-saving objectives. Under the
leadership of the NPMO, a variety of dissemination activities were carried out at the
provincial level. These activities have brought about considerable demonstration effect to
thermal plants, including plants from other provinces. This has led to the rehabilitation of
thermal efficiency on a much broader scale, involving plants at many geographic
locations.

8.     The GEF project also supported studies to introduce international experience and
summarize experience and lessons learned from the supported rehabilitation. The
“Evaluation report on thermal plants rehabilitation” provided technical inputs to the
issuance of “Administrative Measures on Fiscal Incentives on Energy-saving
Technologies,” which was issued jointly by MOF and NDRC in 2011.

9.      The “Standard Procedure of Energy Audit for Thermal Plants” also provided
input to the “Notice on Undertaking a Comprehensive Upgrading of Coal-fired Power
Plants,” issued jointly by MOF and NDRC in 2012

Component (3): Transition to Efficient Generation Dispatch

10.      The GEF project promoted the ESD pilot in Guangdong through developing the
ESD simulation system and the CHP online monitoring system, and by completing a
number of policy studies on financial compensation and information disclosure. Several
knowledge-sharing conferences were held to disseminate the experience from the
Guangdong ESP pilot to other provinces (Henan, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guizhou). This
facilitated the transition from current generation dispatch practice to an efficient
generation dispatch model in other provinces, resulting in reduced coal consumption and
reduced GHG emissions associated with power generation.

11.    Impacts: The GEF project has brought about significant impacts from economic,
technical, and social perspectives.

12.    From an economic point of view, the GEF project achieved improvements in
energy efficiency, reduced coal consumption, and GHG emissions, thus avoiding costs
associated with national and global environmental pollution.
     Component 1 established an incentive mechanism for closing down small thermal
       power plants. The mechanism helped solve the obstacles encountered in the



                                            52
       implementation process. It also contributed to the achievement of coal-savings
       targets in thermal plants.
      Component 2 enhanced the technical capacity of the six thermal plants to
       implement EE measures and thus achieved remarkable economic benefits and
       energy savings. The pilot efficiency improving technologies created significant
       demonstration effect via dissemination activities.
      Component 3 promoted the development of domestic scheduling techniques of
       ESD, improved the efficiency of ESD operation, and promoted the rational
       distribution of energy.

13.     From a technical perspective, Component 1 drew upon the Bank’s prior
experience with closing small thermal plants to design an operational manual and adapt it
to China’s context. The Operational Manual provided for financial compensations to the
closed thermal plants based on the capacity to be closed. This played an important role in
achieving the target of plant closures during the 11th FYP.

14.     Component 2 supported studies on international experience with standard
procedures of energy auditing and best practices on plant O&M. Those studies
strengthened technical capacity of thermal plants in designing and implementing EE
measures.

15.     Under Component 3, Guangdong Power Grid Corporation drew upon
international experience and best practices to develop the ESD simulation system. This
system assesses the potential of improvement in existing ESD operation and provides
useful guidance. In addition, an international expert on ESD was hired to provide key
inputs and recommendations for the development of the ESD simulation system.

16.     From a social perspective, the GEF project brought about positive social impact
on project areas and beyond. The project contributed to coal savings and GHG emission
reductions. The project also alleviated air pollution by increasing coverage of district
heating. It also created positive social impacts and raised the living standards of people in
the project areas by avoiding the environmental damage caused by coal.

17.      Indicators: The GEF project reached or surpassed the PDO level indicator targets
established at appraisal. However, 7 out of a total of 18 intermediate indicators were not
met; these related to (i) the efficiency of Weihai Botong power plant, as one of the three
rehabilitation activities was not completed by the end of 2013 (one indicator); (ii) annual
coal savings and GHG emission reductions in Weihai Botong plant (two indicators); and
(iii) annual coal savings and GHG emission reductions in Huangtai and Beijiao power
plants (four indicators). Reductions in the Huangtai and Beijiao plants were not achieved
as both plants were operated for fewer hours in the non-heating seasons, although their
targeted efficiencies were met.

Success Factors
The following observations apply:




                                             53
18.     Government commitment and collaboration between departments are the
basis for project success. The GEF project, from preparation to conclusion, received
considerable attention from officials in Shandong and Shanxi provinces, at Guangdong
Power Grid Corporation, and at MOF and NEA. This played a critical role in the
materialization of counterpart funds. Cooperation among relevant departments is key to
ensure the successful implementation of the project.

19.     Strong management capacity at the project management units is critical for
successful project implementation. Since project inception, the project management
units in the three provinces had focused on establishing competent project executing
agencies. During the project, their capacity improved as they grew more experienced with
the daily project management and also received training from the World Bank. This
strong management capacity played an important role in project implementation.

20.     Effective management and supervision ensure smooth project
implementation. The project established independent project management units and the
appointment of project management personnel was competitively based. The PMU
stipulated a series of implementation procedures, regulations, as well as monitoring tools,
to avoid conflicts of interest between management personnel and beneficiaries, reflecting
the independence and impartiality of project management. The measures also established
effective supervision of project management and PMU staff.

21.     Bank’s flexible management is the key to project success. Some planned
project activities became obsolete because of swift government interventions, in
particular related to the closure of small thermal plants. The NPMO in consultation with
the World Bank cancelled some activities and redesigned news ones. This flexibility is
desirable.

Lessons Learned:

22.     Exchange rate fluctuations affected some project activities adversely. The
GEF grant is denominated in U.S. dollars. Over the course of project implementation,
The renminbi (RMB) appreciated against the dollar, from a USD to RMB exchange rate
of 1:8 in early 2006 to a 1:6 rate in 2014. This resulted in 25 percent reduction of total
available funds, which put pressure on the IAs to seek other financing sources. As such,
this volatility of foreign exchange had an adverse effect on project implementation.
Because of this, it is recommended that future projects set aside adequate contingencies
to deal with risks associated with foreign exchange rates.

23.     Dissemination efforts at the national level should be included as a major
design element to promote the application of knowledge and project outputs. The
project was designed to largely focus on the provincial level activities, although a
national PMO was also established to coordinate the national activities. The GEF project
has produced valuable studies and demonstrated leading energy-saving technologies that
contributed to the closure of small thermal units, improvement of ESD operation, and
enhancement of plant thermal efficiency. The experience and lessons from the GEF



                                            54
project are significant for the implementation of the national EE program. However,
dissemination of some of the project outputs was limited to the provincial level and thus
has not yet been broadcast to a broader range of stakeholder at the national level. The
potential impacts of knowledge outputs could have been even more significant if the
project was designed to have a greater link to line ministries at the national level.
