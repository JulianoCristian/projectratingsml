A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The request is to extend the project closing date by six months, i.e. from December 31, 2013 until June 30,
2014. A request was received from the Ministry of Finance on November 18, 2013, and an action plan to
implement the project in the extension period has been submitted by the project management office, and is
considered acceptable. This is the 3rd restructuring for the Project.

B. Project Status
The project implementation is moderately satisfactory. All major project components have been
implemented in three provinces, and the estimate GEF grant that would be eligible for disbursement could
be about US$18.9 million (96% of total GEF grant 19.7m$) by current closing date (Dec. 31, 2013). The
pending tasks are mainly dissemination activities and can be completed before June 30, 2014.

The project objective continues to be achievable.

C. Proposed Changes

Financing
Change in Loan Closing Date(s):
Explanation
With the extension of the project closing date, the project management office can complete the planned
dissemination activities to expand the achievements under the Project and extends its influence, and total
disbursement of GEF grant can be increased current projection of 96% to 100%.
