                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to reduce coal consumption and GHG emission per unit of electricity production in Shanxi Province, Shandong Province and
                         Guangdong Province in China, through (i) mitigating the financial barriers of closing inefficient small-sized coal-fired units; (ii) demonstrating the viability of investments
                         in efficiency improvements in existing mid-sized thermal units; and (iii) developing effective regulations to implement the pilot ESD programs and conducting studies to
                         support the transition to efficient generation dispatch.

                         All three major components under the Project have been implemented satisfactory â€“ total 9 small coal-fired power plants were closed following an agreed manual under Component
                         1; total 6 medium and large coal-fired power plants have been rehabilitated to improve their efficiencies under Component 2, and their experience has been shared domestically and
                         additional dissemination activities are planned; an energy saving dispatch simulation system has been established in Guangdong province under Component 3. The project indicators
                         also showed that the project objective has been achieved based on the information provided by the PMO - average coal consumption per unit of coal-fired electricity output in
