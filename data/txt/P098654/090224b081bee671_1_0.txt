                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to reduce coal consumption and GHG emission per unit of electricity production in Shanxi Province, Shandong Province and
                         Guangdong Province in China, through (i) mitigating the financial barriers of closing inefficient small-sized coal-fired units; (ii) demonstrating the viability of investments
                         in efficiency improvements in existing mid-sized thermal units; and (iii) developing effective regulations to implement the pilot ESD programs and conducting studies to
                         support the transition to efficient generation dispatch.

                         Continuous project implementation progress has been made since the previous supervision mission after the completion of two project restructuring by mid April 2013. As a result,
                         total commitment increased from 88% in end September 2012 to 91% by end March 2013 and total disbursement increased from 52% to 69% during the same period. The project
                         development objectives will most likely to be met.
