Security, and Pension Reform in Brazil,\n            and, within the strategic context, it responds financially\n            to such reforms. The components are: 1) restructuring of the\n            National Institute for Social Security (INSS), which\n            requires studies on diagnostic/strategic plans, and an\n            information system master plan. Additionally, studies on a\n            public information/dissemination strategy, and an evaluation\n            of the Unified Data Base of Social Information (CNIS) will\n            be implemented to enhance information, and institution\n            building. The Management of Contributors by Segment (SGS)\n            will be implemented, and, will include equipment supply; 2)\n            pension and insurance legal frameworks, will be developed\n            through studies emphasizing on regulation of work related\n            injury insurance, and, the regulation for the Private Sector\n            Workers Pension System (RGPS); 3) strengthening of the\n            Secretariat of Complementary Pension Funds (SCP), which call\n            for the preparation of complementary laws, and, design of\n            investment, actuarial, financial, and supervision models, in\n            addition to equipment supply. Further studies will focus on\n            the preparation of Ordinary laws, strategic planning for\n            regulatory agencies, and, expansion of the integrated\n            information system, and external information network."}, "docdt": "2000-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
