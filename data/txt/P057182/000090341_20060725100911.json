Lessons\n            learned from the project are as follows: The Bank's\n            role in promoting judicial independence is a delicate one\n            given its political ramifications. Close coordination among\n            donors remains crucial, given the many institutions involved\n            in legal and judicial reform in Eastern Europe. Active\n            involvement of other donors during preparation and launch\n            stages can help to fill gaps while the often slower\n            implementation process of a World Bank-supported project\n            gets underway. Ensuring commitment and ownership (and\n            adequately assessing capacity levels) of the beneficiary\n            institutions is one way to mitigate the effect of changes in\n            the political leadership during project implementation.\n            Because of the weak capacity, it may have been appropriate\n            to start off with a much simpler (modular) court and case\n            management systems. Introduction of new information\n            technology in weak institutions is more likely to expose\n            underlying organizational problems rather than solve them.\n            Long-standing institutions may need more time and additional\n            support for undergoing change than newly established ones.\n            Monitoring and evaluation is an element of institutional\n            development in its own right."}, "docdt": "2006-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
