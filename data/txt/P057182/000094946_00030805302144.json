The project has four main components. The first\n            component improves legal education at the Faculty of Law of\n            the University of Tirana by funding twinning arrangements to\n            train faculty staff abroad and technical assistance; by\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of the Faculty of\n            Law and funding textbook preparation and teaching materials,\n            financing investments, and rehabilitating and expanding the\n            premises of the law faculty building. The second component\n            improves the court and case management systems, provides\n            judicial training, strengthens the enforcement of judicial\n            decisions, and reinforces inspection services in the justice\n            system. Component 3 establishes a center for mediation and\n            arbitration of commercial disputes.
