PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NIGERIA
EKITI-AKOKO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1854-UNI)
Preface
The Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Ekiti-Akoko
Agricultural Development Project was prepared by the Agricultural Projects
Monitoring, and Evaluation Unit of the Federal Government of Nigeria. It
covers the Loan 1854-UNI for which an amount of US$32.5 million was
approved on May 27, 1980. The Loan was to close on September 30, 1985.
The Federal Government of Nigeria applied to the Bank for the extension of
the Loan Closing Date by two years and the Bank had agreed to an extension
on condition that the project filled in the positions for key senior staff
and instituted a redesigned work program. Non-compliance of these
conditions led the Bank to close the Loan on March 31, 1986 and cancel the
undisbursed loan amount of US$18.07 million.
The PCR consists of three volumes which are bulky for general
distribution. The Overview provides an outline of its main
findings and also includes a brief description of the Bank's thinking about
the project performance because of which the Bank refused to extend the
Loan Closing Date. A copy of the PCR is available for reference with OED.
The PCR provides a detailed analysis of each of the project components and
compares performance with the expectations of the appraisal report
(No. 2514-UNI).
The IBRD Overview of the PCR was prepared by the Africa Regional
Office to draw out the main issues deriving from this project which have
implications for the ongoing agricultural lending program in Nigeria.
A copy of the draft overview was sent to the Borrower on
February 16, 1990 for comments but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NIGERIA
EK7TI-ANOKO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1854-UNI)
Evaluation Summarv
Introduction
1.        This is the ninth of a series of agricultural development
projects which the Bank has supported in Nigeria as a part of its overall
strategy for development in the rural sector. Similar to other ADPs in
Nigeria, the project included agricultural services, input supplies and
rural infrastructure components.
Obiectives
2.        The project consisted of the following activitiea:  (a) crop and
livestock development by introduction of a basic package of farm inputs,
improved practices and extension for smallholders on 29 0ao ha, an advanced
package on 11,500 ha for progressive individual and group farmers; small-
scale poultry production; and farm credit; (b) supporting infrastructure by
constructing and maintaining 500 kms roads, 35 small-earth dams, 30 farm
service centers and 1000 ha land clearing; (c) establishment of a project
headquarter; and (d) provision of facilities for training both agricultural
field staff and senior specialists.
Implementation Experience
3.        Right from the beginning the project faced problems on the
following fronts which were the main reasons for its poor performance:
(a) staffing problems related to high turnover and a general shortage of
senior staff; and (b) a low commitment to the project shown by the Ondo
State Government (ODSG) by poor and irregular funding. While there is some
doubt on the quality of staff of the expatriate firm managing the project,
the initial decision of ODSG to fill 7 out of 14 posts, agreed for
international recruitment with local unqualified Nigerians, did affect the
project adversely. Program Manager made serious but unsuccessful efforts
to secure the financial commitment from ODSG.
4.        After the contract with the expatriate firm expired in August
1981, the Nigerian counterparts, who were not effectively trained by the



- v -
expatriate firm, started acting in various capacities of the key positions
like Program Manager. Commercial MSanager, etc. The Bank had repeatedly
urged ODSG to fill up these positions with qualified people. As this
situation continued, the Bank gave November 11, 1985, that is one year
after the expatriate firm had left the project, as the deadline for filling
the key posts. Submission of a revised work program proposal to the Bank,
reflecting rephasing/recosting agreed with Bank staff, was another
condition for the extension of the Loan closing date beyond September 30,
1985. The failure of the State Government to meet these conditions and its
continued unsatisfactory financial commitment to the project led the World
Bank to withdraw funding of the project from March 31, 1986 with the
undisbursed amount of US$18.07 million being cancelled.
5.        The total cost of the project was USS 45.07 million against the
appraisal estimate of US$80.5 million. Against the loan amount of US$32.5
million only US$14.4 mil'ion were disbursed. The Federal Government
provided N 11.8 million out of N 12.08 million expected contribution, that
is about 97.6? of the expected contribution. In contrast to this the State
Government contributed only N 6.4 million out of N 16.7 million expected,
that is only about 382 of the amount included in the SAR. The actual
receipt of quarterly allocation by the project was delayed constantly.
Both capital and recurrent expenditures were 68.22Z and 76.3Z of the amount
expected in the SAR.
6.        The agricultural and commercial services did not perform as
expected. The extension and research component had poor impact on farming
practices. The achievements of the livestock component were very much
below SAR targets. The project employed few extension agents and hence the
extension worker:farmer ratio was much lower than targeted by the SAR.
Extension activity related to agroforestry and livestock was grossly
inadequate. On the impact side the information is sketchy and the data
show that somewhere in the range of 10 to 28Z of farmers adopted improved
practices. Several research trials were conducted during the life-span of
the project but they were mostly located on station and the absence of on-
farm adaptive research, mainly because of poor quality research staff,
created a wide gap between research and extension. The project achieved
only 21? and 13 of the SAR targets for fertilizer and improved seeds
because of the limited demand. The outgrower program was started but was
discontinued within a year on the ground that outgrowers were inefficient.
One season was too short to expect both the farmers and the project to have
mastered the art of contract seed growing. The drought of 1983 also
affected the program. Thus overall, in spite of one of the biggest seed
processing plants in the country and well-staffed unit, performance of the
seed production program was poor. Similar to the seed processing plant,
several capital investments in the livestock component, for example, the
hatchery and feedmill, were grossly under-utilized and a countrywide feed
crisis in 1983 was the major reason sighted. Only the agro-forestry
component of the agricultural services, which was not considered in the SAR
but was later added in the project, performed satisfactorily. The reasons
for this were not given in the PCR.
7.        On the infrastructural side the project was not very successful
as it achieved 52? of its target in road construction and improvements, but



- vi -
its water development program of constructing 35 small earth dams for
potable water did not take off at all. A lack of periodic maintenance of
roads resulted in excessive damage to the roads by erosion, High staff
turnover and the uncooperative attitude of the LGAs towards the joint road
maintenance program hindered the achievements. The Land Use Planning
subcomponent started in 1983 but was later abandoned due to poor staffing,
funding and lack of equipments. Tractor hire proved popular in the project
but its economic viability was questionable. The SAR had envisaged a
decline in the activity of the tractor hire unit (THU) during the project
life and an increased focus on assisting private operations. However, the
project tried to do exactly the opposite by doubling the size of THU.
Results
8.        Little information is available to assess the impact of project
at farm level. Given the poor performance of research, extension and seed
services, it is doubtful whether any significant results were achieved in
terms of the SAR targets. The main benefit of the project lies with the
increased sale of fertilizers, development of infrastructure and training
of staff (Table 1). The PCR estimates ERR from the project 13Z but
cautions that the estimate does not truly reflect achievements of the
project, mainly because the growth in production achieved during the
project period could have been achieved without the project.
Sustainability
9.        The PCR does not discuss much on the issues related to
sustainability except in relation to the seed production program where the
PCR comments that involvement of outgrowers would have ensured
sustainability of the program. The subsequent agricultural development
projects in Nigeria have, however, explicitly tackled the issue of
sustainability of project investments and institutions (Overview para 14).
Findinys and Lessons
10        The performance of the expatriate firm on which the management
of the project was entrusted, suggests that such a decision to hand over
the project should not be repeated.
11.       The project had no mid-term review which could have helped in
improving the project performance and the counterpart funding from the
state government.
12.       Vacant key positions should be filled with qualified candidates
without delay.
13.       To attain self-sufficiency in seed production, the outgrower
scheme in the seed multiplication program should be encouraged. This would
involve farmers and hence it would be sustainable.
14.       The linkage between extension and research should be
strengthened through the on-farm adaptive research program.



- vii -
15.       Lack of adequate data hindered a thorough assessment of project
performance.
16.       An incorporation of agro-forestry into the extension program
would make agro-forestry more effective.
17.       The state governments should demonstrate adequate commitment to
the project by giving prompt attention to matters affecting the project,
and providing sufficient and timely financial support.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NiGERIA
EKITI-AKOKO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1854-UNI)
Bank Overview of the Ekiti-Akoko Agricultural Development Proiect
Comoletion Report which was Preopred by the
Nigerian Federal Ministry of Agriculture
A. GENERAL
1,        The Completion Report was prepared by the Federal Government's
Agricultural Projects Monitoring, and Evaluation Unit (APMEU). The report
consists of a main volume and two additional volumes covering various
aspects of the project. The main report provides a good overall coverage
of the project, is well structured, compares achievements in each section
with the expectations of the staff appraisal report and related deviations,
and offers an analysis of constraints and lessons learned for each major
component. The annexes were prepared by a wide range of staff from APMEU
and the Federal Agricultural Coordinating Unit (FACU) and, as would be
expected under those circumstances, are of varying quality. Because the
PCR provides an adequate coverage of project performance, this overview
will focus on those issues which impinge upon future agricultural projects
in Nigeria. These include sector development objectives and policy content
when the project was prepared, sources of project benefits, commercial
services, Bank performance, long-term sustainability, and lessons learned.
The PCR does not mention an important fact that the project had drawn only
44.32 of the Bank loan and did not complete its life. Benefits of the
project will have to be evaluated against this background.
2.        This is the ninth agricultural development project in Nigeria
for which completion reports have been prepared. In line with its
predecessors (Gombe, Gusau, Funtua, Lafia, Ayangba and 8ida), the project
was expected to have a broad impact on the production of all the crops
grown in the project area by using a combination of technical initiatives
to bring about a doubling of most crop yields. In the event the project
followed the pattern of the earlier projects and its impact was mainly
through its engineering and fertilizer distribution activities, resulting
in little general change in farming practices or production by the majority
of farming families in the project area.



- 2 -
3.        At the time of the implementation of the project the
Government's main short term development objective was to improve internal
price stability in basic food crops and to ensure adequate food supplies to
the rapidly expanding urban centers. Beyond this aim of assured food
supplies, Government's longer term objectives were to create a prosperouo
and efficient agro-based industries that could reduce population drift to
urban centers, and to revive the role of Nigeria as an agricultural
exporter.
4.        The framework for economic policy was set out in the Third Five-
Year Plan (1975-80). Although there was no well defined agricultural
development strategy, the Government was keenly aware of the need to
improve performance of the sector, and to use oil revenues, a depleting
asset, to expand and diversify the economy in which agriculture continues
to be the dominant sector. The program included irrigation, dissemination
of modern farming techniques to smallholders, improved inputs distribution
and marketing services and support for various integrated development
projects. The next Four-Year Development Plan (1981-85), under preparation
then, was expected to have the same basic focus.
B. SOURCES OF PROJECT BENEFITS
5.        The benefits from the project were mostly expected to derive
from major increases in yield from five crops, namely, yam, cassava, rice,
maize and cowpeas, and poultry. Two of these crops, yam and cassava, were
to provide about 682 of the total project benefits. The yield increases
were expected to result from the use. of improved seeds, higher plant
populations, the use of insecticides, fungicides and fertilizer, improved
land preparation, etc. The SAR attributed the major project benefit to
increased yam production (452 in year 5). Yield per ha were expected to
rise from 6.5 to 11 tons through the use of improved planting material and
the application of 200 kg of fertilizer. No improved planting material for
yam growers had been released during the period of project implementation.
6.        The second major crop, due to be promoted under the project, was
cassava (232 of benefits in year 5). In this case the incremental
production of two tons per ha from the use of new planting material and 100
kg of fertilizer was reasonable. The new cassava varieties from IITA were
available. The rate of their uptake, however, did not keep up with SAR
estimates. Only 500 ha of new cassava were planted in the fourth year as
opposed to the SAR target of 7000 ha.
7.        Poultry production (eggs and meat) was planned as a major
project activity responsible for 13Z of benefits in year 5. By the year 3,
one hundred units were expected to be established with a doubling ef this
number by year 5. By the end of the second year of the project (1983) 88
units had been established but the acute food shortage and resulting feed
shortage of 1984 had led to the slaughter of many of these flocks.
8.        Maiz-, rice and cowpeas were to contribute to the remaining
project benefits. However, poor quality seeds was a major constraint on
growth of their production.



C. EXTENSION
9.        The SAR anticipated that extension staff would be increased to
the point where 70,000 farmers would be covered on a ratio of 1 worker to
400/600 farmers. Actual extension workerafarmer ratio was much lower than
targeted by the SAR. Demonstrations were based on sole cropping while the
farmers practiced mixed cropping. This problem was confounded by the fact
that the ADP did not develop a sound two-way linkage with research
institutes or universities. Several trials were conducted during the life-
span of the project in collaboration with research institutes and
universities. Often the results of these trials were never sent back to
the project. Moreover, the project did not establish an advisory committee
provided in the SAR for coordination of research and extension. Thus
expected benefits to the extension system of the ADP hardly materialized.
Unification of extension would have helped the livestock component but its
extension activity was separated from the extension service for crop
production and it was also grossly inadequate.
10.       Extension messages were confined to the use of fertilizer,
planting material and limited application of herbicide. The minimum
tillage techniques which were expected to form the basis for the advanced
package were not effectively demonstrated in the area.
D. COMMERCIAL SERVICES
11.       The original financing for "Farm Inputs' distribution by the
IBRD Loan was drastically reduced and amended because the quantities of
farm inputs marketed declined considerably. The section related to the
credit services imposed a heavy drain on project resources. Performance of
the tractor hire service was similar and it was nowhere near covering its
costs. The SAR envisaged a decline in the activity of the tractor hire
unit during the project life and an increased focus on assisting private
operators. In reality this did not happen. In case of seeds, particularly
for rice and maize, it was not possible to assess the farmer demand because
the seeds supplied by the project were sold at well below normal market
rates for foodgrain.
12.       This experience with regard to input sales, tractor hire, seed
production and credit services tallies with experience in the other ADPs
and suggests that the government intervention in these activities should be
reconsidered.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
13.       In all, nine supervision missions had visited the project in a
matter of four years after its effectiveness and thus the project was
adequately supervised. The Bank had continuously persuaded ODSG to meet
its share of funding to the project but had by and large failed. Unlike
the PCR, the supervision missions did not find anythiag wrong in terms of
the quality of the expatriate firm managing the project. The exercise of



the recosting of the project done by FACU was reviewed by the Bank in
November 1985, that is, shortly before the cancellation of the Loan. The
review pointed out several lacunas in the technical messages propagated by
the project and thus indirectly raised questions about technical viability
of the project assumed by the SAR.
F. LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY
14.       The Bank has appraised a Multi-State Agricultural Development
Project (MSADP-II) which includes Ondo State and therefore the activities
undertaken in the project under review can be continued in future. MSADI-
III is designed explicitly to take care of the issue of sustainability
which is discussed at length in the next section on key lessons. The
following components of MSADP-III correct for weaknesses in the design of
Ekiti-Akoko ADP: (i) unification of extension; (ii) inclusion of tree-
crops; (iii) on-farm adaptive research program and its link with
agricultural research institutes; (iv) introduction of now available
improved technologies related to yam and cassava; (v) 752 of seed
production by contract growers; (vi) exclusive iocus on rehabilitation and
maintenance of roads; etc. The national credit system is being developed
by Government in order to handle shortfall in the supply of credit to
farmers.
G. KEY LESSONS
15.  (a)  A close supervision of the project management is necessary for
successful implementation of the project, particularly in terms
of the counterpart staff when expatriate staff is managing key
positions;
(b) technical packages included in the project need to be based on
proven technologies acceptable to farmers, and an appropriate
on-farm research program is needed to test improvements in
accepted practices;
(c)  closer linkages are needed between national research institutes
and extension services so that their programs respond to
problems experienced at farm level;
(d) extension services need to be unified to ensure a single source
of technical advice and streamlined to reduce overlap and
inefficiency;
(e) ADPs should be viewed in the wider context of state agricultural
expenditure programs and policies;
(f) there is need to privatize activities such as seed production
through outgtower program, input distribution at retail level,
road construction by contract, etc.; and such privatization
should be experimented on a long term basis; and



- 5 -
(g) there is a greater need for flexibility of program design and
implementation.
