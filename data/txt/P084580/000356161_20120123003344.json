Some lessons\n            learned includes: the capacity of the provincial education\n            authorities was substantially strengthened by the Technical\n            Support Unit (TSU) of the Finance Commission (FC). More\n            responsibilities and administrative powers were given to\n            provinces. The impact evaluation clearly shows that the\n            quality and efficiency of the service delivery has been\n            enhanced through the Program for School Improvement (PSI). A\n            strong monitoring and evaluation mechanism is a key for\n            project success. The high level monthly monitoring meeting\n            was possible because of the robust data monitoring systems\n            with the strong support from high officials of the\n            government.
