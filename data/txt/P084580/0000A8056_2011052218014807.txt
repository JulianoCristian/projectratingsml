                         The Education Sector Development Project has made satisfactory progress. All key performance indicators have either met their proposed targets or, in some cases, even exceeded
                         targets. The proportion of students completing grade 9 increased from 78 percent in 2005 to 91 percent in 2010. The learning outcomes of primary school children improved in

                         secondary education curriculum was revised and modernized. Examination guidelines and a bank of test items were produced for the GCE O/L and GCE A/L examinations.

                         Successful innovations such as school-based teacher development and Bilingual education were introduced or expanded. A sector development plan covering both national and
                         provincial education systems has been institutionalized.

                         Program implementation was considerably facilitated by the adoption of a programmatic sector-wide approach, with funds flowing to the central Ministry of Education and the
                         Provincial Councils along the same lines as the government budget. The implementation responsibility was devolved to the respective central and provincial education agencies. This
                         built considerable ownership in the government system at both central and provincial levels.
