The project will consist of the following\n            components: an action plan to reduce non-technical power\n            losses, technical assistance and training for the power loss\n            reduction program, and support for institutional reform and\n            strengthening. The action plan includes: transferring the\n            electricity inspectors to the Albanian Electroenergetic\n            Corporation (KESH), increasing their numbers, reorganizing\n            them, improving their equipment and assuring police support\n            if needed; replacing broken or faulty meters in the cities\n            of Tirana, Durres, Elabasan, Shkoder and Vlore, and\n            upgrading meter testing, calibration and repair; improving\n            consumer services management through establishing consumer\n            contracts, creating a better database, carrying out a\n            publicity campaign, and introducing incentive schemes in the\n            distribution entities. KESH will be converted to a joint\n            stock company and establish new accounting and financial systems."}, "docdt": "1994-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
