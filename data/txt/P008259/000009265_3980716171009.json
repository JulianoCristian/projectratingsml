Some lessons learned included:  the\n            non-technical power distribution loss problem in Albania has\n            become deeply rooted in the socio-economic and political\n            fabric of society, as evidenced also in the illegal use of\n            other public utility services such as water. It cannot be\n            resolved by the utility alone but requires strong and\n            consistent support from the Government and legal system as\n            well. The longer illegal consumption is allowed to continue,\n            the harder it will be to significantly reduce or eliminate\n            it. Illegal use of electricity, in turn, makes bill\n            collection from legal electricity users a more difficult\n            task. The twin trends of growing illegal electricity\n            consumption and unpaid electricity bills will cause steadily\n            increasing financial difficulties for the power sector, a\n            growing need for the Government to pay for imported\n            electricity, and a possible major breakdown in the power\n            system. These trends could create macroeconomic difficulties\n            and social and political problems."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
