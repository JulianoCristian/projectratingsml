                         Implementation Status Overview
                          SMMRP implementation has been successful; stakeholder reviews and feedback on the project were overwhelmingly positive. Some of the important achievements to-date include:
                         (i)      Airborne geophysical surveys of the entire country have been completed and Nigeria now has arguably the best and most modern geophysical coverage of any country in
                         Africa. This information is of inestimable value to companies wishing to explore for minerals; (ii) The modern mining cadastre system is now in place and operational. The Cadastre

                         developed and undergoing consultations process; (iv) The project emphasized the need for training the next generation of Nigeria leaders for the mining sector. This is exemplified in

                         the Nigeria Institute of Mining and Geosciences (NIMG) which is now operational and which has gone well beyond what was originally envisaged in the Project (the first batch of
                         students is to graduate in 2011), and in courses on mining accounting, governance, taxation and finance which focused on training of lecturers at various universities in the country;
                         (v) The small grants program for artisanal and community based miners has had good success in improving the productivity, safety and working conditions, and livelihoods of the
                         beneficiaries; (vi) The project assisted in development of new mineral product lines as, for instance, gemstones and dimension stone. Significant progress has been made to put
                         Nigeria on the map in respect of its gemstones and to develop local commercial and residential construction markets for the locally mined dimension stones.
