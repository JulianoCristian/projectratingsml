Sustainable Management\n            of Mineral Resources Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: keeping project design relatively simple\n            when operating in countries with complex environments,\n            limited capacity, and a weak country implementation record.\n            Making the stability of project management or coordination\n            units a covenant can be an effective means of avoiding\n            adverse consequences of political interference in complex\n            policy environments. While acquisition and development of\n            geo-data (geological, geo-physical, magnetic, etc.) is\n            instrumental in attracting investors, there is a parallel\n            demand for designing adequate systems and modalities for\n            dissemination (and sale) of the data to a wide international\n            audience. Web-based solutions have proven most efficient but\n            constrained by national security concerns and limited\n            band-with in developing countries; when the project is\n            supporting the start up and initial operating expenses of\n            new institutions, such as the Nigeria Institute of Mining\n            and Geosciences or the Mining Cadastre Office, it is\n            important to build a plan for phasing out subsidies for\n            operating expenses into project design. The importance of\n            government commitment to budgeting sufficient funds to cover\n            recurrent cost in order to sustain project investments\n            beyond the project closing date; the necessity to approach\n            mining sector development from different interrelated\n            angles, such as looking to reform, in parallel, the mining\n            sector's regulatory framework and institutional set up;\n            capacity building of the lead agency to improve governance;\n            increase transparency through computerization of the mining\n            cadastre; promote the mineral sector through high quality\n            data and integrated data management; and to redress adverse\n            environmental, social and economic conditions typically\n            associated with informal mining by incentivizing the\n            legalization of and giving a 'leg up out of\n            poverty' to small scale miners."}, "docdt": "2012-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
