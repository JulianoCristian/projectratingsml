                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in the implementation of a strategy designed to: (i) improve governance and technical capacity in the solid minerals
                         sector to enable the sustainable management of mineral resources; and (ii) establish a basis for poverty reduction and rural economic renewal in selected areas of the
                         territory of the Borrower via the development of non-farm income-generating opportunities through artisanal and small-scale mining and via diversification away from oil
                         sources of income

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was prepared in response to Nigeria Government's express intent to promote the mining sector as one of the industries which could help diversify the largely petroleum-
                         dependent economy. This objective remains relevant today since the Vision 2020 document for development and diversification of the Nigerian economy identifies the mining sector

                         as one of the strategic industries which are expected to contribute to diversifying the Nigerian economy and increasing job creation in rural areas. Accordingly, the project has
                         remained highly relevant for economic development and diversification. Feedback from central and local decision-makers confirms that project activities and outcomes have had a
                         high relevance in the federal and state-level development strategy. The project design is well-aligned with client needs as well as global best practice since the project activities
                         combine direct support to local economic development with focus on training and education of the next generation of sector professionals. Capacity building of current sector

                         professionals has proved its relevance in the reinvigoration of an industry which had been neglected for decades.

                         SMMRP implementation has been successful; stakeholder reviews (2007 and 2011) and feedback from industry, academia and local communities on the project are overwhelmingly
                         positive. The important project achievements include:
                          (i)      Airborne geophysical surveys of the entire country have been completed, and Nigeria now has arguably the best and most modern geophysical coverage of any country in
                         Africa, including map interpretations, hosted by the National Geological Survey Agency (NGSA). This information is of inestimable value to companies wishing to explore for
                         minerals; (ii) A modern Mining Cadastre Office (MCO) is now in place and operational. The cadastre procedures are transparent, publicly available, non-discretionary; (iii) Modern
                         mining law is now in place, fiscal regime for mining is updated and competitive, mining regulations developed and adopted in 2011; (iv) The project has contributed to the training of
                         the next generation of Nigeria leaders for the mining sector. This is exemplified in the Nigeria Institute of Mining and Geosciences (NIMG) which is now operational and which has
                         gone well beyond what was originally envisaged in the Project (the first batch of 32 students graduated in late 2011). Additional courses on mining accounting, governance, taxation
                         and finance have targeted lecturers at various universities in the country and the topics are now mainstreamed into regular curricular in several universities in Nigeria. All of these
                         project results contribute to the achievement of the first part of the Project Development Objective, i.e. promotion of governance, capacity development and sustainable sector
                         development.

                         Additional project results include: (v) The small grants program for artisanal and community based miners has had good success in improving the productivity, safety and working
                         conditions, and livelihoods of the beneficiaries; (vi) The project assisted in development of new mineral product lines such as gemstones and dimension stone. Significant progress
                         has been made to put Nigeria on the map in respect of its gemstones and to develop local commercial and residential construction markets for the locally mined dimension stones.
                         These results contribute the achievement of the second part of the Project Development Objective, i.e. rural economic development and diversification in order to generate income
                         from non-oil activities.

                         Efficiency in use of resources compared to achievement of outcomes has been good; all original components have been completed. The majority of PDO and results indicators have
                         achieved and exceeded targets while a few indicators have see marginal shortfalls (i.e. appr. 95% achievement). The ratio of operational costs to total budget is relatively high at
                         18.7%, but this is largely explained by the inclusion of NIMG and MCO development costs under "operating costs" as opposed to "consultant's services".

                         The project will be completed in May 2012 and project components are being wrapped-up.
