                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         (i) Increase the Government's long-term institutional and technical capacity to manage Nigeria's mineral resources in a sustainable way;
                          (ii) Establish a basis for poverty reduction and rural economic renewal in selected areas of the country via the development of nonfarm income generating
                         opportunities through small-scale and artisanal mining.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         SMMRP implementation has been successful; stakeholder reviews and feedback on the project were overwhelmingly positive. Some of the important achievements to-date include:
                         (i)      Airborne geophysical surveys of the entire country have been completed and Nigeria now has arguably the best and most modern geophysical coverage of any country in
                         Africa. This information is of inestimable value to companies wishing to explore for minerals; (ii) The modern mining cadastre system is now in place and operational. The Cadastre

                         procedures are transparent, publicly available, non-discretionary; (iii) Modern mining law is now in place, fiscal regime for mining is updated and competitive, mining regulations
                         developed and adopted in 2011; (iv) The project emphasized the need for training the next generation of Nigeria leaders for the mining sector. This is exemplified in the Nigeria
                         Institute of Mining and Geosciences (NIMG) which is now operational and which has gone well beyond what was originally envisaged in the Project (the first batch of students is to
                         graduate in late 2011), and in courses on mining accounting, governance, taxation and finance which focused on training of lecturers at various universities in the country and are

                         now mainstreamed into regular curricular in several universities in Nigeria; (v) The small grants program for artisanal and community based miners has had good success in
                         improving the productivity, safety and working conditions, and livelihoods of the beneficiaries; (vi) The project assisted in development of new mineral product lines as gemstones and
                         dimension stone. Significant progress has been made to put Nigeria on the map in respect of its gemstones and to develop local commercial and residential construction markets for
                         the locally mined dimension stones.

                         The project will be completed in May 2012 and project components are being wrapped-up.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is approaching completion and as such activities are being wrapped up. There is a strong need for the Government of Nigeria to design and internally adopt short-,
                         medium-, and long-term strategy for continued and sustainable mineral sector development after the completion of the project. It was agreed that preparation of such strategy can be
                         supported by the project to ensure its sustainability.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
