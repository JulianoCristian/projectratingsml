The\n            International Development Association (IDA) credit in the\n            amount of SDR 80.1 million (US$120 million equivalent) was\n            approved by the Board on December 14, 2004, and became\n            effective on April 25, 2005. Current closing date (after an\n            extension granted on November 24, 2009) is May 30, 2012. The\n            original project is expected to be fully disbursed by its\n            current closing date. The project has been consistently\n            rated satisfactory. The project is an important element of\n            the Government of Nigeria's strategy to diversify its\n            economy away from petroleum. The project has generated\n            substantial results, including establishment of a regulatory\n            framework and an institutional structure for a sector which\n            was, in the beginning of the project, generally informal and\n            unregulated. Some of the important achievements to-date\n            include: (i) airborne geophysical surveys of the entire\n            country have been completed; (ii) the modern transparent\n            mining cadastre system is now in place and operational;\n            (iii) modern mining law and regulations are now in place,\n            fiscal regime for mining is updated and competitive; (iv) to\n            train the next generation of Nigerian leaders for the mining\n            sector, the project supported re-opening and upgrading of\n            the Nigerian Institute for Mining and Geosciences (NIMG) as\n            well as rolling out accounting and finance courses for\n            mining sector personnel across colleges and universities in\n            Nigeria; (v) the small grants program for artisanal and\n            community based miners has supported almost 300 projects and\n            had improved the productivity, safety and working\n            conditions, and livelihoods of the beneficiaries; (vi) the\n            project assisted in development of new mineral product lines\n            including gemstones and dimension stone. Significant\n            progress has been made to put Nigeria on the map in respect\n            of the former and to develop local commercial and\n            residential construction markets for the latter."}, "docdt": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
