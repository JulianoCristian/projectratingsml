This\n            made communication between the resident engineer and the\n            Albanian Contractors difficult. The necessary interpretation\n            and translation was time consuming and often led to\n            misunderstandings and mistakes. As a result, the contract\n            language for all civil works contracts undertaken within the\n            ongoing Road Maintenance Project is English, although an\n            Albanian version of the bidding documents and contract has\n            been made available to local contractors during bid\n            preparation. (2) Management, administration, and\n            coordination of the project: In 2001: The General Roads\n            Directorate's Project implementation units (PIU's)\n            were merged to establish a single PIU for all government\n            road projects. Such a single embedded PIU possesses the best\n            management experience available in Albania, whilst requiring\n            less overhead and personnel cost per project because of\n            economies of scale, and makes the management of road\n            contracts - and the training of future PIU members - more\n            consistent and efficient. Ultimately, the project benefited\n            from the best available domestic knowledge and experience in\n            management, procurement, and accounting in Albania. This is\n            a key lesson, suggesting that a strong case would need to be\n            made to establish a project specific PIU in future, if there\n            is an already established competent PIU."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
