Prot. No. 758                                      Tirana on November 18, 1999.
Subject: Opinion on ToR of the EIA for the Emergency Road Repair Project
To: General Roads Directorate
(Ministry of Transport)
We examined carefully your explanatory Report and The Environment Management Plan
of the Emergency Road Repair Project in Albania.
In our opinion the Plan is enough detailed and in compliance with standards included in
our legislation, regarding environment and working conditions. So before your
application for construction & environment permission you would prepare in advance
Environment Impact Assessment according to the above mentioned Plan.
The noise pollution is a problem only in urban areas along the road axis and in areas with
sensitive bio diversity. Thus in this case noise and dust pollution should be reduced and
monitored.
In general problems related to noise and dust pollution are related with the expose of the
plant and equipment operators to them, and this problem is covered under Working
Hygiene.
We would suggest to contact Public Health Institute in Tirana, where is included the
Noise and Vibration Service, with a 27 years experience in the sector. Cooperation with
and some special equipment for them would be very helpful also for you.

OFFICE MEMORANDUM
DATE;  October 28. 1999
TO:  Elena Kastlerova, Task Team Leader, ECSIN
Cesar Queiroz, Task Team Leader, ECSIN
FROM: Bernard Baratz, Principal Environmental Specialist, ECSRE
EXTENSION:  32333
SUBJECT:  ALBANIA: Emergency Road Repair Project-Environmental Management Plan
Back to Office Report
1.   In accordance with my Terms of Reference (dated October 5, 1999), I
visited Tirana for a period of about six days. The purpose of my visit was to assist the
implementing agency (General Roads Directorate, GRD) in the preparation of an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) in accordance with World Bank requirements.
2.    I coordinated my program with Mr. Guxho, and met with the following
people:
Dipl. Eng. Lorenc Mishaxhiu
Director of Maintenance Directorate, GRD
Mr. Edmond Alite
Coordination Unit,
Planning Department, GRD
Dr. Tatjana Hema
Director of Air, Water Quality
.And Works Management
National Environmental Agency of Albania (NEAA)
3.    I then visited the subject project roads from Tirana to Fushe-Arrez (further
travel to Kukes was considered unsafe), and then from Berat to Corovode. I[ also visited
typical quarries and asphalt plants along the way. Based on these meetings and visits I
prepared a draft EMP for discussion with both GRD and NEAA. Unfortunately, neither
of them was available on my last day. As a consequence, I shall briefly describe the
outstanding issues, and detail the remaining follow up activities which must be
performed.
4.    Issues: The chief outstanding issue is project approval from NEAA. Dr.
Hema indicated to me that the subject project does according to Albanian law require an
environmental license. She said that the GRD should forward a request to her office
describing the project and a small report on the mitigating measures to be taken (I believe
the EMP I prepared, when completed, would suffice) and they would then make a
decision as to whether a preliminary EA or a full EA would be necessary. If adequate

material is provided to NEAA and a preliminary EA is all that is required, she claimed
that a license could be granted within two days.
5.    Dr. Hema also expressed some concern about extraction activities from
river beds (sand and gravel) and that they are subject to Albanian environmental
regulations. I mentioned to her that any activities of this type must be fully licensed by
NEAA, and that this requirement would be specified in the bidding document.
6.    In my discussions with GRD I informed them of the requirement of a
public consultation as part of their EMP, and described to them in detail the
documentation required. They claimed to understand, and agreed to conduct the public
consultations accordingly. I also recommend that the public consultations be used as an
opportunity to determine: (a) satisfactory work hours for the work crews so that
disturbances to local affected groups are mininmized, and (b) the type and location of
road hazard signs local affected groups believe are necessary
7.    The remaining activities where agreement was reached are cited below.
Unfortunately, I could meet with officials of GRD and NEAA (by telephone) only very
briefly. As a consequence, a schedule could not be agreed upon. However, GRD is fully
aware of the December 8 deadline for the EMP as a condition of Board presentation. I
have also attached a copy of the draft EMP I prepared that should be shared with GRD (I
experienced formatting difficulties with my laptop so the presentation is less than
perfect). Completion/agreement with the list of activities presented below in conjunction
with the draft EMP should constitute all that is necessary to meet World Bank
requirements.
*  GRD to conduct consultations with affected groups and local NGOs and document
these consultations for the EMP
e  Agreement by GRD to allow their final EMP to be placed in the Public Information
Center of the World Bank (Washington, D.C.)
*  Placement of the final EMP by GRD at public facilities within Albania for review by
projected affected groups and local NGOs
*  A condition to be placed in bid documents of material suppliers (asphalt, crushed
stone, sand and gravel etc.) that only those suppliers who obtain approval and/or a
license to operate from the NEAA would be considered comrrpetitive.
Agreement was obtained with NEAA to approve and/or license material suppliers
(other than sand and gravel operators) since such approval/licensing is currently
not covered under the existing regulatory regime.
*  Cost estimates to install and maintain covers for trucks carrying asphalt, stone, and
sand/gravel
*  Cost estimates to install and maintain sprinkling systems for dust suppression at
construction sites
*  Cost estimates to install and maintain appropriate measures that are easily seen or
easy to follow for traffic redirection at construction sites



Elena Kastlerova                      -3-                         October 28. 1999
*  Cost estimates to install and maintain appropriate lighting and safety signs at
construction sites, for use in the evening when no work is occurring but the site must
still be protected
*  Cost estimates to install and maintain covers for material storage at the construction
site, and any other devices to prevent contaminated runoff waters from polluting
nearby surface waters
*  Cost estimates to install a reasonable number of safety signs and devices (convex
mirrors) along the roads considered in the project
*  Number and unit cost of sound level detectors needed
Agreement was obtained with NEAA to conduct site noise monitoring
*  Number, type and cost of air quality monitoring equipment (low cost Ringlemann kit
is recommended)
Agreement was obtained with NEAA to conduct site air quality
monitoring
* Cost estimates to do simple runoff water testing at construction sites
Agreement was obtained with NEAA to conduct simple water quality
testing (turbidity and/or suspended solids) at construction sites during
rainy weather
8.    I know the list looks formidable, but in fact most of the items are trivial or
of minimal cost, and if indeed the cost is trivial, it need not be provided, but an entry of
"regligible" would be adequate.
