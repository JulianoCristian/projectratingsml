Public consultations\n            were recommended, to inform the community, and use this\n            opportunity to determine, a) satisfactory working schedules,\n            to minimize noise, and air pollution, and, b) allocation of\n            road safety measures. The EMP thus recommends the inclusion\n            of conditions on procurement documents, requiring the\n            contractors to comply with delivery, and operational\n            regulations in accordance with the National Environmental\n            Agency of Albania (NEAA). The construction site should limit\n            activities to daytime schedules only, in addition to\n            installing sound level detectors, and, appropriate traffic\n            safety measures should be in place to redirect traffic as\n            needed, through defined road signs. Sprinkling systems for\n            dust suppression should be installed at construction sites,\n            as well as covers to maintain stored materials on site,\n            including prevention devices to avoid contaminated runoff\n            waters, from polluting surface waters. Water quality testing\n            for turbidity and/or suspended solids, should be conducted,\n            and the use of air quality monitoring equipment (low cost\n            Ringlemann kit) is recommended."}, "docdt": "1999-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
