INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXBTUTIVE DIRBETORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $8 million to the
Republic of the Philippines.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed highway project is an outcome of the UNDP Transport
Survey of the Philippines which was carried out by consultants in 1968/69 with
the Bank as Executing Agency. The primary objective of the Survey was to
prepare a long term investment program for the transport sector. The Survey
also included the preparation of feasibility studies for priority roads which
it was hoped might lead to Bank financing. Detailed engineering of the
project, based on the feasibility studies prepared under the ',urvey, started
in early 1970 and was completed by the end of 1970. A Bank mission appraised
the project in July 1970.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington from
February 22 to March 1, 1971. The Government was represented by
Mr. Antonio M. Locsin, Deputy Director General of the Presidential Economic
Staff, Mr. Baltazar Aquino, Commissioner, Bureau of Public Highway8,
and Mr. Gregorio San Agustin, Director, Legal and Policy Research Office,
Presidential Economic Staff.
4.        If approved, the proposed loan would be the fifteenth in the Philip-
pines and would increase the total amount lent to $239 million, net of
cancellations. The proposed loan would be the second in the transport sector
and the first for highways. The following is a summary of Bank loans to the
Philippines as of February 28, 1971:

a/ Not yet effective.
5.        In my report of January 13, 1971 on the Rice Processing Project,the
Executive Directors were informed that disbursement was lagging on some
projects. In the case of the Second Rural Credit Project (Loan No. 607 PH),
the Government is expected, early in April, to propose changes in the project
designed to stimulate demand which has been adversely affected by the change
in the value of the peso after the exchange reforii of February 1970. A Bank
mission is scheduled to visit Manila in the spring to discuss these proposals
with the authorities. The rate of disbursement under Loan 630 PH to the
Private Development Corporation of the Philippines is likely to improve
following a recent increase in commitments, although the demand for industrial
loans is still weak. After initial delays in the award of the equipment
contract, the Fourth Power Project (Loan No. 491 PH) has been progressing
fairly satisfactorily. Measures for improving the financial position of the
project authority - the National Power Corporation (NPC) - are being discussed
with the Government.
6.        No IDA credits have been made to the Philippines.   IFC has made six
commitments in the Philippines totalling $32.2 million, of which IFC now holds
j32.5 million (including $8 million not yet effective), net of participations,
sales and cancellations. Several projects in the Philippines, including a
?.c:kel mining project and an aluminum smelter project, are currently under



- 3 -
various stages of consideration by IFC. Further Bank loans for agriculture
and education are under;consideration for FY 1972; and also for power on the
assumption that satisfactory steps will be taken by the Government to
strengthen NPC's finances.
PART !I - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.        Borrower:                     Republic of the Philippines
Amount:                       $8 million
Purpose:                      To finance the foreign exchange costs
of the construction and improvement
of the Cotabato-Digos road (160 km)
in Mindanao and of consultants' services,
and interest and other charges during
construction.
Amortization:                  In 24 years including a four-year period
of grace, through semi-annual instal-
ments beginning May 15, 1975 and ending
November 15, 1994.
Interest Rate:                7-1/4% per annum.
Commitment Charge:             3/4 of 1% per annum.
Estimated Economic Return
on the Project Road:       18%.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Project - Philippines"
(PTR 68a) is attached.
9.        In line with the recommendations of the Transport Survey for a long
term investment program in the transport sector, the Government is giving high
priority to improving transport facilities, particularly highways. In its
current five-year (FY 1971-75) infrastructure investment program ($1,130 million
equivalent) issued in February 1971, transport investments account for 46%
or $510 million, of which highways alone account for about 70% or $370 million.
10.       As part of the Transport Survey, the consultants carried out feasib-
ility studies of about 1,000 km of priority roads. Based on these feasibility
studies, the Government, with the Bank's agreement, had detailed engineering
studies made of three roads totalling about 900 km - the Cabanatuan-Tuguegarao
and Lucena-Legaspi roads in Luzon and the Cotabato-Digos road in Mindanao - as



a basis for a project for Bank consideration; at the Government's request
the Bank agreed to consider financing retroactively the foreign exchange
cost of the detailed engineering if and when a Bank loan were made for the
project. Subsequently, it was determined by the Government that equipment
for the construction of the two roads in Luzon would be financed from the
proceeds of a loan contracted with Japan in 1969 for the reconstruction
of various sections of the Pan-Philippine Highway - a north-south route linking
the islands of Luzon and Mindanao. Accordingly,the Bank agreed to consider
only the construction of the road in Mindanao, and, in view of its earlier
commitment, to include in the proposed project, the detailed engineering not
only of this road but also of the two roads in Luzon.
11.       The proposed project would consist of the following elements:
(a) Construction and improvement of the Cotabato-Digos road
of about 160 km in Mindanao;
(b) Consultants' services for:
i.     construction supervision of the Cotabato-Digos road;
ii.     detailed engineering of this road and the Cabanatuan-
Tuguegarao and Lucena-Legaspi roads in Luzon;
iii.     detailed engineering of about 700 km of roads to be
selected from item (c) below;
(c) Feasibility studies of about 1,000 km of roads; and
(d) Technical assistance to the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH)
for operational improvements.
12.       The proposed loan includes an amount of $3.3 million representing
the foreign exchange costs of road construction and $2.6 million representing
the foreign exchange costs of consulting services. An allocation of $900
thousand has been made to cover contingencies in both categories. The
proposed loan would also finance interest and other loan charges (estimated at
$1.2 million) to cover a period of roughly 4 years when, as indicated in
Part V of this report, the debt service burden of the Philippines is likely to
be exceptionally heavy.
13.       Contracts for road construction   (expected to commence in the
third quarter of 1971) will be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding. With the Bank's concurrence, prequalification of contractors
started in January 1971. Judging from contractors interested in the project,
it is most likely that the contracts would be won by joint ventures of local
and foreign contractors or by foreign contractors. Depending on the degree of
local participation in the successful bids, the foreign exchange component of
the total construction cost (estimated at $5.9 million) could vary between
52 per cent (about $3.1 million) if there were joint ventures with equal



local and foreign participation and 60 per cent (about $3.6 million) if the
contracts were won by foreign contractors. It was agreed with Government that
the most probable local/foreign contractor participation in construction
would r,>sult in a foreign exchange component of 55 per cent (about $3.3 million)
and I propose that the Bank finance this amount. Should the contracts be won
by joint ventures with a local participation of more than 50 per cent, the Bank
loan would finance a small part of local currency expenditures. Conversely,
if the contracts should be won by joint ventures with a local participation of less
than 50 per cent - or by foreign contractors - the loan would not finance the
entire foreign exchange cost of construction and the shortfall would be met by
the Government.
14.       Local currency costs of the project are estimated at P35.9 million
($5.9 million equivalent). Budget appropriations have been made for this
amount and, therefore, problems of peso financing are not expected to arise
as they did in some of the previous Bank-financed projects.
15.       The foreign exchange cost of $2.6 million for consultants' services
includes $750,000 for retroactive financing to February 1970 of detailed engineer-
ing of the project road in Mindanao and the two roads in Lazon (see para. 10);
approximately $600,000 for supervision of construction; and a further
US$1.2 million for detailed engineering of about 700 km of roads to be selected
from the UTNDP-financed feabisility studies referred to below.
16.       The Bank will be working closely with UNDP on this project.   UNDP is
prepared to finance items (c) and (d) in para. 11 above, namely, the feasibility
studies of additional priority roads and technical assistance to imorove the
operations of BPH, the agency responsible for project execution. The Bank has
agreed to act as the Executing Agency for both these items of END   assistance.
It is expected that the technical assistance to BPH and the feasibility studies
will start about mid-1971.
17.       The operations of BPH suffer considerably from overstaffing, both at
headquarters and in the field. Furthermore, there is a proliferation of
technical and administrative divisions at headquarters which contribute to lack
of planning and control of field operations, particularly road maintefnance.
The technical assistance provided under the UNDP grant is designed to assist
the BPH in carrying out the necessary reforms which do not require legislative
action. Other reforms must await legislation which is expected to follow from
a study on the reorganization of all departments and agencies which has just
been completed by a Presidential Commission.
18.       The Commission has reached the same general conclusions as the
Transport Survey regarding the transport sector. Both have found that adequate
transport olanning and coordination are lacking and concluded that all
trarnsport matters should be brought under the Department of Public tbrks and
Communications (DPWC) and that the DFWC itself should be reorganized and
strengthened. The Commission's proposals are being considered by the President
and are to be submitted to Congress in May 1971. The proposals concerning the
transport sector have incorporated a number of comments made by the Bank staff
during auid since the appraisal of last July and, if implemented, would improve
the operations of government transport agencies. The Bank has some reservations



- 6 -
as to whether transport planning and coordination are adequately dealt with in
the proposed reorganization of DPWC. This will be the subject of further review
and discussions with the Government during execution of the project.
19.       The Cotabato-Digos road is the only east-west link in central Mindanao,
one of the richest agricultural areas in the Philippines. On the basis of savings
in vehicle operating costs the rate of return for the road construction is
estimated at 18%. Construction of the road has high priority and the feasibility
studies and detailed engineering of other priority roads should facilitate
further investments in the highway sector. The road construction would take
about three years, the feasibility studies and subsequent detailed engineering
about two years and the technical assistance to BPH about two years.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND. AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section h(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
21.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions normally used for highway
projects. The execution of a Plan of Operation for the highway technical
assistance and feasibility studies to be financed by UNDP is made a condition
of the effectiveness of the loan.
PART V - THE EONOMY
22.       A Bank economic mission visited Manila in February/March 1971 to
update the economic report (No. EAP-16a) which was distributed to the
Executive Directors last August.   The mission's report, which will be
distributed to the Executive Directors shortly, will serve as a basis for
discussions at the inaugural meeting of the Consultative Group for the
Philippines to be held in Paris on April 22 and 23.
23.       The mission's findings are still under review.    Its preliminary
conclusions are that impressive results have been achieved by the Government
in implementing the stabilization program under the standby agreement negotiated
with the IMF a year ago. The exchange reform of February 1970, accompanied by
fiscal and credit measures, resulted in substantial improvement in the balance
of payments position.   In 1970, exports rose by 22%, and the trade deficit
was reduced to $26 million from $257 million in 1969. Gross foreign exchange
reserves were up by 90% ($111 million) to $237 million at the end of 1970,
despite a heavy debt service burden involving total service payment of some
$468 million in 1970. Internally, measures were taken to improve fiscal
performance and to restrain credit expansion. For the year ending June 30, 1971,
tax revenue was estimated to rise by 25% compared with 13% in 1969/70, and a



- 7 -
budget surplus of P460 *illion on current account was foreseen as against a
current budget deficit (if P220 million in 1969/70. Gross domestic savings
increased to 18.4% of GDP in 1970 from 15.7% in 1969. In 1970, the increase
in money supply was reduced to 6% from 19% in 1969, and the rate of net domestic
credit expansion was down to 6% from 25% in 1969. Earlier this month a standby
agreement was reached with the IMF which allows for Philippine drawings of up
to $45 million in foreign exchange for the next 12 months.
24.       The rate of growth, already affected by severe typhoon damage to
major crops last year, is currently hampered by the restrictive measures which
have been necessary to restore stability and by the large demands on resources
to service external debt. The real growth rate of GNP in 1970 is expected to
be 4.4% compared with 6.2% in 1969.
25.       The external debt service ratio will be about 28% of exports of goods
and services over the next three years. This high ratio is attributable to
the very large proportion of the total debt in short and medium maturities.
Nearly 60% is due for repayment within the three year period 1971-1973.
Notwithstanding this su]-stantial short term debt, the Philippines is credit-
worthy for loans on conventional terms having regard to the favorable outlook
for exports and the prospects of regular and substantial inflow of capital.
26.       A larger inflow of longer-term capital on more favorable terms and
with longer grace periods would be helpful. This would in effect allow the
Philippines to substitute long term for short term debt, thereby spreading
repayments over a longer term and reducing the debt service requirements for
any particular year. This is one of the matters which will be discussed at
the Consultative Group meeting in April.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
