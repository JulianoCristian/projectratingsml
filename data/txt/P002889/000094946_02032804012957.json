sustainability, negligible\n            institutional development impacts, and unsatisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank, and Borrower. Several lessons\n            are drawn from the project. The lack of control mechanisms,\n            and weak management within the Education Fund to address\n            insufficient budgetary resources to pay teacher salaries\n            created problems, because as part of an emergency response,\n            the overall environment was of weak capacity, and\n            instability. Instead, building on the existing capacity, or\n            outsourcing the fund's financial management would have\n            been preferable, particularly the former option in terms of\n            sustainability. Furthermore, the whole project concept was\n            premised on the financial support of parents, and\n            communities - in a continuing economic crisis with falling\n            family revenues - including on an expectation that\n            consumption taxes could be levied at the grassroots, which\n            proved unrealistic, and almost jeopardized community\n            voluntary contributions of public school fees. Rather, a\n            careful assessment, and monitoring could have appropriately\n            focused on beneficiary expectations. Despite a seemingly\n            adequate implementation support by the Bank, and Borrower,\n            failure to gauge the emergency situation, and weak\n            governance hindered success, experienced by failed control\n            mechanisms, preventable had public finance management been\n            strengthened; because of mistaken assumptions that textbooks\n            publishers would easily negotiate legitimate copyrights\n            instead of easing procurement of generic textbooks; because\n            of failure to adequately evaluate contractors capacity,\n            explore procurement management, and provide needed technical\n            support; and because of the absence of an agreed policy\n            framework regarding decentralization to the regional level."}, "docdt": "2002-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
