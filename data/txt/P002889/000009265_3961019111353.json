and\n            political unrest and a decade of declining enrollment and\n            quality. The project has two objectives: to improve the\n            quality of schools and to develop better education system\n            management. The project comprises two components: 1) the\n            development of better schools through school construction\n            and rehabilitation, provision of textbooks, and the Quality\n            of Schools Initiative; and 2) development of better\n            education system management through decentralized\n            recruitment and financing of teachers, development of system\n            managment tools including information and communication\n            systems, budgetary programming and monitoring, consolidation\n            of the minsterial restructuring by strengthening\n            decision-making process and further decentralizing the\n            responsibility for instructional as well as financial management."}, "docdt": "1995-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
