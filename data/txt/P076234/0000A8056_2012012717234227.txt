                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Project continues to be highly satisfactorily with visible and well documented results and impact in community mobilization, rural infrastructure upgrading
                         and attention to maintenance and sustainability planning. Total disbursements stand at $13.36 million and 228 Community Projects (CPs) have been completed out of approximately
                         305 CPs envisaged for the Project. The increase in the projected total number of CPs financed (from 250 to over 300) is due to savings accumulated through the project lifespan. The
                         sectoral composition of the 298 ongoing and completed Community Projects currently comprises roads – 63%; potable water – 13%; electricity – 12%; irrigation – 5%; schools – 3%;
                         health – 2%; drainage – 1%. 70 CPs are currently at the stage of social mobilization, training and proposal development, registration, appraisal, approval, procurement and project
                         implementation.
