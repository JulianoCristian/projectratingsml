                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation support mission for the project was carried out from April 29-May 16, 2014.

                         POWERGRID continues to demonstrate efficiency in project implementation and as on June 9, 2014, almost 96% of funds have been disbursed in PSDP IV whereas for additional
                         financing almost 84% of funds have been disbursed, 1.5 months before project closing date. POWERGRID has recorded cost savings under the schemes approved at the appraisal
                         stage. With completion of restructuring on May 23, 2014, a new scheme (SRSS 13) has been added to PSDP IV. On assessment of progress of work under this scheme, it is noted
                         that the scheme is facing severe right-of-way issues, especially in the state of Karnataka (400kV D/C Gooty-Madhugiri and 400kV D/C Quad Madhugiri-Yelhanka lines). Even though
                         all the packages under this scheme have been awarded and implementation has begun, the progress is slower than anticipated. POWERGRID is in dialogue with the state authorities

                         under PSDP IV and IV FAF have been completed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         With the completion of the project restructuring, the attention is now being focused on the completion of the new scheme (SRSS 13) included under PSDP IV. The scheme is facing
                         severe right-of-way issues and completion is expected by December 2014, five months after the loan closing date. POWERGRID is in dialogue with the state representatives to
                         resolve the issue at the earliest. With this delay in commissioning of the scheme, the PDO rating is being downgraded from Highly Satisfactory to Satisfactory.

                         Restructuring History
                         Level 2 CD Decision on 23-May-2014
