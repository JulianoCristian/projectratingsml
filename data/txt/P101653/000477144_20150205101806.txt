1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal (2007-08)

1.      Country background. At appraisal, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a
remarkable rate of 9.4 percent during FY2007 and this was expected to be sustained and reach 10
percent by the end of the 11th Five Year Plan (2007–12). However, due to the global crisis,
growth slowed down and the GDP touched only 6.69 percent at the end of FY2012; in FY2013,
the GDP growth was only 4.47 percent. India’s growth is expected to rise to its medium-term
growth potential of about 6.75 percent once recently approved investment projects are
implemented and as global growth improves.1 Although India has made significant progress in
reducing absolute poverty, it remains home to one-third of the global poor. India has already
achieved the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG 1) by halving the proportion of people
living on less than US$1.25 a day as early as in FY2012.2 Rural poverty has decreased by 16
percent, and the less well-off are increasingly reaping the benefits of shared prosperity, with
consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent rising to catch up with average consumption
growth. However, Indian society still remains highly segmented and income inequalities are
rising. With a gross national income (GNI) per capita at US$1,570 in 2013, India remains at the
bottom of the group of middle-income countries and more than 400 million people still live in
poverty.3

2.       Sector background. Post-independence, the Indian power sector was concentrated in few
towns and urban areas. To provide power to the population along with an effort to provide
irrigation benefits, massive river-valley projects were developed. With rapid industrial
development, there was a necessity to integrate various state grids, which resulted in the
formation of the five regional transmission grids in the country. With thermal generating plants
setting up near pit heads and producing large amounts of power, transmission voltage levels
increased from an initial 220 kV to 400 kV in the 1980s and to high voltage direct current
(HVDC) in the 1990s, enabling bulk transfer of power across the states and regions. This was
even more important as large consumption centers were scattered across the country while power
generation centers were predominantly located in select states. In parallel, the sector was
unbundled and regulatory commissions were set up at the central as well as state levels. This led
to private sector participation beginning with power generation and followed by the distribution
and transmission sectors.

3.       At project appraisal (2007–2008), the sector was affected by chronic shortages of
electricity and a growing demand. Given the priorities of India’s 10th Five Year Plan (2002–
2007), investments in the sector needed to deal with (a) the limitations of grid integration; (b) the


1
  IMF country report February 2014 and India Labor Market Update - December 2013. Following a sustained period of
growth, India’s economy slowed down rapidly over the last eighteen months. The GDP growth rate touched a low of
5.0 per cent in FY2012/13, before bottoming out at 4.4 per cent in the first quarter of FY2013/14. In general, economic
growth in India is largely driven by services (from a supply-side perspective) and private consumption (taking a
demand-side view). However, the slowdown during 2012 and 2013 was associated with a dramatic decrease in the
growth of industry and investment. These two dimensions are critical if India is to return to higher and sustained rates
of growth.

deficit in power sector capacity; and (c) severe shortages as peak load shortages reached 12.1
percent and energy shortages 7.2 percent (in 2005) resulting in substantial losses to the economy.4
In 2010, the country’s peak power deficit was at 12.7 percent and the average deficit at 10.1
percent. Therefore, the country constantly needed additional power as it suffered from shortfalls
in both generation and transmission capacity.5 The country's installed generation capacity was
expected to be more than 200 GW by 2012 from the level of 140 GW in 2008. This meant that
demand was to be fully met by 2012 (‘Power for All by 2012’) while shortages were to be
recouped. To deliver this power across the country, an expansion of the regional transmission
network and interregional capacity to transmit power was essential. The country's transmission
plan focused on the consolidation of the National Grid by adding over 31,500 ckm of
transmission network by 2014, over the project period starting from 2007. However,
POWERGRID actually added over 47,000 ckm to reach 106,804 ckm of transmission lines,
which carries about 50 percent of the power generated in the country. For creation of such a grid,
an investment of about US$18 billion was estimated under the 12th Five Year Plan (2012–17).
Out of this, about US$14 billion was planned to be mobilized by POWERGRID and the
remaining US$4 billion through private sector participation.

4.      Operational aspects of the sector. The sector’s operations and management by
POWERGRID continue to be regulated by the Electricity Act of 2003 which brought together
structural and regulatory reforms designed to foster competitive markets, encourage private
participation, and transform the state's role from service provider to regulator. In transmission, the
enforcement of grid discipline, facilitation of interstate and interregional power transfers, and
trading have improved overall power system efficiency. The Electricity Act of 2003 is now being
amended6—the amendments are yet to be finalized—to implement further power sector reforms
through promoting competition, improving efficiencies, and encouraging the clean energy sector.

5.      POWERGRID has been reinforcing its operational capability of grid management and
operations through Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO), a fully owned
subsidiary of POWERGRID. POSOCO, with its state-of-the-art Unified Load Dispatch and
Communication (ULDC) facilities is mandated to carry out proficient, consistent, and

September 2011. The project impact was to accelerate the development of the interregional grid system to deliver
increased power supply to sustain the country’s economic growth. The project outcome, strengthening of the transmission
capacity and more efficient operations, aimed at increasing reliable power supply from private independent power
producers (IPPs) and public utilities through the interconnected grid.

  The amendments aim at strengthening the penalty provisions, increasing the penalty manifold, and making them more
enforceable. Changes to the tariff policy are also expected, to encourage more competition in power distribution, and to
give consumers a choice of companies for power supply. While there will be a government distributor of power to
ensure that power is provided to the weaker sections of society, competition will be introduced through a private sector
role in the sector. Furthermore, to boost the wind energy sector, the government proposes to bring in amendments to the
act introducing stricter penalties for failing to meet renewable purchase obligation (RPO) targets. Under the RPO
system, the state power distribution companies have to mandatorily purchase electricity generated through renewable
energy sources during the year. The proposed changes will also introduce the renewable generation obligation (RGO),
which will make it compulsory for thermal power producers to generate electricity through renewables. Overall, the
government is aiming at 2 trillion units of electricity generation by 2020, in which renewable sources are to account for
15 percent. The share of renewable energy is currently around 6 percent of a total base of 1 trillion units of electricity.

transparent grid operation and management in the country. Further, the National Load Despatch
Center (NLDC) and Regional Load Despatch Centers (RLDCs) have been continuously
upgraded and modernized to establish an effective grid management infrastructure in the
country. During FY2014, to meet the demands in the country, an interregional energy transfer of
about 78.38 billion units (BU), which is more than double of 37.75 BU in FY2007, was
facilitated across the nation using pan-India interregional transmission links and modernized
RLDCs.

6.       Rationale for World Bank assistance. The Bank’s strategy for the power sector in India
remains centered on promoting economically and financially sustainable access to electricity by
addressing bottlenecks in generation, transmission, and distribution at both the state as well as
national level through the financing of relevant public investments, while at the same time
promoting policies and regulatory measures for efficient sector operations and private sector
participation. This project, which was part of a larger program, was designed to contribute to
addressing the constraints existing in the transmission subsector and to optimize the development
of its infrastructure. The Bank has in the past supported investments in POWERGRID to
strengthen the national transmission network and increase the interregional power transfer
capacity. These investments aimed at improving the outcome-orientation and service delivery of
POWERGRID, by (a) facilitating higher economic use of generation resources and helping to
harness low carbon primary energy sources such as hydropower and wind; (b) providing optimal
integration and greater grid stability; (c) establishing the open access regime mandated in the
Electricity Act of 2003; and (d) facilitating the development of a power trading market within the
country and, wherever feasible, with India's neighbors. The Bank has helped POWERGRID
emerge as one of the world's largest transmission utilities through a series of investments
amounting to about US$3.7 billion since 1993 and intensive capacity-building support during
POWERGRID’s formative years. The Power System Development Project (PSDP) series has
been very effective in delivering financial assistance by the Bank to the projects launched by
POWERGRID in the transmission subsector—the Northern Region Transmission Project (NRTP)
for US$475 million that closed in September 2000; the First PSDP (PSDP I) with a loan of
US$350 million that closed in December 2000; the Second PSDP (PSDP II) with a loan of
US$450 million that closed in June 2006; and PSDP III with a loan of US$400 million that closed
in July 2011.

7.      POWERGRID projects have contributed to the development of high-capacity
transmission corridors which increased the interregional capacity of the National Grid from 1,500
MW in FY1999 to 14,100 MW in FY2007 (baseline year for PSDP IV) and to 37,950 MW in
FY2014 (end year for PSDP IV). Correspondingly, it significantly expanded the network of
transmission lines from 35,119 ckm in FY1999 to 59,400 ckm in FY2007 and to 106,804 ckm in
FY2014. In FY2007, the interregional transmission capacity facilitated energy exchange of
almost 37,750 million units (MU) across India to about 78,384 MU in FY2014. During the period,
the total transformation capacity increased from 59,400 MVA (FY 2007) to 205,923 MVA
(FY2014).

8.       Infrastructure development and supply-demand balance management. The PSDP loans
are at the core of the sector’s capacity to deal with expanding demand as repetitive energy and
peak shortages need to be resolved. POWERGRID has established a strong and reliable national
grid in a phased manner to facilitate the optimum utilization of generating resources, the
conservation of eco-sensitive ‘right of way’, and the enhancement of its flexibility to
accommodate uncertainty of generation plans. On December 31, 2013, POWERGRID achieved a
milestone when the Southern Grid was synchronously interconnected with the rest of the national
grid through the commissioning of the 765 kV Raichur (Karnataka)-Solapur (Maharashtra) single


                                                3
circuit (S/C) line (funded under PSDP V). This has resulted not only in increasing the
transmission transfer capacity by 2,100 MW but also in dealing effectively with the congestion
being experienced in the transmission corridor. These infrastructure improvements were a boost
for further economic growth of the country.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(as approved)

9.      The objective of the project was to strengthen India's electricity transmission system in
order to increase reliable power exchanges between regions and states. ‘Growth in Power
Exchange between Regions’ was used as the key indicator to measure the performance in
achieving the PDO.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and KPI, and
Reasons/Justification

10.      Although the project was restructured 7 in May 2014, its PDO was not revised as it
                                                 QQ transmission system in order to increase
remained focused on strengthening India’s electricity
reliable power exchange between regions and states.

11.      The restructuring was triggered by the significant savings/surplus of about US$145
million under the loan (of which about US$60 million was under PSDP IV and about US$85
million was under PSDP IV AF) resulting from the combined effects of a highly competitive
market, the continuing devaluation of the India rupee (INR) against the U.S. dollar since loan
approval, and the regulatory requirements to maintain a debt-equity ratio of 70:30 for all the
schemes financed by POWERGRID. Further, in addition to the inclusion of a new scheme,
another scheme was shifted (originally approved at appraisal) from PSDP V to PSDP IV AF to
leverage flexibility in the POWERGRID portfolio among projects that had the same PDO and
KPIs to optimally utilize available funds across its various engagements. Specifically, the
restructuring included:

       a. Inclusion of a new scheme in PSDP IV—Southern Region System Strengthening Scheme
          XIII (SRSS 13)

       b. Shifting a scheme from PSDP V to PSDP IV AF—System Strengthening in Western
          Region for Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project (UMPP)




7
    It was a level-2 restructuring that required Country Director clearance.




                                                              4
12.      Change in KPI. The project had only one outcome indicator (interregional power
exchange) that outperformed its existing (as per the PAD) end-year (FY2014) target. The project
also had two result indicators: (a) transmission capacity and (b) transformation capacity. For
transmission capacity, targets for FY2010 till FY2013, as agreed during the appraisal, were
revised downward during the April 2010 implementation support mission of the project due to
factors beyond the control of POWERGRID as explained below.

13.      In August 2009, the government of India (GoI) issued a notification under the Forest
Rights Act (FRA) that required the project implementing agency (POWERGRID) to obtain a no-
objection from every gram sabha (at village level) for all the proposals involving diversion of
forest land under the Forest (Conservation) Act. This requirement was later waived for linear
projects8 (including the transmission business) in February 2013. However, it is noted that all the
indicators had already outperformed their original (as per the PAD) targets in FY2013 after which
the end-project targets (FY2014) were revised upward during the implementation support mission
of September 2013, which was also the midterm review mission for PSDP V. The upward
revision in targets was also formally recorded through restructuring of the Project. POWERGRID
outperformed all the revised targets except for a marginal gap of 0.18 percent in transmission
capacity.9

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     POWERGRID, the central transmission utility (CTU) of India, was the borrower and the
direct beneficiary of PSDP IV loans. The loans provided resources and funds for investments
needed by POWERGRID to undertake the physical expansion of the transmission system while at
the same time improving its technical, financial, and institutional capacity to enhance the transfer
of energy across regions and reduce transmission costs, system losses, and unserved energy.

15.       The benefits of the project also extended to the various transmission and distribution
utilities at the state level, as well as to the IPPs, which could rely on a stronger network to allow
them to fully benefit from the open access regime that was mandated by the Electricity Act of
2003. Furthermore, the beneficiaries are also the urban and rural populations as a result of
increased efficiency and reduction in power shortages.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

16.     PSDP IV (US$ 600 million) was designed to contribute to the financing of
POWERGRID’s investment program totaling US$2.125 billion for the 2006–2014 period (as per
the PAD). The project consisted of only one component, namely, Transmission System
Strengthening Schemes, which included the following:

I. Partial construction of the East-West Transmission Corridor (EWTC)


8
  Transmission lines usually need narrow, long strips of land and hence, these are considered linear projects. Roads,
canals, and optical fiber lines are other examples of linear projects.

  Growth in power exchange - Target as per the PAD (PSDP V for FY2014): 58,000 MU; Restructured target: 68,000
MU; Actual: 78,384 MU.
Transmission capacity - Target as per the PAD (PSDP V for FY2014): 95,000 ckm; Restructured target: 107,000 ckm;
Actual: 106,804 ckm.
Transformation capacity - Target as per the PAD (PSDP V for FY2014): 92,000 MVA; Restructured target: 185,000
MVA; Actual: 205,923 MVA.

       kV) (128 ckm) and Kankroli-Zerda 400 kV D/C (470 ckm) were completed under PSDP
       III financing.
1.6 Additional Components

17.     At the time of appraisal of PSDP IV, the GoI had indicated its intention to request a
follow-on loan (additional financing) of US$400 million to finance the completion of the schemes


                                               6
initiated under PSDP III and PSDP IV. The timing of the additional financing was dependent on
POWERGRID initiating advance procurement of these schemes. These schemes also contributed
to the financing of POWERGRID’s investment program totaling US$2.125 billion for the 2006–
2014 period. In line with PSDP IV, the additional financing also constituted of only one
component, namely Transmission System Strengthening Schemes. Revised components under
additional financing (US$400 million) supported the implementation of the following schemes:

I. Completion of the East-West Transmission Corridor (EWTC)
   The works consisted of:
   Substations
   (a) Fixed Series Compensator (FSC) at Raipur substation for 400 kV D/C Rajgarh-Raipur
       transmission line

II. Completion of the Western Region System Strengthening II (WRSS II)
    The works consisted of:
    Transmission Lines
    (a) From Wardha to Parli 400 kV D/C (quad) line on a distance of 337 km (674 ckm)
    (b) From Bhadrawati to Parli 400 kV D/C line on a distance of 388 km (776 ckm)
    (c) From Raipur to Wardha 400 kV D/C line on a distance of 371 km (741 ckm)
   (d) From Parli (Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited [MSETCL]) to

         Baripada-Mendhasal transmission lines
     (b) Re-conductoring of 400 kV D/C Siliguri-Purnea transmission line

18.     Further, after completion of project restructuring in May 2014, two schemes (one new
and one shifted from PSDP V to optimally use the funds available across various POWERGRID
projects with the Bank) were added to the project. Specifically, the restructuring included the
following schemes:

IV. Completion of Southern Region System Strengthening Scheme XIII (SRSS 13)
    The works consisted of:
    Transmission Lines
    (a) From Gooty to Madhugiri 400 kV D/C line on a distance of 209 km (417 ckm)
    (b) From Madhugiri to Yelahanka 400 kV D/C (quad) line on a distance of 66 km (132 ckm)

       Company Limited [MPPTCL])
   (d) Shunt reactors at 765/400 kV substations at Bina, Gwalior, and Indore
1.7 Other Significant Changes

19.     The loan for PSDP IV was appraised in January 2008, approved on March 18, 2008,
signed on March 28, 2008, and became effective on May 16, 2008. The midterm review
(MTR) was carried out during April 12 –23, 2010. It was necessary to provide PSDP IV with
an additional financing of US$400 million and expand the scope of the project by adding
new schemes as it was agreed with the GoI during the appraisal of PSDP IV. During the
appraisal of PSDP IV AF, it was agreed that the loan closing date of PSDP IV will be
extended by one year from July 31, 2013, to July 31, 2014, to match the loan closing date of
PSDP IV AF as it was funding the components of the same schemes with no spillover of
contracts across the loans for ease of monitoring the funds flow.

20.     The Bank and the borrower agreed during the appraisal of PSDP IV to hold a common
MTR for PSDP III and PSDP IV around October –December 2009, which was a year later
than agreed for the MTR of PSDP III during its appraisal (December 2008). During the MTR,
an implementation support mission was also undertaken for PSDP V that became effective on
January 8, 2010.

21.     It is important to note that these three projects (PSDP III, PSDP IV including its
additional financing, and PSDP V) had the same PDO, supported the same entity/sector and
were structurally linked. There were no changes in implementation arrangements. With
availability of the additional financing, the original loan amount underwent a change leading
to an adjustment of the disbursement schedule, which was also impacted by the dynamism in
the environment in which the schemes were being implemented (for instance, introduction of
the notification under the FRA in 2009).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

22.     Robustness of the background analysis. POWERGRID’s satisfactory achievements and
learning experience resulting from the implementation of PSDP I, PSDP II, and PSDP III had a
positive impact on the preparatory process of the project. Continuous and sound sector review by
the Bank ensured that key aspects of the project had been included in the design and appraisal.

23.     A Regional Operations Committee (ROC) meeting was held on December 19, 2007, to
determine if PSDP IV should be considered as a repeater project (to PSDP III). The ROC opined
that since another US$400 million request (additional financing) was to be received soon, the
PSDP IV loan (of US$600 million) should be considered as a repeater only reflecting that
POWERGRID was well-prepared for PSDP IV. Even though the guidelines called for any


                                               8
operation of US$600 million to go to Operations Committee (OC) review, since the project had
no major issues and was low/moderate on risk operation, it was agreed during the ROC meeting
that an OC review will not be required, indicating the robustness of the project design.10

24.     Further, since PSDP IV was structurally interconnected with PSDP III activities that
had been well underway and supported by the Bank, the arguments and analytical perspective
from the Quality Enhancement Review (QER) for PSDP III, which took place in October 2004,
were still valid and applicable for PSDP IV and its additional financing, given that the PDO, KPIs,
and the structure of these projects did not change in qualitative terms.

25.     The implementation of several schemes under PSDP IV was already underway as part of
PSDP III at the appraisal. Advance procurement of all packages to be financed under PSDP IV
was initiated by POWERGRID in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines prevailing at that
time after obtaining no objection on the bidding documents from the Bank.

26.      Assessment of the project design. POWERGRID has been instrumental in providing
efficient, reliable, and smooth grid operations in the country. In line with the urgency of physical
investment actions to be undertaken by POWERGRID, lessons from PSDP II and III were taken
into account for the design of PSDP IV. POWERGRID’s strong technical design capability,
including its Research and Development (R&D) capability and its solid collaboration with the
Central Electricity Authority (CEA), which is a technical regulatory institution under the Ministry
of Power (MoP), was and still is the cornerstone for the power system planning studies and the
targeting of investments. The investments are prioritized in consultations with the various
stakeholders, such as beneficiary states and generators. This process has been helpful and
efficient in determining the types and voltage levels of transmission network development that
were and are required. The key to this aspect of project design was underscored by planning
relevant sections of the new transmission network at higher voltage and capacity to efficiently
meet the growing demand that was scattered across the country while proactively addressing
Right of Way (RoW) problems demonstrating POWERGRID’s planning capability. 11 The
technical experience of POWERGRID combined with the use of eligibility criteria of PSDP III
were critical for identifying investments as well as financing mechanisms for transmission
systems under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF. The use of eligibility criteria to identify investments
was an appropriate analytical tool adapted to carry out project design12 (refer to annex 10).

27.     The schemes funded under PSDP IV were an integral part of the schemes supported
under PSDP III and were required to increase the interregional power exchange capacity (refer
paragraph 36 of the PSDP IV PAD). As a result, Project Implementation Plans (PIPs) for all the
schemes covered under the project had been reviewed and approved by the Bank early in the


10
   The project’s preparation and review of all required conditions (rationale, procurement, social and environmental
safeguards, financial management, and risk assessment) were considered to be fully satisfactory. POWERGRID had
been a reliable partner of the Bank in financing the transmission infrastructure in India (through past projects)).
11
   Experienced with the construction of 765 kV Extra-High Voltage Alternate Current (EHVAC) and ±500 kV HVDC
transmission system, POWERGRID has been working on higher transmission voltages of 1,200 kV Ultra High Voltage
Alternate Current (UHVAC) and ±800 kV HVDC systems to achieve efficient utilization of RoW and increased power
transfer capability for bulk power transmission over long distances.
12
   By applying these criteria, POWERGRID ensured that the investment scheme was technically and operationally
justified and had been formulated after taking into account other alternative investments. Furthermore, the scheme had
to be based on the least cost options and was part of the overall least cost investment program of POWERGRID.
Moreover, the project’s schemes were economically and financially justified. The eligibility criteria were discussed at
length with the Bank team during the appraisal of PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF.




                                                          9
appraisal stage, as they met the eligibility criteria. These PIPs provided extensive analysis and
review of all financial, economic, technical, safeguards, and fiduciary aspects of the schemes.

28.     Further, as PSDP IV supported the additional transmission investments initiated under
PSDP III to scale up the project’s impact and development effectiveness, the bidding process for
packages worth US$434 million (to be financed under PSDP IV) was initiated as part of the
procurement process underway for PSDP III in late 2005, which was before the 2006 revisions
to the Procurement Guidelines were adopted by the Bank. The procurement process for some of
the packages covered under PSDP IV had already been completed and some were in an advanced
stage at the appraisal. It was agreed that for the packages to be covered under PSDP IV,
POWERGRID would have the relevant additional clauses included where contracts had not yet
been awarded, and would request the contractors for suitable inclusion of clauses where the
contracts had been signed. In fact, PSDP IV was already under way at the appraisal since some of
its expenditures had already been claimed under PSDP III. 13 The Bank and POWERGRID
proceeded to make the needed adjustments to ensure that there was no spillover of contracts
across the two loans.

29.     Adequacy of government’s commitment. The strong ownership by the borrower and the
GoI continued to be a key factor that resulted in the effective implementation of POWERGRID
projects. POWERGRID’s commitment to the project as well as its extensive experience and close
working relationship with the Bank facilitated the preparatory work done during the project’s
preparation and appraisal phases. Early preparation that started during PSDP III provided
valuable insights into issues to be resolved by both the parties in PSDP IV and its additional
financing. Furthermore, the continued use of the eligibility criteria (see annex 10) ensured the
borrower’s commitment to the project.

30.      The GoI’s commitment to the project is demonstrated through strategic and managerial
directives for the power sector, specifically for the CTU, put forth in the 11th and 12th five year
plans, translated into institutional measures (through the MoP, Central Electricity Regulatory
Commission [CERC], and the CEA). Further, the nationwide grid failure that happened in July
2012 prompted CERC to take several measures to stabilize the system and thereby ensure grid
discipline. In its report on grid disturbance in August 2012, the enquiry committee constituted by
the MoP had concluded that grid failure was linked to a series of events such as multiple forced
outages leading to weak interregional corridors, transmission line overloading due to overdrawing
by some of the northern region constituents, inadequate response by the State Load Despatch
Centers (SLDCs) to the instructions of the RLDCs, and loss of the 400 kV Bina-Gwalior link.
Some of the key actions that were proposed were (a) third-party protection audits, (b) formulation
of islanding schemes in different states, (c) review of the unscheduled interchange (UI)
mechanism, and (iv) further tightening of the frequency band. After NLDC’s (POSOCO) petition
to CERC, congestion charges were approved in April 2013, thereby amending the congestion
charge regulation of 2009. The amendments were in line with the CEA’s planning criteria.




13
   POWERGRID claimed an amount of around US$48.9 million under PSDP III for contracts that were meant to be
financed under PSDP IV. These expenditures were incurred for various periods starting from March 2007 onward.
Retroactive financing was applied to refinance these already claimed expenditures from PSDP IV proceeds and reduce
these from PSDP III disbursements. This approach ensured that there is complete disconnect between the packages of
the PSDP III and PSDP IV loans for ease of monitoring and tracking of funds flow.




                                                       10
31.      Assessment of risks. The overall risk rating for project implementation was ‘low’.
Specific risks for implementation of key investments were rated ‘low’. To mitigate these risks,
mostly foreseen delays in implementing the project’s schemes, advance procurement action was
taken for the investments before the first year of the project. Further, risk linked to delays in
implementation due to environment and social safeguards was rated ‘moderate’ before mitigation
and was rated ‘low’ after mitigation as POWERGRID has already institutionalized safeguard
policies. The safeguard policies of POWERGRID were being considered for Use of Borrower
System (UBS) at appraisal. These were later accepted under the Bank’s UBS during the PSDP V
project period. The financial management risk was rated as ‘moderate’ because at the time of
appraisal POWERGRID had launched its initial public offer (IPO) in the Indian stock market for
which it had to adhere to higher and stricter corporate governance requirements. POWERGRID,
through its implementation of PSDP projects, has demonstrated its ability to plan and implement
even complex investments on time and to cost. Appropriate mitigation measures were put in place
and consisted of actions and measures that were directly relevant for POWERGRID’s operations
such as compliance with financial covenants, arrears payments, and safeguards compliance.

2.2 Implementation

32.      The implementation of the project component and the utilization of the loan proceeds
were satisfactory. POWERGRID and the GoI were instrumental in ensuring that project
implementation was successful and that all components planned at the time of appraisal were
completed satisfactorily and became operational within the project period. The transmission
schemes in this project had been designed, engineered, and implemented by POWERGRID, and
local and foreign contractors carried out supply and installation works. All the originally
approved schemes under PSDP IV and its additional financing have been commissioned
successfully. With regard to the two new schemes that were added later through level-2
restructuring of the project (while keeping the PDO, KPI, and structure of the project the same),
one scheme (System Strengthening for Western Region for Sasan UMPP) has been commissioned
whereas the second scheme (Southern Region System Strengthening XIII, SRSS 13) is subject to
delays caused due to severe RoW issues being faced at the state level, which is beyond the control
of POWERGRID. This scheme is now expected to be completed not before March 2015 14 as
necessary approvals from the involved state government of Karnataka are being processed. The
monitoring of implementation of this scheme will now be done under PSDP V (for which the loan
closing date is May 31, 2017). Both parties ensured that supervision focused on resolving key
project implementation issues, including physical implementation of transmission schemes and
compliance with environmental and social safeguards (issues of forestry clearance and
resettlement), financial performance, and arrears collection objectives. Details about
implementation of each of the schemes are provided in annex 2 and annex 9.

33.      POWERGRID’s continued use of Integrated Project Management and Control System
(IPMCS) has contributed to closer and effective monitoring of project implementation leading to
the adoption of necessary steps for corrective actions. Moreover, close supervision by the Bank
team with day-to-day responsibilities fully delegated to Delhi-based staff, facilitated by the
availability of effective support from POWERGRID’s staff at field offices, also contributed to
efficient monitoring of project components and timely completion of the project. In addition to
adherence to the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines, POWERGRID's managerial and operational
culture, and project management allowed for effective monitoring of implementation.


14
     Initially, this scheme was planned to be completed by July 2013 according to the PIP (submitted in December 2010).




                                                           11
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

34.      Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design. Arrangements for M&E of the project
consisted of targets that were linked to the completion of the transmission schemes and their
impacts over a given timeframe. The M&E framework focused on annual monitoring and regular
reporting of the progress in achievement of the PDO and project outputs. The targets for
completion of investment projects consisted of physical achievements as well as their impacts on
the performance of the transmission system. In addition, the design of the M&E framework was
intended to provide a comprehensive view on POWERGRID’s performance in every aspect. To
this effect, indicators additional to KPIs and covenanted targets were also agreed upon with the
Bank to objectively measure improvements in power sector performance as well as
POWERGRID's corporate performance. Given the satisfactory performance of POWERGRID in
achieving and reporting such indicators, these were discontinued during the MTR of PSDP IV
and its additional financing. Later, during the MTR of PSDP V in September 2013, the
monitoring of these additional indicators was reinstated to allay concerns linked to the slower
disbursement of PSDP V, reversing the decision taken at the MTR of PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF.
The result of consistent efforts and round-the-clock monitoring is demonstrated through
POWERGRID’s high operational performance from 2007 to 2014 in terms of transmission
system availability that improved from 99.2 percent to 99.9 percent and the number of trippings
per line reduced from 3.64 to 0.56 during this period. The corporate level indicators depict a
strong performance of POWERGRID across several metrics (Refer annex 2 for details).

35.      The sectoral indicators reflect that private sector participation has increased by more than
4.5 times in terms of circuit kilometers of line constructed from 2007 to 2014. Further, power
traded as a percentage of total power generated in the country has shown an upward trend from
3.6 percent in 2007 to 11 percent in 2014. This implies an improved utilization of existing
capacities as the power trade ensures that surplus regions/states can easily transfer generated
power to deficit regions/states when needed. After the July 2012 grid failure, CERC has tightened
the grid frequency band15 to put a check on overdrawing by various constituents, hence, ensuring
grid security and encouraging distribution utilities to procure power through contracts in
organized markets. In December 2013, the Southern Region was also connected synchronously
with the rest of the National Grid. Given these factors, the grid frequency has shown a downward
trend but all measures have been adopted to bring back the frequency within the prescribed band.
POWERGRID along with POSOCO is now handling one of the largest transmission networks at
a single frequency in the world.

36.    Further, the quarterly financial monitoring report (FMR) included the detailed contracts
monitoring report and physical monitoring report, which were essential for both the Bank as well
as POWERGRID to take corrective actions when required (refer annex 11 for templates).

37.     M&E implementation. Data collection was in line with the PAD guidelines and the
borrower’s information system. The data collected for progress achieved on outcome (growth in
power exchange) and outputs indicators (transmission and transformation capacities) were
monitored through an agreed reporting format. The IPMCS provided POWERGRID with real
time monitoring of the physical installation of transmission lines and the NLDC provided
continuous monitoring and data for power exchanges and transfers. POWERGRID established


15
  Indian Electricity Grid Code (IEGC) Range: Till September 16, 2012: 49.5 Hz to 50.2 Hz and from September 17,
2012 onwards: 49.7 Hz to 50.2 Hz




                                                       12
and provided the Bank with a monthly report on billing and collection, quarterly progress reports
(QPRs), quarterly financial management reports, annual information about progress on key entity
and sectoral performance indicators, audited annual financial statements (within six months of the
end of each financial year), and other information as the Bank required. These arrangements were
working in a satisfactory manner in earlier loans and were continued under the project and are
replicated for PSDP V as well. In addition, the Bank team periodically conducted site visits as
part of the implementation support missions, to monitor compliance with the project design with
a special emphasis on environmental and social safeguards, and to engage in discussions
regarding benefits achieved from the investments. The Bank team also interacted regularly with
various project stakeholders including the MoP and the Ministry of Finance (MoF), which have a
keen interest in seeing sustained, high performance from POWERGRID.

38.     M&E utilization. In addition to POWERGRID’s own scoreboard that provided decision
makers with a retrospective analysis on performance and inputs for planning purposes, it
produced and submitted QPRs containing M&E data to the Bank for review every quarter (refer
annex 11 for table of content of QPR). The quarterly reports resulted in discussions on all aspects
of the project ranging from procurement, engineering, safeguards, financial management, and
finance to the corporate monitoring group. These reports also provided close monitoring of
covenanted targets such as the debt-equity ratio, the self-financing ratio, and payment of arrears.

39.     Implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. POWERGRID is in
the process of enhancing its operational capabilities through the deployment of an integrated ERP
system. The system is being deployed to integrate processes and data pertaining to key business
processes of the organization. Among others, the key objective for setting up the ERP system
includes integration and standardization of various business processes and hence the flow of
information. The full deployment of ERP in the organization is expected by February 2015.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

40.      Environmental and social safeguards. PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF were rated ‘Category A’
on safeguards management. Aspects linked to environmental and social safeguards associated
with the project have been addressed in accordance with the corporate Environment and Social
Policy and Procedures (ESPP) developed by POWERGRID in 1998 and revised from time to
time. The corporate ESPP is in compliance with the Bank's safeguards policies and its provisions
systematically applied to all POWERGRID projects regardless of the source of financing. The
ESPP outlines POWERGRID's approach and commitment to deal with the environmental and
social issues relating to its transmission schemes and lays out management procedures to address
them. The ESPP provides POWERGRID with a framework for identification, assessment, and
management of environmental and social concerns at both organizational as well as field levels.
Capacity building in the environmental and social management department of POWERGRID
contributed significantly to the update of the corporate ESPP in 2005, which resulted from
research on legal and institutional frameworks, analysis of priority issues (gap analysis) in the
power transmission sector and wide ranging discussions including national and regional
consultations. The ESPP was further updated in 2009 to meet the requirements of the new
enactment, revised rules, and guidelines including those of multilateral funding agencies and to
adopt international best practices to preempt all possible safeguards issues. During this revision,
even wider stakeholder consultations including project affected people and local communities
were carried out. The revised ESPP was adopted by the Bank as a pilot for Use of Country
Systems (OP 4.00) under PSDP V.




                                                13
41.     The safeguards process followed during the preparation and appraisal stages of a scheme
under the project included preparation of an Initial Environmental Assessment Report16 (IEAR)
for these transmission schemes. These IEARs were reviewed by the Bank and the feedback was
incorporated in the Final Environmental Assessment Report (FEAR). In addition to measures
taken for PSDP III,17 the Bank team had also recommended the use of Environmental and Social
Sustainability Reporting on a regular basis with the objective of improving POWERGRID’s
communication with internal and external stakeholders regarding its environmental and social
management track record. POWERGRID agreed to develop such a sustainability report, with
consultant assistance for the first year, to showcase its achievements so far and the way forward
as seen by it and other stakeholders.

42.     In addition, POWERGRID implemented specific actions to improve implementation
monitoring, such as tracking and collating information on actual compensatory afforestation on
the ground; updating of statutory clearances from the Ministry of Environment and Forest
(MoEF) and state pollution control boards, if needed; extending application of the integrated
Environment Management System (EMS) to regional headquarters and project locations; and
strengthening environmental training and capacity building. At project closing, POWERGRID
has demonstrated a clear appreciation and adherence to the ESPP provisions pertaining to
minimum disturbance of forest areas by the field office staff both in the Regional Head Quarters
(RHQ) and site (substation and line) offices. Overall, POWERGRID has satisfactorily dealt with
safeguards issues associated with the project. These aspects of the project were adequately
addressed by implementing the provisions of corporate ESPP effectively.

43.      In carrying forward its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, POWERGRID
has ensured that resources were made available to cover local needs and provide adequate
solutions to social safeguard aspects in terms of development impact. POWERGRID’s CSR
policy is clearly stated in its biennial Sustainability Report and in line with international best
practices in order to preempt possible environmental and social issues. In line with the Bank’s
social safeguards, the CSR policy is aimed at promoting community development around its
establishments and substations with a focus on education, health care, infrastructure development,
ecology and environment conservation, and disaster relief in the country. The CSR initiatives are
aimed to improve the quality of life of the local population and bring the marginalized people to
the mainstream of development. POWERGRID has articulated a ‘Social Entitlement Framework’
based on the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy of 2007 and other progressive
trends in its ESPP applicable for the affected families. In line with its land acquisition policy (for
the construction of substations), POWERGRID acquires land with minimal social impact on
account of land loss. Site selection is planned on the basis of avoiding irrigated land, homestead
land/houses, religious structures, cultural property, or public infrastructure. Overall,



16
   IEARs were prepared for schemes proposed under PSDP IV. These were submitted to the Bank for review and
disclosed on the POWERGRID website. These environmental assessment reports and the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) have been prepared using baseline information available concurrently with the preliminary surveys, and
include analyses of alternative routes/alignment and community consultation. The FEAR shall include additional
information collected at the time of detailed surveys, details of compensatory afforestation and other regulatory
approvals, and details of EMP implementation.
17
   Actions for further strengthening the environmental management practices as was done for PSDP III through (a)
designation and assignment of environmental management specialists in the field and regional offices to assist with
implementation and reporting of the EMP implementation at POWERGRID; (b) undertaking of yearly independent
environmental audits of a sample of transmission lines and substations; and (c) preparation of sustainability reports
(prepared annually).




                                                        14
implementation of ESPP along with measures adopted under CSR has played a major/vital role in
mitigation of social impacts of the project.

44.      The safeguards rating was Moderately Satisfactory since the start of the project to
maintain consistency across the various repeater projects as PSDP IV partly funded some of the
schemes under PSDP III. To improve safeguards performance, POWERGRID was advised to
strengthen its Environment and Social Management Department (ESMD). In response,
POWERGRID started taking measures to strengthen its ESMD both at its head office and at
regional offices to manage safeguards concerns of the projects. On environmental issues, the
focus was on two specific aspects related to forests: (a) coordination with MoEF to reduce delays
in obtaining clearances under the Forest (Conservation) Act and (b) coordination with the
recently formed state-level Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authorities
(CAMPAs) to monitor the plantation to be carried out as part of compensation. In parallel,
POWERGRID, through the MoP, requested the MoEF to streamline the clearance process under
the Forest (Conservation) Act. Further, the RoW issues and delays in obtaining forest clearances
started cropping up after the GoI’s notification regarding the FRA in August 2009,18 which was
later waived for linear projects19 (including the transmission business) in February 2013. The
rating was later upgraded to Satisfactory in June 2011 when (a) POWERGRID strengthened its
ESMD at its corporate office as well as RHQs to factor in activities required to comply with the
MoEF’s notification to the FRA of August 2009 and (b) upon obtaining long-pending forest
clearances (final approval for Wardha-Parli and in-principle approval for Baripada-Mendhasal)
for transmission lines in May 2011. Since then, the rating has been kept at Satisfactory. All the
schemes are complete except for SRSS 13, which is now expected to be completed not before
March 201520 due to severe RoW issues being faced in the state of Karnataka, which were out of
the control of POWERGRID. Annex 2 provides the details about the chronological sequence of
activities by POWERGRID to resolve this issue. Monitoring of implementation of this scheme
will now be done under PSDP V.

45.      Financial management (FM). At the beginning of the project, in July 2008, the FM rating
was Moderately Satisfactory due to certain outstanding issues21 on PSDP III, PSDP IV, and PSDP
IV AF. Given the progress on implementation of agreed actions, the FM rating was again
upgraded to Satisfactory in May 2010. The FM ratings were Satisfactory till October 2013 when
the rating was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory due to delay in submission of the project
audit report for FY2013 (due to the delay in appointing an auditor) that falls due for submission at
the end of September every year. Further, the FY2013 audit report was qualified due to temporary
diversion of Bank-funded material for other projects. The audit report for FY2014 was submitted
on time (September 30, 2014), meeting the legal covenant, after these loans had been already
closed. However, the qualification remained on diversion of material by POWERGRID from the
sites where delays occur due to issues (like RoW in SRSS 13) to sites that have become higher
priority on the National Grid thereby reducing capital work in progress. A proper arrangement is
formulated between the sites where the material has been diverted to return the material of the


18
   Under this the project, the implementing authority (POWERGRID) had to get a no-objection certificate from every
gram sabha (at the village level) for all proposals involving diversion of forest land under the Forest (Conservation)
Act.
19
   Transmission lines usually need narrow, long strips of land and hence, these are considered linear projects. Roads,
canals, and optical fiber lines are other examples of linear projects.
20
   Initially, this scheme was planned to be completed by July 2013.
21
   Such as, agreed terms of reference (TOR) of audits, application of the various provisions of TORs in the audit of the
underlying financial statements, the audit opinion, and the management letter on audit (as issued by auditors).




                                                           15
same specifications and diligently followed. Both the Bank and POWERGRID are working
together to resolve the issue at the earliest and this will be closely monitored under PSDP V.

46.     Although rated Moderately Satisfactory initially and briefly toward the project end,
POWERGRID’s FM system accurately accounted and reported for the project resources and
expenditures. The FM systems of POWERGRID (housed as a part of their general accounting and
financial systems) were used to generate the financial and other quarterly progress reports under
the project. The reporting framework for the project included a quarterly FMR, an equivalent of
the interim unaudited financial report, prepared by POWERGRID in a format agreed with the
Bank (detailed in the PIP). Initially, the FMRs were being submitted by POWERGRID on a
monthly basis, which was later amended to quarterly submission starting from the April–June
2009 quarter. FMRs were prepared using information generated from POWERGRID's FM system
(FMS) and management information system (MIS) and were rated Satisfactory. These systems
are now being upgraded through implementation of the ERP system. POWERGRID has
strengthened its FM capacity during its partnership with the Bank through implementing ERP,
strengthening its internal audit function, and undertaking Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)22
and has been able to adhere to its policies and procedures as its FM performance under previous
loans has been rated Satisfactory.

47.      Procurement. Under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF, procurement was carried out for all the
schemes in accordance with the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines. The Bank team worked together
with POWERGRID to review relevant sections, such as qualification requirements, special
conditions of contract, and technical specifications, in the Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs)
of the Bank, resulting in model bidding documents of POWERGRID under the loan. This
facilitated preparation of the package-specific bidding documents expeditiously and thereby,
reduced the overall time consumed during the administrative part of the procurement process.
Additional provisions were also introduced to provide substantial flexibility to POWERGRID in
handling the procurement process and interactions with contractors. Further, the Operational
Procurement Review Committee (OPRC) threshold limits were also revised upward, except for
high risk packages, from US$50 million to US$200 million for low-risk packages and to US$115
million for moderate-risk packages that are generally the risk profile of POWERGRID packages.

48.      Under this loan and in line with the Bank’s procedures, procurement was carried out for
transmission system projects which were either uniquely positioned or pertained to emerging
transmission technologies in India. For example, the Balia-Bhiwadi Transmission System, a long
distance (approximately 800 km) bipole HVDC transmission system for transfer of 2,500 MW
power at ±500 kV voltage level was a unique project, considering the complexity of procurement
of the HVDC Terminal Package. Similarly, procurement for certain packages in other
transmission projects involved procurement of plant and equipment and goods for 765 kV voltage
level, which was an emerging voltage level in the transmission system in India at that time.
POWERGRID, in association with the Bank, reviewed and suitably incorporated the sections to
facilitate selection of capable contractors to successfully execute such emerging technologies in
India.



22
  As part of its compliance to Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement and Dep artment of Public Enterprises’ Code on
Corporate Governance, POWERGRID has implemented an ERM framework. The framework was approved by the
POWERGRID Board on February 8, 2011. The ERM framework identifies 24 major risks. A few KPIs are associated
with each of the risks. Quarterly ERM reports with these KPIs are being prepared and examined by the Risk
Management Committee. The Chief Risk Officer subsequently presents the report to the Audit Committee.




                                                      16
49.     Further, to increase participation of the vendors, POWERGRID, in association with the
Bank, organized conferences for conductor and insulator vendors in April 2009 and September
2010. Such conferences have resulted in more participation and competitive prices. Further,
POWERGRID, in association with the Bank, also organized the vendor conference regarding
common mistakes/discrepancies during bidding in September 2010. This conference has resulted
in significant improvement in the bids being submitted and helped reduce the delay in bid
evaluation on account of common errors or inconsistencies in the bids.

50.      Incorporation of lessons from the Detailed Implementation Review (DIR). This consisted
of a review of all procurement issues that had been flagged by the DIR of projects in other sectors
in India (mainly health) and an agreement between the Bank and POWERGRID on a set of
actions to be taken during the implementation of PSDP IV to avoid and deal with such issues (see
annex 12). During the first mission (appraisal) in January 2008, based on the executive summary
of the DIR, the team prepared a matrix including all the main recommendations of the report.
Subsequently, the team discussed the status of the recommendations with POWERGRID and the
actions to be taken both by the team and POWERGRID.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.      Investments financed by the loan were successfully and progressively commissioned
between March 2009 and October 2014. These schemes were integrated with the National Grid
and their operation is continuously closely monitored and maintained by POWERGRID.
POSOCO ensures the integrated operation of the grid in a reliable, efficient, and secure manner.
In line with the latest CPS (2013–2017) and through a series of additional loans to POWERGRID
(PSDP V) and other sector entities, the Bank shall continue to support the ongoing sector reform
agenda and further strengthen POWERGRID's institutional and transmission capacities in line
with the standards of global operators.

52.     Changes in the regulatory environment/framework of the transmission sector. The
regulatory environment in India is changing rapidly given the fast pace at which new
complexities are being introduced to the system, such as integration of large-scale renewable
energy and smart grids. The tariff regime has changed since appraisal of the loans. On April 1,
2014, CERC introduced new tariff regulations for five years (2014–2019). Further,
POWERGRID was earlier recovering all the costs through cost-plus basis but the GoI introduced
TBCB23 in India in January 2011. Since then, POWERGRID also has to apply for competitive
bidding to get new projects. There are exceptions to this regime wherever POWERGRID is
entrusted by the MoP to carry out the works on a nomination basis depending on the criticality of
the works. As of October 31, 2014, POWERGRID had secured five transmission projects, which
is more than 30 percent of the projects floated under TBCB.

53.      Bank’s follow-up on the project’s sustainability. The project KPIs: (a) power exchange
across regions (in MU); (b) transformation capacity (in MVA); and (c) transmission capacity
development (in ckm) are being monitored and updated through implementation of PSDP V that
is in compliance with their respective M&E systems. Given the grid disturbance of July 2012 (for
details refer to annex 2), monitoring of additional indicators was reinstated as part of PSDP V.


23
  Under the TBCB norms, developers quoting the lowest average electricity tariffs from a proposed project get to set it
up, as against the erstwhile ‘cost-plus’ model, where projects were set up through pacts with transmission utilities and
were entitled to assured returns.




                                                          17
Further, two new additional indicators on safeguards (percentage of project affected people [PAP]
rehabilitated and cumulative transmission capacity [MW] per meter width of RoW within forest
areas) were also added under PSDP V. Since SRSS 13 is expected to be completed after March
2015, supervision of its implementation will be part of PSDP V.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

54.      The Bank’s support for this project was highly relevant and the PDO reflects the
importance of achieving further expansion and transformation in India’s power sector
infrastructure. The project’s design reflected sector priorities and focused on the need for more
investments in transmission to successfully transmit the power generated (by large-scale
generation capacity infusion planned in the country) from surplus to deficit regions and hence
optimally utilizing the available limited resources. In partnership with POWERGRID, a key
participant in several sector reform initiatives in India, the Bank has been able to design and
implement a project, among many, that ensures the funding of much-needed physical investments
in parallel with institutional transformation. This has become even more important with
synchronization of the Southern Region grid with rest of the grid to make it truly one National
Grid.

55.      The framework outlined in the CAS (2004–2007) remains largely pertinent. The
strategic principles and program priorities remain appropriate and the overall approach has
been effective. The priority areas of engagement (infrastructure, human development, rural
development) remain relevant, and the instruments for delivery of the program are functioning
well. On an operational level, this project focused on (a) expanding POWERGRID’s
transmission capacity (interregional and at the state level); (b) sustaining efficient energy
markets and linking demand centers with resource-rich parts of the country (particularly hydro
resources in the north and northeast); and (c) improving electricity access and quality of
services to end consumers both in urban and rural areas. Since the loan had been put in place,
POWERGRID has been able to provide efficient, reliable, and smooth grid operation and
management in the country and deliver on the outcomes of PSDP IV and its additional
financing.

56.     The Bank’s current CPS (2013–2017) for India endorses a larger development vision that
will enable the country to launch action programs for ‘faster, sustainable, and more inclusive
growth’ focusing on poverty reduction, group equality, regional balance, empowerment,
environmental management, and employment. Given that an estimated 400 million people are
not connected to the national electrical grid and those who are connected face frequent
disruptions, it is critical to invest in the sustainable development of power infrastructure which is
a strategic pillar of project financing, in tandem with private participation, and best-practice
management in power generation and distribution. Investments in the power sector aim at
building upon the achievements of previous power projects, including those dedicated to energy
generation and transmission. The support for the sector was made clear during PSDP IV MTR
mission as the Bank expressed its support for India’s 12th Five Year Plan (2012–17). The plan
called for a substantial increase in POWERGRID’s investment targets for 2012–17 from the
ongoing plan and it needed mobilization of about US$11 billion for which POWERGRID
expressed interest to continue its collaboration with the Bank. The Bank had informed the
borrower that since funds that can be mobilized directly from the Bank are limited, there is a need
to explore other innovative financing options which will allow leveraging of additional funds to



                                                 18
finance the Bank-supported projects. In this context, POWERGRID has planned a capital
investment of more than US$16 billion (or INR 1,000 billion) for the development of an interstate
transmission system during this plan period. In financing PDSP IV, the Bank reaffirmed its
commitment to a long-term partnership to support critical investments in the transmission
segment. In view of the Bank’s assistance to India, POWERGRID has put in place a network of
about 106,804 ckm of transmission lines along with 184 Extra High Voltage (EHV) AC and DC
substations with transformation capacity of 205,923 MVA, spread over the length and breadth of
the country at the end of March 2014. POWERGRID has been consistently maintaining the
availability of this huge transmission network at over 99 percent and ensures the transfer of about
50 percent of total power generated in the country on its network.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

57.     Disbursements. The disbursements under PSDP IV stood at 96.10 percent and at 100
percent under PSDP IV AF. This reflects that almost all the funding for the project was used. The
undisbursed balance of US$23.14 million represents savings on the loan amount that are to be
returned to the loan account at the Bank. The used/disbursed amount served to finance the
following project schemes: (a) Balia-Bhiwadi HVDC terminal; (b) WRSS II; (c) EWTC; (d)
NWTC; (e) ERSS I; (f) SRSS 13; and (g) System Strengthening of Western Region for Sasan
UMPP.24 For optimal utilization of available resources to POWERGRID, PSDP IV and PSDP IV
AF were restructured on May 23, 2014, as a result of which the last two schemes were added to
the project. In terms of procurement, all 73 packages (39 packages under PSDP IV and 34
packages under PSDP IV AF) were awarded according to the Bank’s procurement procedures.

58.      Implementation and completion of transmission schemes. Under PSDP IV, all
transmission project schemes have been completed except for SRSS 13, which has been delayed
due to severe RoW matters that needed to be dealt with at the highest level of state authorities and
the concerns about the compensation were adequately addressed for the Tumkur and Bangalore
rural areas. However, as implementation resumes on the transmission line, issues concerning the
small area in the Bangalore city urban area are being taken up for prompt resolution of RoW
issues with the state government authorities. The amount disbursed for SRSS 13 was about
US$37 million out of the fundable value of US$47 million and no further disbursement is
expected. The scheme will now be completed using POWERGRID funds.

59.     Under PSDP IV AF, all transmission project schemes were completed before the loan
closed on July 31, 2014, except one spare transformer at the Indore substation (under system
strengthening for Sasan UMPP), which was commissioned in October 2014.

60.     Impact of the completion of project components. It should be noted that all the indicators
have already outperformed their original (as per PAD) targets in FY2013 after which the end-
project targets (FY2014) were revised upwards during the implementation support mission of
September 2013, which was also the mid-term review mission for PSDP V and later recorded
through restructuring of the Project. POWERGRID outperformed not only the original targets (as
per PAD) but also the revised/restructured targets for all indicators except for a marginal gap of
0.18 percent in transmission capacity. POWERGRID’s infrastructure investments have expanded


24
  During the restructuring, Northern Region System Strengthening XXIV (NRSS 24) and Southern Region System
Strengthening XVII (SRSS 17) were transferred from PSDP IV to PSDP V while one scheme of PSDP V (System
Strengthening Scheme in WR for Sasan UMPP) was transferred to PSDP IV AF.

the network to 106,804 ckm of transmission lines along with 184 EHV AC and DC substations
with transformation capacity of 205,923 MVA, spread over the length and breadth of the country.
As of March 2014, POWERGRID has been consistently maintaining the availability of this huge
transmission network at over 99 percent and wheels about 50 percent of total power generated in
the country on its network. India’s electricity transmission system has been strengthened further
as the following key indicators show:

a. Power exchanges between regions have been enhanced. During FY2014, POWERGRID’s
   strong transmission network and modernized RLDCs facilitated about 78,384 MU of power
   exchange across regions, reflecting a growth of about 40,634 MU (107.64 percent) in power
   exchange across regions in comparison to baseline FY2007 of 37,750 MU. Under the PSDP
   IV loan, an interregional line, namely, the 400kV Rourkela-Raigarh-Raipur D/C line, has
   been implemented. This line has contributed an addition of about 1,400 MW to the
   interregional power transmission capacity of the National Grid.

b. Transmission capacity has significantly increased. As on March 31, 2014, POWERGRID
   owns and operates about 106,804 ckm of EHV transmission lines. An addition of about
   47,404 ckm (79.80 percent) has been achieved in transmission capacity with respect to
   baseline FY2007 of 59,400 ckm. Transmission lines covered under PSDP IV and the
   additional financing have contributed about 6,230 ckm 25 of 400 kV lines toward transmission
   capacity addition.

c. Growth in transformation capacity has been achieved. As on March 31, 2014, the
   transformation capacity of POWERGRID’s network is about 205,923 MVA. An addition of
   about 146,523 MVA (or 246.67 percent) has been achieved in transformation capacity with
   respect to baseline FY2007 of 59,400 MVA. The infrastructure funded under PSDP IV and
   PSDP IV AF has added about 8,000 MVA of transformation capacity.

61.     The implementation of the +500 kV HVDC bipole and other 765 kV and 400 kV
transmission lines and components has contributed to the strengthening of the National Grid
through the enhancement of interregional and intraregional power transmission capacity. The
benefits of these elements are the following:

a. apart from extensions of numerous substations, a significant transmission capacity has been
   added, which is about 6,230 ckm at 400 kV level and about 8,000 MVA transformation
   capacity along with new 400/220 kV substations at Pune, Solapur, and Parli and a 765/400
   kV substation at Indore.
b. The interregional transmission line, namely, 400 kV D/C Rourkela-Raigarh-Raipur, under the
   EWTC Strengthening Scheme, implemented under the PSDP IV loan has resulted in
   enhancing the interregional power transfer capacity by about 1,400 MW.
c. The implementation of grid strengthening schemes under PSDP IV and the additional
   financing has resulted in improving the grid security, quality, and reliability of the Indian
   power system.

62.     It should be noted that the availability of all the Bank-funded lines have been above 99.5
percent (refer to annex 2 for details). However, this does not imply that the lines have to be
loaded to their capacity due to reasons as follows. After commissioning of a transmission system,


25
     It excludes about 549 ckm being implemented under the SRSS 13 scheme.




                                                         20
sometimes loading on the lines is less during the initial phase due to delays in envisaged
generations and/or the capacity of the state’s transmission network to absorb power. However, the
loading increases with increase in power transfer requirements and materialization of envisaged
generation projects. It is also imperative to mention here that as per technical norms, it is essential
to maintain redundancy in the system so that in case of grid indiscipline, grid security is not
compromised.

3.3 Efficiency

63.     At appraisal, the economic and financial analysis for the originally approved schemes
was carried out and they were justified on the ground that their Economic Rates of Return (ERRs)
were higher than the opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. The ERRs were in the range of
14.8 percent to 22.4 percent in the base case and 10.46 percent to 15.52 percent in the most
adverse case.

64.     Analysis at completion. Using actual cost figures and applicable tariffs, the analysis
covers all the schemes. It also takes into account changes in tariffs and return on equity (ROE)
objectives. This has a positive impact on the revenue generated from the schemes and is reflected
accordingly in the ERR and ROE calculated and presented in detail in annex 3.

a. Economic Rate of Return. The same methodology during appraisal was also adopted at
   completion to calculate the ERR. The ERR varies between 10.86 percent (for ERSS I) and
   23.54 percent (for NWTC). In all the cases, except for ERSS I, the ERR is above the
   opportunity cost of the capital at 12 percent.

b. Return on Equity. The ROE has been taken as a proxy for financial rate of return as was taken
   during the appraisal. The same methodology as during appraisal was adopted to calculate
   ROE at completion. In all the cases, the ROE for the different schemes varies between 14.02
   percent (for ERSS I) and 29.08 percent (for NWTC).

65.      The financial analysis was also carried out at the entity level and it is observed that all the
financial ratios (presented in annex 3) are robust. POWERGRID also comfortably complied with
all the financial and legal covenants. The debt-equity ratio was always less than 80:20, and the
self-financing ratio was also greater than 20 percent for all the years from FY2008 till FY2014.
Accounts receivable over the project life were also much lower than the 3 months of billing
stipulated in the Legal Covenants. POWERGRID’s receivables as of July 31, 2014 , stand at 0.34
months of average billing.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

66.     The overall rating of the project is Satisfactory on the basis of its high relevance (as
discussed in Section 3.1); satisfactory achievement of all the PDOs; and efficiency in
implementation (as discussed in section 2.2). In addition, owing to the project, POWERGRID’s
performance has significantly improved. It stands today as a stronger company on the technical,
managerial, and institutional fronts and has undergone a tremendous transformation to reach the
coveted status of a corporation with international stature. The Satisfactory rating is also justified
by sustainability of the project components. In the coming years, the role of POSOCO will
become more important with further development of the electricity trading market as the



                                                  21
transmission schemes financed by this loan as well as subsequent loans will enable transfer of
large quantities of power across and between the regions of the country.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

67.      This project will increase the availability of electricity to the Indian people and contribute
to an increase in consumers’ connection rate to the system, especially in regions where power
availability has been constrained by the lack of adequate transmission systems. Development and
strengthening of the National Grid through reliable and stable operation of regional grids
facilitates the timely transfer of power from surplus regions to deficit regions leading to optimal
utilization of scarce energy resources. Although POWERGRID’s network does not link directly
to the end consumer, it facilitates power evacuation from central sector generating stations and
interregional power exchange, resulting in increased availability to and access to reliable
electricity by the connected consumers.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

68.      The two-decade partnership between the Bank and POWERGRID has led to adoption of
good practices by the latter since its inception. POWERGRID’s institutional and managerial
capacity has been strengthened through targeted Bank support and strengthening of internal audit
department, development/implementation of an organization-wide ERM framework and ERP
aimed at improving corporate governance and financial accountability. Consistent improvement
on such aspects has led POWERGRID to successful listing on stock exchanges, both Indian as
well as international.

69.    In July 2012, POWERGRID also signed loan agreements with International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and Infrastructure Crisis Facility Debt Pool Limited Liability Partnership (ICF
Debt Pool LLP) for a total amount of US$270 million.

70.      In February 2009, POWERGRID established and commissioned the NLDC (funded
under PSDP II and PSDP III loans) as the apex structure for national grid management and
operation. According to POWERGRID, this four-tier system is a complex and globally unique
mode of grid operation. It minimizes grid disturbances and facilitates quick restoration in case of
failure. Further, the NLDC and RLDCs, now being managed by POSOCO, are upgraded and
modernized continuously to establish an effective grid management infrastructure in the country.

71.      Aspects linked to the environmental and social safeguards associated with the project
have been addressed in accordance with the corporate ESPP developed by POWERGRID in 1998
along with an active support from the Bank. This ESPP is revised from time to time. The
corporate ESSP is in compliance with the Bank's safeguards policies and its provisions
systematically applied to all POWERGRID projects regardless of the source of financing. The
ESPP outlines POWERGRID's approach and commitment to deal with the environmental and
social issues relating to its transmission schemes and lays out management procedures to address
them. POWERGRID’s ESPP was adopted by the Bank as a pilot under UCS (OP 4.00). This was
formally adopted under PSDP V. POWERGRID developed a CSR policy enabling it to make
contribution to the society at large with emphasis on socioeconomic and integral development of
areas/communities primarily in and around its areas of operations. POWERGRID is the first
among the Bank’s clients in India to have prepared a Sustainability Report in March 2010,
covering its environmental and social performance. The second such report has been published in


                                                  22
March 2013, providing all stakeholders a clear picture of POWERGRID’s cont ributions to
sustainable development through its activities. Further, this ESPP is now being used as a base
document for replication in various state level utilities including the Northeastern states where the
Bank is also engaged.26

72.     As mentioned in the earlier sections, under this loan following the Bank’s procedures,
procurement for some of the transmission system schemes were either uniquely positioned or
pertained to emerging transmission technologies in India. For instance, the Balia-Bhiwadi
Transmission System was a unique project given the complexity of procurement of HVDC
Terminal Package. Similarly, procurement for certain packages for 765 kV transmission lines,
which was an emerging voltage level in India, was also carried out under these loans.
POWERGRID, in association with the Bank, reviewed and suitably revised the bid documents to
successfully facilitate execution of this new technology in India.

73.     Building on the experience gained from several HVDC transmission links including the
±500 kV Balia-Bhiwadi HVDC line, POWERGRID has now established 500MW HVDC back-
to-back terminal along with Bheramara (Bangladesh) - Baharampur (India) 400kV D/C enabling
a power flow of 500 MW from India to Bangladesh. This line is an important contribution toward
regional integration.

74.     Experienced with construction of the 765 kV EHVAC and ±500 kV HVDC transmission
system, POWERGRID has been working on the next higher transmission voltages of ±800 kV
HVDC27 and 1,200 kV UHVAC system to achieve efficient utilization of RoW and increased
power transfer capability for transfer of bulk power over long distances. The 1,200 kV UHVAC
technology, the highest voltage level in the world, is being developed indigenously by
POWERGRID in collaboration with 35 Indian manufacturers under public-private partnership
(PPP). The 1,200 kV UHVAC National Test Station at Bina, Madhya Pradesh, including test-
charge of 1,200 kV single and D/C transmission lines, as a pilot project has been established.
Construction of a 1,200 kV upgradable transmission line from Wardha to Aurangabad
(approximately 350 km in length, to be initially charged at 400 kV level) is also underway and
shall be charged after field trials. This 1,200 kV line is also being funded under one of the Bank
loans (PSDP V).

75.     On December 31, 2013, POWERGRID achieved a milestone by interconnecting Southern
Grid synchronously with rest of the National Grid through commissioning of the 765 kV Raichur
(Karnataka)-Solapur (Maharashtra) S/C line (funded under PSDP V). With this ‘One Nation-One
Grid-One Frequency’ has become a reality. This has facilitated augmentation of transmission
capacity by 2,100 MW. After integration of Southern Region with rest of the grid, through the
transmission link funded under the Bank loan, POWERGRID along with POSOCO is handling
one of the largest transmission networks at a single frequency in the world. Such integration will
enable transfer of power to power starved Southern Region.


26
   The Bank is preparing a ‘North Eastern Region Power Sector Improvement Project’ to provide assistance of
US$1,500 million of IBRD funding, in three tranches of US$500 million each, for strengthening of the intrastate
transmission and distribution network and for building institutional capacity of six states in the region (Assam, Manipur,
Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Nagaland).
27
   The HVDC system facilitates bulk power transmission over long distances with power controllability, reduced RoW,
and transmission losses. Implementation of ±800 kV, 6,000 MW multiterminal HVDC system of around 2,000 km
from North Eastern Region (NER) to Northern Region (NR) is under implementation (non-Bank funding). Upon
completion, it shall be one of the largest multi-terminal HVDC systems in the world at this voltage level.




                                                           23
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

76.      POWERGRID was conferred ‘Navratna’ status by the GoI in May 2008, implying a
greater commercial and financial autonomy for the Company. During the project period,
POWERGRID entered the capital market with an Initial Public Offering (IPO) during FY2008
with 10 percent of fresh issue of existing paid-up capital along with the divestment of 5 percent of
GoI’s shareholding. In FY2011, POWERGRID floated a Follow-on Public Offering (FPO)
comprising fresh issue of 10 percent paid-up capital along with divestment of 10 percent of GoI’s
shareholding. The FPO received overwhelming response and was oversubscribed by 14.84 times,
reflecting sound corporate governance policies of the company. In December 2013,
POWERGRID again issued its second FPO constituting 13 percent of existing paid-up capital
along with simultaneous disinvestment of 4 percent of GoI’s sharing holding and was
oversubscribed 6.7 times. The shares are listed on the National Stock Exchange and Bombay
Stock Exchange. In January 2013, the company made its maiden foray into foreign currency
markets and raised US$500 million through issuance of 10-year foreign currency notes at an
attractive coupon rate of 3.875 percent per year and was oversubscribed nearly 19 times. The
bonds are listed on the Singapore stock exchange. Other achievements by POWERGRID are
listed:

       POWERGRID continues to excel over its competitors under TBCB. As on October 31,
        2014, the company has secured 5 transmission projects, which is more than 30 percent of
        the projects floated under TBCB since January 2011 when the regime was changed from
        cost-plus basis to TBCB.

       POWERGRID has developed a Smart Grid pilot project in the country through open
        collaboration at Puducherry. The company has been appointed as advisor-cum-consultant
        for implementation of the Smart Grid project by eight utilities during FY2014.

       With the vision of setting up a world class laboratory for carrying out research and
        development in power transmission, POWERGRID is establishing a POWERGRID
        Advanced Research and Technology Center (PART) at Manesar, Gurgaon, with state-of-
        the-art laboratories for power system analysis, advanced equipment diagnostics, smart
        grid in transmission and distribution, energy efficiency, power system control and
        automation, material science, and engineering design.

       Further, POWERGRID is also establishing a transmission line research lab to carry out
        validation of transmission line design and subsequent optimization. In the quest to
        achieve fully digitized substations, POWERGRID is in the process of introducing process
        bus technology for substations.

       POWERGRID is also playing a catalyst role in formation of the South Asian Association
        for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) grid for effective utilization of resources for mutual
        benefits. Transmission links with Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh already exist and are
        being further strengthened.

       POWERGRID is also in the process of mapping pollution intensity of various regions of
        the country on a geographical map. This activity shall enable efficient and effective
        transmission line designs, particularly in high pollution and fog affected areas.




                                                24
       POWERGRID diversified into the telecom business under the brand name ‘POWERTEL’
        to expand its revenue stream by installing overhead optic fiber network using Optical
        Ground Wire (OPGW), leveraging its existing countrywide transmission infrastructure.

       Since 2009, POWERGRID has spread its global footprint in more than 18 countries and
        is emerging as a strong player in the transmission sector in South Asia, the Middle-east,
        and Africa. The company has also joined hands with other leading power sector
        companies to offer integrated solutions for generation, transmission, and distribution to
        international power utilities.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low or Negligible

77.     The overall level of risk to the development outcome is rated Low. This assessment is
based on the sustainability of the physical investments financed by the loan as well as on the
financial, operational, and technical strength of POWERGRID. POWERGRID has an adaptive
technical, operational, and corporate structure that allows it to operate its infrastructure efficiently.
The low risk level is also based on the sustainability of POWERGRID's enhanced institutional
capacity and managerial performance which should enable the company to continue to achieve
high performance levels. The reliability of the grid has been enhanced.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

78.     The Bank’s performance during identification, preparation, and appraisal of the
project is rated Satisfactory. The Bank had acquired valuable experience through PSDP I, II,
and III and its knowledge of the Indian power sector resulted in the formulation of a targeted
PDO in keeping with the strategic transformation of the transmission subsector sustained by
POWERGRID's operational and institutional capabilities. The Bank established a strong
partnership and good working relationship with all the sector’s stakeholders including the CERC,
POSOCO, MoP, MoF, and PTC. This helped the Bank team, POWERGRID, and GoI authorities
define feasible component options and set up an implementation framework in line with the
Bank's procurement and applicable safeguards. The definition of the PDO focused on outcomes
for which POWERGRID was held accountable and risk assessment focused on appropriate risks
while the ratings were realistic.

79.    The preparation team also ensured that all required steps were taken by the GoI and
POWERGRID, including the final project implementation plan incorporating details of
investment subprojects. The project ROC review (held in December 2007) ensured that lessons
from previous operations and India’s DIR were taken into account by the project team and the


                                                  25
borrower. The Bank team also carried out safeguards and compliance measures assessment.
Tests were carried out during the preparation phase, including a financial management
assessment (refer to annex 7 of the PAD). The Bank also ensured that the borrower had an
established and effective ESPP framework needed for project implementation. In addition, the
ESPP assessment made sure that POWERGRID provided the initial environmental action plan
and Rehabilitation Action Plans (RAPs) for the project. Moreover, a number of required
measures were put in place to ensure quality at entry contributed to successful implementation:

    a. Early approval by the Bank of PIPs for all five schemes covered under PSDP IV
    b. Advance procurement of all packages to be financed under PSDP IV initiated by
       POWERGRID in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines prevailing at the time
    c. Timely compliance by POWERGRID with all required actions for ESSP (IEARs, EMP,
       FEAR, and RAPs), CSR, recommendations from DIR, and FMR

80.      The Bank carried out a total of eleven missions, of which one was the appraisal mission
for PSDP IV held in January 2008, including site visits. The first implementation support
mission for PSDP IV held in August 2008 coincided with the appraisal mission for PSDP IV AF.
The second implementation support mission for PSDP IV held in February 2009 was also the
first implementation support mission for PSDP IV AF and preparation mission for PSDP V. The
first implementation support mission for PSDP V was also the MTR mission for PSDP III,
PSDP IV, and PSDP IV AF. This MTR was held in April 2010, four months after its planned
date at appraisal stage of PSDP IV so as to include PSDP IV AF and also to enable the team to
get a holistic view of implementation of the schemes being financed across these projects

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory
81.      The World Bank’s performance during supervision is rated Satisfactory. Since loan
effectiveness, the Bank team carried out nine supervision missions, including field visits over the
six-year implementation period. Adequate budget and staff resources were allocated as the project
was effectively supervised and closely monitored, including through delegation of day-to-day
supervision responsibilities to Delhi-based staff, which proved highly effective. The
Implementation Completion and Review (ICR) mission took place in October 2014. Supervision
of the project's implementation was strengthened by a systematic collaboration between the Bank
and POWERGRID's project teams with a significant skills mix. The Bank team was continuously
involved in all aspects of implementation to ensure that physical investments were carried out and
that disbursements occurred as planned. Submission of progress reports, FMR, and safeguards
compliance reports ensured that supervision provided both parties with indicators to allow them
to track progress and take corrective actions when needed. The Bank's supervision tracking
system (Implementation Status and Result Reports (ISR) and mission aide memoires) provided
much-needed status information about the project and required implementation ratings and
compliance with covenants. Continuous involvement by the Bank's team and POWERGRID were
instrumental in ensuring that the project components were successfully implemented with a
satisfactory disbursement rate.

82.    The MTR for PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF was carried out in April 2010, and at that time,
the PDO and implementation progress were rated satisfactory and all KPIs had surpassed their
planned targets. The project’s closing date was postponed to July 31, 2014, to adjust for
implementation and disbursements schedules of the additional financing portion of the loan. The
Bank team was continuously involved with POWERGRID to resolve delays due to forest


                                                26
management and RoW issues. Most of these issues were resolved and project implementation
activities proceeded toward completion according to the planned schedule. The FM was also
closely monitored as the World Bank recommended that POWERGRID strengthen its internal
audit department and take actions to hire consultants for reviewing the company's ERP and
strengthen its ERM.

Overall World Bank Performance Rating: SATISFACTORY

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

83.     The Bank did carry out an objective and well-defined appraisal of the project. In tandem
with the borrower, the Bank team has been able to make the necessary adjustments and take
corrective actions (in all project aspects) so that the project achieves its development objectives in
line with the Bank’s overall objective for the transmission sector.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

84.      The government’s performance is rated Satisfactory. The GoI has identified the
power sector as being vital for sustained and inclusive economic growth and has made investment
allowances (in the 12th Plan) in line with the growth of the transmission subsector so that
electricity demand is sustained by a reliable network. All sector stakeholders (MoP, MoF
POSOCO, and CERC) were always available to the Bank supervision teams and worked together
to resolve issues during project supervision. Sector governance by the GoI was crucial to the
successful implementation of this project. Institutional support ensured continuous monitoring
and support for loan disbursement and related financial measures such as counterpart funding,
and compliance with loans covenants, including arrears payments. The GoI ensured an adequate
legal and regulatory framework conducive to achieving the objectives of the project and
POWERGRID’s operational sustainability. In addition, the GoI's and CERC's regulatory
framework were designed to provide tariffs to enable the company achieve adequate and
satisfactory ROEs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

85.     POWERGRID was the borrower and the implementing agency and its performance
is rated Satisfactory. This rating is based on POWERGRID's efficiency in implementing the
project as most investment schemes were implemented on time, disbursements reached 96
percent of the PSDP IV first loan, and closing occurred as planned on July 31, 2014. The
undisbursed balance of US$23.14 million represents savings on the loan amount that are to be
returned to the loan account at the Bank. The PSDP IV AF loan was disbursed at 100 percent.
POWERGRID has satisfactorily achieved the PDO and has not only met but outperformed all
KPIs, thus meeting all development outcomes.




                                                 27
86.      Compliance with financial and legal agreements was also achieved during
implementation as POWERGRID's management and project team were strongly committed to the
project's successful implementation. The use of IPMCS in tandem with its corporate ESPP
ensured adequate mitigation of safeguards risks. POWERGRID continues to improve its
corporate governance, environmental, and social responsibility through strengthening of the ESPP
and CSR, internal audit department, carrying out of operational audits, implementing of the ERM
framework, and the ERP system.

6. Lessons Learned
87.        The main lessons learned from the design and implementation of the project are listed:

a. Long-term programmatic engagement results in a successful partnership. The long-term
   partnership between the Bank and POWERGRID has not only contributed to the
   establishment of a strong transmission system but also supported POWERGRID in
   institutional strengthening, enabling it to become one of the largest and best utilities in the
   world. Successful implementation has shown the importance of partnership with an efficient
   and strong implementing agency over the PSDP series. Using operational and project
   management experience, POWERGRID has effectively contributed to the success of the
   project. Moreover, this project has shown that continuous reviews and improvements of
   POWERGRID’s technical implementation, procurement, and safeguards systems have raised
   the standards to be followed by others.
b. Repeater projects contributed toward effective implementation of POWERGRID projects.
   Early preparation started during PSDP III provided valuable insights (such as success of
   eligibility criteria and implementation of emerging technologies)28 into issues to be resolved
   by both the parties in PSDP IV and its additional financing. Furthermore, the continued use of
   the eligibility criteria ensured the borrower’s commitment to the project.
c. Retroactive financing enabled an advance preparation of the project. Under the loans, the
   provision for retroactive financing for up to 20 percent of the loan amount resulted in
   immediate disbursement of about US$57 million under PSDP IV and about US$26 million
   under the PSDP IV AF loans.
d. Strong and reliable National Grid is facilitating economic development. With a stronger
   National Grid spanned out across the country, integration of renewable energy with the grid
   has become easier. This will provide energy security as well as carbon emission reduction.
   POWERGRID is engaged with the GoI on this initiative through implementing interstate
   transmission system and setting up of Renewable Energy Management centers and control
   infrastructure as part of Green Energy Corridors that envisions grid integration of renewable
   generation capacity addition of about 33 GW across India during the 12th Five Year Plan.
   Further, POWERGRID has installed overhead optic fiber network using OPGW, leveraging
   its existing countrywide transmission infrastructure. It has an all-India broadband telecom
   network of about 29,640 km, providing connectivity to all metros, major cities, towns, state
   capitals, including remote areas of the North-Eastern Region. POWERGRID also has the
   necessary licenses to provide a variety of telecom services. As part of a National Knowledge
   Network, POWERGRID is connecting selected educational institutions with a unified high-

     The Balia-Bhiwadi HVDC bipole line was funded under PSDP III and PSDP IV.

   speed network backbone. POWERGRID is also a member of the Advisory Body and Core
   Committee of the ambitious National Optical Fiber Network project, which uses the existing
   optical fiber facilities of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), POWERGRID, and RailTel
   Corporation of India Limited to connect all the 250,000 gram panchayats (GPs).
   POWERGRID is working for development and maintenance of this network in four states
   (Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Odisha) covering about 36,000 GPs.
e. POWERGRID is now a ‘partner of choice’. Over the years, POWERGRID has transformed
   into an organization successfully foraying into advanced technologies that it has become a
   ‘partner of choice’ by Indian states as well as neighboring countries. Building on the
   experience gained from several HVDC transmission links including the ±500 kV Balia-
   Bhiwadi HVDC line, POWERGRID has now established 400 kV D/C HVDC back-to-back
   terminals at Bheramara (Bangladesh), enabling a power flow of 500 MW from India to
   Bangladesh. This line is an important contribution toward regional integration.
   POWERGRID is also providing technical support through consultancy outside India. Within
   India, POWERGRID is partnering with most of the states (such as the North Eastern States)
   to help develop their transmission networks.
f. Timely measures required for overcoming RoW issues. It is important to note that given the
   scarcity of resources within the country, RoW has become very difficult to obtain. Because of
   the linear nature of the transmission projects and traversing through agricultural lands/farms,
   and habitation enroute, RoW problems are probable during construction of transmission lines.
   Even though POWERGRID is following principles set out in its ESPP, it is increasingly
   becoming difficult to obtain RoW. These issues can hamper project execution and, in some
   cases, may derail the entire project schedule as in the case of SRSS 13. Since, land is a state
   subject, POWERGRID takes necessary assistance of the local government authorities in
   resolving the RoW problems as and when they arise.29 Further, POWERGRID has adopted
   innovative tower design and deploying transformation technologies30 to reduce width of RoW
   and has also taken a policy decision to install D/C or multicircuit towers in forest and other
   ecologically sensitive areas. This has resulted in huge saving of trees. POWERGRID is also
   adopting higher voltage levels gradually such as 765 kV or 800 kV and increasing the power
   carrying capacity of transmission lines (up to 6,000 MW on D/C lines) for optimizing RoW
   without much effect on transmission losses.
g. Due focus on safeguards help in obtaining forest clearance with a shorter turnaround time.
   Even though processing time of a proposal for forest clearance at the state level has been
   prescribed as 210 days according to guidelines issued by MoEF, the time taken normally is
   very high, resulting in delay in implementation of projects. This is aggravated if the
   transmission line passes through a wildlife sanctuary, national park, or notified eco-sensitive
   zone, when permission of the Supreme Court is essential but is a very cumbersome process.
   In such cases, the whole process takes 2–3 years and sometimes even more. POWERGRID
   has very limited role in processing of forest proposal in the state forest hierarchy due to
   involvement of many officials. However, it was experienced that constant persuasion of the
   officials expedites the process. Hence, strengthening of the environment and social
   department proved to be useful as POWERGRID did in June 2011 to factor in activities
   required to comply with MoEF’s notification to the FRA of August 2009. POWERGRID has



29
   It should also be noted that the probability of abnormal RoW issues of very high severity as faced in SRSS 13 is very
low and rare.
30
   POWERGRID is deploying various technologies such as multi circuits, compact and tall towers, High Surge
Impedance Loading Lines, Fixed and Thyristor Controlled Series Compensation, and High Temperature Low Sag
(HTLS) Conductors.




                                                          29
   exclusively deputed one officer in each region for regular follow-up and monitoring of forest
   proposals at the state level and concerned Regional Ministry of Environment and Forest
   (RMoEF) to expedite forest clearance.
h. Adequate handling of land acquisition issues. The land acquisition procedures/laws are too
   cumbersome. These might be counterproductive to sector development and to network
   expansion (as they create delays) and they might have a negative impact on the sustainability
   of POWERGRID’s operations. Considering the ramifications, POWERGRID has already
   initiated preemptive measures and has developed a policy for procurement of land on
   ‘willing-seller willing-buyer’ basis on negotiated rate without enforcing the provisions of
   land acquisition laws to smoothen procurement of land without any resistance and delay.
   Such measures may come handy in offsetting the delays associated with land acquisition as
   has been demonstrated in case of the Aurangabad substation funded under PSDP V. Further,
   as land has become a scarce resource, POWERGRID is adopting new technologies like Gas
   Insulated Substation (GIS) which requires less land area (about 25 percent) as against
   conventional Air Insulated Switchyard (AIS) substations. It is also following the practice of
   land management to minimize the land requirement to the barest minimum under which it has
   taken a policy decision to have GIS substations in the city area and to install multicircuit
   towers around a 1-km radius of all new substations. Wherever possible, POWERGRID tries
   to locate substations on government land/waste land/non-fertile land to reduce the impact of
   land acquisition on PAP.
i. Review and updating of procurement documents to promote new technologies. As part of this
   loan and in line with the Bank’s procedures, procurement for some of the unique and
   emerging technologies in India (HVDC for Balia-Bhiwadi and 765 kV technology) was
   carried out. The procurement documents were reviewed and suitably updated to promote
   scaling up to new technologies as part of the loans.
j. Vendor conferences resulted in higher participation and competitive prices. POWERGRID,
   in association with the Bank, organized conferences for conductor and insulator vendors in
   April 2009 and September 2010 with the objective of increasing participation. Such
   conferences have resulted in more participation and competitive prices as evident from the
   bids received for the packages floated after these conferences. Further, a conference on
   common mistakes and discrepancies during bidding was also organized with prospective
   bidders in September 2010 by POWERGRID in association with the Bank. This conference
   resulted in significant improvement in the bids being submitted and helped reduce the delay
   in bid evaluation on account of common errors or inconsistencies in the bids.
k. Restructuring of loans to optimize utilization. The restructuring of the project was triggered
   by the significant savings/surplus resulting from the combined effects of a highly competitive
   market, the continuing devaluation of the Indian rupee (INR) against the U.S. dollar since
   loan approval and the regulatory requirements to maintain a debt-equity ratio of 70:30 for all
   the schemes financed by POWERGRID. In addition to inclusion of a new scheme, shifting of
   one scheme from PSDP V to PSDP IV AF enabled leveraging of flexibility in the
   POWERGRID portfolio that had the same PDO and KPIs, resulting in optimal utilization of
   the available funds across its various engagements.
l. With large size of package, it is useful to have higher prior review threshold. In view of
   POWERGRID’s procurement of large and costly packages, it is recommended that the
   US$25 million limit for prior review packages be increased. This change should help
   POWERGRID manage the procurement process of large contracts. In January 2014, the
   Operational Procurement Review Committee (OPRC) threshold limits were revised upward,
   except for high risk packages, from US$50 million to US$200 million for low-risk packages
   and to US$115 million for moderate-risk packages that are generally the risk profile of
   POWERGRID packages.



                                               30
m. Engagement with a capable borrower results in mutual learning. Both the Bank and
   POWERGRID learned from each other during this partnership. The learnings have been in
   terms of better project management that includes contract management. For instance, for ease
   of reconciliation of the disbursement applications by the Bank and the borrower, it is
   suggested that changes in the contract value on account of price variation and amendments to
   the contracts should reflect on the Client Connection website. This system will help both the
   Bank and the borrower in monitoring and reconciling the funds available against each
   contract for disbursement and facilitate optimal utilization of the fund by keeping a tab on the
   savings, if any, being envisaged.

1.       The Bank had a programmatic engagement with POWERGRID to the tune of US$1.4
billion provided to it in a phased manner. The first tranche of US$400 million was availed under
the PSDP III loan that closed in July 2011, and ICR Report (No. ICR1862) was disclosed on
January 30, 2012. The following schemes were covered under PSDP III:

2.       The second and third phases of US$600 million and US$400 million were made available
to POWERGRID under the PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF loans that closed on July 31, 2014. The
original schemes, approved at appraisal and funded under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF, were
implemented and completed within the project period. One of the new schemes that was shifted
from PSDP V was also completed within the loan closing period. Only one new scheme (SRSS
13) is not complete due to severe RoW issues at the state level (Karnataka). This scheme is now
expected to be completed not before March 2015 and its implementation will be monitored under
PSDP V, which is an active POWERGRID loan with the Bank. The scheme will be completed
using POWERGRID funds. Table 2.2 compares the total project costs at the time of appraisal, the
corresponding Bank funding at that time, final committed value to be financed by the Bank funds
after the award of the contract, and disbursements as on December 19, 2014.

4.     The following section elaborates further on the various schemes and their components
funded under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF.

a. ±500 kV, 2,500 MW Balia and Bhiwadi HVDC Bipole System

5.      The objective of the scheme was to transfer power to the Northern and Western regions
from the Balia Pooling Point (in Uttar Pradesh), which gets power from surplus generated in the
Eastern region. A 2,500 MW HVDC bipole system between Balia and Bhiwadi was required to
meet the power demand for the states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi in the western
part of the Northern Grid. The HVDC system has some inherent features which help in
maintaining grid stability and reliability efficiently:

      The HVDC system allows controlled power flow.
      Control features of the HVDC system helps in damping system oscillation after any
       disturbance.
      The HVDC system does not contribute any additional short circuit current to Balia
       whereas AC systems do.
      The HVDC system provides flexibility of operation.

6.       Further, it was anticipated that the Northern region would be importing a large quantum
of power from the Eastern region and accordingly a number of interregional links are envisaged
to be established between the Eastern and Northern regions. It was felt prudent to develop a
hybrid system comprising high-capacity transmission links. Keeping this in view, a pooling
station at Balia in the Northern region is envisaged where power will be pooled from various
projects in the Eastern region and thereafter 400 kV AC and HVDC lines are envisaged to be
established for dispersal of power to various constituents of the Northern region.


                                               38
7.      Pole I of the HVDC line along with the terminal station was commissioned in September
2010. The 500 kV HVDC bipole line of this project was covered under the PSPD III loan from
the Bank. The second HVDC terminal was covered under the PSDP IV loan. Pole II of the
scheme was originally scheduled for completion in December 2009 but could only be
commissioned in July 2012 due to delays in supply of converter transformers at the Biwadi
terminal station by the contractor. According to the contract, eight (8) converter transformers
were to be manufactured and supplied by M/s BHEL in technical collaboration with M/s Siemens
AG, Germany, which were the Joint Venture (JV) partners for the package, from July 2008 to
March 2009, whereas it could only be supplied from October 2011 to March 2012.

8.      Both Pole I and Pole II of the Balia-Bhiwadi HVDC project were successfully
commissioned and tested for rated power of 1,250 MW each and overload power of 1,500 MW
each. Presently, the ±500 kV, 2,500 MW Balia-Bhiwadi HVDC bipole project is in successful
operation and maximum power flow was of the order of 2,500 MW. It will be operated at full
capacity progressively with commissioning of the Barh generation units. The ±500 kV Balia-
Bhiwadi HVDC link is facilitating bulk power exchange between the Northern and Eastern
regions and has become an important HVDC link in strengthening the Northern Grid.

9.      Under PSDP III, the works consisted of transmission lines:

        •   Balia-Bhiwadi 500 kV HVDC bipole line (1,580 ckm)

10.     Under PSDP IV, the works consisted of substations (initially proposed to be funded under
PSDP III but to match the commissioning of the associated generation projects it was later
financed under PSDP IV):

        •   HVDC Terminal Station for 2,500 MW at Balia and Bhiwadi along with associated
            works

b. North-West Transmission Corridor Strengthening Scheme

11.     Synchronous operation of Western Region (WR) and Northern Region (NR) was
envisaged through a 765 kV line between Agra (NR) and Gwalior (WR) as a part of transmission
system of Kahalgaon-II (1,500 MW) generation project in the Eastern Region. With more
generation projects coming in the Eastern Region (ER) with beneficiaries in the NR and WR, the
power flow on lines connecting Northern and Western Regions was envisaged to increase. Thus,
a need was felt to enhance the power transfer capacity between the Northern and Western regions.
Accordingly, the second circuit of the Agra-Gwalior 765 kV line (initially to be operated at 400
kV) was envisaged under the project.

12.     With the completion of the Agra-Gwalior 765 kV first circuit, the Eastern, Western, and
Northern regions are operating as a single unit having large capacity. The common geographical
boundary of the Western and Northern regions is spread longitudinally. Therefore, to maintain
system stability as well as security of the single grid under all operating conditions, it was felt
necessary to connect both the regions through interconnection at different locations along the
boundary. Accordingly, another interconnection between the two regions was envisaged by
connecting Kankroli (NR) and Zerda (WR) through a 400 kV D/c line.

13.     Under the project, two interregional lines (between the Northern and Western regions),
namely Agra-Gwalior 765 kV S/C line and Zerda-Kankroli 400 kV D/C line, were implemented
(funding under the PSDP III loan). Extension works of bays for termination of these lines were


                                                39
covered under the PSDP IV loan. Extension of substations covered under the PSDP IV loan was
commissioned matching with the associated transmission lines, that is, Agra-Gwalior 2nd 765 kV
S/C and Zerda-Kankroli 400 kV D/C lines covered under the PSDP III loan. These lines have
added about 2,100 MW in interregional power transfer capacity.

14.     Under PSDP III, the works consisted of transmission lines:

        •   Agra-Gwalior 765 kV S/C (initially to be operated at 400 kV) (128 ckm)
        •   Zerda-Kankroli 400 kV D/C (470 ckm)

15.     Under PSDP IV, the works consisted of substations:

        •   400/220 kV Agra (POWERGRID) Substation Extension
        •   400/220 kV Gwalior (POWERGRID) Substation Extension
        •   400/220 kV Kankroli (POWERGRID) Substation Extension
        •   400/220 kV Zerda (GEB) Substation Extension

c. Western Region System Strengthening Scheme II

16.      In India, major energy resources are concentrated in a few pockets like the large belt of
coal deposit confined to the eastern part, while most of the hydro potential is located in the
northeastern and upper northern parts of the country. Therefore, to meet the power requirement of
deficit regions like the Western region, bulk power transfer over long distances from the
generation resources to the load centers located across the country is required. Further, major
generation sources in the Western region are located in its eastern part while load centers are in
the western and central part of the region. Therefore, to transfer power from major generation
plants in the eastern part to load centers like Wardha, Pune, Aurangabad, Gwalior, Bhopal, Indore,
and Karamsad, there was a need to develop transmission corridors of adequate capacity.
Accordingly, the WRSS II was designed to strengthen various parts of the WR. The scheme was
evolved consisting of four sets (A, B, C, and D). While transmission lines under sets A and D
along with all the substations were implemented by POWERGRID, transmission lines under sets
B and C were to be implemented through private participation.

17.     Out of this, POWERGRID implemented the Bina-Gwalior 765 kV second S/C
transmission line (initially to be operated at 400 kV) under PSDP III funding. The line was
commissioned in February 2010. It may be mentioned that other important lines, such as Seoni-
Wardha were also implemented through Bank financing under the PSPD III loan. The Seoni-Bina
765 kV S/C line is under commercial operation since April 1, 2010, and has helped to connect the
major load center (Bina) in the northern part of the state of Madhya Pradesh to a power pooling
point in the south-eastern part of the state (Seoni) as well as to complete the 765 kV ring
interconnecting the Eastern, Western, and Northern regions of India as part of the development of
the National Grid. The Seoni-Wardha transmission system has been commissioned progressively
from April 2009 to November 2009 and has provided adequate transmission arrangements to
enable the state of Maharashtra to draw power reliably from a pooling point in the central part of
the WR, where power imported from the ER and other sources are being pooled.

18.    Major components of the balance scheme were covered for financing under the PSPD IV
and PSDP IV AF. Various elements of the project have been commissioned progressively from
February 2010 to December 2012 and are under commercial operation.

19.     Under PSDP IV, the works consisted of the following components:


                                               40
        Transmission Lines
        • From Korba to Birsinghpur 400 kV D/C (454 ckm)
        • From Birsinghpur to Damoh 400 kV D/C line (508 ckm)
        • From Damoh to Bhopal (MP transco) 400 kV D/C line (432 ckm)
        Substations
        • New 400/220 kV substations at Pune and Solapur
        • Extension of 400/220 kV substations at Aurangabad, Parli, Kolhapur, Damoh,
           Gwalior, Bina, Korba, and Bhopal

20.     Under PSDP IV AF, the works consisted of the following components:

        Transmission Lines
        • From Wardha to Parli 400 kV D/C line (674 ckm)
        • From Bhadrawati to Parli 400 kV D/C line (776 ckm)
        • From Raipur to Wardha 400 kV D/C line (741 ckm)
        • From Parli (MSETCL) to Parli (POWERGRID) 400 kV D/C (10 ckm)
        Substations
        • A new 400/220 kV substation at Parli
        • Extension of 400/220 kV substations at Bhadrawati, Parli (MSETCL), Wardha, and
           Raipur
        • Extension of 400/220 kV substations at Rajgarh, Karamsad, Limbdi, Zerda,
           Ranchhodpura, and Birsinghpur
        • FSC at Rajgarh substation for 400 kV D/C Rajgarh-Karamsad line
        • FSC at Wardha substation for 400 kV D/C Wardha-Raipur line

d. East-West Transmission Corridor Strengthening Scheme

21.     In the Eastern region, a large number of generation schemes like Kahalgaon Stage-II
(1,500 MW), Barh (1,980 MW), North Karanpura (1,980 MW), Maithon (1,000 MW), and
Nabinagar (1,000 MW) were planned with beneficiaries located in Western and other regions.
According to the projected load-generation scenario of the Western region, it was envisaged that
a large quantum of power needed to be imported from the Eastern region to the Western region.
Accordingly, 400 kV Rourkela-Raigarh-Raipur D/C line was proposed to strengthen the existing
Rourkela-Raipur interregional transmission corridor between the Eastern and Western regions
and to enable increase in the level of power transfer to the Western region. However, to pool
surplus power from various generation projects in the Eastern region for onward transmission to
Rourkela, a 400 kV D/C line between Ranchi, a pooling point in the Eastern region, and Rourkela
were also proposed to provide a parallel Transmission Corridor from the central part of the region
toward Rourkela.

22.     Further, to enhance power transfer capacity over the proposed 400 kV Rourkela-Raigarh-
Raipur interregional link, 40 percent FSC along with 5–15 percent Thyristor Controlled Series
Capacitor (TCSC) on both the circuits of the Raigarh-Raipur 400 kV D/C line at the Raipur end
was made part of this scheme.

23.     The scheme was originally scheduled for completion in June 2009 but could only be
completed and commissioned in July 2011 due to delays in obtaining forest clearances. Details
are as below:

24.     Forest clearance proposal for diversion of forest land of about 18.8 ha (3.94 ha in Ranchi,
8.89 ha in Khunti, and 6.007 ha in Simdega) was submitted to the nodal officer on January 3,


                                               41
2006. The nodal officer forwarded the proposal to the concerned three district forest officers
(DFOs). During joint site inspection, forest officials advised a change in alignment in forest area.
Accordingly, realignment was done. While carrying out a survey for realignment, identification
of khasra plots, and tree enumeration of the revised route, stiff resistance and disturbances were
faced from the extremists since the entire line route passes through extremist-prone areas.
Therefore, this process of survey for realignment and khasra plot identification, including tree
enumeration, took considerable time. The proposal was revised after getting the plot identification
report for the revised route from concerned six circle officers and enumeration of forest trees. The
process for the No Objection Certificate (NOC) for jungle-jhari land from the concerned deputy
collectors was done in parallel, which took considerable time. Finally, the proposal reached the
Principal Secretary (Forest) on October 24, 2008, through the proper channels, that is, the DFO to
the Conservator of Forest (CF), CF to the Regional Chief Conservator of Forest (RCCF), RCCF
to the Nodal Officer, the Nodal Officer to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), and
the PCCF to the Principal Secretary (Forest), who forwarded it to the Minister (Forest),
government of Jharkhand on November 13, 2008. The proposal was approved by the ministry and
returned to the Principal Secretary (Forest) on February 23, 2009, and it was forwarded to the
CCF (C), Bhubaneshwar on February 28, 2009. A meeting of the State Advisory Group (SAG) at
Ranchi was held on July 17, 2009. The CCF (C), Bhubaneshwar forwarded the proposal with
SAG recommendations to the MoEF, New Delhi on August 3, 2009. The MoEF in turn advised
the CCF (C), Bhubaneswar for submission of the wildlife mitigation plan duly vetted by the
Director, Elephant Project, New Delhi by the state government. The Director, Elephant Project,
approved the plan and communicated to the PCCF, Ranchi with a copy to the Principal Secretary
(Forest), Jharkhand on February 1, 2010. Stage-I approval was issued on March 23, 2010, with a
new condition for compliance of FRA, 2006. This was processed from the village level and
completed by July 2010 from all the three districts. Then, the Principal Secretary (Forest),
Jharkhand forwarded the Stage-I compliance report to the CCF (C), Bhubaneswar on July 19,
2010, and Stage-II approval was issued on August 4, 2010. Only upon receipt of the final
clearance, the works on the scheme could be taken forward.

25.      Under PSDP IV, the works consisted of the following components:

      Transmission Lines
             • From Ranchi to Rourkela 400 kV D/c line (290 ckm)
             • From Rourkela to Raigarh 400 kV D/c line (420 ckm)
             • From Raigarh to Raipur 400 kV D/c line (440 ckm)
      Substations
             • Extension of 400/220 kV substation at Ranchi
             • Extension of 400/220 kV substation at Rourkela
             • Extension of 400/220 kV substation at Raipur37
             • Extension of 400/220 kV substation at Raigarh

26.      Under PSDP IV AF, the works consisted of substations:

         •    FSC at Raipur substation for 400 kV D/C Rajgarh-Raipur line

e. Eastern Region System Strengthening Scheme I


37
   Provision of 40 percent FSC along with 5–15 percent TCSC on both the circuits of the Raigarh-Raipur 400 kV D/C
line at the Raipur end.




                                                        42
27.      Many new generation projects were envisaged to come up under the Central and State
sector in the eastern part of the Eastern region. Such generation projects included Sagardighi (600
MW), Bakreshwar Extn (420 MW) and Santaldih Extn (250 MW) of WBPDCL, Purulia PSP
(900 MW) of WBSEB, DPL Extn (1,200 MW), Mejia Extn (500 MW), and Chandrapura Extn
(500 MW) of DVC. Accordingly, it was necessary to strengthen the transmission grid of the
Eastern region to facilitate transmission of additional surplus power, which would be available
due to addition of these generation projects. In view of this, implementation of ERSS I was
proposed to facilitate evacuation of surplus power from the eastern part of the Eastern Region
Grid to the central areas from where it was designed to get further transmitted through the
existing transmission system. Further, in order to transfer additional power in a reliable manner
from the planned generation projects in Sikkim, Bhutan, and the North-Eastern Region (through
the chicken neck area), strengthening of the Siliguri-Purnea corridor has also been carried out.

28.      The scheme was originally scheduled for completion in October 2009 but could
progressively be completed from August 2011 to March 2014. The delay in commissioning is due
to delays in obtaining forest clearances and severe RoW issues being faced on the various
transmission lines under the funding. Re-conductoring of the Purnea-Siliguri 400 kV D/C line
was affected due to delays in conductor supply and the devastating earthquake and tsunami in
Japan and could be completed by March 2014. After commissioning, the scheme has been
successfully transmitting power across the regions. Further, strengthening of the Siliguri-Purnea
line has resulted in transferring additional power from the planned generation projects in Sikkim,
Bhutan, and North-Eastern Region through the chicken neck area with reliability. It was already
evacuating hydel power from Tala and Teesta projects.

29.      Under PSDP IV, the works consisted of the following components:

         Transmission Lines
         • From Durgapur to Jamshedpur 400 kV D/c line (314 ckm)
         • From Jamshedpur to Baripada 400 kV D/c line (282 ckm)
         • From Baripada to Chandaka (Mendhasal) 400 kV D/c line (544 ckm)

         Substations
         • Extension of 400/220 kV substation at Jamshedpur
         • Extension of 400/220 kV substation at Durgapur
         • Extension of 400/220/132 kV substation at Baripada
         • Extension of 400/220 kV substation at Mendhasal (Chandaka) (GRIDCO)
         • Renovation of 400/220 kV substation at Siliguri38
         • Renovation of 400/220 kV substation at Purnea39

30.      Under PSDP IV AF, the works consisted of:

       Transmission Lines
        • Re-conductoring of the Siliguri-Purnea 400 kV D/c line with twin INVAR moose
            conductor (346 ckm)


38
   Re-conductoring of 400 kV bays, including dismantling and replacement of equipment and associated works.
Dismantled equipment of the Siliguri and Purnea substations shall be used at the Jamshedpur and Durgapur substations.
39
   Re-conductoring of 400 kV bays, including dismantling and replacement of equipment and associated works.
Dismantled equipment of the Siliguri and Purnea substations shall be used at the Jamshedpur and Durgapur substations.




                                                         43
f.   Southern Region System Strengthening – XIII (New Scheme Added Through Restructuring)

31.     In the Southern region, a number of generation projects under the Central Sector such as
Neyveli TS-II Expansion (500 MW), Kalpakkam PFBR (500 MW), and Krishnapatnam UMPP
(4,000 MW) are envisaged for commissioning during the 12th Plan period. All the regional
constituents will have shares from these new generating projects, which will result in
enhancement of shares of beneficiaries, including Karnataka. The power from some of these
generating stations is available at Raichur/Gooty through various transmission lines and the
power is required to be supplied to the major load centers in the state of Karnataka like Bangalore.

32.     Presently, the load of the Bangalore area is being supplied through three 400/220 kV
substations, namely, Hoody, Somanhalli, and Neelamangla. These substations are fully utilized
and do not have adequate capacity to accommodate additional transmission line strengthening or
transformer augmentations. To enable delivery of enhanced share of power as well as to meet
growing load demand, augmentation of the transmission system, including establishment of a new
400/220 kV substation shall be required. Madhugiri, near Bangalore in Karnataka State, is one
such location that is identified for establishing a new 400/220 kV substation, which is to be
connected to Gooty and Yelahanka to feed the growing power demand in and around the
Bangalore area, as a regional strengthening scheme.

33.       However, implementation of the transmission lines covered under SRSS 13 has been
affected due to severe RoW issues faced since February 2013 in the state of Karnataka. Since the
start of the detailed survey/field work, there was severe resistance and protests by the landowners
and villagers on the Gooty-Madhugiri transmission line route.

34.      Foundation work on the Madhugiri-Yelahanka transmission line commenced in August
2012 and progressed smoothly in the beginning. Tower erection work also commenced in
February 2013 although works at many locations were frequently obstructed by landowners under
the influence of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (Karnataka State Farmers Forum [KRRS]).
The protests from the landowners were consolidated once the KRRS started the campaign among
the landowners by distributing pamphlets and organizing meetings in every village along the line
route, and foundation work came to a standstill by January 2014 due to the organized protests.

35.      POWERGRID approached the Assistant Commissioner of Madhugiri and District
Collector of Tumkur in June 2013 and a number of petitions were filed before the District
Magistrate of Tumkur for resolving the RoW problems. In October 2013, a series of meetings
were conducted by the revenue authorities at the district, division, and taluk levels between the
farmers and landowners, represented by the KRRS, and POWERGRID to address their
grievances and resolve the issue. However, no consensus was arrived at in these meetings.
Subsequent to this, location-specific hearings were also conducted with specific landowners for
select locations and orders were passed on January 7, 2014, by the District Magistrate for one
location with a directive to POWERGRID to make an ex gratia payment of INR 50,000 to the
landowners. However, the landowners collectively stopped the work at the above location,
demanding higher compensation. POWERGRID again approached the district administration to
resolve the issue and a senior level meeting was held at the District Collector’s office on February
22, 2014, between officials of POWERGRID and the Revenue and Police departments.
Subsequently, the District Magistrate, Tumkur passed an order on February 28, 2014, directing
POWERGRID to pay the landowners an ex gratia amount ranging from INR 0.15 million to 0.3
million (according to the type of tower) per tower location in addition to tree and crop
compensation. Landowners were generally satisfied with the compensation package, including


                                                44
the ex gratia amount, and therefore work at some locations in the Katenahalli and Kora-Hobli
villages started in March 2014 with the consent of the respective landowners, after notices were
served. However, the work was again stopped after severe protest by a certain group of people.
POWERGRID tried to start work at another location with consent from the landowner in
Honnenahalli village in the first week of April 2014. However, a similar group of people gathered
and work was stopped at this location also. The group even prevented the landowner from
accepting the compensation check for cutting of trees. These incidents were reported to the
District Collector, Tumkur, who in turn called the state leader of the KRRS for a meeting on
April 26, 2014. However, the meeting could not take place as the state leader failed to come for
the meeting and the stalemate continued. The matter regarding compensation was decided in the
meetings held on June 3 and June 26, 2014, and the Deputy Commissioner, Tumkur issued an
order dated July 8, 2014, in respect of compensation, which includes special compensation for
tower locations and compensation toward temporary damages for the Tumkur portion of the 400
kV D/C Gooty-Madhugiri-Yelahanka line. On July 18, 2014, Taluk Committee(s) were
constituted for conducting of Panchnama of the tower footing, landowner identification, and
enumeration of trees and crops in the tower footing area. Committees were constituted in the
taluks of Pavagada, Madhugiri, Koratagere, and Tumkur rural. On August 8, 2014, orders were
passed by the DC, Bangalore Rural toward enhanced compensation in the Bangalore Rural
portion of the 400 kV D/C Madhugiri-Yelahanka line. However, orders from the District
Collector, Bangalore Urban was yet to be issued. Further, on August 10, 2014, the District
Collector, Tumkur reviewed the progress of the Gooty-Madhugiri and Madhugiri-Yelahanka lines.
A meeting was conducted with the DCs and POWERGRID by the Honorable Secretary, MoP,
GoI at New Delhi on August 26, 2014. During November to December 2014, Panchnamas were
carried out in the Pavagada Taluk area. The Taluk Committee visited the locations, both in
Tumkur and Bangalore Rural, and after completion of assessment it will give their
recommendations to POWERGRID for compensation payment. POWERGRID is making all
efforts, with the support of state government authorities, to resolve the RoW constraints.

36.      POWERGRID has assured that completion of the project is top priority. As soon as
resolution is achieved, mobilization through contractors for commencing the work will be
undertaken. Implementation of this scheme will be monitored under PSDP V, which is an
ongoing lending investment with POWERGRID.

37.      Under PSDP IV, the works consisted of the following components:

          Transmission Lines
          • From Gooty to Madhugiri 400 kV D/C line (417 ckm)
          • From Madhugiri to Yelahanka 400 kV D/C (Quad) line (132 ckm)
          Substations
          • New 400/220 kV substation at Madhugiri
          • Extension of 400/220 kV substation at Gooty
      Note: Extension of bays at the Yelahanka substation is being funded through domestic
      sources.

g. System Strengthening in Western Region for Sasan UMPP (Scheme Shifted from PSDP V
   Through Restructuring)

38.    In the WR, a number of generation projects including the Sasan and Mundra UMPPs
(4,000 MW capacity each) in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, respectively, were being set up.
Power from these projects is to be transferred to various beneficiaries in the Western and
Northern regions. For evacuation of power from these projects, separate transmission systems


                                              45
are/were implemented (not funded by the Bank). For dispersal of power to major load centers in
the WR with reliability and security, strengthening of the regional transmission system in the WR
were to be implemented to match with the time frame of these UMPPs.

39.     For transfer of power from the Sasan UMPP, the transmission corridor from Sasan to
Bina via Satna has been implemented. However, system strengthening was also required beyond
Bina in Madhya Pradesh for transfer of power to the load centers of the WR for which a separate
high-capacity 765 kV transmission corridor from Bina to Indore and a major load center in
Madhya Pradesh along with establishment of a new 765/400 kV substation at Indore, was taken
up. Establishment of 765/400 kV substations at Bina and Gwalior were also taken up as part of
this scheme to facilitate charging of 765 kV lines interconnecting the Bina and Gwalior
substations. The transmission system has been completed and the new 765/400 kV substation at
Indore and upgrade of the Bina and Gwalior substations have been carried out under PSDP IV AF.

40.      The scheme was originally scheduled for completion in December 2012 (as per PAD of
PSDP V) but it could only be commissioned progressively from March 2013 to October 2014 due
to multiple reasons such as nonperforming contractor at the Indore substation, leading to
termination and re-award of the site levelling works contract and repairs and maintenance facility
for the 765 kV transformers and reactors and its suitable incorporation in qualification
requirement and in contract. With successful commissioning of the transmission scheme, a total
transformation capacity of 8,000 MVA has been added to cater to the load demand of major load
centers in Madhya Pradesh.

41.     Under PSDP IV AF, the works consisted of the following substations:

        • A new 765/400 kV substation at Indore and extension of the 400/220 kV substation at
           Indore (MPPTCL)
        • Establishment of a 765 kV and extension of the 400/220 kV substation at Gwalior
        • 7x333 MVA, 765/√3 / 400/√3 kV Single Phase Transformers at Bina substation
        • 7x500 MVA, 765/√3 / 400/√3 kV Single Phase Transformers at Gwalior substation
           and 7x500 MVA, 765/√3 / 400/√3 kV Single Phase Transformers at Indore substation
        • 765 kV Bus Reactor and Shunt Reactors at the Gwalior, Bina, and Indore substations

Overview of the Operations of the Bank-funded Transmission Lines

42.     Table 2.4 provides details in respect of capacity, actual maximum power flow that took
place over the link and availability of transmission lines over a specified period, covered under
the Bank funding. As noted, availability of all the Bank-funded lines has been above 99.5 percent.
However, this does not imply that the lines have to be loaded to the full capacity due to reasons
mentioned in the following paragraphs.

43.     It is to be noted that planning of transmission systems is done based on envisaged
generation and peak load demand and system requirements to transfer the same is based on
CEA’s planning criteria (guided by factor of reliability/contingency margin) after considering the
margins available in the existing network, if any, to evolve an optimal system.

44.      After commissioning of a transmission system, sometimes the load on the lines is less
during the initial phase due to delay in envisaged generation and/or the capacity of the state’s
transmission network to absorb power. However, the load increases with increase in power
transfer requirements and materialization of envisaged generation projects. It is also imperative to



                                                46
mention here that according to technical norms, it is essential to maintain redundancy in the
system so that in case of grid indiscipline, grid security is not compromised.

45.       Further, the transfer capability in any system is determined by the capacity of the weakest
link in the system during system contingencies, voltage profile, status of parallel transmission
network, and availability of envisaged generation. The gap between total transfer capacity and
loading of the system narrows down with sufficiency of planned generation and load demand and
is guided only by the factor of reliability/contingency margin as prescribed in the CEA’s planning
criteria.

OUTCOME

Growth in Power Exchanges between the Regions

46.      The completion of interregional lines, namely, the 400 kV Rourkela-Raigarh-Raipur D/C
line, funded under PSDP IV, has contributed to an addition of about 1,400 MW to the
interregional power transmission capacity of the National Grid. Together with works on


                                              48
associated bays (funded under PSDP IV) under NWTC strengthening, completion of the
interregional lines, namely, the Agra-Gwalior 765 kV S/C line and the Zerda-Kankroli 400 kV
D/C (lines funded under PSDP III), has resulted in an increase of interregional power transfer
capacity by about 2,100 MW. Completion of these schemes has contributed to an increase in
interregional power transfer capacity of the grid to 44,250 MW (as on September 30, 2014),
significantly up from 14,000 GW in FY2007. Further, the rest of the schemes have also
contributed significantly toward improved grid stability and security.

47.     During FY2014, POWERGRID’s strong transmission network and modernized RLDCs
have facilitated about 78,384 MU of power exchange across regions. Power exchange between
the regions has increased by about 40,634 MU, which is more than double in comparison to the
baseline of 37,750 MU (FY2007).

48.     Figure x shows the performance since the start of PSDP III (with baseline as FY2005). It
also reflects the baseline for PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF, that is, FY2007. The indicator
outperformed targets for all the years, as set in the PAD. During project appraisal, it was
envisaged that growth in power exchange between the regions will increase from 37,752 MU by
about 54 percent to reach 58,000 MU but the actual addition was about 108 percent and touched
78,384 MU. The targets for this indicator were never revised except for FY2014 for which it was
revised upward (PAD target: 58,000 MU; revised target: 68,000 MU) during the midterm review
of PSDP V, which was also the implementation support mission for PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF.

OUTPUT

49.     The implementation of any transmission scheme has a direct impact on the addition to the
transmission capacity measured in ckm and in the transformation capacity measured in MVA of
the transmission utility. Once the lines are commissioned, they contribute to the company’s
transmission and transformation capacity. The same holds true for POWERGRID, the CTU in the
Indian power sector. Thus, these two measures were adopted as result indicators for the project.
This also ensured consistency across the various repeater projects with POWERGRID (PSDP III,
PSDP IV, and PSDP IV AF) as PDO and KPIs were kept the same.

50.      Growth in transformation capacity (MVA). This indicator also outperformed all targets
set in the PAD. The chart below shows the performance since start of PSDP III (with baseline as
FY2005) and of PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF (with baseline of FY2007). The indicator
outperformed by almost 2.5 times the targets as set in the PAD for the project end year. During
project appraisal, it was envisaged that growth in transformation capacity will increase from
59,417 MVA by about 55 percent to reach 92,000 MVA, but the actual addition was about 247
percent and touched 205,923 MVA. The targets for this indicator were never revised except for
FY2014 for which it was revised upward (PAD target: 92,000 MVA; revised target: 185,000
MVA) during the midterm review of PSDP V, which was also the implementation support
mission for PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF.

51.      Growth in transmission capacity (ckm). Figure 2.2 shows the performance since start of
PSDP III (with baseline as FY2005) and of PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF (with baseline of FY2007).
This indicator also outperformed all targets set in the PAD except for FY2010 and FY2011 due to
factors that impacted progress and were outside POWERGRID’s control.

52.     In FY2010, the actual was lower than the target by almost 6 percent (PAD target: 80,000
ckm; actual: 75,291 ckm). Consequently, KPI targets for transmission capacity were revised
downward (compared to PAD targets) for FY2011 and FY2012 by 4.7 percent (from 84,000 ckm
to 80,000 ckm) and by 3.4 percent (from 88,000 ckm to 85,000 ckm), respectively during MTR in
April 2010 as the main reason for such underperformance was external factors: RoW issues and
delays in obtaining forest clearances, especially after the GoI’s notification regarding FRA in
August 2009 under which the project implementing authority (here, POWERGRID) had to take a
no objection certificate from every gram sabha (at the village level) for all proposals involving
diversion of forest land under the Forest (Conservation) Act. POWERGRID was able to


                                               50
successfully achieve the revised targets for both the years. This FRA requirement was later
waived off for linear projects40 (including transmission projects) in February 2013.

53.     However, it is noted that all the indicators already outperformed their original (as per the
PAD) targets in FY2013 after which the end-project targets (FY2014) were revised upward
during the implementation support mission in September 2013, which was also the midterm
review mission for PSDP V. POWERGRID outperformed all the revised targets except for a
marginal gap of 0.18 percent in transmission capacity for FY2014 (PAD target: 95,000 ckm;
revised target: 107,000 ckm; actual: 106,804 ckm). Overall, the indicator was expected to attain a
growth of about 60 percent over the project period (PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF) but added almost
80 percent of the targets set in PAD for the project end year.

Grid Disturbance of July 2012

55.      In July 2012, a nationwide grid failure occurred in India. The Northern Grid failed on
July 30, 2012, whereas the Northern, Eastern and Northern-Eastern grids failed on July 31, 2012.
The grid failures resulted in multiple outages for many hours and affected the load of about
48,000 MW.41 This prompted an enquiry committee constituted by the MoP, GoI to take several
measures to stabilize the system and thereby ensure grid discipline. In the report on grid
disturbance in August 2012, Enquiry Committee constituted by MoP concluded that the grid
failure was linked to a series of events like multiple forced outages leading to weak interregional
corridors, transmission line overloading due to overdrawing by some of the Northern Region
constituents, inadequate response by the SLDCs to the instructions of the RLDCs, and loss of the
400 kV Bina-Gwalior link. The report brought out the following underlying causes of the
aforesaid grid disturbances:

       a.   Skewed load generation balance across the regional grids
       b.   Grid indiscipline
       c.   Depleted reliability margins
       d.   Failure or inadequate response of defense mechanism/protection system
       e.   Insufficient visibility and situational awareness at load despatch centers
       f.   Inadequate appreciation of transfer capability compared to transmission capacity
       g.   Institutional issues

56.      One of the major reasons for the grid failure was the weak interregional corridor between
WR and NR due to multiple outages including the 400 kV Bina-Gwalior-Agra line, which was
the only main AC circuit available between the two regions before grid disturbance. Even though
outage of the 400 kV Bina-Gwalior-Agra line was planned in advance, the works on the line
could not be completed within the stipulated time frame due to heavy rains. The 400 kV Bina-
Gwalior-Agra line was to be upgraded from 400 kV to 765 kV and included some construction
activities. Meanwhile, the first circuit of the Bina-Gwalior line tripped on July 29, 2012, and
available manpower and material from the other circuit (under planned outage) was diverted
urgently to this circuit to restore the line at the earliest. Since the resources (manpower and
material) were diverted to restore the other circuit, the works on the planned outage circuit could
not be finished in time. Under outage of the Bina-Gwalior line, low voltage at Gwalior is a
limiting constraint. Hence, availability of this line is a critical factor for determining transfer
capability for the WR-NR corridor.

57.     These were the steps taken by POWERGRID for grid restoration during the July 2012
disturbances:

a. The first system disturbance took place at 0233 hours on July 30, 2012, which resulted in
   power supply failure in the Northern Region and a small pocket of Madhya Pradesh in the
   Western Region. The rest of the system was normal. Within the Northern Region, Badarpur
   thermal power stations survived with a portion of Delhi’s load; however, this portion suffered
   a blackout at 0648 hours. Supply was provided to all emergency loads such as railways,
   metros, and airports by about 0800 hours. By 1000 hours, all thermal power stations were
   provided startup supply. The Northern Regional system was restored by 1600 hours with the
   normal scheduling process commencing from then.
b. The second system disturbance affecting the Northern, Eastern, and North-Eastern electricity
   grids and a small pocket in Madhya Pradesh occurred at 1300 hours of July 31, 2012, leading
   to loss of power supply in these areas. Nearly 55,000 MW of consumer load was affected in
   the disturbance. The areas which survived included the Western Region, Narora atomic
   power station on house load, and system comprising Sterlite/IB TPS, Bokaro Steel, TISCO,
   and CESC Kolkata systems in the Eastern Region (ER). Immediate steps were initiated for
   restoration of the areas affected in the incident. Start-up supply was extended from the
   Western Region and the Southern Region, which were intact. Hydro units in the Northern
   Region, Eastern Region, and North-Eastern Region were self-started. Supply was extended to
   emergency loads such as railways, metros, mines, and airports by about 1530 hours. The
   system was restored by 2400 hours on July 31, 2012, when the normal scheduling process
   commenced.
58.        Some of the key actions as proposed by the enquiry committee were:

      a.   third-party protection audits;
      b.   formulation of islanding schemes in different states;
      c.   review of the UI mechanism; and
      d.   further tightening of frequency band.42

   “…the frequency band of the Northern Grid has been tightened to 49.7 Hz7Hz to 50.5 Hz5Hz. This will make
dependence on the Grid for meeting peak load an expensive proposition. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
(CERC) has done this mainly to increase grid security and encourage distribution companies (discoms) to look at other
options for arranging power supply. There have been several instances of grid indiscipline in the past with states
continuing to overdraw despite low frequency. With the new regulations in force, city discoms are exploring all options
to ensure they are able to meet the peak summer demand. Power sector officials said the only way discoms can provide
smooth power supply is by contracting assured agreements in the organized market.””. (Source: The Times of India,

       stations are connected on a very                         in place. Further, it is in the process of
       reliable telecom network.                                developing a Grid Security Expert
       (i) A proper network may be built up                     System (GSES), which involves
       preferably using Multi Protocol Label                    laying of optical fiber network for
       Switching (MPLS), which is simple,                       reliable communication as well as
       cost effective, and reliable. In remote                  control of under-frequency and df/dt
       places where connectivity is a problem,                  relay based load shedding. System

       cables from the nearest node.                            level and above.
       (ii) Since POWERGRID has its own
       fiber optic cables covering all major
       nodes and power stations, a proper
       communication/IT network may be
       built using dedicated cables to avoid
       any cyber-attack on the power system.

60.      It is to be noted that grid disturbances, mainly triggered by faults at critical system
locations, occur from time to time in all large transmission systems across the world. Since no
system design is capable of removing all constraints (to attempt this would in any event be
prohibitively costly), in power system operation, a specific emphasis needs to be put on robust
planning, efficiency, and speed of service restoration, all of which POWERGRID is practicing in
a collaborative manner with key stakeholders. Using POWERGRID’s robust transmission system,
POSOCO was able to wheel hydropower from Bhutan to restore supply to emergency loads such
as hospitals, railways, and other critical functions within 5.5 hours on July 30 and within 2.5
hours on July 31. It was able to restore the entire system within 13.5 hours on July 30, 2012, and
8.5 hours on July 31, 2012. These restoration times compare extremely favorably with restoration
times in major power system disruptions in other countries. In addition, POSOCO, in consultation
with the CEA, made several adjustments to operational power flow limits on interregional power
transmission links and is in the process of buying specific monitoring and protection equipment to
avert the reoccurrence of any such incident as explained in detail in the above table.

Performance Indicator Pertaining to Environment

61.     In addition to the above KPIs, ‘cumulative forest area impacted/cumulative line length in
ckm’ was selected as a performance indicator with reference to environment. Subsequently,
during the ICR Mission of PSDP III in October 2011, it was decided to use ‘cumulative
transmission capacity (MW) per meter width of right of way within the forest area’ as a
performance indicator on environment (for consistency with the performance indicator being
followed under the ongoing PSDP V loan). Accordingly, the indicator has been calculated for the
PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF loans considering 2004–05 as the base year (as mentioned in the PAD
of PSDP III).

      Note: * There is a dip during 2008–09 as more low-capacity lines (220 kV and 400 kV) were implemented,
      which has dragged the bar down.

62.     In addition to the KPIs as elaborated above, POWERGRID was monitored on indicators
additional to these KPIs and covenanted targets. These additional indicators were also agreed
upon with the Bank to objectively measure improvements in power sector performance as well as
POWERGRID's corporate performance. Given the satisfactory performance of POWERGRID in
achieving and reporting such indicators, it was decided that these would be discontinued during
the MTR of PSDP IV and its AF. Later, during the MTR of PSDP V in September 2013, the
monitoring of these additional indicators was reinstated to allay concerns linked to the slower
disbursement of PSDP V, reversing the decision taken at the MTR of PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF.

63.      As indicated in table 2.8, the corporate level indicators depict a strong performance of
POWERGRID across several metrics. The availability of POWERGRID’s transmission network
has also improved from 99.2 percent in FY2007 to 99.9 percent in FY2014. Strengthened
transmission network is also reflected through decrease in the number of trippings per line due to
factors attributable to POWERGRID over the loan period.

64.      Further, the sectoral indicators reflect that private sector participation has increased by
more than 4.5 times in terms of ckm of line constructed. Power traded as a percentage of total
power generated in the country has shown an upward trend from 3.6 percent in FY2007 to 11
percent in FY2014. This implies an improved utilization of existing capacities as the power trade
ensures that surplus regions/states can easily transfer generated power to deficit regions/states
when needed. After July 2012 grid failure, CERC has tightened the grid frequency band44 to put a
check on overdrawing by various constituents and hence, ensuring grid security and encouraging
distribution utilities to procure power through contracts in organized markets. Further, the
southern region was also connected synchronously with rest of the National Grid in December
2013. Given these factors, the grid frequency has shown a downward trend but all measures are
being adopted to bring back frequency within the prescribed band. POWERGRID along with
POSOCO are now handling one of the largest transmission networks at a single frequency in the
world.

Other Key Developments at Entity Level
66.    Some other key developments that took place at the entity level during the
implementation of the project are listed:

a. POWERGRID was conferred the ‘Navratna’ status by the GoI in May 2008, implying a
   greater commercial and financial autonomy for the company.
b. POWERGRID entered the capital market with an IPO during FY2008 with 10 percent of
   fresh issue of existing paid-up capital along with the divestment of 5 percent of GoI’s
   shareholding. In the post issue scenario, GoI’s holding stood at 86.36 percent with the
   balance held by the public.
c. In FY2011, POWERGRID floated an FPO comprising fresh issue of 10 percent paid-up
   capital along with divestment of 10 percent of GoI’s shareholding. The FPO received an
   overwhelming response and was oversubscribed by 14.84 times, reflecting the sound
   corporate governance policies of the company. In the post issue scenario, GoI’s holding
   stands at 69.42 percent, with the balance being held by the public.
d. In December 2013, POWERGRID again issued its second FPO constituting 17 percent of
   existing paid-up capital and was oversubscribed 6.7 times. The shares are listed on the
   National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange.
e. In February 2009, POWERGRID established and commissioned the NLDC as the apex
   structure for national grid management and operation. According to POWERGRID, this four-
   tier system is a complex and globally unique mode of grid operation. It minimizes grid
   disturbances and facilitates quick restoration in case of failure. Further, NLDC & RLDCs,
   now being managed by POSOCO, are upgraded and modernized continuously to establish an
   effective grid management infrastructure in the country.
f. POSOCO was constituted as a fully owned subsidiary of POWERGRID in March 2009. This
   step represented the beginning of the separation of the role of the system operator from that
   of the CTU, as the owner of transmission assets.
g. POWERGRID’s ESPP were adopted by the World Bank as a pilot under UCS (OP 4.00).
   This was formally adopted under PSDP V.
h. POWERGRID developed a CSR policy enabling it to contribute to the society at large with
   emphasis on socioeconomic and integral development of areas/communities primarily in and
   around its areas of operations. They have carried out various community development
   activities such as skill development and capacity building, livelihood generation, health care,
   education, plantation, sanitation, drinking water, besides infrastructure developments like
   classrooms, roads, and community center.
i. POWERGRID is the first among the Bank’s clients in India to have prepared a Sustainability
   Report in 2009, covering its environmental and social performance. The second such report
   was published in March 2013, providing all stakeholders a clear picture of POWERGRID’s
   contributions to sustainable development through its activities.
j. During FY2013, POWERGRID also obtained its international credit ratings for the first time
   and were initially rated by S&P Rating Services and Fitch Ratings at ‘BBB - (outlook
   negative)’ consistent with India’s sovereign rating. Fitch Ratings was later upgraded to ‘BBB
   - (outlook stable)’ and stands true for FY2014.
k. In July 2012, POWERGRID also signed loan agreements with International Finance
   Corporation (IFC) and Infrastructure Crisis Facility Debt Pool Limited Liability Partnership
   (ICF Debt Pool LLP) for a total amount of US$270 million.
l. In January 2013, the company made its maiden foray into foreign currency markets and
   raised US$500 million through issuance of 10-year foreign currency notes at an attractive


                                                        60
     coupon rate of 3.875 percent per year and was over-subscribed nearly 19 times. The bonds
     are listed in Singapore stock exchange.
m.   On December 31, 2013, POWERGRID achieved a milestone by interconnecting the Southern
     Grid synchronously with the rest of the National Grid through commissioning of the 765 kV
     Raichur (Karnataka)-Solapur (Maharashtra) S/C line. With this, ‘One Nation-One Grid-One
     Frequency’ has become a reality. This has facilitated not only in augmentation of
     transmission capacity by 2,100 MW.
n.   Experienced with construction of 765 kV Extra-High-Voltage AC (EHVAC) and ±500 kV
     HVDC transmission system, POWERGRID has been working on next higher transmission
     voltages of ±800 kV HVDC and 1,200 kV Ultra-High-Voltage AC (UHVAC) system to
     achieve efficient utilization of RoW and increased power transfer capability for transfer of
     bulk power over long distances. In this direction, ±800 kV, 6,000 MW HVDC lines, one from
     Biswanath Chariyali (Assam) to Agra (Uttar Pradesh) of about 1,750 km length and another
     from Champa (Chhattisgarh) to Kurukshetra (Haryana) of about 1,400 km length (latter
     funded under PSDP V) are under construction. Further, POWERGRID has successfully
     established 1,200 kV Test Station at Bina including test-charge of 1,200 kV single and D/C
     transmission lines as a pilot project. Construction of 1,200 kV upgradable transmission line
     from Wardha to Aurangabad (approximately 350 km length, to be initially charged at 400 kV
     level) is also underway and shall be charged after field trials.
o.   POWERGRID is also playing a catalyst role in formation of the SAARC grid for effective
     utilization of resources for mutual benefits. Transmission links with Bhutan and Nepal
     already exist and are being further strengthened. Interconnection between India and
     Bangladesh through 500 MW HVDC back-to-back terminals along with Bheramara
     (Bangladesh)-Baharampur (India) 400 kV D/C line was commissioned in September 2013,
     enabling power flow of the order of 500 MW from India to Bangladesh.
p.   Recognizing the importance of integrating renewable energy resources with the grid,
     POWERGRID took the lead and developed a comprehensive master plan for grid integration
     of renewable generation capacity addition of about 33 GW envisaged during the 12th Five
     Year Plan through Green Energy Corridors across India. The company has also evolved an
     integrated plan (under review) for desert power development (Desert Power India – 2050),
     for harnessing the huge renewable energy potential of about 300 GW, primarily solar and
     wind at desert/cold desert waste land in Kutch, Thar, Lahaul and Spiti, and Ladakh areas by
     2050. The plan includes establishment and grid integration of renewables through hybrid
     transmission corridors utilizing HVDC (including voltage-source converter [VSC] based) as
     well as 1,200 kV UHV AC/ High temperature superconductor technologies.
q.   POWERGRID has developed a Smart Grid pilot project in the country through open
     collaboration at Puducherry. The company has been appointed as advisor-cum-consultant for
     implementation of the Smart Grid project by eight utilities during FY2013/14. In addition,
     POWERGRID has been indigenously developing smart products like smart meter, data
     concentrator unit, home energy management system, micro grid controller, smart cap
     utilizing solar energy, and active filter for varied applications.
r.   The company continues to excel over its competitors under TBCB. As on October 31, 2014,
     the company has secured 5 transmission projects, which is more than 30 percent of the
     projects floated under TBCB since January 2011 when the regime was changed from cost-
     plus basis to TBCB.
s.   POWERGRID diversified into the telecom business under the brand name ‘POWERTEL’ to
     expand its revenue stream by installing overhead optic fiber network using OPGW,
     leveraging its existing countrywide transmission infrastructure. The company has an all-India
     broadband telecom network of about 29,640 km, providing connectivity to all metros, major
     cities, towns, and state capitals, including remote areas of the North-Eastern Region and



                                                61
   covering about 317 Points of Presence (PoP) across the country from where services are
   being rendered.
t. POWERGRID was one of the implementing partners of the NKN, a scheme devised by the
   GoI to provide a unified high-speed network backbone for educational institutions in India
   such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc),
   and the scheme is operational.
u. POWERGRID is also a member of the Advisory Body and Core Committee of the National
   Optical Fiber Network (NOFN) project, envisaged by the GoI for providing connectivity to
   all the 250,000 GPs in the country through utilizing existing optical fiber facilities of Bharat
   Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), POWERGRID, and RailTel Corporation of India Limited to
   connect the GPs.
v. During past decade, POWERGRID has spread its global footprint in more than 18 countries
   and is emerging as a strong player in the transmission sector in South Asia, the Middle-east,
   and Africa. The company has also joined hands with other leading power sector companies to
   offer integrated solutions for generation, transmission, and distribution to international power
   utilities.

                             Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.       As in the appraisal methodology (see PAD annex 9), investment schemes for PSDP IV
are also considered as stand-alone projects with their own technical parameters, financing, and
implementation arrangements. The ex post economic and financial justification consisted of the
determination the ERR and RoE. Since PSDP IV AF funded part of the schemes already funded
under PSDP IV, no separate analysis was run at its appraisal. For schemes included through
restructuring, especially SRSS 13, such analysis was carried out during review and approval of
the PIP. For the scheme shifted from PSDP V (System Strengthening in Western Region for
Sasan UMPP), the analysis was run at its appraisal.

2.      ERR and RoE for the investment schemes at completion. These were calculated using
actual costs and revenues based on applicable tariffs. The sections below provide details on all the
schemes (original and additional schemes) funded under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF but it is
important to take note of the following:

     a. There was a change in the regulatory regime since appraisal of the project. The CERC
        has announced new tariff regulations applicable from 2014 to 2019.
     b. Since the SRSS 13 scheme is still under implementation, its ERR and RoE at completion
        could not be calculated and hence are not included below.
     c. The actual project cost for the economic and financial analysis covers the funds spent
        under PSDP III, PSDP IV, and PSDP IV AF for the schemes which were partly funded
        under more than one project.
Economic Analysis

3.      As mentioned above, during appraisal, the economic analysis of only five core schemes
(Balia-Bhiwadi, EWTC, WRSS II, ERSS I, and NWTC) was carried out. The economic analysis
below also presents the analysis for one additional scheme (System Strengthening in Western
Region for Sasan UMPP).

4.     The same methodology as used during the appraisal was adopted to carry out the
economic analysis at completion as well. During the project implementation period, the tariff
norms as issued by the CERC were revised in 2014 effective over a period of five years (2014–
19). Any scheme of a centrally owned utility that is to be commissioned during this period has to
apply CERC tariff norms. Revenue from tariff as calculated under CERC tariff norms 2014 (at
completion) are almost at par with CERC tariff norms 2009 (at appraisal).

5.       Since all schemes under the project are system strengthening schemes, benefits from
them have been calculated as the value of the reduction in system losses. Based on load flow
studies, at appraisal, POWERGRID had estimated the total reduction in transmission losses that
would accrue from all the five schemes to be about 1,138 MW under peak load conditions. To
obtain the average loss reduction, a loss load factor46 of 0.53 is applied to the loss reduction under
peak load conditions. Since the load flow studies for each line are carried out during transmission
planning, the MW of power saved by implementing these lines was assumed at the same level as


46
  Loss load factor is defined as the ratio of actual losses over a period to the losses obtained under peak loading
conditions for the entire period. It is used to convert peak energy losses into average energy losses. It is calculated
using the following empirical formula: Loss Load Factor = 0.2 x Load Factor + 0.8 x (Load Factor)2.




                                                             63
at the time of appraisal or at the time of PIP approval. For valuing these (physical) benefits, an
economic price/value of electricity has been derived based on the opportunity cost of the energy
saved, for which average cost of alternate supply (here, from thermal generation plants) in
respective regions of the scheme was considered. At the time of appraisal this cost was found to
be INR 3.62/kWh whereas at ICR, the average cost of generation projects is between INR 3.3 per
unit to INR 3.7 per unit.

6.      ERR calculations were based on certain assumptions (discussed later) and their values
were compared with the opportunity cost of the capital of 12 percent for projects to be financed in
India. The ERR, after completion of the schemes, was calculated using the same methodology
that was adopted during the appraisal. The scheme-wise ERR at the time of appraisal is compared
with that at completion; two cases: (a) base case and (b) extreme case where cost escalation by 20
percent, delay in project commissioning by two years, RoE is lower by 1 percent, and foreign
exchange rate is lower by 10 percent.

                                                                  kV transformer and reactor took

7.      As can be observed from the table, three of the six schemes outperformed the base case
scenario. Also, the ERR for all schemes is higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12 percent),
except for ERSS I that got delayed by more than 3.5 years due to severe RoW issues.

8.       The Balia-Bhiwadi HVDC bipole transmission system has facilitated the transfer of bulk
power across the regions. Even though the commissioning of the entire scheme (HVDC line, Pole
I, and Pole II) was deferred due to a delay in the manufacturing of converter transformers by the
contractor at the Bhiwadi terminal, commissioning of the HVDC line along with the poles has
facilitated exchange of bulk power between the Northern and Eastern Regions. Most generation
projects were/are planned in the Eastern Region whereas the load centers are located in the
Western Region. Bridging the demand-supply gap through this line has resulted in an ERR of



                                                64
15.05 percent compared to 14.83 percent estimated during appraisal for this scheme. The
calculations included the elements funded under PSDP III also.

9.       Regarding the NWTC, the ERR of 23.54 percent is higher than the 21.98 percent
estimated under the base case during appraisal. The two interregional lines under this scheme,
funded under PSDP III, have enhanced the interregional power transfer capacity of the National
Grid by almost 2,100 MW. These lines along with the extension of the substations have also
brought stability and reliability to the Indian power system. The importance of this scheme is thus
reflected in a very robust ERR. The calculations included the elements funded under PSDP III
also.

10.      The ERR for the EWTC scheme at appraisal was 17.83 percent at appraisal compared to
19.39 percent at completion, hence outperforming the former estimates. The scheme has
strengthened the existing Rourkela-Raipur interregional transmission corridor, facilitating more
reliable and secure power transfer from the Eastern to Western Region. The interregional link
along with installation of FSC has augmented the interregional transmission capacity of the
National Grid by 1,400 MW.

11.     The WRSS II scheme is a cluster of four sets of transmission lines of which two sets were
to be implemented by POWERGRID and the other two sets by 100 percent private players. All
substations under all sets were to be implemented by POWERGRID. The ERR at completion
(15.51 percent) is lower than at appraisal because the scheme was delayed by almost 2.5 years
due to delays in forest clearance. This line is also being charged at 400 kV, later to be upgraded to
765 kV.

12.      The ERSS I scheme had an ERR of 15.82 percent at appraisal but could only touch 10.86
percent at completion. This is lower than the hurdle rate of 12 percent. The reason was delay in
completion of project by more than 3.5 years. This was due to delays in obtaining forest clearance
for various lines under the project from April 2009–April 2011 (varied from 22 to 42 months).
The longest was taken by the Baripada-Mendhasal line, for which the proposal for forest
clearance was submitted on February 28, 2008. However, the final clearance was received almost
after 3.5 years (on August 25, 2011).

13.      System Strengthening for Western Region for Sasan UMPP had an ERR of 21.1 percent
at appraisal but has only 12.96 percent ERR at completion due to delay in implementation of the
scheme by 22 months. The reasons for this delay were (a) delays in land acquisition at the Indore
substation and (b) the Shunt Reactor Package, which could be awarded in February 2012 after 23
months from initiation of procurement process (Notice to Invite Tender [NIT] issued in March
2010) as it took time for formulation of suitable qualification requirements in the contracts for
setting up R&M facilities for 765 kV transformers and reactors by the vendors, especially foreign
bidders.

14.     The above schemes enabled higher exchange of power from surplus to deficit regions and
strengthened the transmission network making it reliable

Financial Analysis of Schemes

16.     The financial analysis is presented for all the schemes except for SRSS 13. The rate of
RoE was considered as a proxy for financial analysis of the schemes. The same proxy was used
during the appraisal as well. The RoE of the schemes has been calculated using the same
methodology as during the appraisal. The scheme-wise RoE at the time of appraisal is compared
with that at completion across two cases: (a) base case and (b) extreme case where cost escalation
by 20 percent, delay in project commissioning by two years, RoE is lower by 1 percent, and
foreign exchange rate is lower by 10 percent.

17.     In all the cases, the RoE was much higher than the base case. Among others, the main
reason for this is the revision in CERC tariff norms, as mentioned in the section above. Under the
revised tariff norms, RoE has been increased from 14 percent (at appraisal) to 15.5 percent
(current tariff regulations). All the schemes have an RoE that is higher than 15.5 percent. Thus,
the schemes are financially robust.

Financial Analysis of Entity

19.        The financial analysis at the entity level was carried out at the appraisal and completion
stages using the same principles. Table 3.5 lays out the actual financial details at the entity level.
POWERGRID has been a profit-making entity since its inception and the legacy carried over
during the PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF II implementation period as well. Net profit increased from
US$202 million in 2007 by more than 3.5 times to US$737 million in 2014. The main financial
risk to POWERGRID is the risk of nonpayment by off-taking utilities. The risk of recovering past
debts has been mitigated through the signing of tripartite agreements between the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI), state governments, and the GoI. Under this securitization scheme, past debts were
securitized against the tax free bonds valid up to 2016. In addition, POWERGRID has adopted
the Letter of Credit mechanism to ensure payment of current monthly bills by the off-taking
utilities.

20.     Even though the regulated RoE has increased from 14 to 15.5 percent, the RoE at entity
level was at 13 percent in 2014. This is mainly due to the huge capital expenditure that stood at
US$4,324 million in 2014 in response to an increasing demand and need for supporting the
transmission network to transfer power between power surplus and power deficit regions.

           Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Introduction

1.       POWERGRID, the CTU of India and a ‘Navratna’ Public Sector Enterprise (PSE)
operating under MoP, plays a strategic role in the Indian power sector. POWERGRID continues
to contribute directly to economic development of the country by strengthening and establishing
the National Grid comprising interstate and interregional transmission network for reliable and
secure transfer of power from the generating stations to the load centers.

2.      POWERGRID has been a profit-making company since its inception. In FY2014,
POWERGRID achieved a turnover of about INR 157.21 billion (US$2.6 billion), net profit of
INR 44.97 billion (US$737 million) and fixed assets of INR 965.04 billion (US$15.8 billion)47.
POWERGRID is a listed company, with institutional investors and public holding of 42.10
percent and the balance 57.90 percent by the GoI.

3.      POWERGRID has planned a capital investment of more than INR 1,000 billion for
development of interstate transmission system during XII Plan (2012–17). The company has an
excellent credit rating with financial institutions and is thereby placed in a comfortable position in
terms of resource mobilization. As at the end of March 2014, POWERGRID had established a
transmission network of about 106,804 ckm of transmission lines along with 184 EHV AC and
DC substations with transformation capacity of 205,923 MVA spread across the country. The
company has been consistently maintaining the availability of this huge transmission network at
over 99 percent and wheels about 50 percent of total power generated in the country on its
network.

4.       The company has established a strong and reliable National Grid in phased manner to
facilitate optimum utilization of generating resources, conservation of eco-sensitive ‘right of way’,
and for having flexibility to accommodate uncertainty of generation plans. On December 31,
2013, POWERGRID achieved a landmark by interconnecting the Southern grid synchronously
with rest of the National Grid making ‘One Nation-One Grid-One Frequency’ a reality.

5.       POWERGRID has been instrumental in providing efficient, reliable, and smooth grid
operation and management in the country. Since 2009, the grid management and operation has
been entrusted to POSOCO, a fully owned subsidiary of POWERGRID. POSOCO with its state-
of-the-art ULDC facilities carries out proficient, consistent, and transparent grid operation and
management in the country. During FY2014, to meet the demands in the country, about 78.38 BU
of interregional energy transfer was facilitated, across the nation using pan-India interregional
transmission links and modernized RLDCs.

Association with the World Bank

6.        Since its inception, POWERGRID has been associating with the Bank and undertaken
many critical transmission projects in its association, which have become the major backbone for
the Indian power sector. With the Bank’s support, POWERGRID successfully established the
National Grid, open access in transmission, modernization of Load Despatch and Communication
facilities, and establishment of the NLDC. An important landmark—synchronous interconnection


47
     At an exchange rate of US$1 = INR 61.




                                                 85
of the National Grid—has been achieved by commissioning of the Bank-funded (PSDP V)
Raichur (Karnataka)-Sholapur (Maharashtra) 765 kV S/C line in December 2013, thereby
achieving the mission of ‘One Nation-One Grid-One Frequency’.

7.      During the company’s formative years, the Bank was the first multilateral lending agency
to support it with funding of transmission projects. Since then, POWERGRID has availed the
following loans from the Bank:

       a. Northern Region Transmission Project (NRTP): US$475 million, closed in
            September 2000;
       b.   First Power Sector Development Project (PSDP I): US$350 million, closed in
            December 2000;
       c.   Second Power Sector Development Project (PSDP II): US$450 million, closed in
            June 2006;
       d.   Third Power Sector Development Project (PSDP III): US$400 million, closed in July
            2011;
       e.   Fourth Power Sector Development Project (PSDP IV): US$600 million, closed in
            July 2014;
       f.   Additional Financing for PSDP IV (PSDP IV AF): US$400 million, closed in July
            2014; and
       g.   Fifth Power Sector Development Project (PSDP-V): US$1,000 million, loan closing
            scheduled in May 2017.

8.     Association with the Bank has led to marked improvement in the business process of
POWERGRID, especially in the field of environment sustainability, institutional development,
procurement, and financial management.

9.      The PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF loans closed in July 2014 and the following sections
cover various details about the loans.

PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF Loans – An Introduction

10.      A loan of US$1.4 billion from the Bank was availed by POWERGRID in three tranches
for funding its various transmission system projects. The first tranche of US$400 million was
availed under the PSDP III loan which closed in July 2011. ICR Report (No. ICR1862) was
finalized and disclosed on January 30, 2012. The second and third tranches of US$600 million
and US$400 million have been availed under the PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF loans, both of which
closed on July 31, 2014.

11.    All the schemes funded under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF are complete except the SRSS
13 scheme, whose implementation has been adversely affected due to severe RoW problems.

Project Development Objective

12.     The objective of the loans was to strengthen India’s electricity transmission system in
order to increase reliable power exchanges between the regions and the states. ‘Growth in Power
Exchanges between Regions’ was agreed as the key indicator for measuring performance against
the PDO. Further, growth in transmission capacity (in ckm) and growth in transformation
capacity (in MVA) were also agreed to be monitored to achieve the objective. The progress of the
funded elements was continuously monitored through POWERGRID’s own internal mechanism



                                              86
and also through periodic reviews by the Bank missions. The Performance Monitoring Indicators
together with their achievement are as listed in the table:

objection was to be taken from every gram sabha (at the village level) for all the proposals involving diversion of forest
land under the Forest (Conservation) Act, which resulted in delay in obtaining forest clearance.
** As all the indicators have outperformed their original targets (as per the PAD), the targets were revised upward for
FY2014 after restructuring of the loans through Amendments dated May 23, 2014, to Loan Agreements.

Growth in Power Exchanges between
the Regions (Outcome Indicator)                              Figure 7. 1: Growth in Power Exchange

13.      During             FY2014,
POWERGRID’s strong transmission
network and modernized RLDCs have
facilitated about 78,384 MU of power
exchange across regions. A growth of
about 40,634 MU (107.64 percent) in
power exchange across regions has
been observed in comparison to
baseline FY2006/07 of 37,750 MU.

14.     Under the PSDP IV loan, an interregional line, the 400 kV Rourkela-Raigarh-Raipur D/C
line has been implemented. This line has contributed an addition of about 1,400 MW to the
interregional power transmission capacity of the National Grid.

Development of National Grid Leading to Formation of an All-India Grid

15.     The process of setting up the National Grid was initiated with the formation of
POWERGRID. Development of the National Grid started with the establishment of limited
capacity asynchronous links (through HVDC systems) between the regions for transfer of
operational surplus power from one region to other. With the establishment of large capacity pit
head power plants having beneficiaries in other regions, AC and HVDC bipole links were
implemented between regions.



                                                           87
                                          Figure 7. 2: Inter-Regional Power Transmission Capacity
16.      In March 2003, the NER and                                 (MW)
ER grids were synchronously connected
with      the    WR       grid    through
commissioning of the 400 kV Raipur-
Rourkela transmission line, with
cumulative capacity of 50,000 MW. In
August 2006, these three regional grids
were interconnected with the NR grid
with the commissioning of the 400 kV
Muzaffarpur-Gorakhpur line under
‘Transmission System associated with
Tala       HEP       and       East-North
Interconnector’, the first transmission
project implemented under PPP. The
Muzaffarpur-Gorakhpur 400 kV D/C quad line with fixed series capacitor and TCSC has added
2,000 MW to the ER-NR interregional transmission capacity. By the end of the 10th Plan, with
the commissioning of one circuit of the Patna-Balia 400 kV D/C line between ER and NR and
commissioning of the Agra-Gwalior 765 kV S/C line (initially charged at 400 kV) between NR
and WR, the interregional capacity was enhanced by about 2,200 MW. Another 765 kV S/C line
between Agra-Gwalior (initially charged at 400 kV) and the 400 kV Kankroli-Zerda D/C line,
funded under PSPD III, were commissioned during March to April 2009. Commissioning of these
links resulted in a direct high-capacity synchronous interconnection between NR and WR while
providing parallel paths interconnecting two regional grids. The interregional power transmission
capacity of the National Grid was augmented to 27,750 MW by the end of the 11th Plan (March
31, 2012).

17.     Before December 31, 2013, four regional grids were operating in synchronous mode as a
single system whereas the SR grid was interconnected asynchronously through HVDC links. On
December 31, 2013, the SR grid was also synchronously connected with the rest of the National
Grid through commissioning of the 765 kV Raichur-Solapur S/C line by POWERGRID, funded
under PSDP V.

18.     With the setting up of IPP plants in resource rich areas, the focus of planning the
generation and the transmission system in the country has shifted from regional self-sufficiency
toward optimization of utilization of resources on a nationwide basis. Thus a number of 765 kV
D/C and ±800 kV HVDC interregional links are being implemented as a part of high-capacity
transmission corridors associated with IPPs in the country.

19.     As on September 30, 2014, the cumulative interregional power transmission capacity of
the National Grid stands at about
                                             Figure 7. 3: Growth in Transmission Capacity
44,250 MW, which is planned to be
further augmented to more than
76,000 MW by end of the 12th Plan
period.


20.     Growth in transmission
capacity. As on March 31, 2014,
POWERGRID owns and operates
about 106,804 ckm of EHV
transmission lines. An addition of


                                               88
about 47,404 ckm (79.80 percent) has been achieved in transmission capacity with respect to
baseline FY2007 of 59,400 ckm. Transmission lines covered under these loans have contributed
about 6,23048 ckm of 400 kV lines
toward    transmission   capacity     Figure 7. 4: Growth in Transformation Capacity
addition.

21.      Growth in transformation
capacity. As on March 31, 2014,
transformation     capacity       of
POWERGRID’s network is about
205,923 MVA. An addition of
about 146,523 MVA (246.67
percent) has been achieved in
transformation capacity with respect
to baseline FY2007 of 59,400 MVA.
Under these loans, about 8,000
MVA transformation capacity has
been added.

22.     It should be noted that the PDO has been achieved successfully, and all indicators
exceeded their targets as agreed in the PAD. All the transmission elements covered , the loans
except the elements covered under SRSS 13 have been completed progressively well before the
loan closing date of July 31, 2014. Implementation of SRSS 13 has been adversely affected due to
RoW issues along the transmission lines, which is beyond the control of the executing agency,
namely, POWERGRID. Further, POWERGRID has already achieved disbursement of 96.10
percent under PSDP IV and has fully used the PSDP IV AF loan.

Financial Covenants under the Loans

23.     POWERGRID has comfortably met all the financial covenants under the loans; the year-
wise details are given in the table:

                                 Table 7.2: Status of Financial Covenants
                Covenant                 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014
 POWERGRID shall take all

exceeding an amount equivalent to
its billing for transmission and
other regulated services for the
preceding three months.

24.     Thus, POWERGRID has satisfactorily completed these loans by successfully achieving
the PDO, meeting all the financial covenants, and adequately addressing social and environment
aspects while implementing the projects under the loans.

Project Design

25.     The project design was well-aligned with the underlying objectives and focused on
addressing capacity building for increased exchange of power across the regions. To achieve this,
the +500 kV, 2,500 MW Balia-Bhiwadi HVDC Bipole link, 765/400 kV level high-capacity
transmission systems, and interregional/intraregional grid strengthening schemes were planned
under the loans.

26.      To achieve the required objectives under the loan, various pre-implementation activities,
such as site selection, survey and soil investigation, initiation for forest clearance, procurement
process, and funding tie-up, were initiated concurrently so that sufficient time would be available
for executing the project. Procurement being one of the vital parts of project design, the entire
scope of various project(s) was broken down into suitable contract packages keeping in mind the
sources, competitiveness, and ultimate dovetailing of all the contract packages for their proper
integration to achieve the project objectives.

Procurement Summary

27.     Procurement for the packages (number as in table 7.3) under these loans were carried out
in accordance with Bank guidelines and provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreements. Further,
bidding documents for all type of packages were standardized, resulting in a smoother
procurement process and leading to streamlined implementation of the project. In fact,
POWERGRID has harmonized its bidding documents across packages, irrespective of the source
of funding.

Project Implementation

28.      The schemes under the loans were designed, engineered, and implemented by
POWERGRID. All the schemes covered under the loans have been completed except the SRSS
13 scheme, implementation of which has been adversely affected due to RoW problems in
Madhugiri and Yelahanka areas (Karnataka State) along the transmission lines, which is beyond
the control of POWERGRID. The detailed status of implementation of projects is given at the end
of this annex.

Loan Utilization

29.      As a result of rigorous monitoring of the project implementation, expeditious resolution
of various issues, timely submission of disbursement claims, and continuous guidance and
support from the Bank, POWERGRID has fully use PSDP IV AF and about 96.10 percent
utilization under PSDP IV has been achieved till date. Project-wise details are given in the table

Benefits of Projects under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF

30.     Implementation of the +500 kV HVDC Bipole and other 765 kV and 400 kV
transmission elements under these loans have facilitated strengthening of the National Grid
through enhancement of interregional and intraregional power transmission capacity. The benefits
show that significant transmission capacity has been installed, that is, about 6,23049 ckm at 400
kV level and about 8,000 MVA transformation capacity along with new 400/220 kV substations
at Pune, Solapur, and Parli and the 765/400 kV substation at Indore apart from extensions of
numerous substations. The interregional transmission line, namely, the 400 kV D/C Rourkela-
Raigarh-Raipur, under the EWTC Strengthening Scheme (under PSDP IV) has resulted in
enhancement of interregional power transfer capacity by about 1,400 MW.

Operational Experience

31.     All major investments financed by these loans have resulted in further strengthening of
the National Grid and enhanced its reliability, safety, and security. Transmission assets of the


49
     Excludes about 549 ckm under SRSS 13.

percent.

Best Practices under the Loans

32.     Procurement. Under this loan and in line with the Bank’s procedures, procurement for
transmission system projects was carried out, which were either uniquely positioned or pertained
to emerging transmission technologies in India. For example, the Balia-Bhiwadi Transmission
System, a long distance (approximately 800 km) bipole HVDC Transmission System for transfer
of 2,500 MW power at ±500 kV voltage level, was a unique project, considering the complexity
of procurement of HVDC Terminal Package. Similarly, procurement for certain packages in other
transmission projects involved procurement of plant and equipment and goods for 765 kV voltage
level, which was an emerging voltage level in transmission systems in India at that time.

     Initiative for increased conductor and insulator vendor participation. To increase
      participation of vendors for conductors and insulators, POWERGRID, in association with the
      Bank, organized vendor conferences in April 2009 and September 2010. Such conferences
      have resulted in more participation and competitive prices.
     Conference with prospective bidders on common mistakes/discrepancies during bidding. In
      September 2010, POWERGRID, in association with the Bank, also organized a vendor
      conference regarding common mistakes or discrepancies during bidding. This conference has
      resulted in significant improvement in the bids being submitted and helped in reducing delays
      in bid evaluation on account of common errors or inconsistencies in the bids.

33.    Retroactive financing. Under the loans, the provision for retroactive financing for up to
20 percent of the loan amount—Section IV (B) (1) of the Loan Agreements—resulted in
immediate disbursement of about US$57 million under PSDP IV and about US$26 million under
PSDP IV AF.

34.     Restructuring of loans to optimize utilization. During the implementation stage, there
have been significant savings in the PSPD IV, PSDP IV AF, and PSDP V loans due to (a) ICB
process, (b) modification/deletion of some schemes according to system requirements, and (c)
depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. The restructuring of the loans was carried
out with support from the Bank and the Department of Economic Affairs, MoF. This has helped
achieve optimal utilization of these loans. The restructuring of loans included new schemes and
swapping of some schemes between PSDP IV AF and PSDP V keeping in view their
commissioning schedule vis-à-vis loan closing dates and including an additional expenditure
category - Works, Installation, and Erection. The restructuring concerned the following
components:

      a.   PSDP IV (Loan No. 4890-IN)
      •    Inclusion of the new scheme, SRSS 13;
      •    Revision in the Performance Monitoring Indicators; and
      •    Inclusion of Works, Installation, and Erection under categories eligible for funding, in
           addition to Goods.

      b. PSDP IV AF (Loan No. 7593-IN)
      • Shifting of one scheme, namely, System Strengthening in WR for Sasan UMPP, from
         PSDP V to PSDP IV AF. At the time of restructuring of the loan, major scope under the
         scheme was completed and about 88 percent of committed loan amount under this project



                                                 92
        (about US$78 million) was disbursed. Thus, the shifting of project helped full utilization
        of the PSDP IV AF loan.
    •   Shifting of two schemes, namely, Northern Region System Strengthening Scheme XXIV
        and Southern Region System Strengthening XVII, from the PSDP IV AF to PSDP V loan,
        keeping in view their expected commissioning beyond the PSDP IV AF loan closing date
        of July 31, 2014.
    •   Revision in the Performance Monitoring Indicators.
    •   Inclusion of Works, Installation, and Erection under categories eligible for funding, in
        addition to Goods.

35.      Environmental and social. POWERGRID is committed to the goal of sustainable
development and conservation of nature and natural resources. While continually improving its
management systems, accessing specialist knowledge and introducing state-of-the-art and
internationally proven technologies, POWERGRID strictly follows the basic principle of
avoidance, minimization, and mitigation in dealing with environmental and social issues; where
necessary, restoration and enhancement is also undertaken. Based on these principles,
POWERGRID, in association with the Bank, took a proactive approach and developed a
comprehensive ESPP in April 1998 to address the environment and socioeconomic issues arising
from activities for its projects, after a wide consultation involving stakeholders, the general public,
representatives from MoP, MoEF, CEA, State Electricity Boards, allied organizations, academia,
NGOs, multilateral funding agencies, and PAP from its projects through a process of National
Consultation. Since then, POWERGRID has been successfully implementing the provisions of
ESPP in all its projects irrespective of the type of funding, which clearly demonstrated that it is
achieving the highest standard with respect to environment and social safeguards comparable to
any utilities in India and at the international level. Moreover, several good environmental
practices have been institutionalized, including technical innovations to minimize environmental
impact. The project exhibited good rehabilitation and resettlement practices and community
development programs. Some of them are listed:

   POWERGRID has developed its corporate ESPP. Transmission line routes were selected on
    the above-mentioned principles and routes involving less forest/wildlife area were selected
    for detailed survey. Due to implementation of the ESPP, forest area involvement has reduced
    drastically from 6 percent in 1998 to less than 2 percent in 2013.
   POWERGRID has reduced wildlife area involvement by renovating its existing lines into
    multicircuit lines. In the case of the Durgapur-Jamshedpur line (funding under PSDP IV),
    POWERGRID accommodated 1.25 km of line passing through the Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary
    on multicircuit towers in the existing RoW of the Maithan-Jamshedpur line by replacing the
    existing towers with multicircuit towers to accommodate both lines and thereby avoiding
    fresh impact on flora and fauna in the sanctuary area. Likewise, for the Baripada-Mendhasal
    line of ERSS-I (funding under PSDP IV), POWERGRID selected the route involving
    minimum area (about 0.552 ha only) traversing through the Chandaka Wildlife sanctuary.
    POWERGRID was able to pass the Chandaka Wildlife Sanctuary overhead using
    tall/extended towers without any tree felling or building towers inside the sanctuary area. The
    lines under which forest area was reduced by following the principle of avoidance are as
    listed in the table:

                                                                    route.

   For optimization of land requirement for substations, land management practices were
    followed in consultation with engineering and site representatives, to reduce the area of
    requirement. Typically, 20 to 60 ha of land is required for constructing a substation,
    depending upon the type and voltage level. Considering the limited availability of land,
    POWERGRID has constantly upgraded and improvised by investing in new technologies like
    GIS, which requires less land in comparison to the traditional AIS. Following the principle of
    minimization to conserve the precious land resources, POWERGID has taken a policy
    decision to have a GIS substation in city area and to install multicircuit towers around 1-km
    radius of all new substations.
   Active participation of stakeholders, including PAP, is ensured during project implementation.
    Public consultation/information has been made an integral part of the project cycle and the
    public is informed about the project at every stage of execution and their grievances, if any,
    are resolved as soon as possible. Moreover, public consultation/meetings are undertaken at
    every stage of execution, ranging from survey and construction to commissioning of the
    transmission line and during preparation and finalization of the RAP for substations.
   Participation of women in finalizing RAP has been ensured at every stage of the process.
    They have participated in various informal meetings, focused group discussions, and public
    consultations. Their opinions and the priorities set by them have been considered. In public
    consultations, PAP along with villagers/GP members participated and gave their
    consent/priority for primarily taking up Community Development (CD) works. Hence, the
    activities taken up for village development are priority based and are useful for all. Details in
    respect of women’s participation during the public consultation held on the draft RAP at
    various substations is given in the table:

   Awareness and training programs on protection of worker's health and safety is conducted
    regularly at sites. Safety regulations/manuals are included in bidding documents and guides
    provisions for workers’ health and safety.
   POWERGRID has a dedicated unit to oversee all health and safety aspects of its project and
    has framed guidelines and checklists for workers’ safety as its personnel are exposed to live
    EHV apparatus and transmission lines.
   POWERGRID has taken proactive measures to reduce or arrest leakage of SF6 gas used in
    circuit breakers (though SF6 gas leakage is not a major issue) through implementation of a
    greenhouse gas reduction plan. This includes measures like installation of halogen gas leak
    detectors and gas pressure monitors in all circuit breakers, connected to the control room to
    raise an alarm in case of any leakage and pressure drop and strict checking at the store level
    for issuing SF6 gas.
   To develop surrounding and community resources in the affected villages, POWERGRID has
    been taking up CD works in consultation with villagers.
   Sustainability of RAP and CD works. CD works are finalized through public consultation
    with PAP and villagers. Amenities or assets established under CD works are on the land
    provided by GP and handed over to them with an agreement that maintenance of the created
    amenities will be taken care of by the GP.
        Self-help Groups (SHGs): CD works at the Parli substation had the provision of INR
           10 million for each SHG formed by women from project affected families (PAFs),
           facilitating these women to take loans and use the offered grant money as depository
           asset. The money was used by the group as a guarantee against taking the loan for the
           group members. Most of the group members have reported taking loans and investing
           the money for procurement of goats, cows, and buffalos, which became an additional
           income source for the family and for expansion of their business for regular monthly
           income.
   Hygiene and sanitation are often considered women’s tasks. Hence, the gender-based issue
    regarding sanitation was addressed during the consultation/focus group meetings and
    community toilets have been constructed for women in village at Solapur.
   Rehabilitation Assistance (RA) to those in the vulnerable category, widows, handicapped,
    minors, and the elderly, are provided in the form of monthly income scheme/fixed deposits
    that ensured regular monthly income. The regular income for such vulnerable members of the
    family not only provides a better life but also provides additional security and respect in
    society.
   Several employment avenues were opened up to the local residents with contractors of
    POWERGRID even when POWERGRID’s projects did not envisage significant job
    opportunities to the local residents directly. Contractors engaged by POWERGRID are bound
    by the general conditions of the contract (General Condition No. 13), which stipulates that
    local labor has to be given preference for unskilled and semiskilled jobs and will be informed
    about the same by the project authorities and would be asked to hire unskilled labor from the
    eligible PAP.



                                               95
   The establishment of POWERGRID’s substations is marked by huge investment in the area,
    the impact of which spills over in both the local economy and backward linkages. This has
    led to creation of many indirect job opportunities in terms of small businesses and other
    services. Growth of small businesses and private services, which has come to the fore in
    impact assessment of Bhiwadi, is one such example.

36.      Sustainability reporting. POWERGRID has also taken a lead role by becoming the first
PSE in the Indian power sector to issue a separate environment and social sustainability report in
March 2010 for FY2008/09, based on internationally acclaimed/accepted Global Reporting
Initiative-G3 Guidelines/Index (GRI-www.globalreporting.org), for measuring, disclosing, and
being accountable to internal and external stakeholders for organizational performance toward
sustainable development. Since the reporting cycle is biennial, the second such report was
released in March 2013 for the period 2009–11.

Lessons Learned

37.      Forest clearance. As per guidelines issued by the MoEF, processing time of a proposal
for forest clearance at the state level has been prescribed as 210 days. However, the time taken
normally is very high, which results in delay in implementation of the projects. Similarly, for
transmission lines that pass through wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and notified eco-sensitive
zones, permission of the Supreme Court is essential but is a very cumbersome process. It may be
mentioned here that the forest proposals for such areas are processed only after the approval of
the Supreme Court and the whole process takes more than 2 to 3 years or even more.
POWERGRID has very limited influence on the state forest hierarchy in processing of forest
proposal due to the involvement of many officials. However, POWERGRID’s experiences
indicate that constant persuasion expedites the process. Therefore, POWERGRID has deputed
one officer exclusively for each region for regular follow-up and monitoring of forest proposals at
the state level and the concerned RMoEF to expedite forest clearance.

38.      Forest Right Act. Forest clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, has always
been a lengthy process due to the involvement of different levels starting from the range officer to
the Forest Secretary at the state level and from the Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of Forests
to the minister of Environment and Forests, GoI. The MoEF, vide the circular dated August 3,
2009, mandated the requirement of settlement of FRA in the forest areas to be diverted for non-
forest purposes. The process also includes the written consent of the concerned gram sabha,
which was made compulsory under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers
(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 (FRA 2006) for the entire proposal involving diversion
of forest land under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This further complicated the process of
forest clearance, which has resulted in enormous delays.

39.      As per the MoEF’s letter dated February 5, 2013, consent of the gram sabha was not
required but recommendation of the committees under FRA 2006 was mandatory for issuance of
District Collector’s certificate under FRA 2006. However, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs issued a
circular on March 7, 2014, that FRA 2006 does not exempt any category of projects from consent
of the gram sabha and compliance of the FRA was mandatory before forest land can be diverted.
Failure to do so would be a violation of the law and consent of the gram sabha was required.
POWERGRID again took this up with the MoP to be discussed with the MoEF for delinking of
transmission lines from FRA 2006.

40.     Land acquisition. Availability or acquisition of land for substations is a critical factor for
ensuring timely completion of given project. To expedite the land acquisition process,


                                                 96
POWERGRID has taken the initiative to acquire land on negotiated settlement or consent award
basis. Recently, a policy decision has also been taken for direct purchase of land through a
committee on willing buyer willing seller on market/negotiated rates to avoid public resistance
and court intervention faced during land acquisition.

41.      Typically, 20 to 60 ha of land were required for constructing a substation, depending
upon the type and voltage level. However, keeping in mind availability of land for its projects
which has now become a scarce resource, POWERGRID, apart from adopting new technologies
like GIS which requires less land area (about 25 percent) as against conventional AIS substations,
is also following the practice of land management to minimize the land requirement to the barest
minimum. Following the principle of minimization to conserve precious land resources,
POWERGID has taken a policy decision to have GIS substations in the city area and install multi
circuit towers around 1-km radius of all new substations. A comparison of land area requirement
with the newly adopted technology for conventional AIS and GIS substations is given in this
table:

                Table 7.7: Comparison of Land Requirement for AIS and GIS

No                                                              for AIS            for GIS
 1    765/400 kV substation (typical with 8 diameters in       115 acres           50 acres
      765 kV and 12 diameters in 400 kV)
2     400/220 kV substation (typical with 8 diameters in       35 acres             16 acres
      400 kV and 28 feeders in 220 kV)

42.     Wherever possible, POWERGRID tries to locate substations on government land, waste
land, or non-fertile land to reduce the impacts of land acquisition on PAP. In the absence of
government land, private land, which involves fewer PAP, is acquired.

43.     Right of Way. RoW is one of the major concerns being faced in construction of
transmission lines. Various factors such as high population density, other ongoing infrastructural
developments, and POWERGRID’s duty toward environmental preservation, limit the freedom to
select the most optimum route devoid of RoW issues. To address such issues to the extent
possible, POWERGRID has adopted innovative tower design to reduce the width of the RoW and
has also taken a policy decision to install D/C or multi circuit towers in forests and other
ecologically sensitive areas. This has resulted in huge saving of trees. To address the RoW issues
and to cater to the need of bulk power transfer to distantly located load centers, POWERGRID is
deploying various technologies such as multi circuits, compact and tall towers, High Surge
Impedance Loading Lines, Fixed and Thyristor Controlled Series Compensation, and HTLS
Conductors. POWERGRID is gradually adopting higher voltage levels such as 765 kV/800 kV
and increasing the power carrying capacity of transmission lines (up to 6,000 MW on D/C lines)
for optimizing the RoW without much effect on transmission losses.

44.      Initiatives have been taken for re-conductoring of some of the existing lines such as the
Siliguri-Purnea D/C lines (under PSDP IV AF) with HTLS conductors to enhance their power
carrying capacity. A comparison of RoW requirements for 400 kV and 765 kV transmission lines
is given in the table 7.8:

45.     Increasing operational and maintenance efficiency. The company’s assets have grown
exponentially with the increased number of 765 kV transmission lines in the system.
Geographical spread of assets all over the country, open electricity market, wide variation in
power flow in terms of quantum and direction, increased penetration of renewable generation,
and the need for effective utilization of existing assets have made it a challenging task to maintain
such large power systems with high reliability, safety, and security in real time. Recognizing the
need for effective control on a real-time basis and to improve planning and operations of the
power system as a whole, POWERGRID has adopted various measures:

   Remote operations of substations and creation of maintenance service hub facilities where a
    group of experts of all areas, such as control and protection, switchyard equipment,
    transformer, and reactor, shall be available to for major maintenance of equipment as and
    when required. As of March 2014, there are 51 substations under remote operation and 12
    unmanned substations.
   Adoption of state-of-the-art monitoring techniques for transmission equipment for detection
    of defects at their incipient stage.
   Introduction of aerial patrolling of lines using helicopters for the first time in India in selected
    areas such as deep forests, hilly terrain, and snowbound areas where ground patrolling is
    difficult and very time consuming.
   POWERGRID has undertaken full-scale implementation of WAMS on pan-India basis under
    the Unified Real Time Dynamic State Measurement System (URTDSM) project integrating
    state and central grids with the aim of enhancing efficiency in overall grid management in the
    open electricity market regime.
   With a view to optimize the operation and maintenance manpower and efficiently deploy
    them, POWERGRID is in the process of establishing the National Transmission Asset
    Management Center (NTAMC) at Haryana for centralized remote monitoring, operation, and
    control of substations.

46.     The result of consistent efforts and round-the-clock monitoring is demonstrated through
the company’s high operational performance during the year in terms of transmission system
availability (99.92 percent) and the number of trippings per line (0.56).

Institutional Strengthening

47.    POWERGRID has started an organization-wide ERM framework and ERP toward
improving corporate governance and financial accountability.

48.     ERM framework implementation. POWERGRID has implemented the ERM framework
with the approval of its Board in February 8, 2011. POWERGRID had constituted a Risk
Management Committee (comprising five members: ED-Finance, ED-Corporate Planning, ED-
Human Resource, ED-Western Region, and ED-Commercial). A Chief Risk Officer has been
designated who reports to the Risk Management Committee, which in turn will report to the
Board’s Audit Committee. The ERM framework identifies 24 major risks.

     49.      ERP implementation. ERP is being implemented in POWERGRID under the project
     name ‘Roopantar’. The ERP implementation work is being carried out in partnership with M/s
     TCS, who is deploying an SAP system. The ERP system includes Plant Maintenance (Operation
     and Maintenance); Project System (Project Execution); Material Management (Project and
     Operations); Finance and Control; Human Capital Management (HCM); e-procurement; and
     Sales and Distribution (Commercial) for all the business verticals of POWERGRID, that is,
     Transmission, Telecommunication, and Consultancy. ERP’s pilot deployment at the corporate
     office and in one of the regions (Southern Region-II) has gone live in August 2014. The expected
     benefit from the system is as listed:

        Integrated processes
        Elimination of duplication in work
        Visibility of construction and operations inventory
        Traceability of capital and operations expenditure
        Better controls
        Better reports for faster management decision

     Performance of the World Bank

     50.     POWERGRID acknowledges the active support provided by the Bank during
     administration of the loans and other issues pertaining to procurement, disbursement, and
     safeguards. In view of the huge funding assistance to POWERGRID and also for future
     engagements, POWERGRID would like to provide some suggestions for further improving
     various processes:

     a. Suggestions pertaining to procurement aspects
         Threshold limit. The present limit for ‘prior’ review packages under the Bank’s loan is
          US$25 million. Considering POWERGRID’s exposure to Bank loans and procedures, it is
          suggested that the limit for ‘prior’ review packages be enhanced.

     b. Suggestions pertaining to contracts management on the Bank’s Client Connection site
         The changes in the contract value on account of price variation and amendments to the
          contracts do not getting updated in Client Connection. POWERGRID maintains a database
          of updated contract price and disbursement details and reports this information on a
          periodic basis in the FMRs to the Bank. It is proposed that this information be updated
          regularly in Client Connection by the Bank and permission may be given to the borrower
          to view the information so that both the Bank and POWERGRID can verify it and the
          information can be updated in a timely manner, in case of any discrepancy.
         It will also help in reconciling if there is a proper history of applications under which
          disbursements are made by Bank under each contract. This system will help both the lender
          and the borrower in monitoring the availability of funds for disbursement against each
          contract and facilitate optimal utilization of the fund. It is worth mentioning that a similar
          system is already available on the ADB website and proved to be very effective both for
          POWERGRID and ADB in reconciliation of contracts.

  ii. Bank funding under PSDP IV. About INR 16.17 billion (or US$265 million)
Commissioning
          Poles I and II were commissioned in September 2010 and July 2012, respectively.51 Pole II
          of the scheme was originally scheduled for completion in December 2009 but could only be
          commissioned in July 2012 for reasons beyond the control of POWERGRID, as explained
          below. As per the contract, eight converter transformers were to be manufactured and
          supplied by M/s BHEL in technical collaboration with M/s Siemens AG, Germany, which
          was the Joint Venture (JV) partners for the package, from July 2008 to March 2009.
          However, the transformers could only be supplied from October 2011 to March 2012. The
          reasons for the delay are as listed:
        i. Development of manufacturing and testing facilities at BHEL, Bhopal works was
              delayed by two years from February 2008 to March 2010 due to delay in construction of
              the new facility before beginning the manufacturing of these converter transformers.
      ii.     Procurement and delivery of major raw material from the source approved by M/s
              Siemens was delayed.
     iii.     As BHEL was manufacturing converter transformers based on Siemens technology for
              the first time, the technology absorption process took longer than expected.
     iv.      There were some test bed failures at BHEL works. The root cause analysis process
              jointly by Siemens and BHEL, resourcing of the raw material for repair, and so on took
              substantial time, which delayed delivery of the transformer.
      v.      For transportation of converter transformers from BHEL, Bhopal works to Balia, both
              road and water transport was used. During transportation, collapse of bridges and
              variation of water level in the river considerably delayed the supply. For example, the
              first converter transformer unit was ready for dispatch in the first week of October 2011
              but due to collapse of a bridge in Madhya Pradesh, movement of all heavy equipment
              was totally stopped by the government of Madhya Pradesh for almost two months.

                                                       drinking water supply


Other Features of the Scheme
   i.    Procurement. Under the project, the 2 packages that were covered under PSDP IV were
         awarded in March 2007and December 2007, respectively.

          Package Type                Prior Review        Post Review              Total

   ii.   Environmental assessment reports. As only HVDC terminal stations were covered
         under PSDP IV, there was no forest involved. Since the HVDC bipole line was funded
         under PSDP III, the necessary documents (IEAR and FEAR) were submitted as part of
         PSDP III.
Major Benefits of the Scheme
   i.     The HVDC link is operating successfully and enables a maximum power flow of 2,000
          MW.
   ii.    The HVDC link is facilitating bulk power exchange between the Northern, Western,
          and Eastern Regions. The link has become an important component in strengthening
          the Northern Region grid as the HVDC system comes with benefits such as controlled
          power flow, control features that help in damping the system oscillation after any
          disturbance, no contribution to any additional short circuit current to Balia (while AC
          systems does contribute), and flexibility of operations.

b.          North-West Transmission Corridor Strengthening Scheme

             Project Cost
                  i.     Total completion cost. About INR 4.92 billion (or US$81 million)52
                 ii.     Bank funding under PSDP IV. About INR 0.52 billion (or US$8.45 million)
             Commissioning
                    The scheme was originally planned to be completed by January 2009 but was later
                    revised to be completed by March 2009 along with the commissioning of the associated
                    transmission lines, which were funded under PSDP III and commissioned in April 2009.
                    These were the reasons for this marginal delay in commissioning of the associated
                    transmission lines:
                  i.    There was a delay in receipt of forest clearance for the Zerda-Kankroli 400 kV D/C
                        line. The forest proposals were submitted in 2006–07 for clearance in five divisions
                        of Rajasthan and Gujarat States. The process took longer due to delay in processing
                        at various stages within the state forest departments.
                 ii.    In addition, there was a stay order at three of the locations by the Nathdwara court,
                        Rajasthan. The sites were vacated in February 2009. Thereafter, the line was
                        commissioned in April 2009.

     Other Features of the Scheme
            i.         Procurement. Under the project, the 2 packages that were covered under PSDP IV were
                       awarded in April and July 2007, respectively.

       ii.      Environmental assessment reports. As only substations are covered under PSDP IV,
                there was no forest involved. The associated transmission lines were funded under
                PSDP III. The necessary documents (IEAR and FEAR) were submitted as part of PSDP
                III.

     Major Benefits of the Project
        i.      These two interregional transmission lines along with the extension of the associated
                bays have enhanced the interregional power transfer capacity by 2,100 MW.
        ii.     These two separate interconnections have also enhanced system stability as well as
                security of the Northern and Western grids.

c.       Western Region System Strengthening Scheme II

     Project Cost
         i.     Total completion cost. About INR 29.90 billion (or US$490 million)
        ii.     Bank funding under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF. About INR 25.11 billion (or
                US$411.71 million, of which US$152.73 million under PSDP IV and US$258.98
                million under PSDP IV AF).
     Commissioning
             The project was scheduled for commissioning in July 2010 but could be progressively
             commissioned only till December 2012 due to delays in obtaining forest clearance for
             various lines under the project, especially Raipur-Wardha and Korba-Birsinghpur (varied
             between 22 and 62 months). The details are as listed:
          Raipur-Wardha 400 kV D/C line
                  For the state of Chhattisgarh:
                 i. Proposal for forest clearance for the Chhattisgarh portion was submitted in October
                    2007.
                ii. The stage-I approval was accorded on May 31, 2010, by the RMoEF, Bhopal
                    stipulating various conditions.
               iii. After complying with all the conditions in stage-I approval, the stage-II (final)
                    approval was issued on March 9, 2011, by the RMoEF, Bhopal.
               iv. On stage-II approval, the cost of tree cutting was deposited and approval was given in
                    May 2011 for tree cutting.

                  For the state of Maharashtra:
                i. Proposal for forest clearance for the Maharashtra portion was submitted in October
                   2007.
               ii. The proposal involved forest area in the Gondia division and under Forest
                   Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM). The NOC from the FDCM was
                   obtained in November 2010.
              iii. The proposal was forwarded by the state government to the MoEF at New Delhi in
                   May 2011, which directed the RMoEF, Bhopal for site inspection in June 2011
                   followed by submission of report to the MoEF in July 2011. The proposal was then
                   discussed in the meeting of the FAC (August 2011). Since the line passes through the
                   wildlife corridor (Tiger Corridor), comments were solicited from the National Tiger
                   Conservation Authority (NTCA). NTCA/Wildlife Institute of India (WII) submitted its
                   recommendations to the MoEF in December 2011 and the proposal was again



                                                      103
           discussed in the FAC held in December 2011 and cleared for approval. Accordingly
           the stage-I approval was issued on April 30, 2012, stipulating various conditions.
       iv. After complying with all the conditions in the stage-I approval, the approval was
           obtained on September 17, 2012, for the second and final stage.
        v. Further, since the line passes through a protected area/eco-sensitive zone and the
           proposed land is within 10 km of the boundary of the protected reserve, tree felling
           permission had also to be taken from the High Court, Maharashtra. Hence, along with
           the forest department, an application was filed in the High Court in September 2011,
           seeking permission for tree felling in the forest area for establishment of the 400 kV
           D/C transmission line. However, pending MoEF approval, the High Court directed
           that the request be filed again after obtaining MoEF consent. On stage-II approval in
           September 2012, a fresh appeal was filed before the High Court subsequent to which
           the permission for tree felling in the forest area was granted on November 30, 2012.
           After permission of the High Court, construction activities started in forest areas and
           the work was completed and the line successfully charged on December 31, 2012.

      Korba STPP-Birsinghpur 400 kV D/C line
         The transmission line was passing through the forest area in the states of Madhya
         Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The proposal for forest clearance was submitted on May 17,
         2006. However, it took considerable time for the MoEF to grant the final approval
         (stage-II) in spite of continuous follow-up by POWERGRID at different levels. Stage-I
         and stage-II approvals for the Madhya Pradesh portion was granted on March 2, 2009,
         and November 9, 2009, respectively and for the Chhattisgarh portion on July 28, 2010,
         and June 14, 2011, respectively.

               Note: *Forest clearance is an important input for the FEAR, which is basically a compliance report of the
               IEAR listing all measures taken for management of environment and social issues. During the one-year period
               starting from October 2006 to October 2007, no forest clearance was granted by the MoEF due to intervention
               of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, there were delays in obtaining forest clearance and as agreed with the
               Bank, POWERGRID submitted the FEAR.

     Major Benefits of the Project
               These elements have augmented intraregional transmission system in the Western Region
               to facilitate import of power from neighboring regions as well as further dispersal towards
               various load centers in various parts of the region to meet the long-term power transfer
               requirement.

     Project Cost
         i.         Total completion cost. About INR 7.11 billion (or US$117 million)
        ii.         Bank funding under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF. About INR 3.61 billion (or US$59.15
                    million, of which US$52.91 million under PSDP IV and US$6.24 million under PSDP
                    IV AF)
     Commissioning
           The scheme was originally targeted to be completed by June 2009 but could only be
           completed by June 2011 due to delays in obtaining forest clearance for various lines under
           the project, especially Ranchi-Rourkela and Rourkela-Raigarh (varied between 30 and 55
           months). The details are as listed:
         i.    Ranchi-Rourkela line. The proposal for forest clearance was submitted on January 3,


                                                              107
               2006. However, forest clearance was received on August 4, 2010, as the realigned route
               proposed by the concerned forest officials passed through the extremist influenced area,
               creating a lot of resistance to complete the realignment survey and plot identification,
               including tree enumeration. Chronological details of obtaining the forest clearance are
               provided in annex 2.
      ii.      Rourkela-Raigarh line. The proposal for forest clearance was submitted on February 7,
               2008, whereas the permission for construction work in forest area was obtained from
               the MoEF on July 26, 2010, as a special case, in view of the importance of the
               transmission line for the Commonwealth Games 2010.

     Major Benefits of the Project
          The scheme has strengthened the existing Rourkela-Raipur interregional transmission
          corridor facilitating more reliable and secure power transfer from the Eastern to Western
          Region. The interregional link along with installation of the FSC has augmented the
          interregional transmission capacity of the National Grid by 1,400 MW.

     Project Cost
         i.     Total completion cost. About INR 9.96 billion (or US$163 million)
        ii.     Bank funding under PSDP IV and PSDP IV AF. about INR 6.76 billion (or US$110.91
                million, of which US$59.83 million under PSDP IV and US$51.08 million under PSDP
                IV AF)
     Commissioning
          The scheme was originally scheduled to be completed by October 2009 but most of the
          elements were complete by May 2013 except for the second circuit of re-conductoring of the
          Purnea-Siliguri line, which could only be completed by March 2014. The delay in
          completion of the projects was mainly due to the following reasons:
         i.     Delays in obtaining forest clearance for various lines under the project that were
                available from April 2009 to April 2011 (varied from 22 to 42 months). The longest
                was taken by the Baripada-Mendhasal line, for which the proposal for forest clearance
                was submitted on February 28, 2008. However, the final clearance was received almost
                after 3.5 years (on August 25, 2011).
        ii.     Completion of the Durgapur-Jamshedpur Line got delayed as Eastern Coalfields
                Limited did not allow construction works through their area near Durgapur. This was
                compounded by severe RoW problems for some part of the line. POWERGRID short-
                terminated and commissioned the line at Durgapur STPS Switchyard (at Andal) to
                gainfully use the line.
       iii.     Completion of the Jamshedpur-Baripada line was also affected due to severe RoW
                problem.
       iv.      Re-conductoring of the Purnea-Siliguri line was initially affected on account of the
                delay in conductor supply due to the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in



                                                    109
              March 2011. This calamity affected the factory of M/s J-Power Systems Corporation
              Ltd (JV partner of the contract supplier) at Toyoura, leading to delay in conductor
              supplies. Further, supply of hardware material also got affected due to floods in
              Thailand.
      v.      Shutdown of the existing line for re-conductoring works on the Purnea-Siliguri line was
              difficult, especially during the monsoon and hence, could only be achieved in phases.

     Major Benefits of the Project
            i.          This scheme has strengthened the transmission networks and enables transfer of
                        power from the eastern part of the Eastern Region to the central areas of the region
                        and further transmission.
            ii.         Earlier, the Siliguri-Purnea line was evacuating hydel power from the Tala and Teesta
                        projects. Strengthening of this line has resulted in transferring additional power with
                        reliability from the planned generation projects in Sikkim, Bhutan, and the
                        Northeastern Region through the chicken neck area.

f.         Southern Region System Strengthening – XIII (New Scheme Added Through Restructuring)

     Project Cost
             i.         Total completion cost. About INR 4.92 billion (US$81 million)
            ii.         Bank funding under PSDP IV. INR 2.30 billion (US$37.65 million, which is the
                        amount disbursed till August 22, 2014)
     Commissioning
            The scheme was originally scheduled for completion by June 2014, before the loan closing
            date but is now expected to be completed not before March 2015 due to severe RoW issues
            faced in the state of Karnataka since February 2013. The reason for the delays is the intense
            organized protests by landowners and villagers on both the lines funded under this loan.



                                                              111
       Even after intervention of the state authorities, the protests are not dying out. POWERGRID
       is continuously in consultation with the relevant state authorities and has been taking
       measures as being suggested and agreed but protests have been re-emerging. Chronological
       details of the status of the works at site are provided in annex 2. Implementation of this line
       will now be monitored under PSDP V, the ongoing lending engagement with POWERGRID.

     Other Features of the Scheme
             i.     Procurement. Under the project, 8 packages were covered under the PSDP IV loan.
                    These packages were awarded from December 2011 to August 2012. The mix of
                    packages was as given in the table:

     Major Benefits of the Project
           As implementation of the line has been affected due to severe RoW issues in the state of
           Karnataka, the benefits are yet to accrue. The line is expected to carry about 1,600 MW of
           power. However, it may be mentioned that no power is being bottlenecked due to delay in
           implementation of these transmission lines.

g.         System Strengthening in Western Region for Sasan UMPP (Scheme Shifted from PSDP V
           Through Restructuring)

     Project Cost
             i.     Total completion cost. About INR 7.25 billion (or US$119 million)
            ii.     Bank funding under PSDP IV AF. About INR 5.12 billion (or US$84 million)
     Commissioning
            The scheme was originally scheduled for completion in December 2012 (as per PAD of
            PSDP V) but it could only be commissioned by October 2014 due to reasons as explained
            below:
             i.   Gwalior substation. Marginal delay of about 3 months was mainly on account of the
                  intense fog conditions prevailing in the northern part of India around Agra and
                  Gwalior regions at the time completion, which are not suitable for the transmission
                  system, especially of 765 kV. Work at Gwalior substation also got delayed as upgrade
                  of Bina-Gwalior-Agra line was delayed due to major grid disturbance in July 2012.




                                                           113
     ii.    Indore substation. Acquisition of land got delayed initially due to stiff resistance from
            the farmers. Once it was resolved, the site levelling work to be done from July 2010 to
            January 2011 got delayed as the vendor did not perform leading to termination of the
            contract, which was re-awarded in July 2011. This was then completed within
            contract period of six months.
    iii.    Shunt reactor package. The package could be awarded in February 2012 after 23
            months from initiation of the procurement process (NIT issued in March 2010) after
            getting necessary approvals from the Bank at various stages of the procurement action.
            The reason for the delay was formulation of suitable qualification requirement in the
            contracts for setting up of repairs and maintenance (R&M) facilities for 765 kV
            transformers and reactors by the vendors, especially foreign bidders.
