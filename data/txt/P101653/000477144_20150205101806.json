outcome rating with low or\n            negligible risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and\n            the Borrower received satisfactory performance ratings.\n            There was one restructuring that took place during this\n            project. The restructuring was triggered by the significant\n            savings surplus. Additional Financing (PSDP IV AF resulting\n            from the combined effects of a highly competitive market,\n            the continuing devaluation of the Indian rupee (INR) against\n            the U.S. dollar since loan approval, and the regulatory\n            requirements to maintain a debt-equity ratio of 70:30 for\n            all the schemes financed by Power Grid Corporation of India\n            Limited (POWERGRID). Further, in addition to inclusion of a\n            new scheme, another scheme was shifted (originally approved\n            at appraisal) from the Fifth Power Sector Development\n            Project (PSDP V) to PSDP IV AF to leverage the flexibility\n            in the POWERGRID portfolio that had the same PDO and KPIs to\n            optimally utilize available funds across its various\n            engagements. There are several main lessons learned from\n            this project and are as follows: (1) Long-term programmatic\n            engagement results in a successful partnership. (2) Repeater\n            projects contributed toward effective implementation of\n            POWERGRID projects. (3) Retroactive financing enabled an\n            advance preparation of the project. (4) Strong and reliable\n            National Grid is facilitating economic development. (5)\n            POWERGRID is now a \u0091partner of choice\u0092. Over the years,\n            POWERGRID has transformed into an organization successfully\n            foraying into advanced technologies that it has become a\n            \u0091partner of choice\u0092 by Indian states as well as neighboring\n            countries. (6) Timely measures required for overcoming Right\n            of Way (RoW) issues. It is important to note that given the\n            scarcity of resources within the country, RoW has become\n            very difficult to obtain. (7) Due focus on safeguards help\n            in obtaining forest clearance with a shorter turnaround\n            time. (8) Adequate handling of land acquisition issues. The\n            land acquisition procedures/laws are too cumbersome. These\n            might be counterproductive to sector development and to\n            network expansion. (9) Review and updating of procurement\n            documents to promote new technologies. As part of this loan\n            and in line with the Bank\u0092s procedures, procurement for some\n            of the unique and emerging technologies in India was carried\n            out. (10) Vendor conferences resulted in higher\n            participation and competitive prices. (11) Restructuring of\n            loans to optimize utilization. (12) With large size of\n            package, it is useful to have higher prior review threshold.\n            (13) Engagement with a capable borrower results in mutual\n            learning. Both the Bank and POWERGRID learned from each\n            other during this partnership."}, "docdt": "2015-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
