                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The last implementation support mission for the project was carried out from September 16 - October 26, 2013.

                         As noted in the last ISR, POWERGRID continues to demonstrate efficiency in project implementation and as of end December 2013, almost 95% of funds have been disbursed in
                         PSDP IV whereas for additional financing almost 83% of funds have been disbursed, 6 months before project closing date. POWERGRID has recorded cost savings under the
                         schemes approved at the appraisal stage. POWERGRID and the team discussed and agreed upon a project restructuring scenario that would take advantage of the flexibility of the
                         IBRD portfolio (with no change in PDO and monitoring framework) and allow maximizing disbursement under the various loans, including PSDP V. During the January 30, 2014
                         Tripartite Portfolio Review Meeting, DEA has endorsed the restructuring strategy and subsequently confirmed it through several meetings with POWERGRID, including during the last
                         one on the PCG option held on February 14, 2014. The restructuring approach is to swap one scheme (agreed at the time of appraisal) of PSDP V with two schemes of PSDP IV AF

                         as the former is expected to be completed by the loan closing date of PSDP IV AF. This swap will enable to disburse PSDP IV AF fully. As conveyed previously, these changes will
                         not entail any change in the project structure and monitoring framework. It is anticipated that the administrative process for the project restructuring will be completed by end March
                         2014.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         POWERGRID has demonstrated efficiency in implementation and there are no significant shortcomings with respect to meeting the project development objectives. POWERGRID
                         has recorded some cost savings and thus, proposed new schemes to utilize the available balance funds. These were approved by the Bank and are in advanced stages of
                         procurement. During the tripartite portfolio review meeting held on January 30, 2014, DEA has approved the restructuring strategy of the POWERGRID's IBRD portfolio, which entails
                         swapping one scheme of PSDP V with two schemes of PSDP IV AF and allows to fully utilize the surplus funds under PSDP IV and IV AF.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
