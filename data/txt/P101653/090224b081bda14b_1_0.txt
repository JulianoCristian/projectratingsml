                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The last implementation support mission for the project was carried out in December 2012. Since then the team has been actively following up with the client regarding the actions (to
                         be taken by POWERGRID) on regular basis. After the mission, the team also undertook a technical visit in February 2013, to follow up on portfolio disbursement.

                         POWERGRID continues to demonstrate efficiency in project implementation and as of April 2013, almost 93% of funds have been disbursed in PSDP IV whereas for additional
                         financing almost 80% of funds have been disbursed, more than 14 months before project closing date. With regards to disbursement target in FY13, POWERGRID has already met
                         78% of its target for the year and is confident to fully disburse the planned USD 45.5 million by end of June 2013. POWERGRID has recorded cost savings under the schemes
                         approved at the appraisal stage and thus, it has proposed new schemes to utilize these balance funds that were approved by the Bank. The new schemes are also well advanced in
                         procurement. The Bank has received the restructuring request from DEA and the team will process it shortly while undertaking a review of the entire POWERGRID portfolio.

                         All the Key performance indicators (KPI) outperformed their targets in FY 2013. Outcome indicator (growth in inter-regional power exchange) outperformed its target by almost 17%
                         (actual- 66 Billion Units (BU) (provisional) against target - 56 BU). This indicator had already outperformed its end project (FY2014) target (58 BU) in FY2012 itself. Further,
                         POWERGRID has again exceeded the annual targets for the other two KPIs (result indicators). Overall, there are no significant shortcomings with respect to meeting the project

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         POWERGRID has demonstrated efficiency in implementation and there are no significant shortcomings with respect to meeting the project development objectives. POWERGRID
                         has recorded some cost savings and thus, proposed new schemes to utilize the available balance funds. These were approved by the Bank and are in advanced stages of
                         procurement. Request for restructuring has been received from DEA and the team will process it shortly.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
