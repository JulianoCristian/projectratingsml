                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The last implementation support mission for the project was carried out from September 16 - October 26, 2013.

                         POWERGRID continues to demonstrate efficiency in project implementation and as of mid-November 2013, almost 95% of funds have been disbursed in PSDP IV whereas for
                         additional financing almost 83% of funds have been disbursed, more than 7 months before project closing date. POWERGRID has recorded cost savings under the schemes
                         approved at the appraisal stage. Powergrid and the team discussed and agreed upon a project restructuring scenario that would take advantage of the flexibility of the IBRD portfolio
                         (with no change in PDO and monitoring framework) and allow maximizing disbursement under the various loans, including PSDP V. New restructuring scenarios are now being
                         discussed, as DEA has still not provided its green light to the PCG option, key feature of the restructuring strategy of PSDP V. It is anticipated that project restructuring will be
                         completed by January 2014.

                         As of end September 2013, outcome indicator (inter-regional power exchange in a year) has already met 53% of the original targets (in PAD) and 45% of the revised targets (actual -
                         31 billion units (BU) against PAD target of 58 BU and revised target of 68 BU). This indicator had already outperformed its end project (FY2014) target (58 BU) in FY2012 itself.
                         Further, POWERGRID has again outperformed the annual targets for the other two Key performance indicators (KPI) (result indicators). Overall, there are no significant shortcomings

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         POWERGRID has demonstrated efficiency in implementation and there are no significant shortcomings with respect to meeting the project development objectives. POWERGRID
                         has recorded some cost savings and thus, proposed new schemes to utilize the available balance funds. These were approved by the Bank and are in advanced stages of
                         procurement. Powergrid and the Bank are exploring other restructuring options to leverage the flexibility of the IBRD portfolio and fully utilize the surplus funds under PSDP IV and IV
                         AF. These options will be finalized before end January 2014.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
