Project\n            sustainability is regarded as likely, World Bank performance\n            is rated as satisfactory and borrower performance is rated\n            overall as satisfactory. Lessons learned are identified as\n            the following: Advance procurement--that, hiring\n            consultants, appointment of contractors, etc.) should be\n            part of various stages of project preparation and\n            processing. The Ceylon Electricity Board's (CEB)\n            authority to handle procurement independently of the\n            government should be enhanced. Give CEB autonomy so that it\n            facilitates effective project implementation--this may\n            require incorporating CEB under the Companies Act. Entrust\n            project implementation to those dedicated to that task.\n            Evaluate the security situation properly, and exclude works\n            in areas prone to civil unrest. Set up an independent\n            regulatory regime to ensure the sector's financial\n            viability. Promote private investments and operations to\n            complement public resources. At appraisal, pay attention to\n            financial management in general, and submit audited accounts\n            on a timely basis in particular."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
