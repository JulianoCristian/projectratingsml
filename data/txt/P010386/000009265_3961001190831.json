principal objectives of the project\n            are to support further rationalization of the organization\n            of power distribution in Sri Lanka to reduce power system\n            losses and provide additional transmission capacity to help\n            meet projected demand at least cost.  The project will also\n            assist in the preparation of selected hydropower projects\n            and Ceylon Electricity Board's further institutional\n            development.  The project will finance: (a) rehabilitation\n            and expansion of distribution systems to be taken over by\n            CEB during 1992-95; (b) a slice of CEB's least-cost\n            transmission investments comprising the construction of\n            about 152 km of 220-kV line, about 45 km of 132-kV line and\n            related substations; and (c) technical assistance to CEB."}, "docdt": "1991-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
