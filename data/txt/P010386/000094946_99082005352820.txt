SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(Credit-2297-CE)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Power Distribution
and Transmnission Project in Sri Lanka, for which Credit 2297-CE in the amount of SDR 37.5
million (US$ 50.0 million equivalent) was approved on September 10, 1991 and made effective
on December 16, 1991. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1998. Final disbursement took place
on December 14, 1998, leaving an undisbursed balance of SDR 5.66 million to be cancelled'.
The ICR was prepared by Sumith Pilapitiya, with assistance from S. Vijay Iyer, Stefan
Jansson, Janice Williams-Palenzuela, Anna Goodman (all South Asia Energy Sector staff) and
Sanath Ranawana, Consultant. It was reviewed by Marc Heitner, Team Leader for Sri Lanka,
Energy Sector Unit, South Asia Region.
Preparation of this ICR began after IDA's final supervision mission (May 18 - 29, 1998),
and subsequent to IDA's decision on June 28, 1998, not to extend the Credit beyond the original
closing date of June 30, 1998. It is based on material in the project files as well as discussions
with the Ceylon Electricity Board and Government officials associated with the project. The
beneficiary contributed to the preparation of the ICR by providing its own evaluation report,
arranging field visits, and commenting on the draft ICR.
1     The amount to be cancelled includes US$ 128,590.34, which is to be refunded by CEB from the
Special Account.

SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(Credit-2297-CE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Bank Group's involvement with Sri Lanka's power sector began in 1954 with a loan' to the
Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) for the expansion of the Aberdeen-Laksapana hydroelectric scheme.
Since then, the Bank Group has made eleven additional loans/credits for the development of the power
sector to meet demand at least cost, to improve the quality and reliability of supply, and to promote
institutional reforms.
2.     GOSL has historically given high priority to developing the power sector through the
development of hydro-power generation capacity. Over the past decade, the Government has initiated
reforms to rationalize the organization of the sector. Fragmentation of the responsibility for distribution
was identified as a major problem in this respect. Apart from Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Lanka
Electric Company Limited (LECO) and 212 other licensees (local authorities) were responsible for the
distribution and sale of electricity.  To address these organizational issues and rehabilitate the
distribution system, a master plan for development of the distribution system was prepared under the
Ninth Power Project (Cr. 1736)2, based on which GOSL decided on a phased takeover of all licensees by
CEB and LECO. The Distribution Master Plan (DMP) also recommended that the management of power
distribution be decentralized to the divisional levels within CEB. Accordingly, 133 licensees were taken
over by CEB and their distribution systems were rehabilitated under an IDA Credit (Cr. 1933-CE)3 over
May 1989 to June 1991. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed LECO's takeover of another 23
licensees. This ICR relates to the Second Power Distribution and Transrnission Project (SPDTP) project,
whose overall objective was to assist GOSL/CEB in the second phase of institutional reforms (including
the takeover of the remaining 56 licensees) and to implement other measures recommended in the DMP
to strengthen CEB' s financial, operational and technical management capabilities.
Evaluation of Objectives
3.    The specific objectives of the project were to: (a) support rationalization of power distribution
with a view to reduce system losses in distribution systems operated by the remaining licensees and to
improve the quality of supply; (b) augment the transmission facilities to meet projected demand; (c)
strengthen CEB's institutional capacity by providing training programs; and (d) assist in the preparation
of a technologically, environmentally, and socio-economically sound hydropower project.  The
objectives were clear, realistic and consistent with IDA's and GOSL's strategy for the power sector at the
time.

Implementation Experience and Results
4.    Although the project achieved its main sectoral and institutional objectives, the project has not
been fully completed. It is expected that upon completion of outstanding civil works, the physical
objectives would also be achieved. Rehabilitation of distribution systems taken over under the project
was also not completed by the Credit closing date due to delays in procurement and project
implementation. The project achieved its institutional objectives in the distribution sub-sector by CEB
taking over all the distribution systems operated by licensees, except within the Northern Province due to
the prevailing security situation there. Although the CEB has no detailed information on the reduction in
system losses of all the systems taken over under the project, the limited information available indicates
significant reductions in individual licensee areas, such as from 27.6 percent to 12.0 percent in the
Muniwangoda Urban Council Area. Overall, however, CEB's system losses declined marginally from
18.8 percent in 1991 to 18.7 percent in 1998.
5.    The project provided for additional transmission capacity in accordance with CEB's least-cost
transmission expansion plan. In 1996, at the request of GOSL, IDA agreed that a part of the transmission
component would be financed by other donors. Instead, two other sub-stations were substituted for IDA
financing in 1997'. However, implementation of the IDA-funded physical works was poor--with four out
of the five major contracts either incomplete at Credit close or completed with up to three-year delays.
Some of these delays will make it necessary for CEB to use approximately US$ 6.6 million of its own
resources to finance the completion of these components.  Under the institutional development
component of the project, funds were available for technical assistance to improve skills in the areas of
utility management and financial management. The training objectives of the project were achieved
satisfactorily.
6.    The key factors that adversely affected the timely achievement of the physical objectives were:
(i) GOSL's protracted procurement procedures; (ii) inadequate supervision by CEB project staff of
certain components; (iii) security considerations in the Northern Province which resulted in reduction
and modification of the transmission works; and (iv) undue priority attention to rural electrification
schemes which diverted manpower and other resources from the project. The main constraints to timely
project implementation were those common to most government utilities, namely, lack of financial and
operational autonomy resulting in procurement delays, lack of commercial orientation and low tariffs
resulting in poor financial results.
7.    The financial performance of CEB during the project period was not fully satisfactory due to its
failure to meet the Rate of Return (ROR) target (except for one year); there were improvements in some
areas such as reduction of arrears. Tariffs were increased by an average of 12 percent per annum
between 1992 and 1998. In nominal terms, the average tariff has increased from 2.24 SLR/kWh in 1992
to 4.15 SLR/kWh in 1997. However, in inflation adjusted terms, the tariff decreased marginally during
the period. In spite of IDA's repeated reminders, GOSL/CEB did not demonstrate the necessary
commitment to fully meet the revenue target.
8.    IDA was diligent in project design, appraisal and supervision with regular missions identifying
implementation problems and recommending remedial measures. However, such measures were not
always implemented on time by CEB. In retrospect, had IDA taken a stronger stand towards CEB on
implementation of physical components as well as compliance with the revenue covenant, project
outcomes might have been improved.

Project Sustainability
9.    The completed physical works will be part of CEB's integrated transmission and distribution
system. Adequate resources are expected to be provided by CEB for the proper operation and
maintenance of the newly created facilities. Hence, the project benefits are likely to be sustained. In
order to meet the growing demand for electricity efficiently, CEB must continue investing in new assets.
A recent Japanese International Cooperation Agency study concluded that the investment needs for
power generation, transmission and distribution would be about US$ 300 million annually over the next
10 years. However, investments appear to be declining-CEB's investments in 1995 were US$ 70 million
compared to US$ 130 million in 1991 and only averaged US$ 100 million annually in that period. It is
unlikely that the funding available from internal sources and donor contributions will together exceed
US$ 175 million annually. There is thus a compelling case to expand the resources available for
investment by creating opportunities for private sector participation in the electricity sector. For this
reason, GOSL is in fact, contemplating a series of reform measures to create an enabling environment for
private participation in the sector.
Summary of Findings
10.   CEB's ability to perform effectively depends upon GOSL enabling the utility to exercise the
autonomy provided for under the CEB Act. CEB's autonomy has eroded over the years. The restoration
of CEB's autonomy and financial viability are essential preconditions for smooth execution of new
public sector power projects in coming years.
11.   The following lessons can be drawn from this project:
*  Procurement: The main obstacle to achievement of the project physical objectives on a timely
basis was GOSL's protracted procurement procedures. CEB should be given adequate autonomy
in this area.  LECO, which operates as an autonomous company exhibits much better
performance in this respect. Further, all detailed design work and procurement actions should be
completed during project preparation so that implementation is expedited.
*  Tariffs: At the root of CEB's poor financial performance is its inability to function as a
commercial entity and recover its full costs through realistic tariffs. It is essential that tariff
setting be moved out of the political arena. Tariffs should be regulated independently within an
agreed regulatory framework, and on the basis of agreed performance targets.
* Monitoring: Stronger actions by IDA and other donors to ensure CEB's financial performance
might have resulted in a more successful project. Future operations should ensure advance donor
coordination on project design and cofinancing opportunities during preparation, and focus on
compliance with agreed conditions during project implementation.
12.  IDA's strategy for the sector will be to facilitate restructuring, privatization, and creating an
enabling environment to attract private investments to the power sector.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(Credit-2297-CE)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Evaluation of Proiect Obiectives
1.    The objectives of the project were to: (a) continue supporting rationalization of power
distribution organizations, particularly to reduce system losses in distribution systems operated by the
remaining licensees and to improve the quality of electricity supply; (b) augment the transmission
facilities to meet projected demand; (c) strengthen CEB's institutional capacity through training; and (d)
assist in the preparation of a technologically, environmentally and socio-economically sound hydropower
project.
2.    The objectives of the project were relevant, clear and realistic. They were consistent with IDA's
strategy for assistance to the power sector at the time, and with GOSL's sector development strategy.
The distribution component of the project continued to support the rationalization of distribution
systems, which had commenced under IDA Credit No. 1933-CE', and facilitated the takeover of the
remaining licensees from Local Authorities. The transmission component was part of CEB's least-cost
investment program to provide additional capacity to meet projected growth in demand. Consultancy
studies were designed to develop CEB's institutional capacity.
B.    Achievement of ObWectives
3.    This project clearly demonstrates the weaknesses in the institutional arrangements in the power
sector of Sri Lanka. Whereas the Ceylon Electricity Board Act (goveming CEB) provides for autonomy
and independence, the Government has increasingly rnicro-managed the sector, combining the roles of
policy-maker, regulator and operator. Thus, CEB's procedures in terms of finance, human resources
management and procurement became those of the Government. As a result, project implementation
lagged and has affected the provision of services to consumers adversely.
4.    The principal physical components of the project were: (i) rehabilitation and expansion of 56
distribution systems operated by licensees, targeted to be taken over by CEB during FY92-95; (ii)
construction of about 152 km of 220-kV double circuit line with only one circuit strung initially; (iii)
construction/augmentation of related 220-kV substations; (iv) construction of about 37 km of 132-kV
double circuit line with only one circuit strung initially and 8 km of double circuit line and augmentation
of related 132-kV substation; and (v) installation of about 70 MVA compensation equipment at selected
substations to improve voltage level. In September 1995, GOSL decided to utilize other donor funds2 for
construction and augmentation of the 220-kV substations at Kotmale and Anuradhapura. At the request
of GOSL therefore, IDA agreed to substitute the 220-kV substations at Biyagama and Kelanitissa to
evacuate power from new power plants to be constructed at Kelanitissa. No amendment to the Credit
Agreement was required as these substitutions were within the project scope.

5.    The distribution component of the project largely achieved its stated objectives. Of the 56
licensees remaining under local authority control, CEB took over all 22 licensees located outside thec
Northern Province. In April 1996, it was agreed to suspend further attempts to take over the 34 licensees
within the Northern Province due to the prevailing security situation in that province, and procurement
activities were discontinued. It was also agreed to utilize available funds for the extensive rehabilitation
needed at the Kandy distribution system which had been taken over in 1995. The Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR) had identified this security risk, and it was agreed that disbursement on this component would
depend on IDA being satisfied that the security situation was conducive to project implementation.
Subsequently, CEB took over 10 systems in six Local Authority areas in the North as the security
situation improved using its own resources. CEB is now contracting with private generators to supply
power to isolated parts of the distribution system in the North. These generators will be moved to other
more remote areas once supply from the 33-kV grid is established.
6.    The transmission expansion components are part of CEB's least cost expansion plan, based on
prevailing system configuration and load flow assessments. At the time of Credit closure, several of the
major investment components were still under construction. However, notwithstanding the delays in
implementing the transrnission components, the new facilities when completed would significantly
contribute to the objective of meeting projected electricity demand. The component-wise details are as
follows:
*  132-kV Lines Rantambe-Badulla and Kotmale-Kurunduwatte: works completed but can be
energized only after the 132-kV substations at Rantambe, Badulla and Kotmale are completed.
*  132-kV Substations at Rantambe, Badulla and Kotmale: The completion date for this contract
was May 1995, but the substations were still under construction at Credit closure. Low quality
and defective equipment were the main reasons for delay in completion.
*  220-kV Kotmale - Anuradhapura Line: The award of the contract to supply and erect this 165-
km transmission line was delayed by about two years due to the protracted procurement process
and disagreements with IDA on the selection of the contractor. After the contract was awarded in
October 1996, slow implementation and inadequate supervision resulted in the works being only
50 percent complete at Credit closure. Approximately US$ 3.6 million would be spent from
CEB's resources to complete this component.
*  220-kV substation at Biyagama, together with components substituted at the request of GOSL in
January 1996 including: (i) construction of a 220-kV substation at Kelanitissa; (ii) construction
of two 220-kV bays at Biyagamna; and (iii) upgrading 132-kV Biyagama-Kelanitissa line to 220
kV. Following protracted procurement decisions, the contract was finally awarded in June 1997.
Civil works at the site were delayed further by an additional 82 days due to a bomb blast at the
boundary of the Kelanitissa Power Station site. At Credit closure, the civil works at the
Kelanitissa site were 50 percent complete with less than 15 percent of the erection works
completed. At the Biyagama site, only 33 percent of the civil works had been completed with
less than six percent of the erection works completed at Credit closure. Upgrading of 132-kV
Kelanitissa line to 220 kV was completed on time.
7.    Fragmentation of responsibility for electricity distribution and supply--between CEB, LECO and
the Local Authorities (licensees)--was considered to be a major obstacle to improving the efficiency and
further development of the sector. The licensees have been faced with: high systems losses (averaging
25 percent); unreliable, poor quality and deteriorating supply; high arrears to CEB; long delays in
connecting new consumers; and shortages of funding for proper operation and maintenance as well as



3
lack of competent staff. Acting upon the recommendations of-a Distribution Master Plan, GOSL had
taken measures to rationalize the organization of the power distribution sector. The takeover of licensees'
distribution systems by CEB and their rehabilitation commenced under the previous Credit (1933-CE).
The SPDTP continued this activity towards its completion.
8.    Most of the licensee systems were spread over the island and, in view of the economies of scale,
it made sense at the time that they be consolidated into CEB, which operates the island-wide distribution
system. The takeover at the time was to be supported by decentralization of distribution management to
the divisional level within CEB. While the objective of the project was to reduce CEB's distribution
system losses from 18.8 percent in 1991 to 12 percent by 1998, CEB achieved only a marginal reduction
to 18.7 percent. One reason was CEB's centralized management structure and lack of autonomy, which
was in sharp contrast to Lanka Electricity Company (LECO), established in 1983 under the Companies
Act. LECO made considerable progress in reducing distribution losses and improving the quality of
supply and service, as well as its revenue collection.
9.    Upgrading its technical and management skills was a primary objective for CEB as a means to
improve its performance and efficiency. The project addressed CEB's institutional weaknesses and
provided various, largely successful, forms of technical assistance and training. Technical assistance was
also provided to install a computerized project implementation, monitoring and reporting system.
Overall, the training objectives of the project were satisfactorily achieved. A total of 80 members of
CEB's staff received international training while about 9,400 were trained locally. The training followed
an agreed plan which covered the following areas: utility management; financial forecasting and
corporate planning; budgeting and budgetary control; cash and credit management; project accounting;
management information systems; performance audits; and other topics. The training was useful and a
majority of trained staff remained within CEB. However, it is debatable whether the efficiency gains
from the training can be fully realized under CEB' s present institutional framework.
10.   The Credit also financed a study to upgrade the Management Information System (MIS) at CEB.
Although this study was completed, no significant improvement has been observed. This is mainly due
to problems encountered in staffing, training and user commitment in implementing the
recommendations of that study.
11.   The project was to provide consulting services to update the feasibility study and prepare
detailed engineering designs and bid documents for the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project. This sub-
component dropped at the request of CEB after Credit approval, as another donor offered to finance the
technical assistance, as well as the investment required for that project.
12.   The environmental impact of constructing transmission and distribution lines was negligible, and
was adequately monitored. Most distribution lines were constructed alongside existing roadways, so they
are visually similar to existing lines. New transmission lines were also constructed along existing public
roadways and transmission corridors and had no significant environmental impact. Environmental
clearance was required for the Kotmale-Anuradhapura transmnission line, since it was a new line
exceeding 10 km, and at a voltage level exceeding 50 kV [the National Environmental Act's (NEA)
criteria for requiring an environmental assessment for transmission lines]. Clearance was obtained by
CEB after an environmental assessment, as required by the NEA.
13.   In general, the efficiency of CEB's electricity supply improved under the project. Delays in
connecting new consumers were reduced, while the number of customers per employee increased: 75 in
1992; 90 in 1993; 99 in 1994; 108 in 1995; 115 in 1996; 126 in 1997; and 130 in 1998. CEB has thus
recorded impressive productivity gains during the project period. In support of the project's institutional
objectives and to ensure CEB's financial viability, various financial covenants were agreed to between



4
GOSL and IDA. The revenue covenant specified that CEB maintain a rate of return (ROR) on net
revalued fixed assets in operation of at least 7 percent in 1992-1993 and 8 percent thereafter. The rate
was relaxed for the years 1992-1993 in view of a large increase in CEB's asset base' and CEB's
commitment to meet the other financial covenants and commercial objectives, e.g. 30 percent self-
financing of investments, debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5, accounts receivable below three
months of billing and current ratio of at least 1.2.
14.    The ROR target was fully achieved only in 1995. One reason for CEB's inability to meet the
revenue target was that tariff increases were not implemented as scheduled during the course of the
project, and actual tariff increases were well below the required levels and not timely. In addition to
insufficient tariffs, CEB's financial situation suffered in 1996 and 1997 due to a prolonged drought
which affected the hydro-power generation capacity. CEB was compelled to rely heavily on its thermal
capacity, thus increasing expenditure on fuel and causing it to purchase electricity at high prices from
private generators.
15.    CEB was advised both by IDA and the Asian Development Bank that a tariff increase of 12.5
percent in 1998 would be essential to recover from the financial setback suffered during 1996 and 1997.
This would have enabled CEB to achieve a ROR of 7.3 percent in 1998, and, with additional increases in
tariffs of 10 percent in each of the following two years, to restore its financial viability. However, tariff
increases are largely decided upon by the Government and the political agenda often takes precedence
over the commercial interests of CEB.  The recommended tariff increases for 1998 were not
implemented.
16.    CEB' s self-financing ratio, accounts receivable levels and debt service coverage were
satisfactory. Accounts receivables (in terms of months of sales equivalent) also improved towards the
latter half of the project: 2.8 in 1991; 3.5 in 1992; 3.3 in 1993; 2.7 in 1994; 2.5 in 1995 and 1996; and 2.4
in 1997 and 2.7 in 1998. Thus, for the latter years, the rate was well within the covenant level of 3.0.
CEB's actual performance, as compared to project covenants/appraisal projections is summarized in the
table below:

17.    The major components of the project were an integral part of CEB's long-term plan:  the
distribution component was identified as indispensable to address inefficiencies affecting licensees; the
transmission component was part of the least-cost plan for transmission investments to link existing and
future generating stations with load centers; and consulting services and training components addressed
general deficiencies identified by CEB. Since the project contributed towards the overall improvement
I      Resulting from the commissioning of the Samanalawewa hydropower project.



5
of the electricity sub-sector, the benefits of the project to consumers could not be separated from benefits
arising from other investments towards achieving CEB's long-term development objectives.
18.   In view of the project being thoroughly integrated with CEB's least-cost development program, it
was justified at appraisal through an economic analysis of CEB's entire program for the 10 years from
1991 to 2000. CEB's total investments for generation, transmission and distribution were included, as
well as incremental fuel costs, and operating and maintenance costs associated with this investment
program. CEB's incremental sales revenues were used as a measure of benefits. Based on the above, the
economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated to 10.7 percent at the time of appraisal.
19.   The economic analysis in the SAR was adjusted by replacing incremental sales revenue with
estimates of consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) for the incremental electricity sales. This was
considered a better estimate of economic benefits, as it would capture part of the consumer surplus. On
this basis, the ERR at appraisal was estimated at 15.7 percent.
20.   The ERR has now been re-calculated, using actual data for the period 1991-1998, and similar
methods and assumptions as in the SAR (see Annex E). The resulting ERR is 12.2 percent, which is
above the SAR estimate of 10.7 percent. Adjusted for (proven) WTP, the ERR increases to 14.8 percent
which is slightly below the SAR estimate. As such, the investment program has been justified ex-post on
economic grounds since it yields an ERR which is above the standard opportunity cost of capital of 12
percent. Further, the indicated ERRs most likely under-estimate the real benefits of CEB's 1991-2000
investment program, as the calculations largely reflect low tariff levels, and do not fully capture the
consumer surplus. In its Operations Plan, CEB indicates that it intends to comply with the covenanted
rate of return of 8 percent. This would require a tariff increase of about 30 percent over current levels. If
such an increase is assumed to be in effect as from 2000, and maintained in real terms thereafter, the
resulting ERR would be 16.8 percent.
C.    Maior Factors Affecting the Prject
21.   The prevailing security conditions in the country did not pose a risk to overall project
implementation (as anticipated in the SAR). IDA exercised its discretion on approving the component of
the project relating to rehabilitation/expansion of the 34 licensees operating in the Northern Province. In
April 1996, it was decided not to pursue this component of the project. CEB subsequently managed to
take over 10 licensees in six local authority areas, when the security situation improved in 1997-1998.
The security situation also caused delays in the licensee's implementation of another component: a bomb
explosion on the boundary of the Kelanitissa sub-station delayed civil works by 82 days. This
contributed to this component being incomplete at Credit closure.
22.   A major factor that had a negative impact on CEB's financial performance was the extensive
drought which prevailed in 1996 and 1997, which made it necessary for CEB to purchase high cost
emergency power.
23.   The most significant cause of delays in project implementation was GOSL's cumbersome
procurement procedures. CEB has inadequate autonomy for procurement of materials and supplies to
efficiently carry out its mandate. Although GOSL enhanced CEB's authority in procurement by raising
the threshold from SLRs 20 million to SLRs 100 million (equivalent to US$ 1.5 million) at IDA's
insistence, this threshold proved still inadequate for proper functioning of a utility of CEB's size. For
amounts exceeding this threshold, various Cabinet-appointed tender committees are involved in bid
evaluation and the final award recommendation requires approval by the Cabinet of Ministers. This
evaluation and approval process was the major cause of delays in completion of virtually all physical



6
components of this project. Excessive Government control over procurement decisions was identified in
the SAR as a risk which could delay implementation of the project.
24.    Throughout most of the implementation period, CEB was not in compliance with the ROR
covenant. Tariff increases, which are subject to approval from the Cabinet of Ministers were neither
timely nor adequate.
D.    Project Sustainability
25.   Upon completion, the project will be part of CEB's integrated transmission and distribution
system. Total generation has grown at an average of 8.5 percent over the last five years to reach 5,100
GWh in 1997, and peak demand has grown at the rate of 6.9 percent over the same period to reach 1,037
MW that year. Electricity sales in 1997 reached 4,200 GWh and per capita consumption, 230 kWh.
About 50 percent of the population has access to electricity, a ratio that has increased significantly from
only 29 percent in 1990. However, over 1991-1995 CEB's investments dropped steadily from SLRs 6.7
billion to SLRs 3.8 billion, an annual average of less than SLRs 5 billion or less than US$ 100 million.
Considerable amount of work has been carried out to assess the investment needs of Sri Lanka's power
sector over the next 10 years. A Japan International Cooperation Agency study indicates that the
investment needs for generation, transmission and distribution is about US$ 300 million per year for the
next 10 years. Under a "business as usual" scenario, the funding available from CEB internal resources
and from the donors would be in the range of US$ 120 to US$ 175 million. The annual financing gap
could thus be of the order of US$ 150 million. In view of the country's fiscal position, it is unlikely that
GOSL could meet this funding gap. Private investment in the sector will be necessary to mobilize the
additional financing required. GOSL is considering a series of reform measures which would create an
enabling environment for private participation in the sector. This project has enhanced GOSL's ability to
reform and rationalize the power sector by bringing distribution systems that were operated by different
licensees into the CEB fold. This will facilitate GOSL's objectives of creating a limited number of viable
independent distribution companies by restructuring CEB' s existing distribution activities.
E.    IDA Performance
26.   This project was intended to complement the activities started under the IDA financed Power
Distribution and Transmission Project (Credit 1933-CE), which had objectives very similar to this
project: to streamline the organization of the power distribution system; rehabilitate and expand
distribution systems managed by licensees; and implement CEB's least-cost transmission program. The
project was consistent with IDA's lending strategy for combining institution building with partial
financing of CEB's investment program to ensure a balanced and cost-effective development of the
electricity supply infrastructure in the country. IDA assisted CEB in preparation of the project and
identified distinct components consistent with GOSL's sectoral policies, CEB's least-cost expansion plan
and IDA's strategy for sector development. All technical, financial, economic, institutional and
environmental aspects were reviewed carefully and incorporated into the scope of the project wherever
necessary. During appraisal, it was determined that CEB would require technical assistance for
preparation of design and bidding documents and for training its staff in critical areas. Required
provisions were made in the project for fmancing such measures. The project was regularly supervised
by IDA staff with missions every six months during project implementation. The skills mix of mission
staff and duration of the missions were adequate, and recomnendations of the missions were reflected in
the country implementation reviews. The missions identified-implementation problems and made timely
recommendations for remedial measures. However, such were not always implemented on time resulting
in the Credit closing while several components were incomplete. Had IDA taken a stronger position on
CEB's unsatisfactory performance on the physical components and continued default on the ROR



7
covenant, the outcome of the project might have been better. On the whole, IDA's performance is
considered satisfactory.
F.    Borrower's Performance
27.   The project was prepared in accordance with accepted standards for power sector development
and CEB's long-term expansion program CEB clearly recognized the importance of rationalizing the
power distribution system and the need to upgrade and expand the transmission network. However, the
project was plagued with procurement delays due to GOSL's protracted procurement process. These
problems combined with poor quality equipment and supplies in some of the physical components of the
project, resulted in inordinate delays that prevented the construction works from being completed prior to
Credit closure. As a result, CEB wil have to finance approximately US$ 6.6 million of investments out
of its own resources to meet contractual obligations for work completed after Credit closure. While CEB
had dedicated project staff for the transmission component, the distribution component was part of the
daily activities of provincial staff involved in CEB's electricity distribution work. Had there been a
dedicated project management unit for the distribution component with adequate staff and labor, the
rehabilitation work could have been accomplished more effectively. Progress reports were prepared for
the project in a timely manner and were adequate for IDA to monitor the performance of the project.
CEB cooperated fully with IDA supervision missions. The provision of counterpart funds from the CEB
was timely and adequate. The training component was fully utilized. On the whole, CEB's performance
was satisfactory. The performance of GOSL in the areas of procurement and power tariff regulation,
however, was not fully satisfactory. For implementation aspects, the project was rated as a problem
project from late 1993 to April 1996 because of the delays in procurement and non-compliance with
covenants.
G.    Assessment of Outcome
28.   The project has achieved its sectoral and institutional objectives in a satisfactory manner. The
physical objectives will also be substantially achieved, albeit with a delay. CEB's financial performance
was, however not fully satisfactory with CEB failing to meet the ROR target throughout the project
period, except for one year. The project costs were within the estimates of the SAR. The disbursement
ratio was reasonably good, with approximately 85 percent of the Credit being utilized. The re-calculated
ERR, using actual figures from CEB for the period 1991-1998 is still over 12 percent and is considered
satisfactory.
29.   The outcome of the project has highlighted some of the limitations of the CEB model. CEB's
lack of autonomy is demonstrated in the long procurement processes that led to serious project
implementation delays. CEB's inability to function as a commercial entity and recover its full costs by
realistic tariffs resulted in inadequate financial performance. Due to the above considerations, the overall
assessment of the project has been rated as marginally satisfactory.
H.    Future Operations
30.   An operational plan was agreed with CEB during the final supervision mission. The plan
provides for technical inputs from CEB at regular intervals. It also addresses issues required for
satisfactory future financial management of the project, including a commitment from CEB to allocate
adequate funds for completion of the physical works components. Implementation of the plan will be
monitored by IDA during preparation of the proposed Power Sector Restructuring Project.



8
31.   In view of inadequate financial resources for the required level of investment in the sector,..
GOSL has resolved to reform the power sector to attract private investment. GOSL has made a
commitment that all future thermal power generation projects will be executed through the private sector.
As such, some Independent Power Producers have already been contracted, and GOSL is currently
evaluating proposals from private investors for a new 150-MW combined cycle power plant. IDA's
sector assistance strategy will be targeted towards sector restructuring in order to increase efficiency and
create an enabling environment for private investments.
I.     Key Lessons Learned
32.    The following key lessons are identified:
(i)    advance procurement actions (hiring of consultants, appointment of contractors, etc.)
should be part of various stages of project preparation and processing;
(ii)    CEB's authority to handle procurement, independently of GOSL, should be enhanced;
(iii)   CEB's institutional structure should enable effective project implementation with
adequate autonomy--this is likely to require incorporation under the Companies Act;
(iv)   project implementation should be entrusted to staff dedicated to that task;
(v)    the security situation should be properly evaluated, and works in areas prone to civil
unrest should not be included in future projects;
(vi)   an independent regulatory regime to determine tariffs is necessary for the financial
viability of the sector; and
(vii)  private investments and operations should be promoted to complement public resources;
(viii)  at appraisal, attention should have been given to financial management in general, and
the submission of audited accounts on a timely basis in particular.

SRI LANKA
SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
CREDIT 2297-CE
FINAL SUPERVISION MISSION
May 18-June 4, 1998
AIDE MEMOIRE'
1.    An IDA mission comprising Sumith Pilapitiya, Vijay Iyer, Lennart Carlsson, Joan Pullenayegem
and Julitta Rasiah undertook final supervision of the Second Power Distribution and Transmission
Project during the period May 18-June 4, 1998. The project is scheduled to close on June 30, 1998.
2.    The mission would like to thank the officials and staff of the Ministry of Irrigation, Power and
Energy (MIPE), the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)
for all the courtesies and assistance extended to the mission members. This Aide Memoire summarizes
the mission's findings and the agreements reached with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and CEB
at the wrap-up meeting held on May 29, 1998 and is subject to conformation by ]DA management.
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
3.    An overall assessment of progress of activities under the project clearly demonstrates that
performance is unsatisfactory. The project was declared effective in 1991. The project implementation
has been consistently plagued with procurement problems, resulting in unacceptable delays. With all
major procurement under the credit completed by June 1997, the mission noted that the disbursement
over the last year was about 100 percent more than the cumulative disbursements over the last six years.
However, with just one month remaining before credit closure, the overall disbursement ratio for the
project has been only 56 percent. The pace of implementation of the larger investment components are
well behind schedule. The CEB defaulted on the 8 percent Rate of Return (ROR) covenant in 1996 and
1997; the information provided to the mission indicates that the CEB will be in default on this covenant
in 1998. Under these circumstances, whereas CEB management has made a request for a nine-month
extension of the credit closing date, the mission does not recommend an extension.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Transmission Component
4.    Lot A: 132 kV Rantambe - Badulla and Kotmale Lines. A supply and erect contract (US$ 3.2
million) was awarded in November 1993 with contract completion by May 31, 1996. Although there
were substantial delays due to design and manufacturing difficulties, the 37 km Rantambe - Badulla line
has been completed, and the Take-Over-Certificate (TOC) will be issued shortly. The eight km Kotmale
- Kurunduwatta spur line has also been finished and the works are now being checked out by CEB. The
lines can, however, not be energized until Lot B has been completed.
I     The text of the Aide Memoire has been altered to remove the names of consultants and contractors.

Page 2 of 9
5.    Lot B: 132 kV Substations at Rantambe. Badulla and Kotmale. The contract (US$ 1.6 million)
for the turn-key supply of these three substations was in February 1993, with contract completion by
February 1995. Most of the equipment has been sourced in India. There were quality problems with
some relay panels and steel structures that have been resolved. The main problem, however, has been
and still is with 11 disconnect switches.
6.    The original disconnectors were supplied to the sites, but rejected before erection due to
corrosion of the galvanized steel parts as well as other deficiencies. They were replaced by the supplier,
but the same quality problems re-occurred. In September 1997, the supplier was given a second chance
to correct the problems and agreed to supply a new and improved design. The first disconnector of the
new design was supplied and installed in February 1998. Even though the new design is a clear
improvement, it does not fully meet CEB's requirements in all aspects. The remaining 10 disconnectors
have just been delivered and their installation will commence in early June.
7.    It is the mission's opinion, that CEB should have acted more forcefully, and exercised its
contractual right to procure the disconnectors from other sources and deduct the cost from the contract
price, as was agreed with IDA in December 1996. At present, this does not appear to be an option, but
CEB should use its right to claim maximum liquidated damages for delay. Neither the 5 percent payment
at PAC nor the 5 percent at FAC would be due before the closing of the credit.
8.    The mission takes serious note of the fact that even after three years from the date that this
contract was scheduled to be completed, the substations are not ready and the transmission lines (Lot A)
cannot be energized.
9.    Lot C: 220 kV Kotmale - Anuradhapura Line. The procurement of this 165 km line was
delayed by about two years. However, a supply and erect contract was subsequently signed on October
2, 1996. The contract calls for completion in January 1999, which is after the credit closing date of June
30, 1998. This is a result of the late award of the contract. The contract amount is US$ 8.5 million plus
SLRs 132 million.
10.   The contractor is well behind schedule and as of April 30, 1998 the situation is as follows:
_________ __   |Planned (%)    Actual (%)
Supply of material      90.0           65.5
Foundations             410 (87)       99 (21)
Tower erection          350 (74.3      -
Overall work progress    85.8          45.9
11.   As is evident from this table, the main problem is in the area of foundation construction, where
the contractor in using two local subcontractors in addition to his own crews. The rate of foundation
construction is at best 35 foundation groups/month. Tower erection has started during May 1998.

Annex A
Page 3 of 9
12.   The consultant estimates that about US$ 2.2 million plus SLRs 88 million will remain unpaid at
the loan closing date. This amount includes the 5 + 5 percent retention money to be paid at PAC and
FAC respectively and about US$ 0.5 million of tower material that will not be delivered before June 30,
1998. The presently expected completion date is May - June 1999, i.e. 5 - 6 months behind schedule.
This, however, assumes that there is no disruption of the payments to the contractor as a result of the
credit closing. A total of approximately US$ 3.6 million of GOSL resources is required to complete this
component of the project. The mission was assured by the Chairman that CEB's own funds will be made
available for completion of this component upon credit closure.
13.   Lot D: 220 kV  substations at Kotmale and Anuradhapura. and Reactive Compensation
Equipment. The financing of this lot was taken over from IDA by NORAD, SIDA and NDF. The lot
includes the two substations at the endpoints of the Lot C line and a 6*5 MVAr switched shunt capacitor
bank at the Kotugoda substation near Colombo.
14.   The shunt capacitor installation was commissioned in late April 1998, three months ahead of
schedule. It has substantially improved the voltage in the Colombo area.
15.   Pre-commissioning tests of the Kotmale 220 kV substation extension are presently being
performed and it is estimated that it will be commissioned on June 28, one month ahead of schedule.
16.   Equipment erection is nearing completion in the New Anuradhapura 220/132/33 kV substation.
It is expected that the station will be completed in January 1999, five months ahead of schedule.
17.   All equipment for these substations have been sourced in Sweden, Norway and Germany. There
have been no problems with any of the Lot D contracts.
18.   Lot E: 220 kV Substations at Kelantissa and Biyagama. Although IDA approved the bidding
documents for the above contract in October 1996, the bidding process was protracted and final contract
award was in June 1997. This delay occurred in spite of an agreement with CEB that the contract award
should be made by March 31, 1997, so that this component could be completed prior to credit closing.
Civil works at the site was delayed further by an additional 82 days due to the bomb blast at the boundary
of the Kelanitissa Power Station. At present, the site investigations have been completed and the civil
works design is approximately 85 percent complete. CEB anticipates that 30 percent of the erection will
be completed by credit closure while it is expected that construction will be completed by February 1999.
The mission was informed that the equipment manufacture is on schedule with all equipment except for
the transformers having been manufactured and tested successfully. The mission was informed that
transformer testing has just commenced. If the testing of transformers are successful as well, the
contractor proposes to ship the equipment to Sri Lanka in mid-June. The equipment is scheduled to
arrive in Sri Lanka several months prior to the site being ready. The mission urges CEB management to
ensure that the equipment is properly stored until the site is ready so that the US$ 21.4 million investment
is not jeopardized.

19.   The CEB expects to disburse approximately 90 percent of the CIF component which is financed
under the credit, prior to closure. This, however, means that CEB will have to pay about US$ 3 million
from its own or GOSL resources for the 5 percent + 5 percent retention money, under this contract. The
mission informed CEB management that CEB will be liable to pay for the completion of this component.
The Chairman has assured the mission that CEB funds will be allocated for this component as well.
20.   Lot F: Upgrading of 132 kV Kelantissa Line to 220 kV. CEB awarded a contract for US$
114,199 plus 32,850.49 for upgrading of the above mentioned line, in May 1997. The mission was
pleased to note that all work under this component has been completed.
Distribution Component
21.   All of the 22 municipal distribution systems have now been taken over by CEB. The last one,
Ratnapura Municipal Council system was taken over during the latter part of 1997. The mission was
informed, that even a few of the 34 distribution systems in the Northern Province, which were agreed to
be excluded in April 1996 due to security reasons, have now been taken over. CEB is now contracting
with private generators to supply power to isolated parts of the distribution system in the north. These
generators are being moved to other, more remote areas when supply from the 33 kV grid is established.
22.   The upgrading of the distribution systems that have been taken over has suffered from the
protracted procurement process.
Procurement Problems
23.   Although there are a number of cases where contractors have shown poor performance, the main
cause of the delays in implementing the investments financed under this credit has been the exceptionally
slow procurement process for all CEB contracts. This risk was identified in IDA's Staff Appraisal
Report for the project dated June 28, 1991, as it had been a major problem in previous IDA financed
projects.
24.   Under the World Bank's recently adopted procurement rules it is very unlikely that any CEB
procurement could have taken place under the procurement procedure that is currently being followed by
CEB. The Bank can now refuse an application for extension of the bid validity time in excess of eight
weeks and require that award of contract be made within the prescribed bid validity time period. If the
implementing agency fails to award a contract on time, the Bank may declare misprocurement and will
normally not accept a rebidding.
25.   It is evident, that the Government of Sri Lanka needs to empower CEB with the right to make its
own procurement decisions, and that CEB must develop the necessary procurement procedure to be able
to function in an efficient manner. The current slow and complicated procurement process is not only
causing major delays in new investments but is also causing delays in the procurement of vital spare parts
for power plants, substations, etc. resulting in a large waste of existing resources. The present situation
is crippling the CEB in a way that is detrimental to the development of the country.

Technical Assistance
Training of CEB Staff
26.   The credit provided approximately US$ 800,000 under this component (US$ 745,000 for general
training of CEB staff and US$ 55,000 for exposing CEB and MIPE staff to power sector reforms). There
is an accumulated balance of about US$ 44,600 available to date. Of this CEB has committed US$
40,575 for additional training of CEB staff which will be utilized prior to credit closure. The unutilized
balance from the training allocation will be approximately US$ 4,000 at the end of the credit. The DGM
- Training informed the mission that a proposal to utilize the balance for a Distance Education Course
will be sent to IDA by June 15, 1998.
Status of Studies financed under the Credit
27.   Management Information System Study CEB signed an agreement in July 1994, to carry out an
MIS upgrading study. The study was estimated to cost Can$1,048,536 and 4,499,371. In July 1996, the
CATB had approved a further contract increase of Can$ 217,533 and 1,116,000 on account of additional
eight staff months consultancy (the consultant left Sri Lanka in September 1996 after completing his
assignment). Although an IDA supervision mission had reviewed the justification and agreed to it during
September 1995, CEB has been unable to get the amendment to the contract which reflects these
changes. CEB had paid for this extension with its own resources without an amended contract.
Subsequently, the firm ceased to be in existence and CEB is unable to get the amendment to the contract
signed. The mission has informed the CEB that the credit is unable to pay for this extension without an
amended contract, therefore. CEB may have to absorb this cost.
Financial Issues'
28.   During 1996 and 1997 CEB's financial performance deteriorated substantially.  Poor
hydrological conditions in those two years led to costly temporary measures such as purchase of power
from private generators and provision of incentives for import of generator sets. An ADB mission in
February 1998 has pointed out that CEB is in violation of the crucial minimum rate of return on net fixed
assets covenant in 1996 and 1997. This observation has been confirmed by this mission and it also notes
that without tariff adjustments in the current fiscal year. CEB would continue to be in violation of this
covenant. Besides ensuring compliance, tariff increases are also necessary to restore CEB's financial
health in the wake of the problems of 1996-97.
29.   CEB has submitted the audited accounts for the year ended December 1996 to the Bank. This is
presently under review. The CEB is yet to forward the audited accounts for 1997. The mission was also
provided with the draft financial statements for 1997 (under audit) and projections for 1998-2000 by
CEB. Based on these statements, the key indicators for gauging CEB's financial performance are
summarized in the following table.
l     Figures in this section have been revised subsequently.

30.   CEBs Rate of Return: The ADB Mission of February 1998 estimated a negative rate of return
for fiscal 1997 based on provisional data made available at the time. The financial data for 1997 made
available to the Bank mnission indicates that the ROR would be closer to 1.5 percent of the average value
of net fixed assets. This computation does not follow some of the more rigorous assumptions used by
ADB - such as not allowing interest earned as part of income. However, it is clear that even with
generous treatment of income indicators, CEB does not achieve the covenanted 8 percent rate of return in
1997. For 1998, based on the latest provisional numbers provided by CEB to the mission, the ROR is
expected to be in the range of 6 percent. The detailed computations are shown in Annex 1. Based on the
projections for 1999 and 2000 made available to the mission and in a scenario of no tariff increases, the
situation with regard to the rate of return covenant is not likely to improve and in fact appears to
deteriorate.
31.   The following issues are relevant to CEB 's financial performance.
(a)    The KHD thermal power IPP is expected to be commissioned by July 1, 1998. An
output of 27 Gwh per month will be purchased at a rate of between US cents 7-8 per
Kwh (Rs. 4.40 per Kwh at current exchange rate of 1US$ = SLRs 63) depending on the
price at which fuel will be supplied. Power purchase payments of nearly SLRs 650
million in 1998 and around SLRs 1650 million per annum in 1999, rising to SLRs 1800
in year 2000 would need to be made to KHD. At about 350 Gwh per annum the KHD
plant represents an addition of about 8 percent to the net power availability in Sri Lanka.
The pre-KHD tariff of SLRs 4.50 per unit needs to increase to SLRs 4.85, in order for
CEB to pay for the power without incurring any additional financial burden (assuming
that system losses remain at or below 17 percent).
(b)    The Government has with effect from April 1, 1998 eliminated the 7 percent business
turnover tax (BTT) payable by CEB. This has been replaced by a general sales tax of
12.5 percent, but this is levied in addition to the tariff and is appropriated by government.



26
Annex A
Page 7 of 9
The GST applies only to consumers with more than 90 Kwh of consumption in the
month. This ceiling eliminates nearly 75 percent of the domestic consumers from paying
this tax. To CEB the benefit of eliminating BTT translates into an effective tariff
increase of nearly 6 percent. The computations shown in the table above reflect this
change from April 1 onwards.
(c)    CEB is anticipating government approval for importing fuel directly at Singapore spot
mnarket rates. Together with the anticipated reduction of fuel taxes, CEB is assuming
substantial savings in its fuel costs and is making a case for tariff decreases! The
mission would like to caution against any such steps based on anticipated cost reductions
which may not materialize. Buying fuel at spot market rates may make sense at today's
depressed oil prices. However, without an assurance of steady supply and hedging and
indexation provisions to insure against market changes and upward movements in oil
prices, this could be a potentially risky strategy.
(d)    The mission recommends that average tariffs be increased with effect from July 1, 1998
to SLRs 5.07 representing a 12.5 percent increase. This is recommended to be followed
up by similar increases in 1999 and 2000 to restore CEB's financial health and facilitate
its recovery from the crises in 1996 and 1997. This recommendation is also consistent
with the ADB mission recommendations. Increases across consumer categories should
be made to reduce cross subsidies on domestic consumers, since 75 percent of such
consumers are already benefiting from being under the consumption ceiling that triggers
payment of GST. The scenarios for 1998-2000 with and without these tariff increases
are shown in Annex 1. The mission was told that a 12.5 percent tariff increase is in fact
being contemplated and that the CEB intends to apply this and future increases across the
various consumer categories so as to eliminate the subsidies on the domestic sector,
particularly on the 0-90 Kwh per month consumption category.
(e)    The present credit is closing on June 30, 1998. In view of the fact that the project has
performed poorly and the state of CEB's financial performance, it is unlikely that an
extension would be considered. The ongoing and outstanding works will require an
investment of nearly SLRs 430 million spread over the period from July 1998 to June
1999. This funding would have to be from CEB resources. This additional resource
generation would also be facilitated by the suggested tariff increases mentioned in (d).
Other Proiect Aspects
32.   Financial Accounts and Disbursements. Unaudited financial accounts of the CEB were given to
the mission. CEB has informed the mission the audited accounts will be available by June 30, 1998.
Actual disbursement as of June 4, 1998 is approximately US$ 29 million. Although, disbursements
under the project have improved, it is still only 55 percent of the credit proceeds. With approximately a
month left prior to credit closing, the mission is very concerned that almost 45 percent of the credit
remains undisbursed.'
l     Just prior to Credit closure, CEB submitted large claims so that eventually, more than 87 percent of the
Credit was withdrawn.

Lonig Term Generation and Transmission Expansion Studies
33.   The Mission has reviewed CEB's Long Term Generation Expansion Planning Study for the
period 1998 - 2012 issued by CEB in December 1997 and the Master Plan Study for Development of the
Transmission System of Ceylon Electricity Board performed by JICA and issued in January 1997.
34.   The generation expansion study's main load growth scenario assumes an average 8.1 percent p.a.
load growth during the studied period. There are also a low growth scenario of 7.1 percent and a high
growth scenario of 9.1 percent. During the five year period 1992 - 96 the average load growth was 8.8
percent p.a. and the corresponding average demand growth 6.9 percent p.a.
35.   The present generation system is dominated by hydro with 1115 MW installed capacity. The
CEB thermal capacity is 391 MW (derated capacity). During recent years hydro has supplied on the
average 90 percent of the energy, exceptions being the drought years of 1992 and 1996 where thermal
generation was 18 percent and 28 percent respectively.
36.   The remaining exploitable hydro capacity is limited and also relatively expensive. Sri Lanka
therefore stands on the threshold to a new era where thermal power is going to play an increasingly
important role. As there are no domestic thermal fuel resources, future generation expansion will have to
be based on imported oil and coal.
37.   Thermal generation projects are well suited for development by the private sector, and GOSL is
encouraged to invite Independent Private Power developers to build the necessary thermal generation
plants. This is already happening to some extent, but this policy should be pursued in a consistent way.
Public financing resources could then be concentrated on the investment needs in the transmission,
distribution and rural electrification areas.
38.   The generation expansion plan seems to have been done in a competent manner using the
WASP3 software and assuming five different hydrological conditions. The least cost generation
expansion program for the base case envisages the following generation additions during the next few
years:

39.   The coal fired plants would most probably have been scheduled earlier if it had not been
considered unrealistic to commission such a plant before 2004. In the low growth scenario, which
appears more realistic, there are no gas turbine plants until 2010. The mission was informed that no
preparations are underway for the 105 MW gas turbine plant scheduled for year 2000. Bids will be
received shortly for one of the 150 MW Combined Cycle plants as an lPP. Considering the large
proportion of hydro power in the country, it is evident, that there is a need for base load plants. CEB is
proposing the construction of coal fired plants, which appears to be a sound approach as the analysis
clearly shows that coal fired plants provide the lowest cost when operated at a plant factor of 60 percent
or above. These stations are in fact expected to operate at about 80 percent plant factor.
40.   The use of coal negatively affects the global environment, local eco-systems and public health
due to air pollution. In addition to these emissions, the ash residue and wastewater from coal combustion
raise further environmental issues. A very important task for Sri Lanka is to balance the conflicting
demands of economic growth and increased demand for power with environmental impacts that can be
considered reasonable for sustainable development. However, countries like Sri Lanka which are
grappling with impending power and capital shortages should avail itself of recent advances in the field
and be able to select cost effective, environmentally friendly technologies for coal based power
generation.
41.   The introduction of thermal power with imported fuel on a large scale will make it very
important to use electricity in a rational way. This can only be achieved by setting tariffs that reflect the
true cost of providing power to the various customer categories. This will without doubt necessitate
substantial tariff increases. Cross subsidies should also be eliminated. If there are social reasons to
subsidize the very smallest domestic consumers, this should be preferably be done in a transparent
manner through the government's budget so as not to burden CEB's finances with this obligation. If
necessary tariff adjustments are not done, CEB's finances will rapidly deteriorate and CEB will become a
burden on the country's finances.
Implementation Completion Report
42.   The mission left CEB with guidelines for the preparation of the Borrowers Evaluation Report of
the project that will be annexed to IDA's Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission
requested CEB to identify a coordinator for the preparation of the CEB's Evaluation Report. The
mission was informed by the Chairman that Mr. D. C. Wijeratne, Additional General Manager
(Transmrission) will coordinate the preparation of the Borrowers Evaluation Report and the information
for the ICR. An IDA ICR mission will be fielded during the month of August.
Agreements with CEB
43.   It was agreed with Chairman, CEB that CEB's own resources will be made available to make
payments under the on-going contracts once the credit closes. This amounts to a total of approximately
US$ 6.6 million. It was agreed that a letter confirming this agreement will be sent to IDA prior to June
30, 1998.

BORROWER'S EVALUATION
1.    BORROWER'S ASSESSMENT
A.    Introduction
1.    In December 15t, 1991 an IDA Credit of SDR 37.5 Million (equivalent to US $ 50.0 M) was
approved by IDA Board for GOSL/CEB to plan, design and implement a Second Power Distribution and
Transmission Project and the details as follows:
a. Distribution Rehabilitation Component (Part A of schedule II of DCA)
Rehabilitation of Distribution system take over by CEB of 56 licensees
b. Transmission Expansion (Part B of schedule II of DCA)
1. 132kV substations at Rantambe, Badulla and Kotmale with about 45km of Tr.lines.
2. 220kV line from Anuradhapura to Kotmale
3. 220kV substations at Anuradhapura and Kotmale
4. Reactive compensation equipment at related stations.
c. Technical assistance (Part C of schedule II of DCA)
1. Training of CEB officials
2. Consultancy services for various technical studies, Preparation of bid documents and
- specifications for 220kV Transmission works, Power system protection study and MIS
upgrading study.
B.    Project Objectives
2.    The principal objectives were:
*    to support further rationalization of Power distribution to reduce system losses in the
distribution systems operated by 56 licensees which could not be taken over under the
Power Distribution and Transmission Project IDA Cr. 1933-CE and improve quality of
electricity supply.
*    to provide additional transmission and grid substation systems facilities to help/mneet the
projected demand of supply North Central, Northern Eastern, Uva and Part of the Central
Provinces.
*    to assist in the preparation of Upper Kotmale Hydro Power project to ensure its
development in a technologically, environmentally and socio-economically sound manner
and
*    to further strengthen CEB' s institutional capacity.

3.    To achieve the above objectives, the following project components of the project were designed.
(I)    DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES SYSTEMS
Studies were conducted on the electricity distribution systems of Sri Lanka by the CEB
under "Distribution Master Plan" and it was revealed that LA distribution systems
suffered from Heavy Voltage drop and Power losses in LV lines. This resulted in a poor
service to the consumers and a national loss of valuable electrical energy. This situation
was expected to grow worse year after year with more consumers adding to the system
and with the growth of electricity demand. No scientific programme to study, design or
implement the improvements needed to arrest the above situation was underway in any
of the local authorities. Therefore CEB launched an intensive design program using
computer techniques AIvMI at rectifying this.
(It)   TRANSMISSION WORKS
LOT A
-  Construction of 37km 132kV Transmission line between Rantambe Power station to
Badulla   Grid Substation of single circuit Lynx conductor with provision for
stringing the second circuit with similar conductor under hot line conditions.
*  Construction of 8km 132kV Transmission Line between Kotmale Power station to
Kurunduwatta Spur line of double circuit Lynx conductor for looping 132kV
Polpitiya Anuradhapura Transmission Line into Kotmale Power station.
LOT B
*  At Kotmale 132kV SS
Construction of a 132kV busbar with three new circuit breakers, two for additional
Polpitiya & Kiribathkumbura feeders and for the bus coupler which connects the
new and existing bays.
*  At Badulla 132kV SS
Construction of a new 132kV feeder bay and connected to existing 132kV single
busbar using two disconnecting switches and one circuit breakers.
*  At Rantambe 132kV SS

LOT -C
Construction of 165km, 220kV double circuit steel tower transmission line single circuit
strung with single ACSR Zebra between Kotmale PS to new Anuradhapura GSS
LOT -D
*  Construction of 2 nos. 220kV transformer bays along the 100 MVA 220/132/33kV
transformers at Anuradhapura Grid Substation.
*  Construction of 220kV  line bay at new 220kV  Anuradhapura Grid Substation
with provision for an additional bay.
*  Construction of 220kV  line bay at existing 220kV Kotmale Grid Substation with
provision for additional bay.
* Construction of 2 Nos. 132kV transformer bays at Anuradhapura to interlink with
existing 132kV Substation.
*  Static Reactive compensation with switchgear and other allied equipment to be
connected to existing bus bars such as at Pannipitiya GSS, Anuradhapura GSS and
Matugama GSS.
4.    Subsequently in 1996, GOSUCEB decided that Lot D to be executed under financial assistance
from Norad funds. IDA at the request of GOSLUCEB agreed to permit CEB to use the saving to construct
220kV Kelanitissa Biyagama Tr. work and to carry out a thorough rehabilitation of the Kandy
distribution system subject to CEB adherence to and agreed a procurement schedule.
(M)   Technical Training
5.    Credit under training is utilized in the training of senior managers, engineers and accounts by
way of visits to power sector utilities in different countries attending seminar of BOO/BOT and
restructuring studies financial management, business strength, forecasting programmes, operational
maintenance of low and high voltage distribution, protection study, procurement study.
(IV)      Management Information System Upgrade Project
* Design
The MIS of CEB was a paper based system and all the functional systems except
billing was paper based. The CEB Management did not receive timely and accurate
management information, for decision making. It was very difficult to trace back any
previous transactions occurred which are recorded in various paper documents.
6.    The objective of the project is to computerize five functional areas of CEB namely.
1. Material Management
2. Finance and Accounting
3. Project Management
4. Human Resource and Payroll
5. Billing and Consumer Services - only the MIS

Annex B
Page 4 of 9
7.    The consultancy services for the project is funded by 2297CE.
Detailed Project Implementation:
The consultants, Ontario Hydro International, Canada, submitted a findings report with
recommendations to tender for off-the-shelf packages for computerizing the above. CEB
accepted the proposal and OHII prepared the specifications for tendering. It was decided to
implement the systems at two pilot sites; Head Office and WPN Province with the intention
to deploy at other CEB sites if successful.
8.    CEB funded the software / hardware and implementation costs.
*  Implementation
Six offers were received and an integrated package with Material management and
Accounting called MITF in was selected. There were no acceptable solutions for other
functions.
The LAN-WAN infrastructure is installed by CEB funds and the microwave project.
The supplier MIT Ltd., has developed a job costing system to suit CEB's specific needs.
Also Tender monitoring, Purchase / Sub contracting modules are developed to suit the needs
to Procurement Branch-
By now (end of 1998) WPN Provincial Office implementation is completed.
Central Stores is computerized and linked to Head Office. The Head Office sites are in
varying degrees of implementation mainly depending on the support from users.
*  Operation Experience
The major factors affected in implementation are:
1. The degree of user support
2. The adherence to accepted procedure, prompt resolution of issues consistency (or the
lack of the above)
3. Delays in procurement and installing the infrastructure and the breakdowns of
infrastructure.
4. The complexity of CEB' s operational procedure
*  Plans:
Implementation commenced at WPS Office, it is planned to deploy at other
province/complex offices in phases.
A system study is commenced to:
1. Extend the computerization to Areas & Deports.
2. To cover the missing components of a provincial setup.

9.    The work implemented and the progress as a percentage of scope as at end of June 1998, is given
below.
New MV Lines                     -      57 km
New Substations                  -      124 km
New LV Lines                     -      183 km

Substation Augmentation          -         10 nos
Service connection Rehab.        -     46,000 nos
Meter Replacement                -     20,000 nos
Primary Substations & KMC sys.   -         2 nos
10.   The overall progress based on the value of work completed upto end of June 1998 is 60 percent.
11.   The main reasons for the delays are as follows:
i.  Design changes necessary to incorporate the needs of the fast developing Loads.
ii.  CEB's resources had to be shared by several simultaneous projects while the provincial
construction units at the same time had to cope with shifting priorities thus disrupting plans
and programmes.
iii. Lengthy procurement procedures.
iv. The private sector construction units in the country were small in number at the start of the
project and time was needed for theses units to be established and trained for them to be
utilized by the CEB in the Project work.
12.   The work has been handled by the provincial units of the CEB utilizing the CEB's own work
force as well as contractor gangs on short time contract basis. CEB's own vehicles and construction
equipment procured under other projects as well as under this project have been utilized for the work.
The contractor gangs have been using their own vehicles, tools and construction equipment.
13.   The major and essential work is expected to be completed by the 315' of December 1998, while
the balance work consisting mainly of the improvement and expansion work of the Ratnapura Municipal
council scheme taken over recently and rehabilitation of 11kV underground system in the enhanced
Kandy Municipal Council scheme would continue up to December 1999, as organization of work and
supply interruptions are complex and need co-ordination with other utilities.

Transmission
Lot A
The turnkey project for the construction of 37km of 132kV double cct. tower line single circuit
strung (Lynx conductor) between Rantambe and Badulla and 8km of 132 kV double cct tower
line with lynx conductor looping 132kV Polpitiya/Anuradhapura Tr. Line to Kotmale PS was
awarded to a foreign contractor at a total estimated cost of USD 2,930,965.00 + SLRs
32,963,208.50 on 1st Nov. 1993 with a target completion of 31-05-96. However the project
commenced only on 19th May 1994, and were completed and put into commercial operation on
28" March 1998 and the reason for the delay being.
* The design fabrication and testing of transmission towers (manufactured by SAE, India) had
given problems.
* Kotmale Kurunduwatta 1.2km line section was deviated to avoid heavy Pile foundations.
* Special type towers of l9nos were proposed along the line route to cater uplift load and it
involved special design and testing of uplift. Later T3 and T6 towers were modified to cater
for uplift loads.
* Delay in supplying of foundation stubs and other materials.
Lot B
Construction of 4 nos. 132kV line bays and one 132kV bus coupler bay at Rantambe, Badulla
and Kotmale substations at total estimate cost of Deutsche Mark 421,118.00 plus US$
1,008,911.00 plus SFR. 295,141.00 plus SEK 397,534.00 plus SLR 11,498,131.90 was awarded
to joint venture of ABB Schaltanlagen GmbH (Germany) and Samuel Sons & Co. Ltd., Sri Lanka
on February 2, 1993. Target date of completion was February 8, 1995. The contractor was not
completed even at time of closing of the IDA loan and the reasons for delays being:
* All control and relay panels, most of the steel structures were rejected due to excessive
corrosion and poor quality and replaced by new items.
* Supplying of inferior quality material specially 145kV disconnector units were rejected twice
and the matter was then referred to a special committee appointed by the GM(CEB) and they
rejected total 1 Inos. 145kV disconnectors on 26t, August 1996.
*  On CEB's consent contractor erected one DS unit with modification at Kotmale SS on 19
February 1998 and took nearly five months to install balance 10 nos. DS units.
* The substation extension works at Rantambe has not been completed yet due to non
availability of Busbar protection scheme modules.

Lot C
Turnkey construction of 165km of 220kV double circuit Zebra conductors tower line with single
circuit strung between Kotmale power station and Anuradhapura GSS was awarded to joint
venture KEC International Ltd., and Best and Crompton Engineering Ltd., India on 20.05.96 at a
total estimate cost US $ 8,479,618.00 plus SLRs 132,192,703.00 with target completion date of
02.01.1999.
The work has really conmmenced on 2nd October 1996 and is presently expected to be completed
only by June 1999. The reasons for the delay being:
* Contractor delayed with the commencement of the site work by four months due to the
difficulties in obtaining registration of the joint venture in Sri Lanka and India.
*  Difficulty in access to the sites, 50 percent of the line route is passing through hilly terrain
and contractor has not equipped with mechanization and tools for work in such conditions.
E.    Operation Experience
14.   The works that are commissioned under the Project will integrate with the works in the normal
CEB Electricity Distribution System and the same organizational set up will be responsible for carrying
out the maintenance and operation of the works.
*  Organization Chart
The organization Chart of the CEB set up for the above is given below. The work is carried
out by the Depot Maintenance Staff under the direct supervision of the Depot
Superintendents and the Area Engineers are responsible to the Provincial Deputy General
Manager of the smooth functioning of the planned maintenance work.
*  Plant & Equipment Register
A plant & Equipment Register is maintained in each Depot giving the details of all lines,
substations and underground systems and this Register is updated regularly when newly
constructed works are added to the system.

Depot System Maintenance Register & Maintenance Planning
The details of Plant & Equipment of which regular maintenance has to be carried out are
extracted from the Plant & Equipment Register and entered on the Depot System
Maintenance Register. This register serves as a check list to ensure that maintenance of all
plant and equipment has be planned for each quarter. When the maintenance work carried
out during the quarter is entered in this register, any outstanding work would be reflected in
this register at the end of each quarter. When planning the work using the schedules of tasks,
frequencies, standard gang compositions and work standards, any deficiencies in staff
categories needed to plan all the periodic maintenance work would be immediately evident in
this system of planning and corrective action could be taken such as recruitment of staff,
engagement of contractor gangs or payment of incentives for work by staff over and above
the work standards fixed for a gang.
* Maintenance Progress
Electrical Superintendents of the Depots forward the Monthly Progress to the Area Engineers
who forward the details extracted from these reports to the Deputy General Managers of the
Provinces, at the same time deciding action to improve substandard performance as well as to
deal with an overload of work.



37
Annex B
Page 9 of 9
*  Substation Maintenance
Periodic checks and maintenance work of Distributions are carried out by Depot staff. In the
case of Primary substations the periodic checks are carried out by the substation staff while
the maintenance work is carried out by the Distribution Maintenance Engineer and his staff.
* System Operations
System Operations are carried out by the standby gangs in the depots with the help of
Primary Substation and Grid Substation staff. The operations are supervised by the
Electrical Superintendents of the Depots. The Central System Control Centre is regularly
informed of the systems operations carried out at 33kV.
F.    Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance
Distribution. Rehabilitation component
15.   The work required Modern technology and computer systems for interactive on-going system
designs and for identification of system changes and their incorporation in the Project during
implementation. The delays in purchase of such equipment and the non-availability of trained personnel
and expertise as a result of the exodus of technical staff was mainly responsible for the slow design work.
16.   Due to periods of Civil unrest affecting work and the fast changes in the country having to meet
the demands of growing industries as well as domestic loads, the implementation work was delayed.
Slow administrative systems inherent in the country and the lack of a proper incentive scheme to promote
work also contributed to these delays and as a result the Borrower Performance fell short of the
requirements needed for timely performance.
17.   Some of the Key lessons learned that may be useful in the future are as follows.
(i)  Large Projects to be carried out expediently require change of frame work of organizations.
To undertake such work as a separate project by identified staff.
(ii) Planning work should be facilitated with modern equipment such as computer systems to
be provided to the project planners at the pre-commencement stage.
(iii) Training of personnel on modern techniques.
(iv) Retention of trained personnel by offering incentives.
G.    Evaluation of Bank Performance
Distribution. Rehabilitation component
18.   One of the key lessons learned in negotiating with the Bank is that the conmmunication between
the Bank and the Borrower should be fast and all responses quick for speedy decisions and
implementation. The Bank should seriously consider incorporation special conditions in agreements with
Government of recipient countries for healthy changes to be introduced in purchase and adrninistrative
procedures prevailing in the countries.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(Credit-2297-CE)
Recalculation of Economic Rate of Return
1.    The ERR calculations for this ICR follow as far as practicable the methodology used in the SAR.
As the project forms an integral part of CEB's 1991-2000 investment program, the ERR calculations are,
as they were in the SAR, based on this program and not on the project. Actual data have been used up to
1998, and revised projections for 1999-2001 based on most recent available information. After year
2001, costs and benefits have been assumed to remain constant in real terms. The main features of the
ERR calculations are summarized below:
(a)    Capital costs for 1991 to 1998 have been taken out of CEB's books and taxes, duties and
revaluation adjustments have been removed; the estimates for 1999 and 2000 are based
on past investment trends and CEB's indication that all project works will be completed
by the end of 1999;
(b)    CEB's purchase of power and lease of generating capacity in recent years have been
excluded as not being related to the 1991-2000 investment program;
(c)   Incremental operating costs exclude depreciation and taxes; CEB's operating costs
defined in this manner have over the period 1992-1998 fluctuated between 2.1 percent
and 2.5 percent of gross fixed assets in operation; for the purpose of ERR calculations,
incremental operating costs have been assumed to equal 2.3 percent of accumulated
capital costs for CEB's 1991-2000 investment program;
(d)    Fuel costs for incremental power generated in 1991-1998 are based on CEB's actual fuel
costs and for 1999-2001 on CEB's Long Term Generation Expansion Planning Studies
(1998);
(e)    CEB's actual incremental revenues for 1992 to 1998 have been used, interest and other
non-operating income have been excluded and no deductions for turnover tax have been
made; for 1999, no tariff increase is expected, and for 2000 and 2001, annual increases
of 10 percent have been assumed; for the "willingness to pay" case, higher tariffs in real
terms - as demonstrated by consumers' willingness to pay in the past - have been used;
(f)    All nominal cash flows have been expressed in 1998 real terms using the IMF published
GDP deflator for 1991 to 1997 and the CPI for 1998 to 2001, i.e. 9 percent for 1998, 8
percent for 1999, 7 percent for 2000 and 6 percent for 2001; after 2001, all incremental
costs and benefits have been assumed to remain constant in real terms;
(g)    The useful life of the assets created under CEB's 1991 to 2000 investment program is
expected to end in 2025; no residual values have been considered.

ERR using average tariff as benefit proxy:  12.2%
2.     The cost and benefit streams presented above produce an ERR of 12.2 percent. If consumers'
proven willingness to pay is used, the ERR would be 14.8 percent. The indicated ERRs most likely
underestimate the real benefits of CEB's 1991-2000 investment program, as the calculations largely
reflect existing tariff levels and do not fully capture the consumer surplus.
3.    In its Operations Plan, CEB indicates that it intends to comply with the covenanted rate of return
of 8 percent. This would require a tariff increase of about 30 percent over current levels. If such an
increase is assumed to be in effect as from 2000, and maintained in real terms thereafter, the resulting
ERR would be 16.8 percent.
