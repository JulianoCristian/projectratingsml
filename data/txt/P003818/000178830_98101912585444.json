"The Fourth Transmigration Project will\n            settle 3,500 families at Muara Wahau and 2,500 families at\n            Sangkulirang in East Kalimantan. Each family will receive a\n            3.5 ha farm and a standard transmigration package including\n            1.25 ha of cleared land for houselots and food crops,\n            transportation to the site, a house, agricultural inputs and\n            subsistence supplies. Each family with assistance from\n            public from public estates will also establish 2.0 ha of\n            coconut. About 500 ha of coconut will be established by a\n            public estate at Muara Wahau. As both sites are forested,\n            commercially valuable timber will be recovered during land\n            clearing. The major risks associated with the project are\n            poor coordination of implementation and reduced crop yields\n            due to poor soil quality."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
