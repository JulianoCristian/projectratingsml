PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Morocco - Rabat Urban Development Project (Loan 1528-MOR)
PREFACE
This report outlines the history of the Rabat Urban Development
Project (Loan 1528-MOR), examines its implementation performance, and
highlights its achievements and problems. The Loan (US$18 million) was closed
on March 31, 1984 after its original closing date (March 31, 1982) was
extended twice. The last disbursement was made on December 7, 1984 foL a
total of US$7.93 million and the loan balance of US$10.07 million was
cancelled.
The report is based on information in the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 1800-MOR) of February 3, 1978, a project evaluation report prepared by
the Institut National d'Amenagement et d'Urbanisme (INAU), interviews with
Bank and Borrower staff, the project files, and data collected by a project
completion mission which visited Morocco in February 1985.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit repcrting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were
received.

sites and services, cost recovery, etc., thereby serving as the basis for
building a solid urban lending program in Morocco; and (ii) address structural
problems in the infrastructure, social service, and employment sectors of
Rabat's 7th Municipal Ward.
In order to achieve these objectives, the project consisted of
infrastructure for nei,hborhood upgrading; development of sites and services
plots for residential as well as commercial and industrial use; loans for home
improvement and construction and for business development; improvement of
municipal services; and related technical assistance. An organization was
created for project implementation which was to involve seven ministries and
two other agencies under the supervision of a Project Directorate (PD).. The
project cost at appraisal was DR 165.5 million, of which DR 79.2 million
(US$18 million) were to be financed from the Bank loan.
The main features of the project were:
(a)  it largely succeeded in meeting its objectives.  While providing
solutions to specific shelter problems, it demonstrated the
feasibility of upgrading and sites and services and set the stage for
Bank lending in the sector which now includes four projects;
(b) the identification/preparation period was too long even for a first
project, because of uncertain sectoral objectives, lack of continuity
of Bank staff, and technical problems;
(c) it experienced considerable implementation delays because of
managerial problems, the country's difficult financial situation, and
institutional complexity. Regardless of the delay factors, however,
the appraisal implementation schedule was over-optimistic;
(d)  no major revisions took place during implementation but some minor
physical works and the technical assistance had not been implemented
by the closing of the project;
(e) works were executed satisfactorily with no major procurement issues
raised and most covenants fulfilled promptly;
(f) despite implementation delays, appraisal cost estimates were exceeded
only marginally because of contractors' low prices as a result of the
recession;



- v -
(g) lnstitutional development did r.ot materialize as expected. The PD
was initially ineffective as an implementing and coordinating agency
but this was resolved after it was assigned to MHAT's regional
delegation in Rabat. The poor staffing of the Urban Upgrading Unit
was partly remedied through technical assistance from USAID while the
role of the Small Business Promotion Unit was assigned to the Office
de Developpement Industriel. This latter arrangement proved a
decisive move as the employment generation component would not have
been impleme.lted otherwise.
(h) the project is economically justified (ERR 20%). The sites and
services have a re-estimated ZRR lower than in appraisal because of
higher cost and lower terrain utilization due to technical problems;
and
(i) the project is affordable by its beneficiaries and recovery of the
sites and services cost is satisfactory. Recovery of upgrading
costs, towever, has not yet started due to delays in land acquisition
and delivery of plot ownership titles.



PROJECT COMPLETION R!:?ORT
MOROCCO - RABAT URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1528-MOR)
I. BACKGROUND
A. The Urban Sector
1.01     According to the 1982 census, 8.7 million people or 432 of Morocco's
20.4 million inhabitants lived in urban areas. Largely due to rural-urban
migration, i-rban population has been increasing at an average annual rate of
4.4% since 1971 and is estimated to account for 55% to 60% of the total
population by the end of the century. About two-thirds of GDP is generated in
urban areas where incomes are at least 30% higher than those in rural areas
and they have been increasing twice as fast. Given the country's state of
economic development, the large number of agricultural workers, and the
limited supply of nonagricultural employment in rural areas, this trend is
expected to continue.
1.02     This rapid urban growth generated a large housing demand estimated at
about 800,000 dwelling units at the time of project appraisal in 1977,
increasing by some 85,000 units annually. As demand exceeded the capacity of
the formal housing sector to supply housing, population overflowed into shanty
towns and other poorly planned and serviced informal settlemeuts. In 1977,
about 25% of the total housing stock of 1.37 million units was in slum-like
squatter settlements, and another 15 represented aged, deteriorated housing
beyond repair. Also, about 50% of urban households were without water
connections, 451 without sanitary installations, and 30S without electricity.
B. Government Responses to Urban Needs
1.03     Until the mid-1970's, government policies and programs had not been
effective in deaUing with urban problems.  During the first decade after
independence in 1956, when resources were limited, attention was focused away
from the cities on measures to stimulate agricultural growth and to contain
rural emigration. As the urban population continued to grow rapidly, the
Government reassessed its policies in the late 1960s and the 1973-1977
Development Plan provided for a sizeable and ambitious housing program. At
the end of the Plan period, however, only about 40S of the housing production
target had been met because of inadequate organization and staffing, costly
design standards which eroded budget provisions, poor cost recovery, and
insufficient availability of public land for development. The Government was
becoming conscious of the shortcomings of its housing programs, partly through
its continuous dialogue with the Bank, and gradually reoriented its urban
policy towards the preservation and better utilization of existing shelter



-2-
resources through upgrading of slum areas. To this end, the 1978-82
Development Plan provided for upgrading the housing of about 500,000 urban
low-income families as opposed to the construction of some 300,000 new urban
dwellings.
C. Bank Operations in the Sector
1.04     The Rabat Urban Development Project ($18 million, Loan 1528-NOR)
signed on March 31, 1978 was instrumental in influencing the Government's
policy of slum upgrading versus demolition. As such, this first Bank
supported urban project in Morocco was aimed at demonstrating efficient
low-cost solutions to urban development problem in general and to shelter in
particular, thereby setting the stage for the replication of similar
operations in the future. To this end, the project had a twofold objective:
(a) to introduce low-cost urban upgrading, infrastructure, and housing
concepts affordable by the lowest income groups and incorporate
improved cost recovery which would enable the initiation of
country-wide programs to tackle already serious housing,
infrastructure and social service problems more effectively; and
(b) to deal with structural problems in the housing, infrastructure,
social service and employment sectors of Rabat's 7th Municipal Ward.
1.05      As a result of the dialogue and the groundwork developed under this
pilot operation, the Second Urban Develotment Project was prepared by the
Ministry of Housing and Regional Development (MHAT) and approved by the Bank
in 1981 (US$36 million, Loan 1944-MOR) as a further step towards strengthening
the institutional framework for urban development. This second project built
on the experience of the first project and has avoided some of its pitfalls.
It is more focused, deals with fewer agencies and has provided for the
strengthening of staff when warranted. This project addresses the needs of
about 100,000 low-income people in the cities of Mekn6s and KUnitra. Besides
providing infrastructure and community facilities to the selected sites, the
project aims at strengthening the implementing capacity of the municipalities
of Meknes and Kenitra.
1.06     As a complement to the efforts undertaken in the first two projects,
the First Housing Loan to Cr6dit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH) was approved by
the Bank in 1983 (US$60 million, Loan 2245-MOR). This third urban project
focuses on housing production, makes suitable financing available and provides
a set of financial incentives to private and public developers for low-cost
housing construction. Most importantly, it encourages developers to apply the
physical standards used under the two first projects, and streamlines the
responsibilities for delivering low-cost housing units by channelling Bank
funds through CIH, an effective financial institution.
1.07     The Bank involvement in the urban sector also includes a line of
credit to the Fonds d'Equigement Communal (FEC) approved in 1984 (U3$16
million, Loan 2272-MOR), to finance municipal infrastructure and to strengthen



- 3 -
FEC's capacity to prepare, appraise and supervise municipal projects. In
addition to the above, a Fourth Urban Development Project is being prepared to
upgrade existing unplanned and unservicad settlements and to prevent a
recurrence of their growth.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin
2.01     In January 1971, the Moroccan Government requested Bank assistance in
the formulation of its urbanization policies and programs. One year later, a
sector mission reviewed Morocco's urban problems and practices, and identified
a growing gap between housing supply and demand, which was accentuated by
widespread uncontrolled land speculation and unrealistic housing standards.
On that basis, the mission proposed the creation of a land development agency
which would carry out a large-scale project in six cities including Casablanca
and Rabat. While the Government agreed in principle with the project
rationale, it had reservations about the scale of the project, preferring
instead to start with one city as a first step.
2.02     Consequently, the project identification process started again from
square one when the possibility of a project in Casablanca was discussed
during an economic mission aud a sites and services project was subsequently
identified in July 1974. Early in 1975, UNDP provided a grant to finance
project preparation and consultants started the studies after their
appointment in June 1975. While that project was being prepared, the
Government informed the Bank in February 1976 that it was upgrading a squatter
settlement in Rabat and expressed interest in receiving Bank assistance in
squatter settlement upgrading, to which the Bank agreed.
B. Pre2aration
2.03     Following the Bank's agreement with the above Government proposal,
preparation of an upgrading component in Rabat started in mid-1976 for
possible inclusion in the project. In the meantime, incomplete preparation
and geotechnical unsuitability of the sites and services component in
Casablanca made it necessary to drop this component, thereby reducing the
project scope to upgrading and experimental sites and services in Rabat. The
project was prepared by a task force established by the Government under the
Ministry of HousingL' and composed of Moroccan architects, planners, and
engineers, assisted by French and Romanian bilateral assistance and two German
consultants in employment generation financed by the Bank through the PPF.
1/ Ministry of Urban Development, Housing, Tourism and Environment (MUHTE) at
the time; replaced by MHAT in September 1977; Ministry of Housing (MH)
stands on its own since April 15, 1985, with Regional Development being
attached to the Ministry of Interior.



- 4 -
2.04     During project preparation, several problems were encountered:
inadequate initial project preparation arrangements and poor intergovernmental
coordination on proposed project approaches led to delays; progressive and low
cost solutions to urban problems, particularly slum upgrading, were often
rejected by authoritative administrators, thus causing setbacks in project
preparation. In April 1977, however, the Government officially took an
affirmative position for coping with urban problems, as prepared by the task
force. In May 1977, a Government delegation visited the Bank and presented
the outline of an integrated urban development project for Rabat-Sud which
reflected a suitable project approach.
C. Appraisal
2.05     The project was appraised in June 1977 by a mission consisting of
five Bank staff members and two consultants covering technical, financial,
economic, and employment generation specialties. The project at appraisal
consisted of the following components:
(i)  Integrated upgrading in the squatter settlenents of Douar Doum, Douar
Maadid and Douar Hai4a with a population of 3,600, 4,500, and 3,800
families, respectively. Upgrading consisted of rehabilitation and
extension of infrastructure, improvement and expansion of commercial
installations, home improvements through self-help with construction
materials and equipment provided under the project, and provision of
community facilities.
(ii) An experimental sites and services/housing scheme at La Butte (a site
located between Douar Doum and Douar Hajja) for relocating about 900
families because of the upgrading works under (i) above. The scheme
consisted of development of plots provided with infrastructure and
extendable contractor-built core units, commercial installations, and
community facilities.
(iii) An employment generation program consisting of the urovision of:
(a) 11 ha of serviced land and a line of credit for building
construction, equipment purchase and working capital to labor
intensive enterprises; and (b) two vocational training centers for
market-demand-related training, and a day-care center.
(iv) Programs to rehabilitate and upgrade key sewerage and road
infrastructure, and to improve community services in Rabat's 7th
Municipal Ward (garbage collection, fire fighting, and ambulance
services).
(v)  A total of 110 man-months  of technical assistance in small-scale
business development, vocational training, urban upgrading planning,
preparation of housing finance reforms, and municipal equipment
operation and maintenance.



2.06     The appraisal was based on preliminary design for infrastructure,
community facilities and commercial installations and final design for core
unit construction prepared by MHAT,-' RED,2' and the relevant ministries.
Detailed engineering for road and sewerage works was prepared by a French
consulting firm and for electricity and water works by RED.
2.07     The total project cost was estimated at DH 165.5 million or US$37.62
million equivalent at an exchange rate of DH 4.4 per US$1 at the time of
appraisal. The foreign exchange component (US$15.55 million) and about 112 of
local costs (US$2.45 million) were to be financed through a Bank loan of
US$18.0 million.
2.08     Project execution was to involve seven ministries, the Municipality
of Rabat, and the Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP), under the supervision of a
Project Directorate (PD). As each agency insisted in maintain4ing full control
over their respective project budgets, a project implementation organization
was created, as shown in Chart I, to ensure participation of each agency in
project implementation and provide competent and coordinated project
management. A Project Steering Committee (PSC), representing each project
related entity and chaired by the Governor of Rabat, was to be established to
ensure proper and timely project implementation. An interministerial project
coordination committee, composed of the chief secretaries of all ministries
involved, was also to be set up to review unresolved problems.
2.09     The Project Directorate was to manage the implementation of all
project items except small-scale business promotion, vocational training,
urban upgrading planning, and housing finance reforms. It was to tender,
award and supervise material and equipment supplies and civil works; it was to
manage construction materials depots and provide technical assistance to
households for self help construction/improvement; it was also to review home
construction and extension plans. Its entire staff was to be seconded by MHAT
and was to receive guidance and support from MHAT's Urban Upgrading Unit
(para. 2.11).
2.10     The other ministries concerned-' were to manage the construction
and equipment of the relevant components in their domain with their own staff
under the supervision of PD. Each ministry was to pay suppliers/contractors
after invoice endorse.ient by the Project Director.
2.11     A Business Promotion unit under PSC was to provide assistance in
marketing, productivity, and management to small-scale businesses. A special
Urban Upgrading Unit, was to be created within MHAT, was to be responsible for
urban upgrading planning, and a small ad hoc unit in MOF was to prepare the
institutional and procedural basis for a savings and loan system.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness
3.01     The date of loan effectiveness was set for June 30, 1978, three
months after the loan signature date, under the following conditions:
(a) issuance of a zoning plan for the project area;
(b) Government possession under provisional terms and conditions, as
provided for under Moroccan legislation (envoi en possession
provisoire) of all land required for the project;
(c) that the conventions between the Government and the (i) Municipality
of Rabat,-' (ii) BCP,I' and (iii) RED1' have been entered into
by all parties; and
(d) that the Project Directorate be established, properly equipped and
accommodated, and staffed with key personnel.
3.02     The loan became effective on November 21, 1978, or about five months
after the original date, mostly due to delays in: (i) staffing the Project
Directorate with suitable personnel; (ii) provisional possession by government
of land in Douars Hajia and Maadid; and (iii) finalizing the convention
between the Government and RED. Staffing difficulties were encountered
because of the noncompetitiveness of civil servants' salaries, while the
lengthy administrative procedures and the multiplicity of owners in Douars
Hajja and Maadid accounted for the delay in Government possession of the
land. Finalization of the Government-RED convention was delayed because of
some misunderstanding of RED's procurement procedures which had to be cleared
by the Bank.
3.03     The originally estimated effectiveness period was too optimistic
given the type of conditions of effectiveness and the fact that this was the
first urban project in Morocco. Some of the delays, however, could have been
avoided by a more careful assessment of the institutional structure and
regulations during preparation and by undertaking certain measures during
appraisal-negotiations (e.g., explore the possibility of making the project
unit an autonomous agency with independent salary structure, require RED's
presence at negotiations).
1/ For the prefinancing by GOM of community services equipment, off-site
infrastructure, and technical assistance.
2/ Entrusting BCP with the administration of the (i) home improvement and
business loans, and (ii) collection of all charges from project
beneficiaries.
3/ Under which RED would procure materials for water supply and electricity
network extension through ICB and would install them at prime cost under
PD's supervision.



B. Cancellations and Revisions
3.04     Although there was no formal cancellation of any project component
during project implementation, the following components were cancelled from
the loan de facto since they had not been implemented when the project
accounts were closed:
(i) the technical assistance (US$0.45 million) which was provided under
the project but was never used (paras. 3.14 and 3.15);
(ii) the small scale business promotion unit (US$2.2 million) which,
although it was nominally set up, never functioned and its tasks were
ultimately assigned to the Office de D6veloppement Industriel (ODI)
(para. 4.05);
(iii) the youth centers and the center for young women (US$1.6 million)
which were not implemented because of lack of counterpart funds
(para. 3.12);
(iv) the line of credit for construction materials and equipment (US$2.0
million) since no loans had be.e,n requested as of the date of closing
of project accounts (para. 3.18); and
(v) the undisbursed line of credit to small businesses (US$1.95 million).
While (i) and (ii) will not be implemented, the rest remain part of the
project to be implemented without IBRD participation depending on the
availability of counterpart funds. Additionally, implementation of (iv) and
(v) will be contingent on the demand for such loans.
3.05     No major revisions took place during project implementation.  In the
course of supervision missions, however, many minor (mostly technical)
revisions were recommended and introduced after they were reviewed and found
warranted by the Bank. These revisions included:
(a) The increase of diameters of sewerage mains in La Butte to comply
with municipal regulations.
(b) The reduction of the number of serviced plots developed at La Butte
from 900 to 875 because of the high terrain slope which would have
made their cost unaffordable.
(c) The extension of the Industrial Zone to publicly owned land on the
other side of the main access road, instead of the development of its
northern part as originally planned.. This decision was made after
the diacovery that the northern part of the original site was on top
of an old quarry filled with solid waste which might have caused
unpredictable expenditures in infrastructure and foundations of
future buildings.
(d) The alignment change of the Dl throughway road at Douar Doum and the
construction of a trunk sewer along the new alignment. This was
necessary in order to minimize demolitions (75 instead of 250) which



- 8 -
otherwise would have been necessary because of the densification
which had taken place since appraisal.
(e) The use of asbestoa cement instead of cement pipes for the sewerage
system of Douars Haija and Maadid when the slope exceeded 20% in
order to avoid premature erosion of the system.
(f) The increase of water head in La Butte since the buildings would
exceed one storey in height.
(g) The construction of a link road between the two major access roads to
the industrial zone in order to improve traffic conditions around the
zone.
(h) The extension of the telephone network to the industrial zone.
C. Overall Implementation Performance
3.06     The project was implemented over a period of 5 1/2 years, 30 months
longer than the appraisal estimate. In retrospect, the implementation
schedule envisaged at appraisal was unrealistically optimistic. The average
profiles of (i) all urban projects, (ii) all EMENA projects, and (iii) all
projects in Morocco extend over 9 1/2, 8 1/2, and 8 1/2 years, respectively.
Given the number of project components, intersectoral character, and
institutional complexity, and the fact that it was the first urban operation
in Morocco, the actual implementation schedule of the project is reasonable
and compares favorably with these profiles.
3.07     After the initial delay of loan effectiveness, execution of some
infrastructure works started in November 1978. About one year after
effectiveness, execution of physical works had progressed slowly with overall
project implementation behind schedule by about 12 months while the
non-physical components were experiencing even greater delays. Two years
after effectiveness, implementation had progressed somewhat with some
previously neglected works started (e.g., infrastructure works and a
dispensary in Douar Hajja). Construction pace, however, was still slow as
delays in payments to contractors (due to the country's difficult financial
situation) were added to the delays caused by insufficient project
coordination. In the third year after effectiveness, considerable progress
had been made in execution of works and implementation of the non-physical
components. The project, however, continued to suffer from managerial and
financial difficulties which had increased the estimated completion delay to
30 months.
3.08     In consequence of the extended implementation schedule, it was
proposed that: (i) an extension be granted for 12 months during which the
Government would be required to take a rat of agreed critical actions, and
(ii) a decision on possible further extension would be considered in light of
compliance with (i). At the time of the original closing date (March 31,
1982), about 50% of all project works had been completed and some 48% of all



- 9 -
expenditures were committed. An action program was then agreed upon with the
Moroccan authorities under which specific targets were to be met by certain
dates, and the closing date was extended to March 31, 1983.
3.09     During the 12 months following this extension, the Government showed
continuous commitment to the implementation of the action program within the
agreed timetable. Some 70S of all project works had been completed by March
1983. About 752 of the key actions were implemented on schedule with delays
occurring mainly in the implementation of the non-physical compunients. Given
this progress, an additional extension to March 31, 1984 was approved after
agreement on a revised action program.
3.10     Satisfactory project implementation continued after the second
closing date extension with about 90 of all physical project components
completed by early 1984. It was agreed not to extend the closing date beyond
March 31, 1984 but to leave the project accounts open for six months after the
closing date to allow for maximum disbursements. Accordingly. the project
accounts were supposed to be closed on September 30, 1984. The Government,
however, argued that it had not been promptly informed on this and requested
that additional disbursements be made. The Bank accepted one last withdrawal
application paid on December 7, 1984 after which the remaining loan balance
was cancelled as shown in Table 1.

D. Execution of Project Components
Physical Components
3.1L     Infrastructure and Core Housing.  Infrastructure works in La Butte
and the Industrial Zone were packaged in one contract. Execution started in
November 1978 and was completed by mid-1980 after some delays because of
relocation of some families and repair works in the Industrial Zone.



- 10 -
Construction of core units in La Butte was split into three contracts and was
completed in three stages between mid-1979 and mid-1982 after delays incurred
by late payments to contractors. Infrastructure works in Douars Rajja and
Maadid also formed one contract. In Uajja, works started in January 1980 and
were completed in mid-1982 after some initial delays due to difficulties in
combining the new with the existing networks. In Maadid, works started in
June 1982 and were completed in early 1984. Upgrading of Doum started in
April 1981 after some problems in awarding the contract (para. 3.20 [aD) and
took longer than initially envisaged because of the difficulty of the site
(steep slopes, narrow and irregular paths, etc.). Infrastructure works were
also stopped for about four months because of the layout change of the Dl
throughway road (see para. 3.05 [d]), finally being completed in early 1984.
3.12     Community Facilities and Municipsl Equipment.  There were long delays
in construction of community facilities because of poor coordination between
implementing agencies. Although the dispensary in Hajja, was built in 1980,
construction of the dispensaries in La Butte and Maadid started only in August
1981, and in Doum in January 1982. Construction of the primary schools
started in January 1981 at La Butte, in January 1982 at Doum and Maadid, and
in July 1982 at Hajja. While all municipal equipment was purchased between
1980 and 1981, construction of the municipal depot, the vocational training
center, and the commercial installations did not start until late 1982 because
of changes in location and design. Due to lack of counterpart funds, it was
decided that the youth centers and the center for young women would be
implemented at a later date without Bank financing.
3.13     At the end of 1984, the only physical works which were still underway
were a part of two off-site roads and about 25% of street surfacing at La
Butte.
Non-physical Components
3.14     Technical Assistance.  Despite repeated efforts by Bank staff during
supervision missions, none of the 110 man-months of the technical assistance
included in the project was used by the Government as there was a continuous
unwillingness to accept expatriate consultants. This was due to: (i)
reluctance by the Moroccan authorities, and in particular MOF, to spend hard
currency for technical assistance, given the country's difficult financial
situation; and (ii) the Government's view that the staff assigned to the
various project components was quite capable of dealing with all issues
without recourse to outside help. Since this appeared to be a sensitive issue
and there was no specific covenant in the Loan Agreement requiring the
Government to use technical assistance by a certain date, it was decided to
reassess its need against the capability of existing staff. Such a need did
not arise as the implementing agencies were able to rely on their own staff
while (in some cases) receiving technical assistance not financed under the
project, as discussed below.
3.15     With respect to urban planning, USAID provided an urban planner for
two years on a grant basis starting in 1981. This expert was attached to the
Urban Upgrading Unit and helped prepare a national program for the upgrading
of small and medium "bidonvilles" (para. 4.04). Also, in 1980, a Housing



- 11 -
Finance Commission-' was established. It carried out detailed studies on
the financing of low-income housing and on the establishment of a savings and
loan scheme. Finally, as regards technical assistance to small-scale
businesses, MEAT signed a contract in 1981 with the ODI, which was
strengthened under the First Small Scale Industries Project (Loan 1687-MOR) to
provide technical assistance to small-scale enterprises.
3.16     Land Acquisition.  Before the start of the project, MHAT sad acquired
all the land in Douar Doum. In La Butte, land acquisition was completed in
1982 while !a Douars Hajja and Maadid, it proceeded slowly and was completed
only in 1984 because of the difficulty of identifying and tracing the original
owners. For the same reason, registration of beneficiaries was completed in
1981 in Douar Doum and in Douars Hajja and Maadid two years later.
3.17     Plot Sales.  The industrial land sale process started in late 1980.
By February 1985, all the industrial plots had been allocated and 66% of the
titles had been transferred. Construction on the industrial plots started in
late 1982 and is currently underway for about 601 of all enterprises, of which
some 20S are already in operation. Allocation of residential plots in La
Butte started in late 1981. By February 1985, about 902 of all the plots at
La Butte had been allocated and 602 of the titles had been transferred. On
the allocated plots, all the core units had been extended horizontally and
many of them vertically. Sale of plots in the upgraded settlements has not
yet started as the Service des Domaines requires detailed plot layouts (plans
de lotissement) on the basis of which it will start plot sales. MHAT,
howevertcannot prepare "plans de lotissement" covering each entire site
because plot markings establishing the precise property boundaries have not
been set for all plots. During the Project Completion Mission, it was agreed
that MEAT will not wait for boundary marking of all plots but instead will
prepare "plans de lotissement" covering on'ly the plots with boundaries already
marked in order to expedite their sale. This will be repeated successively
every time the boundaries of some additional plots are established. MHAT was
planning to carry out this procedure every three months for each sector of the
upgraded settlements and was estimating that it would be completed in 1-1 1/2
years.
3.18     Loans for Home Improvement and Business Development.  Processing of
the line of credit to small-scale businesses started in September 1982. As of
February 1985, about 301 of the enterprises had requested loans from BCP for a
total amount of DE 13,4 million (or 50% of the total amount of the line of
credit), of which 592 had already been disbursed. As no sales contracts had
been completed in the upgrading areas, no building materials loans (and
therefore no Bank disbursements) were made since the beneficiaries were not
eligible in the absence of ownership titles. However, considerable private
investment in house improvement, extension, or reconstruction has occurred to
date. This housing investment is financed through a number of other sources
or private savings pointing to the strong resource mobilization effect of
U1 Comprising representatives from MOF, MHAT, CIH, BCP and the Caisse de
Dep8t et de Gestion (CDG).

upgrading."' Given this phenomenon and the fact that in La Butte, where
beneficiaries are already eligible, no loans have been requested up to now
while construction has advanced rapidly, it is doubtful that the line of
credit for home improvement will be used in its entirety.
E. Covenants/Reporting
3.19     The Moroccan Government fulfilled most of the loan covenants in a
satisfactory and timely manner. The only covenants not complied with until
now are the auditing by MOF of the implementing agencies' accounts for each
fiscal year (3.04 lb] [ii] of Loan Agreement), and the sending of the audit
reports to the Bank within four months of the end of the fiscal year (3.04 lb]
[iii] of Loan Agreement. Auditing was done only once in 1982 by MOP but not
according to appropriate auditing principles satisfactory to the Bank.
Covenant 3.04 (c) of Loan Agreement requiring that the Upgrading and Economic
Activities units provide monitoring was only partially met because of
insufficient staffing. Also compliance with covenant 3.04 (a) of the Loan
Agreement regarding the preparation of quarterly progress reports was not
entirely satisfactory as the reports were not always received on time and were
often prepared in a haphazard manner.
F. Procurement
3.20     No major procurement issues were raised during project
implementation. However, a number of minor procurement problems, did occur:
(a) Calls for bids for the infrastructure contract in Douar Doum were
advertised twice without response because of the difficulty of the
site. The contract was finally negotiated with three firms and was
awarded, after agreement with the Bank, to the contractor who made
the lowest evaluated offer.
(b) The contracts for two primary schools in Douars Doum and Hajja and
for three dispensaries in La Butte and in Douars Doum and Hajja were
awarded without prior Bank review of the relevant bidding documents
and procedures. Following the recommendation of a supervision
mission which found them satisfactory afterwards, the contracts were
approved a posteriori by the Bank. If, as under the Second Urban
Project, a minimum limit of US$300,000 had been set for submission of
bidding documents to the Bank prior to contract award, such a problem
would have been avoided as none of these contracts exceeded
US$200,000.
(c) Because of delays in official contract approval, the contractor
selected for the contract of the primary school at Douar Hajja
withdrew. PDU called for bids for the second time and the contractor
1/ In Douar Doum, the ratio of private investment for housing to public
investment for upgrading averages 3.9.



- 13 -
selected withdrew again for the same reason. After a third call for
bids, the contract was finally awarded after a delay of about 18
months.
(d) Similarly, the contractor for the commercial installations at La
Butte withdrew and bids were called for a second time.
G. Project Costs
3.21     Table 2 provides a summary of the appraisal estimates and actual
project costs while Annex I shows a detailed cost comparison by project
component and type of expenditure. The cost of the project, expressed in
local currency, excluding the components which were cancelled or not yet
implemented,-' was estimated at DR 129,524.1 thousand at appraisal. The
corresponding actual cost is DR 141,793.4 thousand, or 92 above the appraisal
estimate, based on actual expenditures for all completed works and services
and on contract amounts for works in progress. When the cost of the
components cancelled or not yet implemented is added, the total project cost
expressed in local currency exceeds the appraisal estimate by only 72 which is
very low given the fact that the project implementation period was twice the
appraisal estimate. This is explained largely by the recession which hit
Morocco in late 1978 causing, among others, a considerable slowdown in the
activity of the construction industry. Consequently, contractors eager for
work lowered their prices to levels which were substantially lower than
expected at appraisal. This compensated, at the aggregate level, for the cost
overruns caused by implementation delays and other factors (para. 3.22).
3.22     For   number of project components, however, there are substantial
cost variations from the appraisal estimates. The cost overrun of the
sewerage works (88X) is due to: (i) the additional works in Douar Doum as a
result of the densification of the lower part of the settlement (realignment
of the trunk sewer, extension of the system to include the densified area)
(para. 3.05 ld]); (ii) the change in the type of pipes used in Douars Hajja
and Naadid (para. 3.05 [e]); and (iii) the underestimation of the required
works in Douars Hajja and Maadid because of design errors and omissions. The
cost overrun of the core units (58X) is due to the foundation problems
encountered at the site and the cost overrun of the road works is due to the
realignment of the Dl throughway at Douar Doum (para. 3.05 [dl), the addition
of the link road in the Industrial Zone (para. 3.05 [g]), and the geotechnical
problems of a road around Douar Hajja. The cost underrun of the water supply
is due to the reduction in the number of standpipes as the system provides for
individual connections to be constructed by RED after application by
beneficiaries (i.e., outside project). The cost underruns of the other
components are partly due to overestimation at appraisal and partly due to low
bids by contractors because of the construction activity slowdown (para.
3.20). The differences in dollar terms reflect the *harp appreciation of the
dollar against the dirham since appraisal (US$1 = DR 4.4 in appraisal versus
US$1 = DO 9.33 at the closing of project accounts).

H. Disbursements
3.23     Disbursements were initially delayed by:  (i) the postponement of
loan effectiveness; (ii) the delay in approval of the project budget by MOF;
and (iii) the poor coordination between the Project Directorate and MOF in
preparing the disbursement requests. While project expenditures started in
1978, loan disbursements did not start until 1980 and lagged well behind
appraisal estimates because of the delays in project implementation to which
delays of contract processing and disbursement requests were added. A
supervision mission in October 1981 estimated that the time elapsed between
call for bids and first Bank disbursement was 72 weeks. In order to resolve
this problem, the 3ank accepted a modification in the docucentation required
for processing withdrawal requests."' For these reasons and also because of
the sharp appreciation of the dollar against the dirham, at the time when the
entire loan should have been disbursed disbursements amounted to 142 of the
loan ; 441 of the loan was finally disbursed.
3.24     Nonetheless, when viewed in terms of dirhams, 632 of the loan was
disbursed amounting to DH 50.09 million (Annex II). This corresponds to 351
of actual project costs while the total loan amount represented 482 of the
project cost as estimated at appraisal.
I. Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.25     The final design and tender documents for roads and sewerage prepared
by the consultants followed the preliminary design closely. However, in some
cases the consultants used higher standards without providing any technical
justification. At the insistence of supervision missions, the consultants
provided only the basis of the cost estimates but not the underlying
calculations, arguing that the Municipality had forced the design standards on
them.2' The Project Directorate assigned the design of the community
facilities to private architects. Their performance was generally
satisfactory except in the case of the school in Douar Doum and the vocational
training center, which were overdesigned and had to be revised before being
approved by the Bank.
3.26     Because of the tight financial situation in Morocco, payments to
contractors were delayed as long as six months in many cases. As a result,
contractors were reluctant to commit themselves to advancing construction
beyond a certain point. Consequently, work was slowed-or even stopped-
thereby delaying the overall project implementation. Under these
1/ Instead of attaching a receipt of payment from the contractor to the
withdrawal request, it was agreed to present a receipt of ordera to
transfer from the General Treasury and a receipt of transfer from a
Commercial Bank.
2/ For example while the appraisal design provided blind sewerage connections
through 15 cm. pipes estimated at DH 48 each, the Municipality requires 2
extra manholes for each connection costing DH 660, linked by a 20 cm. pipe
costing DH 60, or DH 720 per connection.



- 16 -
circumstances, contractors performed remarkably well, delivering high quality
construction exhibiting good workmanship within the best possible schedule
permitted by their financial resources.
3.27     Due to the initial difficulties in staffing the Project Directorate
with qualified and experienced staff, supervision of construction was far from
satisfactory in the beginning of project implementation. After repeated Bank
efforts to convince the Moroccan authorities of the need to exercise close and
continuous supervision of project implementation, the consulting firm which
prepared the detailed engineering was hired to supervise the execution of all
infrastructure works ir which it performed satisfactorily.
J. Role of the Bank
3.28     The Bank was instrumental in bringing policy changes with respect to
upgrading versus demolition, design standards, and cost recovery. These
changes were obtained at the cost of a lengthy dialogue which could have been
improved if there had been more continuity of Bank staff. The succession of
project officers was detrimental to an effective dialogue with the Government
for establishing sectoral goals and priorities and agreeing on the composition
of the project. Moreover, at the beginning of project implementation,
supervision missions did not sufficiently focus on key objectives. Continuity
of Bank supervision staff in the last three years of implementation as well as
the definition of action programs (paras. 3.08-3.09) helped streamline project
execution and meet project objectives.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL, ECONOMIC, AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Institutional Aspects
4.01     The institutional arrangements for project execution were complicated
due to the multicomponent and intersectoral nature of the project. Although
the Project Directorate was supposed to orchestrate the coordinated
implementation of nine agencies, it had neither the authority nor the power to
do so. Created within the MEAT, the Project Directorate stood as a "unit" not
specifically represented in the organization of the Ministry reporting
directly to the Minister.  Shortly after appraisal, its director became also
Director of Housing in addition to his responsibilities as Chief of Cabinet.
As a result, the Project Director increasingly took the position of pushing
the execution of the components under his ministry's responsibility at the
expense of other components. In addition, an abrasive and confrontational
style often affected relations with other ministries/agencies negatively.
4.02     After the accidental death of the Project Director in 1982, the
Moro-can authorities reassessed the institutional arrangements for speeding up
project execution.  In agreexent with the Bank, the Government decided to
attach the PD to the MHAT delegation in Rabat, I/ the MHAT delegate acting
1/ As in the case of the Second Urban project where the two Project
Directorates are attached to MHAT's delegations in Meknes and Kenitra.



- 17 -
as Project Director. At the same time, the Governor of Rabat started playing
an increasingly active role in coordinating the activities of the various
project agencies.
4.03     The Project Steering Committee, chaired by the Governor of Rabat, met
twice a month. These arrangements proved to be effective in solving
implementation problems and speeding up project execution.
4.04     The project included the creation of an Urban Upgrading Unit in MHAT
which was to receive technical assistance to carry out urban upgrading
studies.  The unit was created, but was inadequately staffed.  As a first step
tovards defining its work program, Bank supervision missions insisted that it
should monitor the implementation of the project. Although it did carry out
some preliminary studies on the impact of the project, the unit focused its
activities on its original function (i.e., to carry out the above urban
upgrading studies). To this e:id, instead of receiving technical assistance
financed under the project it received the assistance provided by USAID on a
grant basis (para. 3.15) consisting of the services of an architect/urban
plEnner for 2 years. This led to the preparation of a national program for
the upgrading of small and medium slum areas implemented by MHAT with some
financial assistance by USAID.
4.05     Difficulties were encountered in the establishment of a Small
Business Promotion Unit to provide assistance to small-scale enterprises.
Originally expected to be attached to the Project Steering Committee, this
unit was set up but never effectively functioned because of poor staffing and
lack of authority. To remedy this situation, PD signed a contract in 1981
with the Office de Developpement Industriel (ODI), which would carry out the
tasks originally assigned to the Small Business Promotion Unit. At that time,
ODI was preparing a study on the creation of industrial zones and was
receiving technical assistance for small-scale enterprises under the First SSI
Bank project (Loan 1687-MOR). Subsequently, ODI identified the demand for
industrial plots by small businesses; it prepared the list of potential
purchasers which was used to prepare the plot design and mix; it assisted the
municipality in the screening of interested enterprises; and it helped these
enterprises prepare the necessary documentation for acquiring plots and
requesting business development loans. Assigning the role of the Small
Business Promotion Unit to ODI thus proved a decision of crucial importance
for the implementation of the employment generation component of the project
which would have failed otherwise.
B. Economic Reevaluation
4.06     At appraisal the economic benefits of the upgrading and sites and
services components were measured by imputed rental value changes brought
about by legalizing land tenure, provision of infrastructure, community
facilities, commercial installations and improved housing. The economic rates
of return estimated at appraisal were 20% for Douar Doum, 21% for Douars Hajja
and Maadid, and 192 for La Butte.



- 18 -
4.07     The economic reevaluation of the shelter components followed the same
methodology as at appraisal. It included the opportunity cost of land, and
the costs of on-site and corresponding off-site infrastructure, community
facilities, commercial installations, house rebuilding and improvement (in the
case of upgrading), core units and additional rooms (in the case of sites and
services), project management, studies and supervision, and operation and
maintenance. All costs are net of taxes converted to 1984 prices using the
GDP deflator. Benefits included: (i) the incremental value of rents with and
without the project, adjusted to 1984 prices and population, over a period of
30 years; and (ii) the revenue from the sale of commercial installations
(shops built and land developed). The economic reevaluation is described in
detail in Annex III.
4.08     The economic rates of return calculated accordingly are 22S for
Douar Doum, ' 22% for Douars Hajja and Maadid, and 14% for La Butte. These
rates do not account for vertical extension, which is a conservative
assumption for Douar Doum and La Butte, where such potential exists. If one
additional floor is added over five years, the rates of return for Douar Doum
and La Butte would increase to 25% I/ and 18%, respectively. The lower than
appraisal rate of return of the Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme
can be attributed to the higher than expected cost of the core units in
La Butte combined with the reduction of the number of plots finally developed
due to unsuitable topography.
4.09     The benefits from the employment generation component were measured
at appraisal by the expected increases in household incomes as a result of the
employment provided in the industrial zone. On that basis, the rate of return
of this component was estimated at 212. Since (i) most of the enterprises are
not yet in operation, and (ii) the ones in operation have not reached their
ultimate employment level, the industrial development benefits could not be
measured according to the appraisal methodology. Alternatively, the market
value of serviced industrial land was u#ed as a measure of benefits for the
purpose of reevaluation. Using the minimum market price of DR 200 per m2
furnished by the Service des Domaines as a conservative average, the
calculated rate of return was 15%. The costs included in the analysis were
the opportunity cost of land, and the costs of on-site and relevant off-site
infrastructure, project management, studies, and supervision. It should be
noted, however, that since the actual plot sale price is considerably below
the minimum market price, this component's benefits remain captured by the
purchasers of industrial land until the employment projected under the project
is generated.
1/ As at appraisal the cost of land was considered as sunk cost since it had
been acquired and paid in 1959 and 1961. When the cost of land in Douar
Dotun is included in the analysis, the ERR is 132 (see Annex III, page 6).
2/ 15%, when the cost of land is included in the analysis.



- 19 -
4.10     At appraisal the overall rate of return of the combined shelter and
employment generation components was estimated at 20%. The reevaluated rate
of return is 20% -' for the base case and 222 1/ for the case of the
vertical extension of Douar Doum and La Butte.
C. Cost Recovery and Affordability
4.11     Under the project, the cost of land acquisition, on-site
infrastructure, studies and supervision, project management, interest during
construction, core units, commercial installations, and home improvement and
business loans, were to be recovered directly from beneficiaries. Pricing for
cost recovery provided for a cross subsidy between commercial and residential
plots in the upgraded areas and in the experimental housing scheme as well as
between different types of plots in the industrial zone and the experimental
housing scheme.
4.12     The pricing established on the basis of the actual project costs was
based on the above principles with the exception of the cross subsidy between
different plot types in La Butte, which was not followed, after agreement with
the Bank, to avoid social problems. On this basis, the total amount to be
recovered directly from project beneficiaries is DH 119.6 million or 692 of
the estimated total project cost.
4.13     Although title transfer of the residential plots and core units did
not start until 1984 in the experimental housing scheme, cost recovery had
been underway since late 1981 under lease contracts between beneficiaries and
BCP. The performance of cost recovery is satisfactory. As of February 1985,
about 26b of the amount to be recovered had been paid while arrears in loan
repayments were only 41, of which less than one fifth accounted for delays of
more than two months. Recovery in the industrial zone started in 1982. Plots
are paid in cash and as of February 1985 about 58% of the amount to be
recovered on the basis of the established plot prices had been paid for. This
latter amount, however, falls short of the recoverable cost of industrial
land, requiring that the Government increase industrial plot prices to cover
that cost, even though they would still be well below the market price.
Aecovery of business loans started in mid 1983 and, as of February 1985, about
351 of the disbursed loans were being recovered satisfactorily.
4.14     Cost recovery in the upgraded settlements, however, had not started
as of February 1985, since no sales acts had yet been passed either for the
residential plots or for the commercial installations and shops. The delay in
plot sales is due to the reasons mentioned in para. 3.17. Following the steps
taken during the Project Completion mission (para. 3.17) plot sales should
have started by now and recovery should follow immediately afterwards.

4.17     Upgrading charges are lower than the appraisal estimatesI/ a-id they
are easily affordable by project beneficiaries since they represent only a
small fraction of their income. On the other hand, while the monthly charges
for the serviced plots and core units at La Butte are higher than appraisal
estimates,A/ they are still below the total monthly expenditure on housing
(about 25% of available income) and compare favorably with existing monthly
rent levels in the project area.
V. CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Conclusions
5.01     While it is still early to fully assess some of its features (i.e.,
employment generation, recovery of upgrading cost), the project was generally
successful in meeting its objectives. The project created an opening for the
Bank in the urban sector in Morocco and laid the groundwork for a sectoral
lending strategy. As such, the project was instrumental in bringing about
major policy changes in the urban sector through demonstration of the
feasibility of upgrading and sites and services at lower standards, while at
the same time providing solutions to specific shelter problems in priority
areas in Rabat.
5.02     The Government attached great importance to extending the experience
gained under the project to similar projects throughout the country in terms
of physical standards, pricing and cost recovery principles and coordination.

This led to the Second Urban Development Project and to the upgrading of small
and medium "bidonvilles" partly financed by USAID. The course charted by the
project was felt next in the First Housing Loan to CIH, where developers
financed under the project apply the policies and standards developed under
the first two projects. Similarly, the same standards are being used in the
preparation of a Fourth Urban Development Project to upgrade underserviced
settlements.
5.03     The time elapsed between identification of a first urban project and
appraisal of the project in its final form is 5 1/2 years. Although it could
be argued that this was necessary in order to develop a smooth policy
dialogue, the length of the above period points to the fact that the
Government's sectoral objectives and priorities had not yet crystalized but
were still evolving at the time, which led to changes in project scope,
location, and composition. Additionally, the lack of continuity of Bank staff
during project identification/preparation, and inadequate project preparation
arrangements which caused technical problems contributed to the overall delay
of project processing.
5.04     Establishing a Project Directorate within the central structure of
MHAT may have been the most appropriate alternative when the project was
appraised. It did not prove successful, however, as the Project Directorate
was ineffective in its role as overall project coordinator of so many agencies
mainly due to lack of authority with other ministries. The decision to attach
the Project Directorate to MHAT's regional delegation in Rabat and to enhance
the role of the Project Steering Committee chaired by the Governor, improved
project implementation considerably. This was facilitated by the very active
role and leadership of the Governor of Rabat, who had the authority needed to
coordinate the decisions and actions of all agencies concerned. The
correctness of this decision is further confirmed by the fact that similar
arrangements were subsequently adopted under the Second Urban Development
Project and have been found satisfactory.
B. Lessons Learned
5.05     The project was a first pilot operation aiming at bringing together
the agencies responsible for the implementation of interrelated and
interdependent services. Even so, however, the institutional arrangements for
project implementation were too complex, involving many agencies operating
rigidly with poor cooperation under a weak coo-dinating authority.
Coniequently, such arrangements proved detrimental instead of expeditious for
project execution. This was a useful lesson for the Second Urban Project
which has simpler institutional arrangements and involves fewer implementing
agencies.
5.06     Given the multitude of components and sectors and the institutional
complexity of the project, the three-year implementation schedule was
unrealistic. Moreover, the country's difficult financial situation, which
resulted in slowing down project implementation because of delayed payments to
contractors, was an exogenous factor which had not been foreseen. To the



- 22 -
extent, however, that delays were caused by insufficient project coordination
due to poor management, they could have been alleviated by proper and timely
staffing of the Project Directorate.
5.07     Experience under this project (as well as under Urban II) has shown
that beneficiaries accept reduced standards provided they are well tailored to
their financial needs. Much remains to be done, however, on further reduction
of standards and phasing of infrastructure provision. This is now being
addressed under the preparation of the Fourth Urban Development Project.
5.08     Technical assistance and home improvement loans were a financial
burden for the Government which had to pay commitment charges while they
ultimately remained unused. Technical assistance should have been better
targeted and more concretely defined, with precise terms of reference and
timetable agreed at negotiations. Drawing from this experience, the Second
Urban Development Project includes a smaller technical assistance component
for the execution of specific tasks (i.e., study of municipal accounting for
Meknes and preparation of sewerage master plan for Kenitra).  The need for
technical assistance should also be carefully assessed in the case of future
projects in view of the increasing reluctance of the Moroccan Government--as
well as of other EMENA borrowers--to borrow hard currency for expatriate
consultants.  To this end, when such a need is warranted, all the
possibilities of suitable technical asistance should be explored first (e.g.,
technical assistance provided as a grant basis by USAID to the Urban Upgrading
Unit and by the Italian Government to the Tunisian Agency for Urban
Rehabilitation and Renovation).
5.09     The fact that home improvement loans have not been disbursed reflects
the impressive ability of the private sector to mobilize resources and
undertake relatively large shelter investments as a result of upgrading which
was underestimated under the project. The argument that material loans have
not been used because beneficiaries do not have plot titles, which would allow
them to borrow from BCP, does not apply in the case of La Butte where
beneficiaries have not requested any loans despite their eligibility. Surveys
have also shown that beneficiaries are reluctant to borrow from formal
institutions preferring instead to use their own savings or resort to informal
loans from individuals. Whatever the case may be, the total demand for
materials loans should have been better assessed and more flexible eligibility
criteria should have been established allowing the early loan use by
interested beneficiaries. This clearly has implications for the design of
future projects. It may be more appropriate to envisage separate lending
operations for upgrading infrastructure and providing finance for (building
materials and ) shelter.
5.10     In view of the implementation delays caused by lack of counterpart
funds due to the difficult financial situation in Morocco, the effort to
strengthen financial intermediaries which has now started under the CIH and
FEC projects, is of particular importance. Their emphasis is on domestic
private resource mobilization including realistic pricing of products and
services as much as improved assistance to beneficiaries in the design,
timing, and execution of their projects.

5.11     The main impediments to cost recovery have been:  (i) lengthy
procedures for land acquisition; and (ii) cumbersome mechanisms for delivery
of ownership titles. This could be avoided in future projects by, for
example, starting recovery under lease contracts and attempting to remedy
their causes (e.g., complete lpnnd acquisition before project start-up,
development of simpler transfer methods) so that successful cost recovery
permits replicability and does not strain the already overburdened Government
budget.
B. Recommendations
5.12     In order to consolidate the success of the project and to complete
the achievement of its objectives in full, the following actions need to be
taken by the Moroccan Government:
(i) expedite the sales of residential and commercial plots and shops in
the three upgraded settlements and start the cost recovery process;
(ii) provide frequent and proper maintenance of the implemented
infrastructure network and collection of solid waste in all project
settlements on a regular basis;
(iii) start operation of the vocational training center;
(iv) complete any works still in progress (GTR road, street surfacing in
La Butte) and build the Center for Young Women and the Youth Center;
and
(v) revise the sale prices of the industrial plots to ensure full
recovery of all the recoverable costs.
5.13     It is also recommended that, during supervisioni of the Second Urban
Development Project, the undertaking of these actions be followed up and their
progress be monitored

MOROCCO-RABAT URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
The costs used for the calculation of the economic rate of return are
based on actual project expenditures by component for each year. These costs
were for land, studies, supervision, project management, infrastructure,
community facilities, housing improvement and extension, commercial
installations and operation and maintenance (32 of civil works per year).
Costs have been adjusted to 1984 prices using the GDP deflator and are net of
taxes which are estimated at 14.32 of costs.
The direct benefits from investments undertaken in all project sites
are measured by:
(i)  the increased rental value of existing, improved and rebuilt
dwellings in the upgraded settlements;
(ii) the additional rents of new dwellings in the experimental sites and
services/housing scheme;
(iii) the market value of the commercial plots and shops developed in all
residential sites; and
(iv) the market value of the serviced plots developed in the Industrial
Zone.
The basis and assumptions for the calculation of costs and benefits
by component are shown below.
Costs
1.  Actual expenditures for land represent its opportunity cost except for the
part of the Industrial Zone which was sold for the symbolic price of DR 1
which has been adjusted on the basis of the average of the other prices
paid for land acquisition in that site during the same year.
2.  Studies and supervision were allocated on the basis of the physical
component to which they corresponded.
3.  On-site infrastructure costs represent the actual expenditures for each
contract by year. Since the infrastructure works for Douars Hajja and
Maadid were grouped into the same package, their rate of return could not
be calculated separately.

ANNEX III
Page 2 of 8
4. Project management is 7.3% of cost except land, as at appraisal, and has
been distributed evenly over the project period.
5. Community facilities have been distributed according to their location.
6. On plot costs are as follows: Douar Doum. DH 40,000 per rebuilt dwelling
(with the project) less DR 10,000 representing the construction cost of
the dwelling it replaces. Cost of vertical extension is DH 8,000 per
room.  Douars Haila and Maadid.  Improvement cost is DR 10,000 per
dwelling (with the project) as opposed to no improvement (without the
project). La Butte. Cost of core units are as per actual expenditures
plus DH 8,000 per added room.
7. The cost of shops is as per actual expenditures.
8. Off-site infrastructure has been distributed as follows: Electricity.
67/107 Douar Dowm, 14/107 Douars Hajja and Maadid, 14/107 La Butte, 12/107
Industrial Zone. GTR Road. 25% Industrial Zone, 252 Douars Hajja and
Maadid, 50Z broader general use. 203 Road. 25% Industrial Zone, 12.5% La
Butte, 12.52 Douar Doum, 501 broader general use. Contract 80.559A
(Roads). 502 Douar Doum, 50% broader general use Contract 80.559B
(Sewerage). 100% Douar Doum. Contract 2PDU (Roads and Sewerage). 502
Industrial Zone, 501 La Butte. Contract 8PDU (Roads and Sewerage). 100l
Douars Hajja and Maadid.
Benefits
As the detailed information on rents agreed with INAU was never
provided, the results of INAU's limited sample surveys were used for
calculation of benefits from the residential components. Oa this basis,
actual rents range between DH 85 - 200 per room per month.
Douar Doum:  The lowest and highest parts of this range (DH 85 and DR 200 per
room per month) were considered as rents with the project for existing and
rebuilt dwellings, respectively. The 1977 rent adjusted to 1984 prices
through the GDP deflator (DR 21 per room per month) was considered as rent
without the project. The total number of dwellings in 1984 was estimated at
3,854 with an average of 3 rooms per dwelling. The dwelling rebuilding
schedule is 500 dwellings between 1981 and 1984 and the rest between 1985 and
1987.  The sale price of shops (60 shops at DH 18,500 each and 24 shops at DH
30,00u each) reflects their market value while the market value of the 8,802
m2 of serviced land for commercial use was assessed at DH 400/M2.

Douars HaiJa and Maadid: The total number of dwellings in Douars lajja and
Maadid in 1984 was estimated at 5,900 and 4,915, respectively, with an average
of 3 rooms per dwelling. The with prolect rents were estimated at DR 162 and
DR 123 per room per month for Douars Hajja and Maadid, respectively. The 1977
rents adjusted to 1984 prices through the GDP deflator (DR 59 and DR 41 per
room per month for Douars Hajja and Maadid, respectively) were taken as rents
without the project. The actual sale prices of shops (60 shops at DR 25,992
each and 6 shops at Dl 32,400 each in Douars Hajja and 6 shops at DR 33,000
each in Douar Maadid) and of serviced land for commercial use (1,650 mt at
DR 475/m2 in Douar Hajja and 2,770 m2 at DR 525/m2 in Douar Maadid)
reflect their market value.
La Butte: The average rent per room was assumed to be DR 250 per month in
1984. Ultimate horizontal extension is assumed to be completed by the end of
1986 as follows:
Plot Type       Plot Size        No. of Plots       Rooms/Plot "
A             60 m2              482                 3
B             70 m2              307                 3
C             80 mZ               86                 4
The actual sale price of DR 25,992 per each of the 120 shops represents their
market value.
Industrial Zone: The sale schedule of the industrial plots is as follows:
Year:  1982       1983      1984      1985
m2:  9,158    17,609    11,772   37,584
The market price of industrial land at the end of 1984 was given as between
DR 200/m2 and Dl 350/mi2 by the Service des Domaines.
