                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project is the second Phase of a two-phase Rural Investment and Services Program. The Program objective is to provide long-term support to accelerate
                         agricultural recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural and rural sectors can play their full role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth
                         and poverty reduction.

                          Under this overarching objective, the project will strive to continue foster the post-privatization growth in the agricultural and rural sectors of Moldova by
                         improving access of farmers and rural entrepreneurs to legal ownership status, know-how, knowledge and financial services, while building the capacity of the
                         private and public institutions to ensure the sustainability of the activities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make satisfactory progress towards Project Development Objectives despite a slowdown in the growth some of the indicators throughout 2010. Both
                         PDO indicators are still expected to be met by the Closing Date. Approximately 80% of all IDA and SIDA resources were disbursed as of March 31, 2011. All disbursements are on
                         track, with the exception of the Irrigation FinanceServices Sub-Component which has failed to disburse, because of the considerable precipitation levels since the funds were made
                         available and because the economic crisis has shifted savings/investments patterns of the farmers. The Ministry of Finance requested a restructuring of this component on March 24,
                         2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A decision was reached between IDA and the Government to reallocate funds from the Irrigation Credit Line by merging it with the General Credit Line for rural and agricultural
                         activities while maintaining a matching grant portion of 20% for investments related to on-farm irrigation and low till equipment.
