The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013. While the original\n            project was approved in 2006 in the amount of US$16.00\n            million, The 2008 additional financing was made available\n            following a disastrous 2007 drought that resulted in a\n            nearly 80 percent loss of the country's crops. The\n            resources were provided for targeted investments for the\n            rehabilitation of small-scale on-farm irrigation systems,\n            and for dissemination of knowledge to farmers on techniques\n            for adaptation to drought. The 2009 additional financing was\n            made available to assist the Government of Moldova in\n            staving off the impact of the global economic downturn on\n            the country's rural economy by securing additional\n            long-term credit resources in order to avoid a contraction\n            of commercial lending to rural businesses, at a time when\n            the original project's credit line was nearly fully\n            disbursed. The project continues to make satisfactory\n            progress towards the achievement of the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO). Approximately 85 percent of the overall\n            project resources were disbursed as of March 31, 2012. In\n            light of this, the project was restructured in October, 2011\n            to expand the eligibility of subprojects eligible for\n            financing under this source from on-farm irrigation\n            equipment only, to financing a wider array of\n            faster-disbursing, rural-based investments eligible under\n            the rural finance component. The extension is necessary to\n            allow for additional time for the absorption of resources\n            from the International Development Association (IDA), under\n            the project's rural finance component, in order to\n            provide additional credit resources to potential\n            beneficiaries in an amount nearing US$4.5 million. The\n            extension will allow the restructuring undertaken in\n            October, 2011 to have a more meaningful effect by covering a\n            full agricultural season. This will be the second extension\n            of the project. The first extension of the closing date from\n            June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012 was required when the IDA was\n            made available as an additional financing in 2009."}, "docdt": "2012-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
