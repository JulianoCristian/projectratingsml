7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project is the second Phase of a two-phase Rural Investment and Services Program. The Program
objective is to provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural recovery and growth so that Moldova's
agricultural and rural sectors can play their full role in providing the underpinnings for future income
growth and poverty reduction. Under this overarching objective, the project will strive to continue foster
the post-privatization growth in the agricultural and rural sectors of Moldova by improving access of
farmers and rural entrepreneurs to legal ownership status, know-how, knowledge and financial services,
while building the capacity of the private and public institutions to ensure the sustainability of the
activities.
