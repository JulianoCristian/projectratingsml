                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project is the second Phase of a two-phase Rural Investment and Services Program. The Program objective is to provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural
                         recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural and rural sectors can play their full role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth and poverty
                         reduction. Under this overarching objective, the project will strive to continue foster the post-privatization growth in the agricultural and rural sectors of Moldova by
                         improving access of farmers and rural entrepreneurs to legal ownership status, know-how, knowledge and financial services, while building the capacity of the private
                         and public institutions to ensure the sustainability of the activities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project fully disbursed by the end of 2012 and reached its Project Development Objective. Both PDO indicators were met: growth in lending to the agriculture and food
                         processing sectors increased by 175% since the beginning of the project (vs. the initial target of 30%); and 90.8% of beneficiaries have seen their income increase (vs. the initial
                         target of 80%).

                         The network of rural advisory consultants supported by the project and managed by ACSA is now providing about 200,000 advisory services per year to approximately 380,000
                         beneficiaries, i.e., agricultural producers and rural entrepreneurs, helping them on a wide range of issues to enhance their productivity and competitiveness, including technology
                         (53%), business/legal (29%) and marketing (18%). An initial impact study conducted in 2010 had shown considerable impact on the productivity of farmers, their switch to higher
                         value crops and higher yields relative to farmers who did not receive support from ACSA. An update of the impact study is being conducted and its findings will be incorporated into
                         the project's Implementation Completion Report. As importantly, a number of achievements has been reached to ensure the sustainability of the extension services, including: (i) the
                         financing of all costs originally funded by the project which are now covered from the Government budget, ensuring the continuation of all activities, and (ii) the decrease in ACSA's
                         reliance on government funding to 56.5% of its revenues (vs. a target of <75%).

                         The project supported business development agencies that contributed to the creation and operation of rural businesses. These development agencies provided hands-on
                         assistance to (potential) rural entrepreneurs in the formulation of business opportunities, preparation of business plans, facilitation of access to finance from financial institutions and
                         implementation support. This component resulted in the creation of 1,038 businesses and 2,645 jobs in a wide range of sectors, including agriculture and livestock (53%), trade
                         (8.6%), food and beverage production (6%), transport (5.7%) and various manufacturing (10.7%). More than 98% of businesses managed to obtain financing from financial
                         institutions, all of them for the first time ever. As of the end of the implementation of this component (June, 2012), 100% of these businesses had met their loan payment obligations.
                         This low cost approach has had a tremendous impact on the ability to secure financing and the sustainability of these institutions and, for each dollar invested, about $2.5 of taxes
                         were generated in the first two years of business operations. Estimates of sales for these businesses exceeded US$55 million in their first year of operation alone. The impact
                         assessment is expected to update these estimates.

                         The project worked with a group of seven eligible commercial banks that were willing to extend their outreach into the rural and agricultural sectors and had met a strict due diligence
                         screening process, following on the success of the first Rural Investment and Services Project. A credit line, professionally managed by the Credit Line Directorate of the Ministry of
                         Finance, extended 737 sub-loans of approximately US$41 million to rural entrepreneurs from all RISP II sources, including re-flows. All client selection and risk rested with the
                         financial institutions. Combined with the contributions of the beneficiaries, in part financed from remittances, and participating financial institutions, the total investments generated by
                         the project represent approximately US$100 million. Coverage was national and loan size averaged $46 thousand. The sectors that received these investments include: Services
                         (30%), Agriculture and Irrigation (28%), Trade (16%), Food Processing (10%) and Manufacturing (10%). Close to 40% of of the beneficiaries had never received a loan from a
                         financial institution before the project (vs. a target of 30%). As of May 2013, the portfolio at risk (60 days) was around 6.4%. Commercial banks view the project as an important
                         catalyst for the banking sector to move into the agricultural/rural sector, as indicated by the increase in total commercial lending to agriculture and food processing mentioned above.

                         The project completed a small pilot on land re-parceling in 2009-2010. The main purpose of the pilot was to identify the constraints to land consolidation and feed into government
                         policy. A first set of 6 villages showed promising results and was extended to an additional 40 villages. The component met its objectives by providing a number of important lessons
                         deriving from the pilot, feeding into a technical assistance program of the FAO to help the Government design a land strategy, and further work on improvements to the country's

                         The project successfully supported capacity building activities in the National Commission for Financial Markets. The Commission, created in 2007, had the responsibility, among
                         other, to regulate the Savings and Credit Associations (SCA) industry. This sector made up primarily of hundreds of unregulated and unsupervised institutions provided critical basic
                         financial services to small farmers in areas under-served by commercial banks. With assistance from the project, the National Commission was able to modernize the legal and
                         regulatory framework for these institutions and design and imp lement methodologies for on- and off-site inspections and risk-based monitoring. The assistance was timely. The SCA
                         sector suffered considerably during the 2008 crisis, leading the portfolio-at-risk (30 days) of deposit-taking institutions to increase from its traditional level of 3-4% to an unsustainable
                         level of 18% during the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011. Seventeen institutions became insolvent. The Commission was able to address these problems, conducting rapid
                         supervisions and taking a wide range of measures to decrease the level of risk to the system and purge the bad loans. As of May 2013, the Portfolio at risk had returned to a much
                         more acceptable level of about 2.7% (vs a target of <5%).

                         The project has successfully provided institutional building support to the Agency for Interventions and Payments in Agriculture (AIPA), which resulted in improved capacity to
