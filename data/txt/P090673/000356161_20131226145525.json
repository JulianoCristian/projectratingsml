outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: strong\n            analytic work, leveraged through good cross-sectoral\n            cooperation and piggybacking the work used for the\n            development policy credit, the PRSC, were crucial to solid\n            project design. A commitment to results-based management by\n            the Bank, the co-financier, and the Government, enhanced\n            positive project outcomes. Strong Government ownership,\n            supplemented by strong implementation by the implementing\n            agencies and support by an experienced fiduciary agent\n            (CAPMU), were the cornerstones of project success and low\n            sustainability risk. A proactive approach and flexibility by\n            both the Bank and Government to adapt to changing\n            circumstances and arising issues of political, financial and\n            environmental nature were critical for project success. The\n            Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP) experience in\n            piloting projects aimed at increasing resilience to climate\n            variability has also provided a clear lesson that the best\n            stimulant for widespread adoption of new or additional\n            technologies is demonstration of benefits.  Finally, a\n            failure to introduce leasing as an alternative financial\n            instrument, as originally envisaged in the Project Appraisal\n            Document (PAD), was a missed opportunity."}, "docdt": "2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
