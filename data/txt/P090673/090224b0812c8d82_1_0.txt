Project Development Objectives
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project is the second Phase of a two-phase Rural Investment and Services Program. The Program objective is to provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural
recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural and rural sectors can play their full role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth and poverty
reduction. Under this overarching objective, the project will strive to continue foster the post-privatization growth in the agricultural and rural sectors of Moldova by
improving access of farmers and rural entrepreneurs to legal ownership status, know-how, knowledge and financial services, while building the capacity of the private
and public institutions to ensure the sustainability of the activities.

Implementation Status Overview
The project continues to make satisfactory progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective. Both PDO indicators are expected to be met by the Closing Date.
Approximately 89% of all IDA and SIDA resources were disbursed as of February 21, 2012. The overall pace of disbursement has been impacted by the slow disbursements of the
>   Irrigation Finance Services Sub-Component which has failed to disburse, because of the considerable precipitation levels since the funds were made available and because the
o   economic crisis has shifted savings/investments patterns of the farmers. In light of this the Ministry of Finance requested a restructuring of the Sub-Component to allow for utilization
of project funds earmarked for credit for irrigation to be expanded to other eligible investments in line with the project's general Credit Line Component . The Sub-Component was
B   restructured in October, 2011. So far this has contributed to a modest growth in disbursements, although due to the seasonality character of RISP-supported agricultural investments,
0   the impact of this restructuring is likely to be be felt later in 2012.
r   The project's implementation outlook continues to be positive. In 2011 the network of rural advisory consultants supported by the project provided over 198 thousands advisory
.0  services for about 372.4 thousand agricultural producers and rural entrepreneurs. The project supported the activity of business development agencies that contributed to the creation
and operation of an additional 42 businesses, thus bringing the total to 908. At the end of 2011, the project has extended approximately US$21 million in loans to rural entrepreneurs.
0-  The project has successfully provided institutional building support to the Agency for Interventions and Payments in Agriculture, which resulted in increased capacity to manage
efficiently and transparently the public support programs in agriculture. Finally, the project supported capacity building activities in the National Commission for Financial Markets,
which has resulted in improved quality of supervision of the SCA industry. The Commission is now able to manage the industry in a much more proficient and proactive way, which
has helped stabilize the industry in 2011, after a difficult crisis year in 2010.
