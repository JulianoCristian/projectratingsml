                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project is the second Phase of a two-phase Rural Investment and Services Program. The Program objective is to provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural
                         recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural and rural sectors can play their full role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth and poverty
                         reduction. Under this overarching objective, the project will strive to continue foster the post-privatization growth in the agricultural and rural sectors of Moldova by
                         improving access of farmers and rural entrepreneurs to legal ownership status, know-how, knowledge and financial services, while building the capacity of the private
                         and public institutions to ensure the sustainability of the activities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's closing date was recently extended from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. It continues to register satisfactory progress towards the achievement of the PDO and the
                         implementation outlook for the remainder of its effectiveness is positive. The PDO indicators and the majority of component-related results indicators are expected to be met by the
                         closing date (see detailed information on indicators in Annex 1). The only indicator which is still problematic (although improving) relates to the Portfolio at Risk for the SCA industry.

                         Approximately 89% of IDA and SIDA resources were disbursed as of May 1, 2012. The original IDA financing (Credit 4157-MD/Grant H2110-MD) is expected to be fully disbursed
                         and close in line with the original closing date of June 30, 2012. The disbursement outlook for the remaining sources of funding, mainly IDA Credit 4416-MD, IDA Credit 4563-MD and
                         TF99549 remains favorable.

                         The Bank team carried out an implementation support visit during April 25 – May 7, 2012 to focus primarily on the factors that could ensure the successful implementation of the Rural
                         Finance Component’s credit line, which was recently augmented with additional resources from the Drought Adaptation Component (October, 2011). Macro factors have stabilized
                         and lending by the banking sector has generally resumed, after the contraction cause by the 2008 financial crisis. However, there were two specific constraints the team focused on:
                         (i) Interest rate competitiveness; and (ii) Co-financing by the participating banks. The team proposed mitigation measures for both constraints (see details under status of component).
