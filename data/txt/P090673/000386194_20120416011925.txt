7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project is the second Phase of a two-phase Rural Investment and Services Program. The Program
objective is to provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural recovery and growth so that Moldova's
agricultural and rural sectors can play their full role in providing the underpinnings for future income
growth and poverty reduction. Under this overarching objective, the project will strive to continue foster
the post-privatization growth in the agricultural and rural sectors of Moldova by improving access of
farmers and rural entrepreneurs to legal ownership status, know-how, knowledge and financial services,
while building the capacity of the private and public institutions to ensure the sustainability of the
activities.

                                         Restructuring Paper


1.      The closing date for the Moldova Rural Investment & Service Project (APL #2),
specifically for IDA Credit 4416-MD and Credit 4563-MD, will be extended from June 30,
2012 until June 30, 2013.1

2.       While the original project was approved in 2006 in the amount of US$16.00 million
(IDA Credit 4157-MD and Grant H211-MD), the project has had two additional financings: (i)
in 2008 in the amount of US$5.7 million (IDA Credit 4416-MD); and (ii) in 2009 in the
amount of US$10.5 (IDA Credit 4563-MD). The 2008 additional financing was made available
following a disastrous 2007 drought that resulted in a nearly 80% loss of the country’s crops.
The resources were provided for targeted investments for the rehabilitation of small-scale on-
farm irrigation systems, and for dissemination of knowledge to farmers on techniques for
adaptation to drought. The 2009 additional financing was made available to assist the
Government of Moldova in staving off the impact of the global economic downturn on the
country’s rural economy by securing additional long-term credit resources in order to avoid a
contraction of commercial lending to rural businesses, at a time when the original project’s
credit line was nearly fully disbursed.

3.      The project continues to make satisfactory progress towards the achievement of the
PDO. Approximately 85% of the overall project resources were disbursed as of March 31,
2012 (see details in the table below). The original IDA financing (Credit 4157-MD/Grant
H2110-MD) is expected to be fully disbursed and close in line with the current closing date of
June 30, 2012. An analysis of the disbursement patterns indicates that the overall pace of
disbursement has been impacted by the slow disbursements of the project’s Irrigation Finance
Services Sub-Component funded from the IDA Credit 4416-MD. Disbursements under this
source failed to meet original forecasts because of satisfactory precipitation levels since the
funds were made available, limiting demand for financing of on-farm irrigation equipment. In
light of this, the project was restructured in October, 2011 to expand the eligibility of
subprojects eligible for financing under this source from on-farm irrigation equipment only, to
financing a wider array of faster-disbursing, rural-based investments eligible under the Rural
Finance Component. The SIDA TF99549 had slower than expected disbursements due to
significant savings.

4.      The project's implementation outlook continues to be positive. In 2011 the network of
rural advisory consultants supported by the project provided over 198,000 consultations to
about 372,400 agricultural producers and rural entrepreneurs. The project supported the
activity of business development agencies that contributed to the creation and operation of an
additional 42 businesses, thus bringing the total to 908. At the end of 2011, the project has
extended approximately US$21 million in loans to rural entrepreneurs. The project has
successfully provided institutional building support to the Agency for Interventions and
Payments in Agriculture, which resulted in increased capacity to manage efficiently and
transparently the public support programs in agriculture. Finally, the project supported capacity
building activities in the National Commission for Financial Markets, which has resulted in
improved quality of supervision of the SCA industry. The Commission is now able to manage
the industry in a much more proficient and proactive way, which has helped stabilize the
industry in 2011, after a difficult crisis year in 2010.

5.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow for additional time for the absorption of
resources from the IDA Credit 4416-MD and Credit 4563-MD, under the project’s Rural
Finance Component, in order to provide additional credit resources to potential beneficiaries in
an amount nearing US$4.5 million. The proposed extension will allow the restructuring
undertaken in October, 2011 to have a more meaningful effect by covering a full agricultural
season. In addition, the extension will allow for a full utilization of grant resources provided
under the SIDA TF99549, and for scaling up activities aimed at: (i) providing rural advisory
services to farmers; and (ii) continuing efforts for ensuring a high quality of the supervision of
the country’s savings and credit associations industry. The overall effect of the proposed
extension will ensure that RISP II continues to contribute to the development of the country’s
rural economy by facilitating the creation of vibrant rural business and new jobs, by attracting
remittances into investment projects, and ultimately by expanding the tax base for local
budgets.

6.     The disbursement outlook for the extension period is favorable. This conclusion is
supported by a comparative analysis of disbursement rates for the IDA Credit 4416-MD and
the IDA Credit 4563-MD. The latter became effective in 2009, compared to 2008 for the
former, and in a shorter period of time disbursed 86%, compared to only 40% for the former.
The difference clearly comes from the fact that the resources under the IDA Credit 4416-MD
were tied to financing only irrigation sub-projects, leaving demand from farmers for such
financing exposed to uncertainty related to precipitation levels. In fact, following the 2007
drought, the country has had generally favorable weather for agriculture which stunted
disbursement rates under the Irrigation Finance Services Sub-Component. Having removed this
binding constraint the credit is expected to disburse faster.
                                             6
7.      The Government of Moldova is committed to keeping a strong implementation focus
and ensuring maximum absorption of remaining IDA and SIDA resources during the extension
period. During the extended period it will maintain the same implementation arrangements
which have been instrumental in the satisfactory implementation of the project to-date. While
the project’s rural finance activities are demand-based, and hence cannot be planned, the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry have prepared an action
plan that focuses primarily on a wider dissemination of information on the financing
opportunities for rural entrepreneurs available under the project. This dissemination effort is
already under way and is expected to yield results in ensuring additional up-take for the
project’s credit products. For the SIDA TF99549, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Industry will ensure full absorption of the remaining resources by extending the financing for
the country’s rural advisory network for the remainder of 20122, and continuing capacity
building activities for the proper supervision of the savings and credit associations industry.

8.     This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension of the closing date
from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012 was required when the IDA Credit 4563-MD was made
available as an additional financing in 2009. At that time, IDA Credit 4157-MD and Grant
H211-MD, and IDA Credit 4416-MD were also extended for 2 years. As mentioned above, the
IDA Credit 4157-MD and Grant H211-MD will not be extended. For the IDA Credit 4416-MD
the cumulative extension period will be 36 months. The cumulative extension period for the
IDA Credit 4563-MD will be 12 months.

 The SIDA grant extension will allow the GOM to release nearly 8.0 million Moldovan Leu budgeted for
network operations costs in the second half of 2012 to be spent on other public spending priorities.
