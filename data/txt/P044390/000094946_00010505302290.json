However, modest ratings in sector policies, and\n            institutional development, demonstrate that long-term\n            sustainability is uncertain, mainly due to the lack of\n            commitment from the Government, in setting funding\n            mechanisms for road maintenance, and, finalizing the Road\n            Administration statutes. In addition, the railway sector\n            requires appropriate management, and operational structures\n            to meet its demands. The lessons convey that the\n            establishment of the Project Implementation Directorate, was\n            crucial (in spite of questionable enclave units'\n            establishment) since, not only basic government functions\n            were not yet established, but it may lay the foundation to\n            re-establish central roles for future roads administration.\n            Due to the donor diversity, the Bank took the proactive\n            approach to \"decentralize\" coordination, in order\n            to achieve implementation progress, which simplified an\n            otherwise time consuming coordination. It is further\n            suggested for emergency operations, to keep project scope\n            and procurement simple, involving local industry and\n            structures, in the implementation process, and, radical\n            steps, such as privatization should be actively pursued."}, "docdt": "1999-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
