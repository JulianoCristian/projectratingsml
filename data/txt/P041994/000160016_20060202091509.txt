    IEG Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence inevaluation.


 About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
 first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank's work is producingthe
 expected results, and second, to helpdevelopimproveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough the
 disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGannually assessesabout 25 percentof the
 Bank's lendingoperations. In selectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to those that are innovative,
 large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which Executive
 Directors or Bank managementhave requestedassessments;andthose that are likelyto generate importantlessons.
 The projects, topics, and analytical approachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluationstudies.
       A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by IEG. To prepare
 PPARs, IEGstaff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
 validate and augment the information provided inthe ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
 IEG studies.
        Each PPAR is subject to a peer review processand IEG managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEG are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluationcriterion (more information is available on the IEGwebsite:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstitutionalDevelopment Impact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictability of institutional arrangements andlor (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutional arrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

 Summary

         Since the 1970s, Uruguay has implemented three projects inthe education sector.

         e        The Vocational Training and Technological DevelopmentProject (Ln.1594-
                  UR)was approved for a US$9.7 millionloan inJune 1978. The loanclosed
                  on June 30, 1986, after extensions totaling 36 months; US$1.2 millionwas
                  canceled.

         e        The Basic EducationQuality ImprovementProject (MECAEP I;       Ln.3729-
                  UR)was approved for a loano fUS$31.5 millioninJanuary 1994. The loan
                  closed as scheduled on June 30,200 1;US$O.9 millionwas canceled.

         e        The Second Basic EducationQuality Improvement Project (MECAEP 11;
                  Loan4384-UR) was approved for a loano fUS$28 millioninJuly 1998. The
                  loan closed on February 29,2004, after extensions totaling 7 months;
                  US$0.25 million was canceled.
         All three projects aimed at improving educational quality andperformance of
 studentsor trainees. The projects were implemented as planned, most o fthe activities were
 carried out, and objectives were substantially met. The institutions supported by the
Vocational Education and TechnologicalDevelopmentProjecthave fulfilled their purposes
as originally intended. The Professional Training Council (COCAP) didnot train as many
learners as expected, but it produces quality courses o f some demand by learners andby
organizations willing to pay. The Laboratorio Tecnologico de Uruguay (LATU) became
able to conduct research andprovide to Uruguayanindustriestechnical assistance that has
helpedincrease the competitiveness o fUruguayanimports.
        Uruguay achieved Education for All inthe 1990s, and in 10 years o fBank support
to primary education, the country has consolidated its progress. Primary education
coverage and completionrates have reached 98 percent, while dropout rates are less than 1
percent. The parts o fthe systemmost likely to benefit the poor have expanded. In2004,
preschool coverage reached 90 percent o f 5-year olds and 85 percent of 4-year olds. Special
schools catering to the disadvantaged through longer days and enriched programs increased
from 58 in 1996 to 106by 2004.
        Overall, student achievement has improved. Between 1996 and 2002, the share o f
sixth-graders reaching a "sufficient" level o f performance rose fiom 57 to 66 percent in
language and from 35 to 48 percent inmath. The achievement gap between students inthe
lowest and highest income levels has beenreduced. In 1996, the `pass' rates o f the lowest
and highest income groups had a gap o f48 percentage points inlanguage, butby 2002 it
hadbeenreducedto about 35 percentage points. Similarly inmath, the `pass' rates o fthe
lowest and highest income groups had a gap o f 50 percentage points in 1996, butby 2002 it
hadbeenreduced to about 35 percentage points. Preschool attendance was found to be
effective inreducingrepetition among low-income first graders.
        However, national repetitionrates have remained highingrades 1and2 (19.9 and
14percent in2002), and despite some improvement, they have not beenreducedto the
target o f 10percent. According to teachers interviewed, the most commonreasonfor
repetitioni s failure to learn reading, a skillprescribed bythe grade 1curriculum. The
government has adopted a teaching methodology that inother countries has been shown to
prolongthe process o freading acquisition among disadvantaged students. Alternative

methods that teach the readingbasics more efficiently might help reduce further the social
inequitiesineducation as well as the expenditures associatedwith grade repetition.
        All three projects largelymettheir targets, andtheir outcomes are ratedsatisfactory.
The MECAEP Iand I1projects succeededinincreasing equitythrough improved
participationo fthe most disadvantaged students inpreschool education and full-time
schools. The Vocational EducationandTechnological DevelopmentProject achieved its
long-term labor-market support goals. Institutionaldevelopment i s ratedsubstantial for all
projects, becausethe institutions expanded their capacity to matchimplementationneeds.
Sustainabilityi s rated likely; the net benefits o f the vocational education project have
provedresilient over time, and the MECAEPprojects have resultedinlong-term
achievement increases. For all projects, Bank performance i s rated satisfactory. Borrower
performance i s ratedsatisfactory for the vocational education project and highly
satisfactory for the basic education projects.
    This assessment confirms anumbero fIEGlessons from the education sector:

    0   Preschool attendanceoffers significant academic benefits to low-income students in
        terms o freduced grade repetition as well as long-term academic achievement (para.
       4.4)

    0  A longer school daymay offer important academic andsocial benefits to
       disadvantaged students, includingimproved test scores. To maximizeperformance
       inhighergrades, however, studentsinlower gradesmightspendpartofthe extra
       time practicingthe basic skills that serve as prerequisites for hrther learning (paras.
       3.10,4.13, and 6.5).

    0  Quality o f education depends on a strong and functional supervisory chain. If
       government policies and learningactivities are to be carried out effectively at the
       school level, teachers must be supervised closely by knowledgeable andinterested
       staff. Although supervision i s often costly interms o f salaries and vehicle support, it
       i s a prerequisite for improved learning outcomes (paras. 3.8 and 5.10).

    0  Project efficiency may be enhanced through instructional methods that enable most
       o fthe students to achieve educational objectives within the prescribed instructional
       time. Efficient instruction may bemore important for disadvantaged children, who
       receive less home support and who often have higher dropout and grade repetition
       rates. Furtherresearch and experimentation would help determine which
       instructional activities are more cost-effective inthe Uruguayancontext (paras. 5.3
       and 5.9).

   0   Vocational-technicaleducation project appraisals may overestimate the number o f
       likely graduates and not adequately take into account dropout rates or changing
       demand for training. Appraisals o f future projects should take into account country
       experience on dropout rates as well as demand changes duringtimes o f economic
       hardship (paras. 2.2-2.4,2.6)

 1.        Background

 1.1       This document presents evidence regarding the achievement o f objectives o fthe
education projects implemented inUruguay between 1978 and 2005. It also presents
evidence regardingthe extent to which Uruguay has achieved its goal o fproviding
quality and equitable education to all primary-school students.

 1.2       With aper capita income o fUS$3,790,' Uruguayi s amiddle-income countrywith
a long-termpolicy o f social protection for its populationo f 3.4 million. Ithas hadthe
highest per capita spendingrates on social sectors among the countries o f the Latin
America and Caribbean Region(LAC), thoughmost of it hasbeendevoted to social
safety nets. The country's traditional ability to provide social services to its citizens
largely stems from its industrialsector that was vigorous throughthe 1990s. Quality
control and research have beenkey factors inexportingproducts such as wood, wool, and
dairy. To provide workers for the industry, vocationaltraining institutions have
complemented the formal education system since the 1970s.

1.3        InUruguay, free anduniversalaccessto all levels ofeducation was introduced
early inthe 20thcentury. The country attained universalprimary education inthe 1960s,
andits adult literacyrate is 98 percent. Educationspendingtends toward eq~ity,~ 85                        and
percent o fprimary schools are p ~ b l i c This i s important becausemost children in
                                                    . ~
Uruguay tend to beborn inlower-income households; 20 percent o f the poorest families
have 42 percent o f the country's childrenwhile the richest families have 7 percent o f the
children5Primary-schooldropout i s negligible (1,668 students in2003), butpoor
students are prone to low performance and highgrade repetition.6 In2002, the average
primaryschool repetitionratewas 10.3 percent, compared to 5.3 percent inArgentina and
5.4 percent inChile. InUruguay, repetitiontends to be concentrated inearly grades; the
average for the first two years was 17.4 percent in2000.' The country has sought World
Bank assistance to prepare young children for school and improve internal efficiency.

2. Public educationinUruguayis the responsibility ofautonomouspublic entities, andnot the Ministry ofEducation
andCulture, which ismainly responsiblefor cultural activities. Primary and Secondaryeducationare managedbythe
National Administration for Public Education(Administraci6n Nacional de EducacionPdblica, ANEP), which receives
guidanceand support fromthe CentralDirective Council (CODICEN) ofANEP. CODICEN is constitutedoffive
membersappointedbythePresidentandconfirmed byCongress. Itsdependencies includecouncils for primaryand
secondary education, teacher training, andVocational Education(COCAP) for short-durationtraining. The secondary-
and post-secondaryleveltechnicalschools (Universidad de Trabajo) provide semi-formaltraining administeredbythe
Council ofVocational and TechnicalEducation.Vocational educationconsists of shorter courses for adults.
3. For the years 1999,2002-2003, the Gini coefficient for the education sectorwas 0.27 and for healthwas 0.44 to .45.
About 51.6 percentofthe educationbudgetwas directed at the poorest20 percentofthe population. (OPP 2004, p. 17-
18; Table B-9). For budgetarydata on Uruguay see tables B-6 to B-9.
4. In2003 there were atotal of 2,834 schools (15 percentprivate) that accommodated about 469,114 students(ANEP

 1.4       Despitethe expense involvedineducational programs, public expenditure on
 education remains relatively low. Itwas about 3.6 o f GDP in2004, considerably less than
 the 4.5 averagepercentage inLAC and lower than the 5.3 percent average o fhigh-
 income countries. Quality o f education interventions for the poor are neededat all levels
 o f the system.*

 Bank Sector Strategy

 1.5       World Banklendingfor education inUruguay started in 1978 with vocational-
 technical education. Altogether, the Bank has financed four education projects in
 Uruguay, the first three o fwhich are the subject of this report (Figure 1, Annex Table A-
 4). Bank assistance has been focused on supporting the government's educational
 objectives and providing economic and technical advice to vocational education inthe
 1980sand to primary education since the 1990s.

 1.6       With World Bank support, the government has implementedsince 1997a 10-year
 educational reformthat focuses at the primary level on improving poor children's
 academic achievement, psychomotor, and social skills, and on reducing repetition rates.
 Universalization o fpreschool was considered necessaryto improve the skills o f low-
 income childrenand lower their particularlyhighrepetition rates. To further support the
 achievement ofthe poor and limit harmful environmental influences, the government
 developed the strategy o f keepingthem inschool for 7.5 hours. A series o fthree Basic
 EducationQualityprojects (known as MECAEP I,11, and 11) has focused on carrying
 out these goals.

 1.7      Uruguaywill continue to receive financing from the Inter-AmericanDevelopment
Bank (IADB) for secondary, technical, and some higher education. Inparticular, IADB
has supported the government's reform at the secondary andhigher education level and i s
currently financing a project on the modernizationof secondary education andteacher
training (UR-0132, US75.0 million, FY2001A).                       lo The country also receives some
bilateral aid on technical education issues from Japan and Germany.

 1.8      Dueto the economic downturnofareacountries Uruguayfaces the challenge of
sustaining the current investments andimproving them." The education sector has
received assistance from the Public Services and Social Sectors StructuralAdjustment
Loan and Special StructuralAdjustment Loan Project (Ln.7104, P078726, FY03) inan
effort to protect educational investments from adjustments necessary to overcome the
effects o fthe 2001 economic crisis. (See more inthe Sustainability section.)



8. World Bank 2005. The percentage o fthe education budget devoted to primary and preprimary public education i s
about 44.7 percent, secondary education about 34.5 percent, tertiary andhigher education 20.7 percent, andhigher
education only 15.1 percent).
9. MECAEP 2004.
10. Inter-American Development Bank 2000.
11. Incontrast to many L A C countries that have decentralized education and given more regional autonomy, Uruguay
remains fairly centralized. One reasonmaybe the relatively small size o f the country and its small andrelatively

 1.10       The three projects under review focused on improving access and quality o f
education inthe subsectorsthey supported. Their implementation experience and results
are presented below.

2. Objectivesand Implementationof the VocationalTraining
       and TechnologicalDevelopmentProject (Ln.1594-UR)

2.1         The project was to enhance the competitiveness o fUruguayan exports by
increasing labor productivity, improving product quality, andpromoting the use o f
technologies well suited to the country's requirements. Project objectives were: (a) Train
adults to improve employment prospects (originally stated as `Finance the physical
facilities and technical assistancenecessary for the Vocational Training Council
(COCAP) to beginoperations") and (b) assist the government indevelopingdomestic
capability inthe areas o f technological research, dissemination o f information, and
technical assistance to entrepreneurs insupport o f its export-oriented industrial
development strategy. The project was to finance (a) the expansion o fthe Laboratorio
Tecnol6gico o fUruguay (LATU), a parastatal organizationcarrying out these hnctions
since 1965 and (b) establish the Professional Training Council (Consejo de Capacitacibn
Profesional - COCAP).

2.2        Both components (which were not linked) suffered long delays inconstruction
andprocurement due to a lack o f advance preparation. By 1982 only 4 percent o fthe
loan had disbursed, andthe project neededextensions totaling four years. Despitevarious
disagreements andproblems, most expected activities were carriedout (see Annex Table
A-1). Bothinstitutionshadconsiderable continuity instaffandmanagement, andthis
made it possible to gather information 19 years after project closing. The managers o fthe

                                                          4


 two institutions showed the IEGmissionthat the buildingsas well as much o f the old
 equipment were still beingusedand ingood condition.

 2.3         Vocational Training Council (Consejo de CapacitacidnProfesional - COCAP). In
 an era o fmanpower planningandsupply-based training, the project helped set up an
 institution offering demand-based short vocational training courses, mainlyto industry
 workers. For the first decade o f its operation, the institution designedcourses o f short
 duration for various industrialoccupations. It expanded, movedinto largerpremises, and
 opened two provincial centers COCAP has usedpart-time instructors who work inthe
 industryduringthe day, payingthem acceptable salaries. In-planttraining inparticular
 was to meet the needs o fpublic ports, railways, electricalpower, petroleum, and fishing
 agencies as well as several largeprivate manufacturers. Project completiondocuments in
 1988 show that COCAP was meetingindustrydemand for in-servicetraining and
 recuperating about 100percent o frecurrent expenditures (Table B-l).'* C O O was to
 finance its work partly throughan export tax, butneededlegislation was never enacted, and
 the expected hndswere never received. Instead, ad hoc subsidieshavebeengivenover the
 years.

2.4         The appraisal overestimated the capacity o fCOCAP to carry out the expected
course load, labor market demand, andthe government's politicalwill to impose export
taxes for the operation o fthe institution. The institution raninto multipleproblems in
 1997 when the National Employment Council ceasedoperations andno longer paid for
COCAP courses. Halfthe staffwere laid off, the institution lost a newbuildingbought
for its operations, and it has returned to the original Bank-financedpremises.
Nevertheless, the institution functions as intended, albeit with a reduced scope. The
missionvisitedeveningcourses of COCAP, where interviewswere heldwith three
groups o f adult learners (two students studyingautomaticity, 13 students o f office work
subsidized bythe NationalEmployment Council, 14 ingraphic design). All students
indicatedthat the training i s usehl and o fgood quality. The students o f automaticity
reported that their employer paid for the course (12,000 pesos for six months), but the
unemployedstudentswere subsidized at 70 pesosper day to take courses. The students
pointedout that the selection o f courses offeredby COCAP in2005 was limited. Several
made it clear that they didnot expect work but took the courses for personal enhancement
and could afford to wait for suitablypayingwork.

2.5        Technological Laboratory of Uruguay (LATU).For this parastatal companythat
has certifiedthe quality o f exported goods since 1965, the project financed equipment,
fellowships, and technical assistance to improve quality control means and find new
manufacturingprocesses through four pilot plants.LATUusedits own funds to buildthe
new premises on the basis o fplans acceptable to the Bank (Annex Table A-1). These are
located on 700 hectares, surrounded by an industrialpark. The project design benefited
                                                                            l3

the institutionrecuperated83 percent ofrecurrentexpenditures. Accordingto reports of COCAP staff, currentcost
recoveryrateis about 50 percent, andthe institutiongets ad-hoc subsidies insteadof a steadyincome fromtaxes as
plannedduringappraisal.

 2.6      Staffinterviewedinthis organization reported that over the years COCAP has
 providedtraining to more than 100,000 people (versus approximately 300,000 according to
 appraisal targets; Annex Table A-1). Some in-plant training was carried out for various
 state agencies, such as petroleum and water. There was more demand, however, for
 training youth andunemployedmiddle-aged people out o fwork who may be subsidized
bytheNationalEmployment Council to take courses (Annex Tables B-1andB-2). For
 example, in2000, 1,130 persons studied in 101courses and in2001,933 studiedin84
 courses with a dropout rate o f about 10percent. However, employability o fjobless
trainees was limited. Inan informal tracer study conducted by COCAP,about 28 percent
had obtained work.

2.7       Staffinterviewedconsider the Bank financing a great achievement and a leap

3.1        The project was to improve the quality, equity, and efficiency o fthe primary
education system (Table 1). It constituted the first large-scale effort to support primary
education within a context of Uruguayansocial policies andto concentrate resources to
the lower-performing schools. Its components aimed at distributingtextbooks, training
teachers, and developing a sample-based standardized achievement test. Through
construction, training, andmaterials, the project also aimed at increasing the net
enrollment o f 4- and 5-year old childreninpreschoolfrom 51 to 55 percent andreducing
the repetitionrate for grade 1from 17.8 to 11.9 percent. (See Annex Table A-1).

3.2       The 6.5-year project was implementedas scheduled, andnearlyallthe planned
activities were completed. Lack o f stakeholder consultationduringappraisal created
some mishust among teachers and administrators, which project authorities had to
overcome. Early inthe life o fthe project auditing and accounting issues arose, and on
occasion ineligible expenditures were financed. These problems were addressedquickly,
and audit reports have been satisfactory since 1996 despite some delays.

BasicEducationQualityImprovementProjectI1(Ln.4384-UR knownas MECAEP11)

3.3      As with MECAEP I,               objectives were concerned with quality and equity.
MECAEP I1continued to implement the educational reform introduced inMECAEP I,
but also included the `hll-time' school model. A curricular design, special training, and

                                                           7


 support were developed to accommodate disadvantaged children ina school day that lasts
 7.5 hours andincludes three meals. As an enrichment activity, 28 hll-time schools also
 introducedbilingual education inPortuguese (inborder areas) andEnglish, teaching half
 the time ineachlanguage. Theproject also aidedregular schools inlow-income areas.
 LikeMECAEPI, emphasized teacher trainingandintensiveteacher supervision bya
                        it
 cadre o fwell-trained inspectors who are responsible for about 14 schools each and visit
themfreq~ently.'~The project carried out several studies (see References). Most
 activities under MECAEP I1were completed (Annex Table A-2.)

 3.4      MECAEP Iand I1hadmany common activities and implementation issues, which
 are described below with achievement o f specific targets where applicable."

 3.5      Classroom construction and rehabilitation. The projects faced difficulties with
 land acquisition. Thus, the government preferred to attach classrooms to existingschools
rather thanbuildnew ones. MECAEP Ibuilt 87 preschool classrooms (exceeding a target
o f 71) rehabilitated another three eventually increasing coverage to 44,000 additional
students; 50 primary-school classrooms were also built. MECAEP I1built 109preschool
classrooms (rather than the targeted 200) because the project populationwas reduced. It
also decided to builda smaller number o f 120new classrooms (11new full-time schools)
rather thanthe projected 280. Though designs were decided centrally, efforts were made
to the needs o f specific users, such as orienting doors or changing the number o f
bathrooms. The localresidents took care o fthe construction andnotifiedMECAEP if
there were problems.

3.6       Textbooks.MECAEP Idistributed4.2 milliontextbooks, exceeding targets by 68
percent (Table B-2). MECAEP I1complemented the effort and distributed many
instructionalmaterials (Table B-3). Textbooks were made according to precise
specifications for a unit cost o f about US$1.2, teachers andparents were consulted, and
the process was eval~ated.'~Students receive them free andreturnthemat the endo fthe
year. Publishers own the authors' copyrights and have sold the textbooks inthe market
for about US$lO. Though textbooks became available for all studentsin 1995, they have
not been gettingreplaced as they wear out. A 2000 study showed that 80.3 percent o f
schools hadthe neededbooks. Low-income schools tended to have more scarcity, and 8
percent o f schools had a severe shortage.20This means that students must share books and
are often unable to take them home to study. The situationhas improved. The IEG
mission found only one school whose staff stated that they had an adequate numbero f
textbooks. However, the textbooks are usually unavailable for sale inthe market, so even
parents who can afford them cannot buy them.

3.7      School improvementprojects. This mechanism o fresponding to school needs
through teacher initiatives started in 1994and has become very popular. MECAEP I
awarded 931 projects and the practice continuedMECAEP I1and 111.In2005, schools

per inspector.

 have 320 projects to implement. In 1995,36 percent o fthe projects were inscience, while
 in1997,42 percentwere inlanguage.?'Theprojects havebecome moreinstructionally
 relevant. Frequent examples are development o fnewspapers, plant nurseries, web pages,
 art history and critique. Evaluations o f school improvementprojects have shown some
 positive outcomes.22Teachers thought that they improved: activities inclass (73 percent),
 reflectionregardingschool reality (75 percent), generated new forms o fwork inthe
 school (70 percent), showed that teachers' work transcends the classroom (60 percent).
 Teachers reported that they were more likelyto collaborate andparticipate (57 percent),
 more capable o fworking ingroups (55 percent), closer links with other teachers (55
 percent), less absenteeism (13 percent). For students, the school improvementprojects
 reportedly improvedvalues (70 percent), school motivation (67 percent), relationship
 with families ina specific class (56 percent), relationshipwith families inthe school (50
percent), relations with community (46 percent), discipline (47 percent), learning
 difficulties (43 percent), absenteeism (24 ~ercent).?~A studyhas shown apositivethough
 limitedrelationship between academic achievement to the executiono f school
 improvementprojects (Table A-3).

3.8      Teacher training. MECAEP Icarried out extensive teacher training, reaching
 17,000 teachersby 2000 and surpassing targets. However, training inlarge auditoriums
that consisted mainly o f lectures didnot have a sufficient impact on classroom behavior.
InMECAEP 11, training was limitedto teachers offull-time schools (extensive courses of
 150hours), preschools, and some teachers ofthe teacher training institutions. Using
salaries o f teacherswho hadbeenabsent, it was possible to pay for teachers to attend
training on Saturdays. Supervisors and inspectors gave close follow-up to teachers to help
them modifytheir teaching behaviors. Convincingteachers o f the needfor change was
found to be an important component for the improvement o f teacher training. Specific
traininghas taken place on the full-timeschool meth~dology~~to emphasize the skills o f
teachers taking the children's knowledge and expanding it, gettingthemto think about
and question issues such as why teeth fall out, why people gain weight. Linkageswith the
community have been an important part oftraining.

3.9      Achievement tests.An achievement test unitwas created through MECAEP I
(Unidad de Medicion de Resultados Educativos) in 1995. Through a participatory
process,25it developed and administered tests approximately every three years: to all sixth
graders in 1996, a sample o f third graders in 1998, a sample o f sixth graders in 1998, an
evaluation o f fourth grade andpreschoolachievement as well as grade 6 in2002. About
20,000 educators receivedtraining inthe interpretationo f test results, andthis activity
increased awareness o ftesting outcomes under MECAEP 11.

3.10    Full-time schools. Such schools had existed inUruguay since 1992 but were
intended for special education. Students spend four hours inthe morningon the regular

 academic curricula and 3.5 hours inthe afternoon on sports, evaluation and group
organization, andworkshops (or projects) on language, science, and math. There i s no
 supervised homework time duringthe school hours. Children are expected to go to bed
 soon after returninghome, so homework i s often limited to information gathering. The
schools that teach Englishor Portuguese do so by teaching part o fthe curriculum inthese
languages, including math. Full-timeschools are larger buildingsthan regular schools
and have recurrent expendituresthat are about 78 percent higher than regular schools
(Table B-4). Teachers work two shifts, but are paid only the basic salary for the second.
MECAEP I1carried out promotionalcampaigns to enrol childreninthese schools as well
as inpreschool.



4. Results of MECAEPIand I1

4.1       These two projects were implementedinsequence and their objectives partly
overlap (Table 1). Objectives related to preschoolexpansion and full-time schools were
infact meansto achieve improvedperformance, increasedequity, andreducedrepetition.
Grouped together, the objectives o fMECAEP Iand I1are presentedinterms of: (a)
expanding preschool coverage inareas o f unsatisfied basic needs, (b) enhancing the
quality o fpreschool and primary education, (c) achieving greater social equitythrough
full-time schools, (d) reducinggrade repetition, and (e) improving sectoral management.

4.2       Preschool education has expanded considerably, and in2004 there were about
85,628 preschool students. According to the 2002 household survey, coverage o f 5-year
olds reached 90 percent; coverage o f4-year olds has quadrupled since 1994, and was
about 85 percent in2004. Increases inenrolment rates were most noted for lower-income
students. Between 1996 and 2001, the attendance o f five-year olds inthe lowest income
quintile improvedby 13 percentage points, while the attendance o f four-year olds
improvedby 23 percentage points (from 36 to 59 percent; Table 2).

  4.3       Preschool education was to improve inquality inorder to increase primary school
  readiness and reduce repetitioninthe first two grades. It i s unknown whether this was
  achieved becauseno tests measuredwhether disadvantaged studentshad a higher
  commando f age-appropriate language, motor, or psychosocial skills between 1996 and
  2002 or whether attendance improvedthese skills.

  4.4       Nevertheless, preschool attendance seems to reduce failure; the repetitionrate o f
  low-income first graders who didnot attendpreschool in 1996-2001 was 47 percent
  compared to 27 percent for similar children who had attended                                 A study
  showed that children were more likely to repeat grades ifthey hadnot attended
  preschool. Childrenwho attended preschool had a lower tendency to repeat at least one
  year, evenwhenmothers hadhigher education (Table 3). Also, childrenwho had
  attendedpreschool hadhigher test scores ingrade 6. Perhapsthere i s no difference
  among preschool models inUruguay. Second graders who had attendedthe preschool
  model developed through MECAEP scored about the same as a national sample o f
  second graders who had attended traditional kindergartens.               *'

  4.5      Overall student achievement in the sixth grade has improved inthe years o f
 MECAEP I and I1implementation. Between 1996 and2002, the share o f students who
 reached a `passing' or "sufficient" level o fperformance (defined as a 60 percent rate of
 items correct incriterion-referenced test scores) rose from 57 to 66 percent inlanguage
 and from 35 to 48 percent inmath (Table 4; see Annex figures B-1and B-2 for raw test
 scores).
4.6        Improvements aside, the absolute levels o f achievement scores are still low.
Masterycriteria typically indicate a highrate o f achievement on objectives that have been
taught.28 Fewer thanhalfo f the sixth graders attain even 60 percent o fthe objectives

 Schoolprincipals and supervisors were informed o fthe scores, and teacher training in
 some areas focused on outcomes. However, the school-level data were not made public,
 as it happens insome other countries, and an opportunity was missedto increase parental
 involvement andteacher accountability.

 (c) Achieving greater social equity - achieved

 4.7       The education system has become more equitable. Test scores showed that
 students from more disadvantaged backgrounds made greater progress thanthose of
 advantaged backgrounds. For example, the percentage o f students obtaining a
 "sufficient" score increased by 12.5 percentage points among the disadvantagedbetween
 1996 and 2002 inmath, while it increased by only 5.9 points among the most advantaged.
 Overall, the poor have made more substantial gains between 1999 and 2002. An equity
index, consisting o fthe difference between the percentage o f the highest and lowest
socioeconomic groups passing or obtaining "sufficiency" showed that equity increased
between 1999 and 2002. Inlanguage, the `pass' rates o fthe lowest andhighest income
groups had a gap o f 48 percentage points in 1996, but by 2002 the gap hadbeen reduced
to about 35 percentage points. The language pass rates o fthe most disadvantaged
students increased by 17.7 percentage points in 1996-2002, while those o fthe most
advantaged increasedby only 2.3 percentage points. Inmath, the `pass' rates o fthe
lowest and highest income groups had a gap o f 50 percentagepoints in 1996, but by 2002
it hadbeenreducedto about 35 percentage points. The mathpassrates o fthe most
disadvantaged students increasedby 19percentage points in 1996-2002, while those o f
the most advantaged increased only 5.9 percentage points (Table 5, Figures2 and 3).29

4.8      Full-time schools expanded. The number o f full-time schools increased from 58 in
1996 to 98 by 2003 (Table 6). The Implementation CompletionReport showed an
enrollment of 26,900 students in2003, approximatingthe target of 30,000 students
(Figure4).    30 Initial targets hadbeen higher, but the government decided to limit the
expansion ofthese rather expensive schools.

4.10      Given these limitations, however, Figures 5 and 6 suggest that achievement o f
disadvantaged students inthe sampled schools i s better infull-time schools. Inthe 1996
test for sixthgraders, the percentage o f students performing at a "pass" level inlanguage
was reportedas significantlyhigher insingle-shift, full-time schools, than inregular
schools of areas considered disadvantaged or highly disadvantaged areas (60.7 versus
49.3 percent for the former, and 42.6 versus 37.5 percent for the latter).33Furthermore,
the sixthgraders who stayed longer infull-time schools have higherperformance than
those who arrived morerecently. The differences from one testing year to the next show
that 5 to 9 percent more students attain satisfactory scores insixthgrade. Furthermore,
the change rate in `pass' percentagesfrom 1996 to 2002 seems about the same for
disadvantaged students inregular and infull-time schools. Although some schools that

circumstances (ANEP 2003b, p. 70). To draw reliable conclusions from the data, it would help to correct statistically
for regression towards the mean, follow paired samples o f students acrosstime, analyze within- as well as between-
school variance, or compare difference-in-difference scores among various combinations o f schools and income levels.

converted to full-time status in 1999 show better performance, the scores o f other full-
time schools show somewhat lower progress.

4.11 The effects of full-time schools are also ambiguous inthe critical early grades. A
national assessment coveringpreschool, first, and second grades found no difference in
performance between first graders inthe national sample and full-time school students.
However the latter were better inreading                      a variable that teachers use to decide
which students repeat grades. It i s possible that the measurable benefits o f full-time
schools for students are small over briefperiods o ftime but significant over the duration
o fprimary school.

(d) Reducinggrade repetition-partly achieved

4.12      Limited reduction in repetition rates. The strategies pursued inMECAEP Iand I1
were partlysuccessful inreducingrepetitionrates. Average primary-level repetitionrate
was reduced from 10.8 to 10.3 percent duringthe two projects, and was nearly double the
5 percent envisaged inthe appraisal documents. At first grade, overall repetitionrates
decreasedfrom 21.O to 19.9 percent between 1996 and 2002 and to 18.9 percent after
project closing (Figure 7, Table 7, B-5); insecond grade, they remainedalmost stagnant
at 14percent. Efforts to convince teachers to fail fewer students succeededina reduction
o f the averagerate to 8.6 percent in2004.

  repetitionrates that fluctuated but didnot show much improvement (28 percent in 1996

 about 1,089 extra teachers are neededannually to teach repeaters.37At an average
 monthly salary o f about US$300, the annual cost o frepetition i s roughlyUS$3.9 million.
 Ifrepetitionjust inthefirst andsecondgradeswere reducedto thetargeted 10percent,
 thenthe repetitioncostsinsalaries alone wouldbe59 percent lower, roughlyUS$2.3
 million. Thus, there would be savings o f at least US$1.6 million annually.

 4.16      Some government staff interviewedbythe mission attributed the highfailure rates
 to a lack o ftraining and distorted incentives. Teacher training duringMECAEP Itraining
 was not very effecti~e,~*while          duringMECAEP I1it was only givento full-timeschools
 andpreschools. Teachers receive a 25 percent bonus for working inlow-income areas
 andmay inadvertentlyattempt to keep studentnumbers highand theirjobs secure.
 (Efforts after 2002 to convince teachers to fail fewer students may bepartly responsible
 for the improving rates.) However, teachers interviewed duringthe IEGmissionreported
 that they recommend grade repetition for the students who do not learnhow to read.
 Some expressedconcern regardingthe effectiveness o fthe reading methods they have
 been instructed to use (para. 5.3). A study has shown that most childrenlearn to read
 later than curricula would specify; only 23 percent o f first graders and 66 percent o f
 second graders read fluently bythe end o f the school year; 35 percent o f second graders
 could only read syllable^.^'

 4.17      Overall, the data presented inthis report suggest that preschool has a notable
 effect on reducing grade repetition among all students, particularly among the poorest.
Bycontrast, full-time schools have aweaker effect onrepetition. Bothinterventions
 seem to have little effect on test scores inthe early grades, but by grade 6, disadvantaged
 students performbetter ifthey have beento one o fthese programs than other students.
MECAEP has not analyzed data on the interaction betweenpreschool and full-time
schoolingand the additive effects are not known.

 o f classes. Inthe latter, the missionobserved instructionalactivities taking place inclass
 at the moment o f IEGmissionentry and asked 3-4 studentschosen at random to read and
 answer simple comprehension questions. The missionalso observed two inservice
 workshops for teacher trainers inmathematics and science. School observations
 confirmedthat the projects hadmade efforts to serve the disadvantaged through quality
 education but also pointedto continuing challenges:

      0     All teacherswere present inschool andoccupiedininstructionor inthe care of
            children. They seemedwell educated and trained and articulately answered
            instructionalquestions. The vast majority o f students were engaged inlearning
            activities at the moment o fmission entry, and instructional time seemed
            efficientlyused. Few studentswere seen unoccupied or uninvolved.

      0     Lower-grade childrenwere articulate hut had limitedreading skills; only two o f
            14 second and third graders who were askedto readcould do so fluently.
            (Findingswere consistent with arecent                         Thus, ina multigrade class
            where students shouldwork independently third grade students could not readthe
            text o f arithmetic problems well enough to solve them. However, most teachers
            expressed satisfaction with student performance and class achievements.

      0     There was a textbook shortage inall but one of the schools visited, and it was
            unclear when more books would be available. Because o fthe shortage, textbooks
            are mainly for classroom use (even inthe advanced grades when students should
            read several pages daily) or students take turns taking them home. They cannot
            regularlybe usedfor homework. The MECAEP editions are not available for sale,
            butmost teachers expressedthe opinionthat at U S 1 0 each, students wouldbe
            unable to afford them evenifthey were.

 5.       Ratings

 ProjectOutcomes

 5.1      The outcomes o f all three projects are ratedsatisfactory. The strategies and
 project designs were relevant to the country's needs andwell suitedto its implementation
 capacity. The institutions supported by the Vocational EducationandTechnological
 Development Project have fulfilled their purposes as originally intended with substantial
 efficacy. COCAP never trained as many learners as expected, but it i s a viable institution
 that produces quality courses o f some demandby learners and organizations willing to
 pay. LATUacquired the capacity to engage intechnological research, provide technical
 assistance, andmarket informationservices for Uruguayanindustriesand has helped
 increase the competitiveness o fUruguayanimports. The MECAEP Iand I1projects were
 successful inincreasing equity inthe systemthrough improvingparticipationo f the most
 disadvantaged students inpreschool education and full-time schools.

 5.2      For all three projects, relevancewas high andefficacy was substantial. The
 strategy o f increasing the achievement o fpoorer studentsthrough preschool education
 and instructiono f longer durationprovedrelatively effective. Eflciency for all three
projects is ratedsubstantial. The strategy o f increasing the achievement o fpoorer
 studentsthrough preschool education and instructiono flonger durationprovedeffective.
 Inputswere also provided efficiently. Nevertheless, some outcomes fell short. The
 training quality o f COCAP courseshasbeengood, but the limitedcourse selections
 sometimes prevented unemployedtrainees from getting training and findingjobs in
 sectors ofhighdemand. And despite efforts, the MECAEPprojects were not able to
reduce the highrepetitionrates inthe early grades andreap systemic savings.

5.3       The potential for efficiency improvement can be illustratedthrough international
research. European studies o f children taught through simple synthetic phonics show
nearly that all German, Italian, Greek, Spanish, or Turkishlearners become accurate and
fluent readersbythe endofgrade 1.43 Bycomparison, only 23 percent o fUruguayanfirst
graders read fluently by the end o fthe school year.44Children cannot learncontent from
textbooks (including math) untilthey read fluently, and early delays reduce the efficiency
o f subsequent grades and o fthe entire system. One determinant may bethe limited
textbook supply. Another may be the "whole word" readingmethod adoptedby the
government. This method, which i s popular inLatinAmerica, has been the focus ofmuch

43. Readingbasics are taughtin4-6 months, andSpanish students at the endofgrade 1readwith 96 percent accuracy
at 45 wordsperminute(Seymour et al. 2003). For other languagessee Seymour et al. 2003 aswell as Cossu 1999,
Harris andHatano, 1999. SomeUruguayanofficials interviewedthought that poorreadingmightbe linkedto child
malnutritioninUruguay; however, there is no documented linkagebetweenmalnutritionandbasic reading
achievement levels.
44. Ofsecondgraders 66percentreadfluently(ANEP2002b, p. 43). The regionnotes that "the findingthat 66 percent
of second-grade students are readingfluently inUruguay, while criticizedbythe PPAR, is indeedimpressiveby
internationalstandards."

 internationalconcern since the early 1990sbecauseit requires very skilledteachers, time,
 andparental support. 45 Since disadvantaged students often lack the needed support at
 school and at home, research incountries such as UK,US, and New Zealand has found
 that they are more at risk o f failure.46The same problems may arise inUruguay, since
 home practices havebeen found to affect student~erformance.~'The "whole-word"
 methodmay havebeen adopted on the basis o f limitedinformation, as the IEGmission
 didnot locate studies inUruguay or pilots to test its efficiency.

 InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

 5.4       The institutionaldevelopment impact for all projects i s rated substantial. The
 institutions that were supported or created through the Vocational Education and
 TechnologicalDevelopmentProjectimprovedtheir capacity to carry out their activities.
 MECAEP Iand I1supported capacity buildinginthe entire sector. Units for standardized
 testing, textbook production, and curriculum were created, staffed, andcontinuedto
 operate effectively for a decade. Many studies were carried out, and efforts were made to
 implement and disseminate their findings.

 Sustainability

 5.5       The sustainability o f all projects is rated likely. The Vocational Education and
TechnologicalDevelopmentProjecthas sustained most expected benefits for about 20
years. The educational benefits o fMECAEP Iand I1are likelyto be maintained as the
more disadvantaged studentsbecome able to performandcontinue on to secondary
school, ultimately improving their earning capacity.

5.6        Inpoliticalterms, resilience ofprojectbenefits inchangingcircumstances is
likely. A new government took power inMarch2005, anditplansto maintainthe current
policies that target the poor. Inthe short term, the government plans to improve the
physical condition o fthe schools by forming an "impact plan" through the Ministryo f
Educationand Culture.48There i s also a medium-termplanto hire more teachers and
reduce class sizes. Ineconomic terms, however, sustainability i s uncertain. Although
educational investment inUruguay is considered                          debts are large, and fiscal
constraints are real. Though the percentage o f education inthe social budget has
somewhat increased (Table B-7), expenditures on the social sectors have beenreduced

 since 2002 (Table B-6). Staffreport that the Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln.7104) that
 was supposedto protectthe social sector budgets may not be succeeding and that the
 government has reduced education spending by about 29 percent since 2001. Sufficient
 funds maybe enteredinthebudget,but lower amounts are actually allocated andpaid.
 The MECAEP I11project mustoften apply to the treasury for the hndsneededto carry
 out its activities, causing payment and execution delays."

 Bank Performance

 5.7       Overall, Bank performance for the three projects i s satisfactory. Bank
 performance on the vocational education project dates from an earlier era. The design
 corresponded to the needs o fthe institution, but some problems were identified.
 Enrollmentprojections for COCAP were unrealistic and didnot consider the alternative
 o fvocationaltraining provisionthoughprivateproviders. The Bank didnot have at that
 time the technical competence to supervise the LATUcomponent. Informationfrom
 project files indicates disagreements between the Bank's architects andUruguayan staff,
 and the Bank delayed approval on the construction o f LATUbuildinginan effort to force
 questionable changesto it. The project was better suited for the industryrather thanthe
 education sector.

 5.8       For the MECAEP Iand I1projects, there was close collaborationwith the
 government and much exchange o fideas. Government staffpraised the Bank for its rigor,
competence, level o fknowledge, follow-up, and frankness. Itwas reported that Bank staff
respectthe identity o fthe country andhave the capacity to transmit experiencesfrom other
countries. Furthermore, there was task manager continuity, so government staffdidnot
have to explainthe country's particularities repeatedly. However, the MECAEP Idesign
didnot include stakeholder consultations. This omission created difficulties anddelays in
the execution o fMECAEP I. the appraisal o fMECAEP I1stakeholderswere
                                       During
consultedmorebroadly. However, civilwork needs were not realisticallyestimated during
appraisal, and itbecame necessaryto change targets duringimplementation.

5.9       Although international researchhasraised concerns regarding the effects o f the
`whole word' approach since the early 1990s, documents and interviewswith staff showed
that these were not brought to bear inthe discussions leadingto MECAEP I.By 1999,
mher studiesandinternational consultations resultedinwidelypublicizedguidelines by
U S NationalReading Panel infavor o fphonics instruction, particularly for poorer
students.'* But there i s no evidence that these studieswere discussedwith the government
duringMECAEP I1andMECAEP 111, despitetheir potentialrelevanceto Uruguay's high
grade repetitionrate andimpact on the efficient use o fresources. The Bank couldhave
usefbllyadvised the government to evaluate current teaching methods againstalternatives.

 BorrowerPerformance

 5.10      Borrower performance for the vocational educationproject i s ratedsatisfactory.

 dedication, andnearly all activities were substantially completed as planned. Educational

 6.        Quality Educationfor All inUruguay

6.1       In10years o fBankinvestmentinprimaryeducation, Uruguayhasconsolidated
its Educationfor All achievement. At the primary level, coverage and completionrates
have reached 98 percent, while dropout rates are less than 1percent. The parts o f the
system most likely to benefitthe poor have expanded. Universalpreschool enrollment o f
five-year olds was attained in2001, making Uruguayone o fthe first middle-income
countries to reachthis milestone.

6.2       Achievement increases across the boardhave enabledUruguay to score highly in

 6.3       The country expects to provide efficiently high-qualityprimary and secondary
 education for all. Futurepolicy measuresinclude universalizingpreschool education to
 four-year olds and extending attendance downwards to reachpoor children at ever
 younger ages.52The goal o fthe current MECAEP I11project i s to increase equity,
 equality, and efficiency inthe provision o fpreschool andprimaryeducation through (a)
 expanding the full-time school model which focuses on students from socioeconomically
 disadvantaged backgrounds, (b) improving the quality o fpreschool andprimary
 education by enhancing the teacher training system and introducingnew teaching and
 training instruments inthe classrooms, and (c) increasing the efficiency o f educational
 institutions.

 6.4       The government would also liketo universalize coverage insecondary education
 through more differentiatedsecondary school curricula, but student performance i s a
 problem. About 90 percent o fprimary-school graduates enter secondary school, but only
 about 50 percent o fthem graduate. Those who repeat inprimary school often tendto drop
 out o f the system, partly because they cannot pass examinations. Itremains to be seen
 whether the strategy o f offering two or more years ofpreschool will reduce repetition
 rates inthe longrun.

 MaximizingPoor Students' Achievement

 6.5       I t i s hard to learnmuch information from books or read and solve mathproblems
untilstudents are fluentreadersandcomprehend text. Giventheimportance o fearly
reading for schoolwork and a script that i s exceptionallyeasy to master, the government
might consider settingreadingbenchmarks, such as a goal that all childrenshould
become fluent readersby the end o f grade 2. (See norms and goals o fthe U S and other
Hispanic countries.        53)  The government might also conduct studies to estimate the
resources neededto make disadvantaged students fluent readersby the end o f grade 2
given efficient instructionalmethods. Full-time schools might devote some o f the
afternoon time to activities involving systematic readinginthese early grades. Regular
schools might offer extra readinghours inthese early grades.

 Balancingthe Costs andBenefitsofInserviceTeacher Training-SomeInsightfrom
 MissionObservations

 6.7      Observations o fMECAEP I11training events taking place duringthe IEGmission
 raised some concerns regarding the efficiency o fthe activities, particularly giventheir
 sizeable cumulative expenditure~.~'These observations might be significant giventhe
 limitedteacher training effects reported duringMECAEP I.58 with teachers         Meetings
 usedtime inefficiently, allowing lengthy commentaries on general or abstract topics.
 There was limitedrecord-keeping or attempt to summarize and concretize actions. Some
 workshops involved homework, most didnot. Teachers met and conducted group
 projects, which shouldprovide elaboration o f concepts and therefore make them more
 memorable.

 6.8      Teachers are not evaluated on the knowledge acquired and infact have little
 incentive for paying attention or learningduringtraining. Some teachers interviewed
 duringthe IEGmissionhave suggestedthat coursesberigorous and include homework as
 well as a final exam, not merely aproject. Others suggestedthat promotions be made
 contingent on passing exams on training. This way there would be a reasonable incentive
 to actually learn duringtraining.

 6.9      Teacher training under MECAEP I1was found to be usable inclass due to follow-
 up. Hopefbllythis trend will continue. Loanfunds mightbebest usedto finance
 informationthat i s transmissible, that effectively cascades to beneficiaries. It may be
worthwhile to formulate innovative ways to measure the effectiveness o fvarious types o f
"software," cost the informationprovided and the impact ofits use, and assess the
probability that it will be retained and flow to students. Suitable andreadily usable
materials that connect with school curricula might link the informationto classroom
practices.

6.10      Teacher training institutions do not give textbooks to student teachers. As aresult,
teacher trainees must study from notes and library books, and they may thus use their
time less effectivelyand learnlessmaterial. Itmaybe feasible to bindthe content needed

for pre-service teacher training, even ifstudents receive cheap editions or loose-leaf
collections.


7. Lessons
    This assessment confirms a number o fIEGlessons from the education sector:

    0   Preschool attendanceoffers significant academic benefits to low-income students in
        terms o freduced grade repetitionas well as long-term academic achievement (para.
        4.4)

    0   A longer school day may offer important academic and socialbenefits to
        disadvantaged students, including improved test scores. To maximizeperformance
        inhighergrades, however, studentsinlower gradesmightspendpartofthe extra
        time practicingthebasic skills that serve asprerequisites for further learning(paras.
        3.10,4.13, and 6.5).

    0   Quality o f education depends on a strong and functional supervisory chain. If
        government policies and learning activities are to be carried out effectively at the
        school level, teachers mustbe supervisedclosely by knowledgeable and interested
        staff. Although supervision i s often costly interms o f salaries and vehicle support, it
        i s a prerequisite for improvedlearningoutcomes (paras. 3.8 and 5.10).

    0   Project efficiencymaybe enhanced through instructionalmethods that enable most
        o fthe students to achieve educational objectives within the prescribed instructional
        time. Efficientinstructionmaybemore important for disadvantaged children, who
        receive less home support andwho often have higher dropout and grade repetition
        rates. Further research and experimentation would help determine which
        instructional activities are more cost-effective inthe Uruguayancontext (paras. 5.3
        and 5.9).

   0    Vocational-technical education project appraisals may overestimate the number o f
        likely graduates and not adequately take into account dropout rates or changing
        demand for training. Appraisals o f future projects should take into account country
        experience on dropout rates as well as demand changes duringtimes o f economic
        hardship (paras. 2.2-2.4,2.6).

Annex C. Statements and Issues Raised inMission Interviews

Interviewstook place individually or insmall groups as the circumstances dictated. The
persons interviewed included:

    e  6 officials and staff inCOCAP and LATU
    e  6 government officials and staffo f MECAEP
    e  10principals, and 3 inspectors inthe schools o f areas visited.

    e  Teachers were interviewedindividually as well as ingroups (9 inschool no. 359,
       13 inschool no. 360, 58 ina teachers' meetinginLa Florida).

    The table below reflects the number o frespondents who indicateda view on each
question; persons couldraise one or more issues but an opinionbrought up repeatedly by
the same person counted as one comment. Not all staff had opinions about all questions
and sometimes only one person ina group expressedopinions, so reply statistics are
approximate. Teachers were only asked questions regarding inputs and effectiveness,
since most didnot know who hadpaid for the inputsthey hadreceived. The questions
posed to respondents were:



   e   What were the benefits o fthe project inyour school, geographic or sectoral area?
   e   What problems did you face inimplementingthe project? What were its
       disadvantages?
   e   Which components worked best inbringingabout results, which didnot? (Some
       persons interviewedwere asked about specific components, as appropriate.)
   e   How effectivewere the Bank staff or consultants who worked on the project?
   e   What training didyou receive through the project? Didit teach you what it was
       supposedto?
   e   Were there financial irregularitiesinyour area o fjurisdiction?
   e   What would be different inthe education sector ifthe project hadnot existed?
   e   Other issues and observations.
