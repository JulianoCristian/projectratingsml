The following are among the lessons learned\n            from this project: 1) Involvement of stakeholders and\n            beneficiaries in early stages of project design promotes\n            ownership and sustainability. 2) A functioning and\n            up-and-running monitoring and evaluation system from the\n            beginning of implementation is important in guiding project\n            implementation. 3) A training module in preschool education\n            is necessary to prepare teachers for the characteristics of\n            the students entering school. 4) Bank support to the\n            government for the implementation of the full time school\n            (FTS) model has been key to its institutionalization within\n            the education system. 5) Time spent on tasks as well as\n            improvements in the quality of tasks leads to better\n            learning. 6) Developing and using tools to focus and plan is\n            key to achieve project targets and more efficiently identify\n            and implement the project activities. 7) The FTS model is an\n            effective way to improve learning outcomes while addressing\n            equity concerns. 8) Experience from this reveals how crucial\n            it is to have a solid and continuous team for a smooth,\n            timely and coherent project implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
