(b) achieve greater social equity\n            by targeting the expansion of the new pedagogical\n            single-shift (full-time) model of teaching within preschool\n            education and elementary education to socio-economically\n            disadvantaged population. The objectives of the\n            univeralization of preschool education component are (a) to\n            expand the coverage of preschool educate to nearly 100% of\n            children of age 4 and 5; and (b) to improve the quality of\n            public preschool education. The component consists of five\n            sub-components: classroom construction;; classroom equipment\n            and learning materials; training, studies; and promotional\n            campaign for parents and families. The objective of the\n            single shift - full time schools component is to expand a\n            new pedagogical model of full time schools targeted to those\n            children from socio-economically disadvantaged families,\n            thus improving the quality of primary education they receive\n            and expanding their access to learning opportunities. This\n            component consists of five sub-components: improvement of\n            the existing full time schools, classroom equipment and\n            learning materials; training and technical assistance to\n            schools; studies; and promotional campaign."}, "docdt": "1998-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
