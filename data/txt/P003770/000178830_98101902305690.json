enhance\n            the productivity of existing irrigated areas. The project\n            will also expand the data collection and planning base for\n            future water resources development. The project consists of\n            two construction components: the Cipamingkis irrigation\n            system (7,600 ha); preliminary works on the Jragung Dam,\n            which will benefit 10,500 ha; and studies and investigations\n            under a Hydrologic Measurement Program and Cimanuk River\n            Water Management Program. The project will ultimately\n            benefit about 36,000 families and will increase rice\n            production by nearly 35,000 tons per year. Project risks are\n            normal for projects of this kind."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
