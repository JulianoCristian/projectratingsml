ELEV]ENTH IRRIGATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Republ:ic of Indonesia
Amount:                $31.0 million equivalent in various currencies
Terms:                 Twenty years, including five years of grace, with
interest at 7.5% per annum
Project Description:  The proposed project would assist the Government's
program to extend the provision of irrigation facilities
and to provide storage to enhance the productivity of
existing irrigated areas. The project would also
expand the data collection and planning base for future
water resources development. The project consists of
two construction components: the Cipamingkis irrigation
system (7,600 ha); preliminary works on the Jragung
Dam, which would benefit 10,500 ha; and studies and
investigations under a Hydrologic Measurement Program
and the Cimanuk River Water Management Program. The
project would ultimately benefit about 36,000 families
and would increase rice production by nearly 35,000 tons
per year. Project risks are normal for projects of this
kind.
Estimated Cost:        The table below summarizes the total cost of the

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR AN
ELEVENTH IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of $31 million to help
finance an Eleventh Irrigation Project. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 7.5% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The last economic report on Indonesia, "Indonesia:  Recent Develop-
ments, Short-Term Prospects and Development Issues," of April 26, 1978
(2026-IND) was circulated to the Executive Directors on April 28, 1978.
3.        During Indonesia's First Development Plan period (1969/70-
1973/74),/2 the rehabilitation of the Indonesian economy was almost completed.
Transport, power, irrigation works and other infrastructure facilities, after
years of neglect, were greatly improved and strengthened. Agricultural
output expanded at an average rate of 4.5% a year and the foundations of
modern industry - fertilizer, cement, etc. - were laid. During this period,
the annual rate of economic growth exceeded 7.5%; domestic savings and
investments also rose rapicdly.
4.        With the start ofE the Second Development Plan period (1974/75-
1978/79), the Government expected that rehabilitation would be completed and
a start made on a course oE long-term development which would assure not
only a satisfactory rate oE economic growth but also a wider distribution of
income. Progress in these respects has been mixed. While there has been
considerable further improvement in the country's physical and social
infrastructure (power, roads, telecommunications, education, family planning),
much of the Government's atLtention and efforts have been focused on short-
term issues, the economic growth rate has tended to slacken, and public
concern with equitable distribution of income has grown. The first two
years of the Plan were dominated by the developments in the oil sector -
the sharp increase in the price of oil and Pertamina's serious financial
difficulties. The latter arose from Pertamina's undertaking of a large and
diverse investment program without arranging satisfactory financing. Foreign
bank credit became more restrictive with the onset of world recession.
Pertamina was unable to roll over its short-term debt and failed to meet the

Mining and Transportation Engineering Project.

financial obligations which were falling due.  In these circumstances, the
Government stepped in and assumed the oil company's obligations. The repay-
ment of these obligations, along with the fall in export earnings as a result
of the recession, necessitated large foreign commercial borrowing, seriously
strained the Government's budgetary resources and Indonesia's balance of
payments, and led to a sharp decline in the foreign exchange reserves.
5.        In most respects, the Government managed the Pertamina crisis
well, and the following two years (1976/77 and 1977/78) witnessed a substan-
tial improvement in the balance of payments and the Government's budgetary
position as well as a reduction in the rate of domestic inflation. During
1976/77 Indonesia's exports recovered strongly (following improvements in
the world economy), and rose to a higher level than anticipated. Imports
continued to increase rapidly but the rate of increase of import prices
slowed down, and Indonesia's terms of trade improved. These trends continued
into 1977/78, and resulted in substantial additions to the foreign exchange
reserves, which have averaged over $2 billion (or about four months of
imports) in the early months of 1978.
6.        The Government's budgetary position also improved in 1976/77.
With the boost in oil exports and a further renegotiation of oil contracts,
oil revenues rose by close to 40%. Non-oil revenues also exceeded the
amounts budgeted, mainly as a result of government efforts to curb smuggling
and a more rigorous collection of customs duties. The additional revenues
together with continued restraint on current expenditures enabled the
Government not only to increase development expenditures substantially
but also to repay the debt to Bank Indonesia, which it had incurred in
the previous year. This helped to neutralize the monetary expansion on
account of the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, and contributed to
bringing down the inflation rate to 14% a year compared to 20% in 1975/76.
The Government budget tightened in 1977/78, since oil as well as non-oil
revenues rose more modestly while current expenditures rose more rapidly
largely due to an overdue general increase in civil servant salaries. As
a result, budgetary savings declined in real terms for the first time in
recent years. Nevertheless, through a cautious monetary policy, the
inflation rate was further reduced to about 10%.
7.        The substantial increase in oil revenues since 1974 has been
largely invested. Government development expenditures more than quadrupled
from 1973/74 to 1977/78 when they amounted to Rp 2.5 trillion (or about
$6 billion); even after allowing for the high rate of inflation, this
represented a real increase of over 30% a year. Over this period, the rate
of gross domestic investment averaged about 22.5% of GNP. However, this
high level of investments has so far failed to increase the rate of growth
of the Indonesian economy; economic growth in the first four years of
Indonesia's Second Development Plan (1974/75-1977/78) has, in fact, been
slower than that in the First Plan period. The world recession, slackening



- 3 -
agricultural output and domestic inflation (which made some domestic industries
uncompetitive with imports), all had a dampening effect on the growth of the
economy. In addition, public investments in recent years have been concentrated
on relatively capital-intensive industrial and infrastructure projects with
long gestation periods. Moreover, the realization of economic benefits from
investments in such sectors as transportation, telecommunications, etc.,
depends on the growth in demand which in turn is determined by the growth
of the rest of the economy, mainly the private sector, which has failed to
provide the necessary momentum to growth. The indications are that private
investments rose only modestly in recent years for a number of reasons,
including the Government's attempts to control domestic inflation and to
encourage indigenous (pribumiL) investors, and the uncertain state of the
world economy.
8.        Between 1961 and 1971, the population of Indonesia grew by 2.1%
annually; with high fertility rates, increasing longevity and an age distri-
bution heavily weighted towards the younger groups, there was a widespread
expectaton that growth would further accelerate, and reach at least 2.3% over
the 1971-1976 period.  Yet the Inter-Censal Population Survey shows that the
growth rate was actually reduced to 2.0% and that Indonesia's population
stood at 130.2 million in March 1976, about 5 million less than had been
expected. Further declines in mortality may actually raise the growth rate
once again, but there is now hope that the population will reach 200 million
only at the end of the century - later than according to even the lowest
earlier projection.
9.        The most outstanding and encouraging feature to emerge from recent
data was a marked decline in fertility levels in Java and Bali. The total
fertility rate for Java declined from 5.5 in 1971 to 4.4 in 1976, a drop of
20%. In Bali, fertility declined even more dramatically, from 5.8 to 3.8, by
more than a third. The National Family Planning Program, which began in 1970
and enjoys strong political backing and support from major religious and other
private organizations, ia believed to be an important reason for the fertility
decline. A start was recently made to extend the the services of the Program
to the other islands. Their total fertility rate was 6.8 in 1971 - well
above that of Java - and it showed no decline up to 1976. Mortality rates
also differ sharply. Life expectation in the other islands is 47 years as
against 49 years in Java. Moreover, the gap itself appears to be widening,
although mortality rates are diminishing everywhere.
10.       Information on underemployment and wages is incomplete and not very
reliable but there are indications that the growth in opportunities for
gainful employment has about kept pace with the growth of the labor force
since 1970. Real wages do not seem to have fallen. This is encouraging,
since many of the changes that are taking place in agricultural production
and processing techniques, including improved transportation, mechanical rice
hulling, etc., are of a labor saving nature. It is evident that farming on
Java is increasingly becoming a part-time activity, that landlessness is
becoming more common and that a growing proportion of Java's rural population
is primarily or exclusively dependent on the sale of their labor to earn an



- 4 -
income. The need for greater emphasis on the promotion of labor-intensive
export industries and the development of small and medium-scale rural indus-
tries deserves high priority in the formulation of future development plans.
11.       Perhaps the most worrying development in recent years, and one with
important long-term implications, is the slackening in the rate of growth in
agricultural production, particularly of rice. Over the 1975-77 period, rice
output failed to rise appreciably; for 1977, rice production is estimated at
15.9 million tons, about the same as the previous year, and almost 10% below the
Second Plan target for that year. The domestic price of rice has been kept
stable only by means of very substantial imports. In 1976/77 rice imports
amounted to 1.6 million tons and in 1977/78 they reached 2.6 million tons, or
over 15% of domestic consumption and 30% of total world trade in rice. The
stagnation in rice output over the last two years, while reflecting a complex
of institutional and policy constraints, is primarily the result of successive
droughts and, in Java, the wereng (brown planthopper) infestation. Long-term
expansion of food crop production and a substantial reduction in rice imports,
require prompt assessment of available land and water resources, accelerated
construction of irrigation and drainage facilities, acceleration in land
settlement and transmigration programs based on food crop production and,
most importantly, expansion and deepening of agricultural support services.
12.       The long-term consequences of the Pertamina crisis remain in the
form of large foreign debt and some burdensome ongoing investment projects.
The heavy foreign borrowing in 1974, 1975 and the early part of 1976, together
with a hardening of average terms during those years, have raised the level
of debt service payments which are now expected to reach about $1.5 billion
in 1978, or about 18% of projected export earnings. The debt service ratio /1
was 15% in 1976 and 16% in 1977; the ratio is expected to remain below 20% in
1979 and 1980. This is the encouraging result of restraint with regard to
new borrowing in 1976 and 1977 and the recent replacement on more favorable
terms of the remaining payments on cash loans (originally totalling $1 bil-
lion) which had been obtained in 1975 from a number of private banks in
the wake of the Pertamina crisis. Total new loan commitments declined from a
peak of $3.3 billion in 1975 to $3.2 billion in 1976 and to $1.7 billion in
1977. Most of the decline was achieved through a reduction in commercial
borrowing. This means that average loan terms have recently begun to soften
again, which will be reflected in future debt service payments.
13.       The Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) continues to be
the principal source of external capital, including Official Development
Assistance (ODA), to the country. Total ODA (bilateral and multilateral)
commitments in 1977/78 (including grants) amounted to about $1.4 billion; the
IGGI (including the World Bank Group and Asian Development Bank) accounted
/1 Ratio of debt service payments to commodity export earnings, with oil
and gas on a net basis.



-5-
for over 90% of this amount. The Bank's most recent economic report on
Indonesia recommends that total ODA to Indonesia should reach at least
$1.75 billion in 1978/79, including both loans and grants.
14.       As a result of the pattern and terms of external borrowing during
the recent past, net resource transfers from abroad are expected to decline
in 1978/79 to about $600 mLillion, even if the recommended level of new ODA
commitments is reached. At the same time, there is a growing doubt that
crude oil production can be increased much above the current level of 1.7 mil-
lion barrels a day during the next few years. Oil exploration activity in
Indonesia has remained much below the peak of 1975 partly as a result
of the renegotiation of the oil contracts in 1976 and partly on account of a
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ruling which declared the oil revenues withheld
by the Government of Indonesia as royalties rather than tax for the purpose
of allowing income tax credit to the U.S. companies operating in Indonesia.
In the meantime no large new oil fields have been discovered, and, although
the Government has now offered improved incentives to the oil companies and
revised the contracts to meet the IRS objections, it is not certain that the
exploration activity would. revive soon enough to make up for the time lost.
15.       The implication of recent developments for imports, exports, net
service payments and future capital inflow requirements is currently under
study, but indications are that, while foreign exchange will be scarcer
over the coming years, Indonesia would be able to finance essential imports
of consumer, intermediate and capital goods and still meet its debt service
obligations. However, the relative decline in oil revenues will have serious
budgetary consequences. In order to maintain the relatively high rate of
domestic investment already reached, the Government would need to raise
substantial additional non-oil revenues over the coming years. The Government
has been quite cautious in. increasing current expenditures and there does not
appear to be much scope for reducing them further; they should, in fact, rise
in step with the growth in GNP and inflation, to permit reasonable growth in
Government salaries as well as materials expenditures, a significant part of
which is development related. Nevertheless, despite the Government's efforts
to limit current expenditures and raise domestic revenue, there is likely to
be a serious domestic resource constraint in the coming years.
16.       The Government is fully aware of the serious concerns regarding
Indonesia's future development discussed above and will make them the focus of
the Third Development Plan. which is now under preparation. In the meantime
the Bank is undertaking a major review of the development problems facing
Indonesia, covering in depth such issues as domestic and foreign resource
mobilization, as well as trends and outlook for agricultural growth, popula-
tion, employment, and income distribution. This review is expected to assist
the Government's deliberations and preparation of the Third Plan; the final
report will be ready towards the end of 1978.
PART II - WORLD BANK OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
17.      As of March 31, 1978, Indonesia had received 38 IDA credits
totalling $601.8 million and 31 Bank loans amounting to $1,526 million. At
that date, IFC investments totaled $61.3 million. The share of the Bank



-6-
Group in Indonesia's total (disbursed) external debt outstanding at the end
of 1976 was about 6% and the share of debt service, less than 1%. By 1978,
these ratios are expected to increase to around 12% and 5%, respectively.
Annex II contains a summary of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and IFC Investments
as of March 31, 1978, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
18.      To date, the Bank Group has financed projects in virtually all
sectors of the Indonesian economy, although there has been particular stress
on agriculture, which accounts for over one third of all lending. Most of
the loans for agriculture have been for rehabilitation and expansion of
productive capacity, both for food and tree crop development. Several
national programs to provide inputs and advice to farmers and to promote
agricultural research have also been financed by the Bank Group. More
recently, a major effort to aid the Government's transmigration program has
been initiated. In the industrial sector, while the major thrust has been on
expanding fertilizer production on the basis of Indonesia's gas resources and
on establishment and improvement of development finance institutions, a
Credit has recently been extended to finance a small enterprise development
project. The main emphasis in education has been on improving primary and
secondary education and manpower training as well as on expanding non-formal
education. In the social sector, the Bank Group has also financed urban
development, through neighborhood improvement programs, urban water supplies
and family planning and nutrition. A major portion of Bank Group financing
has been used to rehabilitate and expand Indonesia's inadequate infrastructure,
particularly in the power and transportation sectors. Credits have also been
extended to finance a telecommunications project and a tourism project.
Finally, the Bank Group has assisted the Government's efforts to prepare and
formulate its development programs and projects through four technical
assistance Credits and a Loan for a natural resource survey and mapping
project.
19.      Bank Group lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in 1968
for irrigation rehabilitation, with lending on Bank terms commencing in June
1974. Disbursements on Loans and Credits, which were slow in the early years,
are now at satisfactory levels. The Indonesian authorities have also become
increasingly aware of the cost to the country of delays in project execution,
caused by cumbersome procedures, and the need to establish an effective
control system in BAPPENAS (the National Development Planning Agency). At
the Government's request, the Bank arranged in 1974, for assistance under the
Fourth Technical Assistance Credit (Cr. 451-IND) to help set up a monitoring
and control system which is now in operation and which should lead to
improved project implementation not only of Bank Group-assisted projects but
of development projects generally.
20.      The discussion in Part I of this report underscores the need for a
development program which will provide increasingly productive work opportun-
ities and incomes for Indonesia's presently underemployed and growing labor
force and increase agriculture production, particularly of food crops.
Efforts to increase employment through programs directed towards improving
the incomes of the poor and their living standards are expected to be the
major focus of the Third Development Plan (1979-84) which is now under
preparation. To assist the Government, the Bank (as mentioned in para 16



- 7 -
above) has undertaken a major review of the development problems facing
Indonesia. This review should help the Government formulate policies and
programs to expand food production, further reduce population growth, and
expand nonfarm rural employment, particularly in Java. While some of these
programs are likely to be suitable for Bank Group financing, it will be some
time before they are ready for implementation. Meantime, a small enterprise
development project designed to increase non-agricultural employment in rural
areas and small towns, has already been approved by the Executive Directors,
and an integrated rural development project is being processed. With respect
to agriculture development, projects are being prepared which would improve
and expand agriculture credit, research and extension services, rehabilitate
and expand irrigation systems, help replant smallholder rubber and coconut
plantations, and develop presently underutilized land in areas outside Java
for transmigrants and other smallholders. In addition to the population
program, which continues to have high priority, other areas of particular
importance for Bank Group assistance will be improvement of urban services
through construction of urban water supply systems and further expansion of
neighborhood improvement programs, and improvement and expansion of higher
education particularly of technicians, accountants and agriculture specialists,
as well as primary and secondary education. Finally, Bank Group financing
continues to be important: for the Government's program of infrastructure
rehabilitation and expansion, particularly in transport and power, which will
continue to require very large investments for many years before these
facilities are adequate to support Indonesia's development.
21.      Between 1968 and 1974, all Bank Group lending to Indonesia was on IDA
terms. Following the rapid increase in Indonesia's oil income which enabled
Indonesia to borrow on less concessional terms, it was decided that all
lending to Indonesia after June 30, 1974, would be on Bank terms. Since 1974,
the Government has saved and invested almost all of the increase in its oil
revenues and greatly expanded its development expenditures which are expected
to reach about $6 billion in 1977/78. For reasons discussed in Part I above,
it now appears, however, that both the budgetary and balance of payments
situation is again likely to become more difficult in the years ahead. Thus,
while Indonesia has always qualified for assistance on concessional terms on
grounds of its low per capita income ($240 in 1977) and the quality of its
economic management, such terms are now also necessary to enable it to
maintain a high level of investment without impairing its ability to service
its external debt. The Bank has accordingly informed the Government that,
starting in FY78, it will provide a portion of its lending on IDA terms.
22.      In the past few years, the Bank Group has financed, from time to time,
part of the local cost of projects with a low foreign exchange component,
particularly in the social sectors, in order to make a meaningful contribution
to the financing of these projects. As noted in Part I, Indonesia now faces
a more difficult financia[l situation, in part for reasons outside its control.
Despite the Government's efforts to increase its non-oil revenues and limit
the growth of current expenditures, Government savings in real terms are
likely to increase very slowly, if at all. At the same time, the Government



- 8 -
is attempting to increase development expenditures, particularly for employment-
creating programs, as well as for programs and projects in agriculture and the
social sectors, the costs of which are largely in local currency. The Bank
Group cannot provide adequate assistance to the Government's overall develop-
ment effort if it limits its financing to the foreign exchange cost of
projects, and future Bank Group financing will, therefore, include increasing
amounts for local costs particularly in the case of projects designed to
create nonfarm employment, provide social services and raise agriculture
production.
23.      The proposed loan is the seventh lending operation presented to the
Executive Directors this fiscal year and would bring total lending to
Indonesia this year to $410 million. Projects for rural credit, and nucleus
estate and smallholders are expected to be ready for presentation in the next
few weeks.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SECTOR
Major Issues
24.       The major issues facing the agricultural and rural sector in Indo-
nesia are: the need to create productive employment opportunites to raise
the incomes of the rural poor; the need to increase domestic food supply to
keep pace with rising demand; the need to expand production of agricultural
exports, particularly smallholder tree crops; and the need to ensure productive,
sustainable use of Indonesia's varied land, water and other natural resources.
These issues are all interrelated. Their solution will necessarily involve
complex and sometimes novel technical and organizational approaches, along
with attendant risks that must be recognized and accepted if programs are to
be developed to deal with Indonesia's problems on the requisite scale. The
risks of action must be weighed against the risks of inaction in the face of
widespread poverty and underemployment, growing food import requirements, and
ecological damage caused by insufficient control of deforestation.
Role and Performance of the Sector
25.       Although the contribution of agriculture to GDP and exports has
declined during the last 15 years, the rural sector continues to be of over-
whelming importance to the vast majority of the Indonesian people in terms
of employment, incomes and food production. Some 80% of the country's
135.5 million people /1 live in rural areas. With the exception of oil palm
and tea, agriculture is dominated by smallholder production; there are some
14.4 million smallholders producing subsistence and cash crops on 14.2 mil-
lion ha and 1,800 large estates occupying 2.2 million ha. Over the five
years to 1976, the growth rate of agricultural production has been uneven,
/1 Estimate for mid-1978 based on Inter-Censal Population Survey of March 1976.



-9-
averaging 3.8% while total GDP grew at 7.9%. In 1977, agricultural perfor-
mance was disappointing. For the second straight year, rice production was
plagued by inadequate or untimely rainfall in many parts of Java, and by pest
and disease damage to high yielding varieties. In view of the critical role
of agriculture as the prim;ary source of household income for over half of all
Indonesians, the slowdown in agricultural growth takes on considerable social
significance.
Development Problems and Potentials
26.       In Java, the cultivable land is almost fully utilized and in some
areas agricultural land usie already exceeds ecologically safe limits. In
1976 about 82 million people lived in Java which has 45% of the cropped area
and only 7% of the country's total land area. About one-third of Java's
rural population is landless and a large proportion cannot support themselves
on incomes from their own farms. Outside Java there are large areas of
unused cultivable land, although less fertile than in Java, and other natural
resources to be exploited. While the inhabitants of these islands do not
enjoy high standards of living, they are generally better off than many in
Java.
Development Strategies
27.       Employment:  Perhaps the single most important challenge facing
the Indonesian Government is to guide and structure the development
process in such a way that the creation of new opportunities for gainful
employment does at least keep pace with the growth of the labor force. The
changes associated with modernization in rural Java are generally labor-saving,
so that farming is increasingly becoming a part-time activity. Modern manufac-
turing and services have been unable to absorb the incremental labor force.
Successful locally administered public rural works programs (INPRES), may be
difficult to expand due to limited budget and implementation capacity. Future
employment strategy will therefore stress labor-intensive export industries
and small-scale rural enterprises producing for the domestic market. There
may also be potential for more productive agricultural employment through
increased cropping intensity and a shift to higher value crops and livestock,
including fruits and vegetables grown on house compounds.
28.       Food Crops:  Despite the heavy emphasis on rice production
in the past, recent developments suggest a widening gap between domestic
production and demand for food. The rate of growth of rice production
appears to have declined in recent years and the principal non-rice food
crops have stagnated. There is no room for relaxing the national rice
production effort. To kee!p rice imports below some reasonable fraction of
world trade in rice, demand must be shifted to other domestic and imported
staples and production must grow at around 4% per year. Improved water
management and agricultural supporting services are essential for increasing
rice yields and production. On Java there remains much scope for more
efficient water use, through construction of additional tertiary and quater-
nary canals. On the other islands there is potential for new irrigation
systems including tidal anid swamp land development. Efforts to increase rice



- 10 -
production must include an intensified research and extension effort to solve
the pest and disease problem. Upland food crops also offer promising develop-
ment prospects. There is much room for yield improvement through intensified
research and supporting services, and tremendous scope for area expansion in
the other islands if stable, long-term cropping systems can be developed. In
addition, a food policy which emphasizes upland crop production as well as
rice would serve the twin goals of growth and equity better than a policy
aimed exclusively at rice, as many of the poorest parts of Java and the other
islands are best suited to dry land farming.
29.       Transmigration:  Transmigration offers challenging opportunities
for improving social equity and the economic use of Indonesia's two main
underemployed resources: Javanese labor and land in the other islands.
Transmigration has long been hampered by unrealistic expectations about its
potential contribution to regional development and the solution of Java's
population problems, overambitious targets and weak, uncoordinated implemen-
tation. These problems are now being addressed. The present focus is on the
organizational aspects of transmigration, the development of an economically
viable farming system, and the design of a least cost package of services
needed to ensure successful, long-term settlement.
30.       Tree Crops:  The Government has embarked on a major effort to
develop smallholder tree crops outside Java as part of its transmigration
and national rubber and coconut replanting programs. The objective is to
improve production on existing blocks while developing large areas of new
land for settlement. One of the Government's main approaches has been to use
public estate companies to plant tree crops on land to be settled by local
landless families and transmigrants. The estate companies provide a range of
services including planting material, land clearing and planting, inputs,
processing and marketing facilities for the smallholders. This approach is
well taken in view of Indonesia's scarce managerial and technical capabilities.
The Role of the Government
31.       The capacity of the Indonesian Government to plan and implement
agricultural and rural development programs has generally improved over the
past decade. However, future programs responsive to the Government's stated
objectives will necessarily be more complex than those which the Government
has followed up to now. They will require closely coordinated "packages" of
research, extension, inputs, credit, land development, transportation and
marketing improvements. Multi-agency integrated area development programs
in Java and land settlement schemes in the other islands will require
stronger field organizations of Government line agencies and local govern-
mental authorities, as well as new administrative arrangements. With the
more complex organizational requirements of future programs, implementation
capacity is likely to become the limiting factor in Indonesia's economic
and social development. It is therefore of utmost importance that the
Government continue its efforts to strengthen the key rural development
institutions.



Bank Lending Strategy
32.       There is general agreement between the Bank and the Government on
the overall objectives and strategies proposed for the rural sector. While
views sometimes differ on the relative emphasis to be given to different
investments and on the technical design of some projects, such differences
are not profound and are likely to be resolved with further analysis and
dialogue.
33.       The Bank has been and should continue to be involved in a broad
range of agricultural and rural activities in Indonesia. Since the first
irrigation credit in 1968 the Bank has rapidly expanded its agricultural and
rural lending to include support for estate and smallholder tree crops,
fertilizer production and distribution, sugar estates, support services,
transmigration, livestock and fisheries. An integrated rural development
project is currently being appraised. Of the three credits closed within the
last year (Estates I, Irrigation I and Pusri Fertilizer), all showed excellent
rates of return ranging from 25% to 33%. Taking 1974 as base year, Bank-
financed projects will con,tribute almost 60% of the increase in palm oil
output by 1980, about 16% of incremental sugar production and 6% of incremental
rice and rubber. Four continuing trends in Bank agricultural lending to
Indonesia are: (a) a shift from rehabilitation to new development activities;
(b) a shift from support of state enterprises to direct support of smallholders;
(c) an increased emphasis on rainfed systems; and (d) greater emphasis on
development of the other islands. All these trends are consistent with the
Government's changing policies.
The Irrigation Subsector
34.       Rice is the dominant irrigated crop in Indonesia.  Of an estimated
8.4 million ha of rice harvested in 1976, 7.2 million ha were irrigated or
grown under wet land condiitions. Irrigation systems cover about 5 million
ha, of which Java accounts for 60%. Average paddy yields on Java are
about 3.3 ton/ha compared with 2.8 ton/ha in the other islands. Although
irrigation has long been a major feature of Indonesian agriculture, by the
late 1960s the systems built during the colonial period were in a state
of complete disrepair. Irrigation development during the first two develop-
ment plan periods concentrated heavily on the rehabilitation of these
systems. Construction of new systems, mainly to serve as the basis for
transmigration projects outside Java, lagged behind.
35.       The share of the irrigation program in the annual development
budget over the last ten years was between 10 and 12%. Since the late 1960s,
the area harvested under irrigation has increased at an average annual rate
of almost 2%, compared with the increase of total rice area harvested of just
under 1%. Over the same period, the production of rice on irrigated land
increased at an average annual rate of 4.3%, compared with almost 3.8% for
rice production in Indonesia as a whole. It is difficult, however, to
quantify the impact of the Government's investment in irrigation. Apart from
the fact that most rehabilitation projects are still in various stages of



- 12 -
construction, the main difficulty is that yields of irrigated rice are the
result of the interaction of a number of factors which jointly influence the
final outcome. These factors include the level of fertilizer application and
crop management standards, as well as random events such as attacks of pests
and diseases and various climatic influences. However, it is generally
accepted that irrigation development was a major and an essential ingredient
in the 3.8% annual increase in total rice production between 1968-70 and
1974-76.
36.       Irrigation development under the First and Second Five-Year Plans
has concentrated heavily on rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems.
Bank-assisted projects, including this and the proposed Tenth Irrigation
Project, cover about 1.2 million ha and account for over half the external
assistance commitments for irrigation in Indonesia, or about 20% of the total
budget for irrigation over recent years, and thus constitute an important
element in the total program. Despite the rapid increase in the size of the
program, the shortage of trained Indonesian staff to execute the projects and
the budgetary constraints, which in turn were exacerbated by cost overruns
brought about by high inflationary trends in the early 1970s, the program as
a whole developed successfully. Good progress has been achieved in Bank-
assisted projects, as evinced in the OED Project Performance Audit Report for
Credit 127-IND (Report No. 2047) which concluded that the project has been a
success and that the growth and effective management of PROSIDA, the agency
responsible for implementing most Bank-assisted irrigation projects in
Indonesia, constitute a notable achievement in institution building. Institu-
tional development has not, however, been confined to PROSIDA; Bank assistance
has also been extended to most of the Directorates and executive bodies of
the Directorate-General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD). This assis-
tance, together with that of other bilateral and multilateral organizations,
has helped make the DGWRD one of the most efficient Government agencies in
Indonesia. Nonetheless, given the size of the irrigation program, continued
assistance from consultants will be needed if projects are to be implemented
expeditious ly.
37.       With the rehabilitation of most existing irrigation systems
either completed or under way, future irrigation development in Indonesia
will shift to the construction of new gravity systems and swamp and tidal
land development outside Java. This shift does not mean, however, that
irrigation development on Java should stop. Many of the existing systems
still need to be fully rehabilitated or upgraded at relatively low cost,
and the limited potential for large storage and groundwater should be
developed to expand dry season cropping as far as economically feasible.
A recent Bank review of Indonesia's irrigation program concluded that to
expand rice production along with demand at 4% per year, the level of
investment in irrigation should be increased by about 20%. This in turn
would require further strengthening of the DGWRD, training and staff develop-
ment, and an expansion of agricultural supporting services. The proposed
project fits in well with these conclusions.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The proposed project was prepared by the various agencies of the
DGWRD in the Ministry of Public Works, and the semi-autonomous Jatiluhur
Authority (under the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry), with consul-
tant assistance from Engineering Consultants Inc. (USA), P.T. Indah Karya
(Indonesia) and Gadja Madah University (Indonesia). The project was appraised
in October 1977. A Staff Appraisal Report (No. 1905b-IND dated May 1, 1978)
is being distributed separately. Supplementary project data are provided in
Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington from April 3 to 17, 1978
with the Indonesian delegation led by Mr. Suyono Sosrodarsono, Director-General
of Water Resources Development.
39.       The components of the project would address a number of different
aspects of the Bank's lending strategy in Indonesia. The studies and investi-
gations would both upgrade the national hydrologic data base (and also
provide a detailed planning framework for a major river basin. The construc-
tion components would aim to increase production from existing irrigation
areas and to bring controlled irrigation to rainfed or partly irrigated land.
The components have been packaged as one project because of their high
priority and their advanced state of preparation and also because of the
Government's desire for the Bank to be associated with the full spectrum of
its water resources development program. The financing of only the preliminary
stages of the construction of the Jragung Dam is proposed in order to expedite
the initiation of the dam itself, thus ensuring that the multiple benefits of
flood control, irrigation and municipal water supply, as well as the benefits
of the SEDEKU component of the Ninth Irrigation project (Loan 1435-IND) could
be realized more quickly. Possible assistance for the construction of the
dam itself has been left unitil final designs and contract documents are
available. In order to ensure that full utilization of the works financed
under this project, an assurance has been obtained that the Government would
proceed with the timely construction of the Jragung Dam and its appurtenant
facilities in accordance with a time schedule to be agreed with the Bank
(Section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement).
Detailed Features of the Project
40.       The project consists of two construction components and two studies
and investigations. The construction components comprise the Cipamingkis
subproject in West Java, and preliminary works for the Jragung Dam in Central
Java.
41.       The Cipamingkis area has a semi-technical irrigation system for
only about 500 ha at present, and various parts of the area receive some
semi-controlled flooding through village irrigation systems. Under the
project a complete irrigation system, including diversion weir, primary,
secondary and tertiary canals, drains and roads and associated structures,
would be constructed to serve the full 7,600 ha. The subproject would depend
on natural flows in the Cipamingkis River. Construction would take about
four years.



- 14 -
42.       In the Jragung area in Central Java, just southeast of Semarang,
irrigation based on run-of-the-river flows is currently available for only
4,400 ha of the 10,500 ha ultimate service area. Water is diverted at the
Jragung and Glapan weirs. The 50-year old canal systems have been largely
rehabilitated over the last decade with Government funds. Under the Ninth
Irrigation project (Loan 1435-IND), additional construction, rehabilita-
tion and upgrading are being carried out for 4,400 ha and the remaining
3,200 ha in the Jragung irrigation system are being rehabilitated with local
funds. The Jragung Dam is one of a number of potential investments identi-
fied during a Netherlands-financed study of the water resources of the East
Semarang area and the first to reach the final design stage, with US techni-
cal assistance. The dam would have important flood control, municipal water
supply and power benefits, in addition to irrigation. Construction of the
dam would enable the 7,600 ha Jragung main canal service area to be cropped
in both seasons, make available return flows to irrigate an additional
1,100 ha adjacent area in the dry season, and provide flood protection for
1,800 ha along the river. The economic merits of including the hydroelectric
facilities would be reviewed during the detailed design phase. The Jragung
Dam is one of three sources of municipal water for Semarang that the Government
plans to utilize over the next few years. The other two sources, which would
not be sufficient by themselves to meet the projected demands, are the Muncul
Springs and groundwater sources, now being investigated with ADB assistance.
Under the proposed project, only the access road, diversion tunnel and base
camp would be constructed. The diversion tunnel would be 400 m long and 4 m
in diameter. Construction would require 2 years, while the dam itself would
be ready for tendering in about 18 months.
43.       Under the Hydrologic Measurement Program, about 120 streamflow
gauging, 20 climatological and 40 rainfall stations would be established and
equipped, covering 23 Provinces. Equipment and technical assistance would
also be provided to eliminate the existing backlog in the publication and
analysis of hydrologic data. Training would also be provided. Implementa-
tion of the program would fill existing gaps in the gauging network,
especially for smaller streams and mountainous areas, and would be an
imoortant prerequisite for the rational planning of future water resources
development.
44.       The 3,600 sq km Cimanuk River Basin in West Java is one of the most
important river basins in Indonesia in terms of present and potential future
water utilization. As a result of uncontrolled development of the upper
reaches, silt loads are heavy and pose serious problems for the operation of
the 90,000 ha Rentang and other irrigation areas. Several studies have been
made for various potential water resource developments within the basin, some
of which are being constructed, but an overall planning framework is lacking.
Under the project, consultants would be engaged to develop a master plan for the
control and effective utilization of the land and water resources of the Cimanuk
River and to review the existing plans for flood protection works for the
lower reaches of the Cimanuk river, as well as the adjacent Cipanas and
Ciwaringin Rivers.



- 15 --
Project Cost and Financing
45.       The total project cost is estimated at $47.4 million (exclusive
of direct taxes), with a foreign exchange component of $26.9 million (57%).
Because of the uncertainties in estimating quantities for the canal system at
Cipamingkis, the equipment needs for the Hydrologic Measurement Program and
the inherent uncertainties of the tunneling work at Jragung, physical conting-
encies of 25% for the civil works cost of the Cipamingkis subproject and the
Hydrologic Measurement Program, 40% for the Jragung tunnel, 20% for equipment
and vehicles and 10 to 15% for other items have been applied. These contingen-
cies reflect past experience on similar projects in Indonesia. The estimated
price contingencies assume annual rates declining from 14 to 8% for civil
works and from 8 to 7% for equipment and services over the project period.
These price increases, which are based on recent trends, total 25% of the
base cost (in April 1978 prices) plus physical contingencies. Consultant
costs have been estimatecd at $8,000/man-month (including all overheads,
housing, and travel) for expatriate firms and $1,200/man-month for local
firms. The proposed Bank loan of $31.0 million would finance the full
foreign exchange cost of the project ($26.9 million) plus $4.1 million of
local costs. The remaining expenditures would be met by annual Central
Government budgetary allocations. Retroactive financing of about $500,000
for consultant services is proposed to permit an early start to the Cimanuk
River Water Management Program.
46.       Vehicles and equipment for construction and operation (estimated
cost $2.8 million) and major civil works for the Cipamingkis subproject and
Jragung Dam (estimated cost $17.3 million) would be procured after inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. For purposes
of bid evaluation a preference equal to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported
goods, on the level of customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to
qualified domestic manufacturers, and a margin of preference of 7-1/2% would
be granted to local contractors for civil works. Vehicles (up to a maximum of
27) for consultants and items of equipment costing less than $10,000 each and
limited to an aggregate total of $400,000 would be purchased through normal
Government procurement procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. There
are sufficient supplies of such goods to ensure adequate completion. All
contracts for vehicles and equipment in excess of $100,000 in value would be
submitted to the Bank for review before bidding and award.
47.       Since the remaining civil works at Cipamingkis and construction of
stations for the Hydrologic Measurement Program (estimated cost $6.8 million)
are scattered over a widie area they would be of little interest to inter-
national contractors. These works (other than the tertiary systems, where
structures would be done by local contractors and remaining works by paid
local labor under, for example, the INPRES rural works program) would be
carried out through locally advertised contracts following usual Government
procedures which have been reviewed under previous Bank-assisted projects and
are acceptable. Assurances have been obtained from the Government that: (a)
to ensure wide competition and upgrade the capability of the local contracting



- 16 -
industry, the major civil works would be divided into a number of suitable
contracts that would enable large local contractors and joint ventures of
small local firms to bid within the categories or classes for which Government
regulations require them to be prequalified; (b) price escalation clauses,
which are not normally provided in local civil works contracts, would be
included in contracts extending beyond one year; (c) to minimize late con-
struction starts, tenders would be advertised as bid documents are completed
and bids would be processed even before the project implementation budget
(DIP) is signed, although contract award and signing would only be done after
the DIP is approved; and (d) for contracts estimted to cost $1,000,000 and
above, documents would be submitted to the Bank for review before tendering
and award (Schedule 4, Section B.1 and El of the Loan Agreement).
Disbursements
48.       Disbursements of the proposed loan would cover 70% of total costs
for civil works (except construction of tertiary networks); 100% of total
expenditures for consultants, training, directly imported vehicles and
equipment; 95% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment; 65%
for imported equipment procured locally (excluding vehicles); and 40% of
total expenditures for locally procured vehicles. In the case of tertiary
systems, disbursements would be made at 100% of the cost of structures only
provided the withdrawal application is accompanied by a certificate from
the site engineer stating that the entire tertiary network had been completed
(Schedule 1, para. 4(ii) of the Loan Agreement).
Organization and Management
49.       The DGWRD, with primary responsibility for the construction and
rehabilitation of irrigation works in Indonesia, is organized along functional
lines, with six Directorates handling a wide range of operational and support
activities. Given that changes (including terms and conditions of employment)
in the basic structure of any Government agency requires Presidential approval -
a very time-consuming exercise - a number of executive bodies (such as PROSIDA)
have been established within the DGWRD to cope with specific tasks which,
given the increasing size of the irrigation program, could not be accommodated
in the activities of the existing Directorates. Since it is within the power
of the Minister of Public Works not only to establish executive bodies but
also to set terms and conditions of employment within such bodies at levels
above those obtaining in the line agencies, the DGWRD has been able to
recruit and retain the necessary skilled staff to work in these executive
bodies.
50.       Four separate organizations will be responsible for management of
the project: two existing agencies and two new executive bodies. Since the
Cipamingkis subproject falls within the Jatiluhur Region, it would be imple-
mented by the semi-autonomous Jatiluhur Authority which is presently executing
two Bank Group-assisted projects (Credits 195 and 514-IND) and part of
another (Loan 1268-IND). The Authority is well managed and, based on its
performance in implementing ongoing projects, should have no difficulty
executing the works at Cipamingkis.



- 17 -
51.       The Jragung component would be executed by PROSIDA, which has prime
responsibility for six ongoing Bank Group-assisted irrigation projects.
During its nine years of excistence, PROSIDA has gained the reputation of being
one of the most efficient construction agencies in Indonesia and would be able
to carry out the Jragung Dam subproject in addition to its cLaer responsibil-
ities.
52.       A new executive body, Proyek Hidrologi, is in the process of being
established to implement the Hydrologic Measurement Program. While organiza-
tionally distinct from the existing Directorate of Hydraulic Engineering
(DPMA), Proyek Hidrologi would share its management, facilities and most of
its staff with DPMA. For example, the Director of DPMA would become jointly
the General Project Manager of Proyek Hidrologi. Execution of the Cimanuk
River Management Program would also be entrusted to a new executive body.
Proyek Cimanuk is being esi:ablished using the same management and largely the
same staff as the line agency, the Directorate of Rivers, which has been
handling the planning and design of flood control works in the Cimanuk basin
up to now. Assurances have been obtained that the Government would consult
the Bank before making any new appointment to the position of President
Director of the Jatiluhur Authority, General Manager of PROSIDA, General
Project Manager of Proyek Hiidrologi, or Project Manager of Proyek Cimanuk, and
would ensure that the above organizations would be adequately staffed at all
times with competent and qualified personnel (Sections 3.07 and 3.08 of the
Loan Agreement).
53.       The DGWRD recognizes that the establishment of new existing executive
bodies is not an optimal organizational arrangements. Discussions are con-
tinuing within the Government and with the Bank on an organizational structure
which would, amongst other things, provide for greater integration of
activities under Bank Group-assisted projects with those of the DGWRD as a
whole.
Technical Assistance
54.       In view of the heavy commitments of the four executing organizations
and the still fairly limit,ed number of well-trained and experienced staff
that each has, assistance from consultants or advisors would be required for
each component, and their contracts would emphasize training of counterpart
staff, especially in technical areas but also managerial functions such as
budgeting, procurement and contract administration. For the Cipamingkis
subproject, consulting finns would be engaged to complete detailed designs,
prepare construction drawings and tender documents and to supervise construc-
tion. For Jragung, consulltants would supervise construction. For the
Hydrologic Measurement Program, advisors in hydrometeorology, hydrology,
sedimentation measurements and automatic data processing would be engaged. It
is likely that these experts would be provided by a consulting firm. For the
Cimanuk River Water Management Program, consultants would assist in the
preparation of a master plan and flood control plans and designs, and a



- 18 -
two-year advisor in river training and management would also be engaged. In
all, about 590 man-months of international consultants and 315 man-months of
local consultants are expected to be needed.
Panel of Consultants
55.       In order to ensure that the Jragung Dam incorporates the best avail-
able design and construction techniques, so as to maximize its design quality
and safety, a Panel of Consultants would be established to review the planning
and design (and, later, construction) of the Jragung Dam (Section 4.07 of the
Loan Agreement). The Panel would meet about twice a year.
Monitoring of Benefits
56.       The monitoring system set up under the Sixth Irrigation Project
(Loan 1100-IND) would be extended to cover the Cipamingkis subproject area
(Section 4.08 of the Loan Agreement).
Agricultural Supporting Services
57.       The major agricultural supporting services (research, credit,
seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, storage and processing) all require streng-
thening in various degrees to maximize benefits from the project. As many of
the constraints extend across the agricultural sector, they can only be
solved on a sector-wide basis rather than in the context of individual
projects. Significant efforts are already being made to improve the quality
of the major supporting services, several of them with Bank financial
assistance. The National Food Crops Extension Project (Loan 1267-IND) is
introducing the "training and visit" system in both West and Central Java.
The National Research and Extension Project (Loan 1179-IND) is conducting
production-oriented research on paddy and other crops. The Bank is also
assisting seed production and fertilizer production and distribution on a
national scale. The village cooperatives are a focal point for the supply of
inputs, credit and marketing. Credit is mainly obtained from Bank Rakyat
Indonesia under the BIMAS program. For irrigated rice production, a farmer
can obtain up to $90/ha equivalent in inputs and cash. To be eligible for
such a loan, he must be able to demonstrate a reliable cropping history and a
satisfactory repayment record. Shortages of trained staff are the main
constraints on the expansion of the BIMAS program. Under the project, the
Government would ensure that adequate supplies of credit, inputs and drying
and storage facilities are made available in the Cipamingkis subproject area
(Section 3.06 of the Loan Agreement). The extension service, in cooperation
with the provincial agencies and the Ministry of Home Affairs, would form
farmer groups (water-users' associations) for extension, production planning,
water management, and construction, operation and maintenance of tertiary
units in the Cipamingkis subproject area.
Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
58.       The Cipamingkis subproject would be operated and maintained by the
Jatiluhur Authority both during construction and afterwards, except that



- 19 -
responsibility for O&M of the tertiary systems would revert to the water
users' associations one year after the completion of construction. The
water users' associations would collect from their members contributions
sufficient to cover the cost of O&M of such tertiary networks (Section 4.05
of the Loan Agreement). While there have been considerable improvements in
O&M services in the completed and ongoing Bank-assisted irrigation projects
in Indonesia, there is still a need for more trained staff, as well as an
increase in O&M budgetary allocations for the main and secondary systems.
For FY78/79, GOI increased the O&M allocation for rehabilitated systems from
Rp 3,200 to Rp 3,500/ha, and is considering the employment of additional O&M
staff. An assurance has been obtained that adequate funds would be allocated
to all Bank-assisted irrigation systems, at least half of which would be
available in the dry season, and sufficient O&M staff would be provided in
consultation with the Bank (Section 4.03 of the Loan Agreement).
59.       The works to be constructed at Jragung would be maintained by
PROSIDA until they are incorporated in the dam itself. The Directorate of
Hydraulic Engineering would operate and maintain the gauging stations to be
established under the Hydrologic Measurement Program and an assurance has
been obtained that adequate funds would be allocated (Section 4.03 of the
Loan Agreement).
Agricultural Production
60.       For the Cipamingkis subproject area, the provision of fully-
controlled irrigation would permit both the wet and dry-season cropping
intensities to rise significantly (from an annual intensity of 139% to
166%). In addition, the availability of water in the necessary quantities
at the right time, together with the proposed strengthening of supporting
services (especially extension) would lead to significant increases in
yields. For example, paddy yields, which now range from 1.7 to 2.6 ton/ha,
would rise to about 4.2 ton/ha at full project development. For the Jragung
subproject, construction of the dam (in addition to the preliminary works now
being financed) would increase the cropping intensity from 143% to 179%. It
would enable farmers to grow irrigated paddy during the dry season (average
yield 4.3 ton/ha) instead of lower value secondary crops, and give flood
protection to a rainfed area, raising paddy yields from 1.4 to 1.9 ton/ha.
Aggregate rice production from the two subprojects would increase from 37,400
to 72,000 ton/year. The increment would result in gross foreign exchange
savings of $11 million per year. No marketing problems are foreseen as the
project provinces are rice deficit areas.
Cost Recovery
61.       Irrigators in Indonesia pay a land tax (IPEDA) assessed as a
percentage of the value of production and, depending on the intensity of
on-farm irrigation development, water charges for O&M of the system below
the secondary turnout. As the result of a Government decision to allocate
some of the funds under its local infrastructure development program (INPRES)



- 20 -
on the basis of IPEDA collection performance, there has been a marked improve-
ment in collection rates in all irrigated areas in Indonesia. The current
average annual IPEDA rates are Rn 7.000/ha At CiDamingkis and Rp 10,000/ha at
Jragung. At full project development, these races (in 19J8 prices) are
expected to increase to Rp 13,000/ha at Cipamingkis and Rp 14,000/ha at
Jragung.  Based on these incremental rates, andc :or the Jragung subproject a
retail electricity tariff of Rp 34.9/kWh and a retail municipal water tariff
of Rp 49/cu.m, the cost recovery indices are 7% for Cipamingkis and 53% for
Jragung. Even though the cost recovery for Cipamingkis is low, the proposed
project charges are considered satisfactory since, even at full project
development, the per capita farm income of most farm families in the project
areas would still be low in comparison with the national average. Assurances
have been obtained that the Government would recover, through IPEDA, the cost
of O&M and a reasonable proportion of the capital costs of the Cipamingkis
component, and that IPEDA rates would be reviewed every two years (Section
4.04 of the Loan Agreement).
Benefits and Justification
62.       By providing improved water control, distribution and drainage, the
proposed project (together with the completion of the Jragung Dam) would
increase crop yields and production on 7,600 ha at Cipamingkis and 10,500 ha
at Jragung. The project would directly benefit some 36,200 farm families
(about 200,000 people) and, by providing additional employment opportunities,
indirectly benefit some 11,400 families of landless laborers. By increasing
crop production and the dry-season cropped area, the project would create a
demand for an additional 1.5 million man-days of farm labor per year, equi-
valent to some 6,300 full-time jobs. At Jragung, hydropower facilities
provided by the proposed dam would generate about 30 GWh per year for the
Central Java power grid. The Jragung reservoir would also supply some
63 M cu. m of municipal and industrial water for the city of Semarang.  The
reservoir would also reduce the river's silt load by some 540,000 cu m
annually, thus reducing O&M costs in the irrigation area served by the
Jragung main canal and the dredging of floodways at the river's mouth.
The project would also support the Government's policy of reducing food-
grain imports.
63.       The internal economic rates of return on the subprojects have been
estimated as follows:
Cipamingkis            13%
Jragung                12%
Weighted average       12%
In calculating these economic rates of return the following assumptions were
used: a 30-year evaluation period; efficiency prices based on forecasts of
world market prices for the major traded inputs and and outputs; a standard
conversion factor of 0.8; a seasonably variable shadow wage rate for unskilled
labor; and current municipal water and electricity tariffs, adjusted for all
required treatment and/or distribution costs.



- 21 -
64.       The majority of beneficiaries of the project would be small farmers
and sharecroppers. At full project development (Cipamingkis, 1987; Jragung,
1988) present per capita farm incomes would have increased by 50% to 105%
(from around $35 to $85 at present to $55 to $175). An estimated
90% to 95% of the project area's farm families presently have per capita
incomes at or below the estimated absolute poverty level of $95 (1975 prices).
At full agricultural development, the incomes of some 30% to 35% of these
farmers would move above the absolute poverty level.
Risks
65.       No major management or organizational problems are expected in the
implementation of the project. Rapid inflation over the past several years
led to sizeable cost overruns on projects initiated in the early 1970s.
Inflation is now more nearly under control, and provisions for price increases
are greater for this project (and other projects recently financed by the
Bank) than in earlier years. Risks are, therefore, considered normal for
projects of this kind.
Environmental Effects
66.       The effects of thie project on the physical environment would be
small, as the project areas have been under rainfed or irrigated cultivation
for many years. Schistosomiasis is not present in these parts of Indonesia.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
67.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the
Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii), of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
68.        Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
69.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
70.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
AGRICULTURE
Irrigation
Credit No. 195   Second Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Initial progress was delayed by difficulties in equipment procure-
ment and civil works execution, and later, by rising construction costs. The
project is expected to be completed by March 1979. The credit is about 98%
disbursed. The rehabilitated and new facilities are technically sound and
hydraulically adequate. The quality of maintenance of completed works is
improving with the availability of operation and maintenance funds substan-
tially higher than previous levels. The estimated project cost has more than
doubled since appraisal due to high inflation rates and increases in contract
quantities, but the estimated economic rate of return remains satisfactory
because rice prices and yields have been higher than those projected during
appraisal.
Credit No. 220   Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Overall project completion is expected by about September 1978,
about 3 years years behind schedule. The problems which caused this delay -
difficulties in preparation of contract documents, late financial allocations,
heavy rains in the 1973 construction season and, more recently, high inflation
rates and consequent civil works cost overruns - have been overcome, but
time lost cannot be regained. The project is now essentially completed with
97% of the Credit disbursed. The quality of maintenance of completed works
is improving with the availability of operation and maintenance funds substan-
tially higher than previous levels. The estimated project cost is about twice
the appraisal estimate, but rice prices and yields substantially higher than
those projected at appraisal enable the project to achieve an estimated
economic rate of return of over 20%.

Credit No. 289 Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978.
The construction program has escalated in cost by 190% over the
appraisal estimate due to an increase in the magnitude of the works and price
escalation due to unexpected inflation. About 70% of the works are finished
and completion of the project is expected by March 1979. The Credit is
about 92% disbursed.  Feasibility studies included in the project have been
concluded and groundwater investigations are nearing completion.
Credit No. 514 Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension: US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Initial organizational difficulties and a delay in awarding the
first construction contract have caused a delay of about 2 years in the
project schedule. The first construction activity started in February 1977
and good progress has been achieved.   Based on bid prices for the first
contract and revised quantity estimates on the basis of detailed design, the
total project cost is now estimated to be about 140% over the appraisal
estimate.
Loan No. 1100   Sixth Irrigation:  US$65 Million Loan of April 10,
1975; Effective Date: June 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Most of the project programs have advanced well during the past
year. Design of works for the Cirebon and Rentang subproject systems is
beyond the capability of PROSIDA to execute, and assistance has been provided
under Loan 1434-IND to expedite this work through the use of local consultants.
Critical review of the program for benefit monitoring is under way.
Loan No. 1268   Seventh Irrigation Project:  US$33 Million Loan of June 4,
1976; Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The implementing agencies have completed the engagement of the
consultants. The project is slightly behind schedule in the North Sadang and
tertiary development areas. The mapping program is progressing satisfactorily.
Disbursements are well ahead of schedule.
Loan No. 1434   Eighth Irrigation Project:  US$63.0 Million Loan of June 6,
1977; Effective Date: July 7, 1977; Closing Date: March 31,
1983.
The project is progressing satisfactorily and is on schedule.

Loan No. 1435   Ninth Irrigation Project:  US$35.0 Million Loan of June 6,
1977; Effective Date: July 7, 1977, Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project is on schedule and progressing satisfactorily.
Other Agriculture Production
Credit No. 259 Tea: US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective Date:
September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Nearly all the targets set at appraisal have been achieved one year
before project completion, but factory capacity still has to be increased
to take account of the increased production which exceeds appraisal estimates
by about 5,000 tons or 25%. Inflation and additional construction and
equipment costs are expected to increase project costs by about 17% above
appraisal estimate.
Credit No. 319 Fourth Agricultural Estates: US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Progress of the project continues to be good with planting of
rubber and oil palm ahead of appraisal estimates and in excellent condition.
The project has been expanded to 15,000 ha (originally 11,400 ha). The
remaining area to be planted is about 3,500 ha of which 2,300 ha have been
cleared and are ready for planting. Technical problems exist in processing
and equipment maintenance but construction of the oil palm mill will be
accelerated and additional capacity for crumb rubber production will also be
provided. Profitability and cost of development at PNP X are satisfactory,
while the capital structure of PNP X is to be improved during the course of
the Nucleus Estates and Smallholders I Project (Loan 1499-IND). PNP X is
participating in both the NES I project and the Transmigration and Rural
Development Project (Loan 1318-IND).
Credit No. 355 Beef Cattle Development: US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project implementation.
Government's budget allocation has been insufficient, and financial manage-
ment and coordination have been weak. Major changes in project scope and
objectives (approved by the Executive Directors in June 1977) reflected a
change in the project frcom one of breeding and fattening of beef cattle for
export to that of production of improved cattle for domestic sale as draft and
breeding animals. The project was reviewed in November 1977 and the mission
found the state of ranch development and management satisfactory.

Credit No. 358   North Sumatra Smallholder Development:  US$5 Million Credit
of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Progress of this project continues to be satisfactory, and the full
program of planting 9,000 ha of rubber and oil palm by smallholders was
completed by the end of 1977. By 1981, when the project is completed, these
plantings will have been brought to maturity. Government has decided not to
expand the project in its present location because of the extensive support
already given to North Sumatra Province through this and other Bank-supported
projects; instead, Government is seeking the Bank's assistance for small-
holder development projects in other Provinces, including Aceh, Jambi, Riau,
S. Sumatra, W. Kalimantan and S. Kalimantan.
Credit No. 400   Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:  US$7.8 Million Credit
of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Disbursements are slower than anticipated and are about a third of
appraisal estimates. This is due to fewer than anticipated credit applica-
tions mainly because smallholder tea price has been higher than anticipated
at appraisal, which reduced the need for subloans. Also private estates have
been slow in joining the project because of their difficult financial posi-
tion, which made them ineligible for subloans and because of difficulties
in establishing land ownership titles. The Project Management Unit (PMU) is
now considering two alternatives: completion of planting by 1980/81 extending
the project period by two years to achieve 80% of appraisal estimates; or,
achievement of 53% of appraisal estimates by 1978/79. The project spin-off
and training have been excellent; about 2,300 ha of tea were replanted or
rehabilitated using funds outside the credit program but still under the
influence of the PMU. Over 3,000 farmers have been trained in training
centers and village level courses. A marketing study indicates that tea
consumption in Indonesia increases by 5% yearly and all of the tea produced
by the project will be consumed domestically.
Credit No. 405   Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:  US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project is on schedule and about 75% completed. The Joint
Sugar Projects Unit is efficiently supervising the procurement and installa-
tion of machinery and equipment. The two PTPs which are involved in the
rehabilitation process are both in a weak financial position and this
problem requires attention. Consultant services are gradually being phased
out as planned except for the sugar research station which still requires a
major input.

Credit No. 480 Fisheries Credit: US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
After some initial delays, the project has generally been progres-
sing satisfactorily. Construction of shore facilities at Ambon is virtually
completed. Boat construction is under way and all related equipment is on
site ready for installation. While the quality of fishpond lending has
suffered some deficiencies in the past, remedial action taken by Bank Rakyat
Indonesia is gradually irmproving the situation.
Loan No. 1318   Transmigration and Rural Development Project:  US$30 Million
Loan of July 21, 1976; Effective Date: February 28, 1977;
Closing I)ate: December 31, 1981.
Settlement and construction are lagging about a year behind appraisal
estimates partly because of the initial delay in project effectiveness, and
because of weak project organization and management. Nonetheless, 650 migrant
families have been settled at Baturaja and are successfully growing food
crops. Initial incomes are satisfactory in spite of inadequate fertiliser
supplies and poor seed supply, although half originates from construction and
rubber planting. In the existing settled area at Way Abung, there has been
little improvement in incomes because fertilisers are not available on site
and delayed road construction limits marketing of cash crops. Experience to
date highlights the need for improving project management and ensuring that
agricultural support services and input supply systems are in place as settle-
ment proceeds.
Loan No. 1499   Nucleus Estates and Smallholder I Project:  US$65.0 Million
Loan of November 18, 1977; Effective Date: January 12, 1978;
Closing ])ate: June 30, 1982.
Initial progress under this project is satisfactory.
Agriculture Support Services
Credit No. 246  Seeds:   US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971; Effective
Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
At Sukamandi 1,600 ha have been developed and it is planned to
develop an additional area of 400 ha in 1978. Significant results as of
1976/77 season, expressed as percentages of appraisal estimates are:
(a) area under production - 2,020 ha (54%), (b) yields of rice seed -
2.9 tons/ha (72%), and (c) production of certified seed - 4,900 tons (42%).
Due to cost escalations and implementation difficulties, only one seed
multiplication district, Klaten, out of the three planned at appraisal, has
been developed. Total area developed so far is 250 ha of a total estimate of
500 ha. National Seeds Corporation's cost of production continues to be high
and it is not commercialLy viable even with increases in production. The
Corporation will need continued financial support from the Government.

Loan No. 1179 Agricultural Research and Extension: US$21.5 Million Loan
of December 19, 1975; Effective Date: February 23, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project having suffered initial delays is about one year behind
the appraisal report schedule, but is now progressing satisfactorily.
Architects for civil works construction have now completed schematic drawings,
a contract for provision of technical assistance for research is under active
implementation and an agreement with FAO for technical assistance in extension
of agricultural information was signed in October 1977.
Loan No. 1267 National Food Crops Extension Project; US$22 Million Loan
of June 4, 1976; Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982.
The construction and procurement programs, after a somewhat slow
start, are now on schedule. Staff appointments are on schedule with the
exception of some supervisory staff and subject matter specialists outside
Java. The new extension methodology has been adopted in all project provinces
and is being gradually applied. A second-phase project, covering the remaining
provinces in Indonesia, is being prepared.
AGRO-BUSINESS AND CREDIT
Credit No. 785 Small Enterprise Development Project: US$40.0 Million Credit
of April 7, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
This credit is expected to become effective in July 1978.
EDUCATION
Credit No. 387   Third Education:  US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date:  August 29, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project finances the production and distribution of 138 million
primary school textbooks, and related in-service training for 350,000 primary
school teachers. Printing of 81 million textbooks has been completed,
generally about nine months behind schedule. Similar delays are expected in
the printing of 31 million books for 1977/78, due in part to delays in paper
procurement. Teaching equipment has been procured and delivered. Teacher
training is on schedule and 3,800 tutors and administrators and 370,000
teachers have participated in training seminars. Due to delays in book
production, it has proved difficult to keep the training program in phase
with book deliveries. Project management has been strengthened by addition

of specialists under a technical assistance contract signed with UNESCO. The
Government is presently seeking additional technical assistance in publishing
and paper procurement. Disbursement has improved and is now 91% of the
appraisal estimate as against 69% a year ago. The Government is planning a
major review of the project to focus on its relation to other ongoing Govern-
ment textbook projects and to overall future needs for production of instruc-
tional materials.
Loan No. 1237 Fourth Education Project: US$37 Million Loan of April 15,
1976; Effective Date: June 17, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project suffered initially a ten-month delay due to late
signing of the Funds-in-Trust agreements with the UN agencies providing
technical assistance and slow site selection. However, no further delays
have occurred and good progress is now being made in implementation. Cumber-
some implementation procedures in the Department of Manpower are still a
potential source of delay for that Department's subproject and should be kept
under review. Architectural designs for all three subprojects have been
prepared by consultants and approved by the Bank. Most sites have been
acquired and surveyed. Construction firms have been prequalified. Tenders
for construction of 14 tco 24 project institutions will be called in the next
six months. Equipment lists are in advanced stages of preparation. Eleven
additional technical assistance specialists assumed their posts over the last
six months and the technical assistance program is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1433 Teacher Training Project: US$19.0 Million Loan of June 6, 1977;
Effective Date: July 7, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Overall project implementation is satisfactory. The overseas
fellowship program to train 40 Indonesian educators in ways to improve teacher
training has started. The technical assistance contract has been signed. The
design of physical facilities has fallen behind schedule because of delays in
appointing consultant architects. First phase civil works was, however,
tendered in March, permitting commencement of construction by July 1978.
Loan No. 1486 Non-Formal Education Project: US$15.0 Million Loan of
September 14, 1977; Effective Date: November 4, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Initial implementation progress is satisfactory.   All positions
in the project unit are filled and appointment of key staff at provincial
centers has been completed. A technical assistance firm has been selected by
the project unit and contract negotiations began in late March 1978. Rehabili-
tation of one of two existing provincial centers is underway. Three of four
sites for new provincial centers have been acquired. Construction of four new
provincial centers is expected to begin in July 1978. Initial staff training,
learning materials development and evaluation activities are being carried
out.

ENERGY
Credit No. 334   Second Electricity Distribution:  US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits 165-IND
and 334-IND (together $55 million) encountered setbacks in implementation
due to delays in the preparation of designs for the system expansion because
of constantly changing city development plans during the early period of
implementation, procurement problems and cumbersome management procedures.
As a result the project is two years behind the original schedule. These
difficulties have been resolved and recent progress is encouraging. The
Closing Date has been postponed from December 31, 1977 to June 30, 1978
to allow additional time for the delivery of some recently ordered goods.
Completion of voltage changeover and connection of consumers will require
another 12 months after Closing Date.
Credit No. 399 West Java Thermal Power: US$46 Million Credit of June 22,
1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 MW units at Muara Karang (Part
A of the Project) were about 65% higher than estimated at the time of
appraisal. This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in
an increase in the total project cost of more than 100%. Government will
provide the additional funds required. The additional financing requirements
led to a delay in the award of the general construction contract and, as a
result, the project is about two years behind schedule. PLN has satisfactorily
met the targets in its financial recovery plan (Part B) provided for
under the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Java System Study (Part C) has
been completed. The Citarum Hydroelectric Feasibility Study (Part D) had to
be extended by another working season to complete additional field work. It
is likely that the Closing Date of the Credit will need to be postponed by
about 12 months.
Loan No. 1127   Fourth Power:  US$41 Million Loan of June 17, 1975; Effective
Date: October 23, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Part A of the project provides for the expansion of the Muara
Karang thermal power station at Jakarta by addition of a third 100 MW
generating unit. The general construction contracts covering this unit as
well as the first two financed under Credit 399-IND have been awarded although
after some delay because of the problems of cost-overruns for the first two
units. The Financial Recovery Plan (Part B) and feasibility study for a new
thermal plant in West Java (Part C 1) have been completed. The Training
Program (Part D) is proceeding satisfactorily. Implementation of the project
is now satisfactory but final completion will be about 18 months behind the
original schedule.

Loan No. 1259 Fifth Power Project: US$90 Million Loan of May 20, 1976;
Effective Date: September 20, 1976; Closing Date:
March 31, 1981.
The procurement of equipment is under way but disbursement is
substantially behind schedule. Orders have been placed for the first of
three lots of equipment for about $11.0 million; these are now being
received enabling field work to be commenced. Bids are being issued for the
second lot worth about $40.0 million and arrangements for construction
altered to speed up implementation. Nevertheless a delay of about a year is
expected in completion oif the Project, due to the slow start. Part B of the
Project (the financial recovery plan) has been completed.
Loan No. 1365 Sixth Power Project: US$116 Million Loan of February 4, 1977;
Effective Date: June 6, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Orders have been placed for main generating plant and equipment.
Loan No. 1513 Seventh Power Project: US$109.0 Million Loan of
February 3, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
This loan is expected to become effective in July 1978.

Loan No. 1089 Second Fertilizer Expansion: US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1978.
The project (PUSRI III) was mechanically completed in December
1976, one month ahead of schedule. Some operational difficulties are yet to
be resolved. The gas system has been completed and total project cost
is expected to be within the appraisal estimate.
Loan No. 1254  Third Fertilizer Expansion Project:  US$70 Million Loan of
May 20, 1976; Effective Date: August 15, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The project (PUSRI IV), which is designed to have an annual cap-
acity of 570,000 tons of urea, was commissioned in mid-October 1977,
about three months ahead of schedule. Total Droject cost is expected to
be below the appraisal estimate.

Industrial Estates
Credit No. 428 Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate: US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The estate is progressing satisfactorily. Of 430 ha of raw land
earmarked for acquisition, 290 ha has been acquired and acquisition of another
31 ha is under negotiation. 104 ha of the 129 ha of developed land have been
sold to 83 firms. Factory employment at full capacity will be around 17,000
and an estimated 1,400 are employed on the average in both factory construction
and land development. Overall, operations are profitable. The return on
capital investment, which is now projected to be 20.6%, is significantly
higher than the appraisal forecast of 13.4%. This is due to the fact that
developed land values are rising faster than the cost of raw land and development.
Development Finance Companies
Loan No. 1054   Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO II):  US$50 Million
Loan of November 20, 1974; Effective Date: January 14,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Despite significant institutional improvements achieved by BAPINDO,
the company has still a high level of arrears; its appraisal work is slow and
administrative costs are excessive. These problems are being addressed
through a Program of Action discussed and agreed among the Government,
BAPINDO and the Bank. The loan is expected to be fully committed in the next
few months.
Loan No. 1437   BAPINDO III Project:  US$40.0 Million Loan of June 6, 1977;
Effective Date: September 23, 1977; Closing Date:
September 30, 1981.
This project is progressing satisfactorly.
Credit No. 436 Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI):
US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973; Effective Date:
March 6, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Despite a long start-up period and difficulties in recruiting
qualified staff, the project has progressed satisfactorily. The Credit is
fully committed.

June 30, 1981.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily.
POPULATION AND NUTRITION
Credit No. 300 Population: US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979.
The National Family Planning Program, of which the project is
an integral part, is exparLding in terms of the numbers of new acceptors
recruited annually and nowl covers about 18% of all married women in the
reproductive age group. Implementation of the civil works component is
on schedule.
Loan No. 1472   Second Population Project:  US$24.5 Million Loan of July 6,
1977; Effective Date: August 4, 1977; Closing Date:
April 30, 1983.
Although the NFPCB, the agency responsible for project implemen-
tation, had done considerable preparatory work, the promise of rapid progress
shown prior to loan effectiveness has not yet materialized. Tendering for
civil works and the procurement of vehicles and equipment are about five
months behind schedule, due in part to the preoccupation of the NFPCB with a
proposed internal reorganization, and the recent promotion of the Chairman of
the NFPCB to the post of Minister of Health in the new Cabinet.
Loan No. 1373   Nutrition Development Project:  US$13.0 Million Loan of
March 14, 1977; Effective Date: March 31, 1977; Closing
Date: March 31, 1982.
Initial progress under this project is satisfactory.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Credit No. 451 Fourth Technical Assistance: US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing D)ate: December 31, 1979.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.

Loan No. 1197   National Resource Survey and Mapping Project:  US$13.0 Mil-
lion Loan of February 5, 1976; Effective Date: April 2,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is essentially on schedule. Construction of
BAKOSURTANAL headquarters and facilities, including cartographic, printing,
photographic interpretation, and data processing wings, is about 50% com-
plete. Contracts covering about 40% of the equipment to be procured under
the project have been awarded. The first new topographic map sheets of
Sumatra have been completed, and an orderly schedule for several hundred
additional sheets are in various stages of compilation and production.
Training programs and the work of expert advisors engaged under the project
are progressing well. Final loan documents for a parallel CIDA-financed
project are awaiting Government's signature.
TRANSPORTATION
Loan No. 1139   Fertilizer Distribution:  US$68 Million Loan of
July 10, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
All the contracts for the original project have been let and most
materials and three ships have been delivered to Indonesia. Savings of about
$12.5 million from the loan were realized in the original project. Procurement
of an additional ship and bulk reception facilities to serve expansion of
fertilizer output beyond that anticipated at appraisal were approved by the
Executive Directors on April 5, 1977. The expanded project is under way, the
fourth ship has been delivered, and other components are likely to be com-
pleted successfully.
Credit No. 260 Second Highway: US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31,1978.
Quality of work is satisfactory and cost overruns have been rela-
tively small (despite sharp price increases) due to efforts to reduce
construction quantities, and to cost savings for consulting services.
Construction work is completed; but work is still proceeding on detailed
engineering of the Padang-Medan Road, the initiation of which was delayed to
reconsider road design standards in relation to those recently developed for
the highway betterment program and to take into account the Bank's recommen-
dations regarding standards for urban portions of the road.
Credit No. 388 Third Highway: US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections in the
project was started early in 1974 under two contracts. Contractors have been
delayed mainly because of long mobilization periods and unusually adverse



ANNEX II
Page 17 of 19 pages
climatic conditions. Construction costs will likely exceed original estimates
by more than 100%, m ainly caused by in creased quantities combined with
sharply escalated prices. The project also included feasibility and detailed
design studies of highway betterment works. Most of the studies are now
completed and formed the basis of the Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1236-IND).
However, work c- a few studies will continue for another 3-4 months and will
then form the basis for lending by ADB or bilateral agencies. The training
Program component was satisfactorily prepared and is being implemented by the
Government.
Loan No. 1236   Fourth Highway Project:  US$130 Million Loan of April 15, 1976;
Effective Date: August 13, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1980.
Nearly all key activities in the initial implementation schedule
agreed with the Government have been completed, although with delays ranging
from nine months to about one year. Construction contracts for almost 900 km
of roads have been awarded, and tender evaluation has been completed for the
remaining about 380 km. Some problems in the execution of the road works
have been revealed on corntracts started in 1976 but it is still too early to
assess the future impact of these difficulties on the overall construction
progress and project completion.
Credit No. 318 Inter-IsLand Fleet Rehabilitation: US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1979.
At the request of the Government the Closing Date has been post-
poned to March 31, 1979 in order to provide additional time for several
new projects of ship rehabilitation and the technical assistance to be
develooed. Due to sharply increased costs and lack of creditworthy appli-
cants,iust over half the tonnage of shipping expected at appraisal will
have been rehabilitated.
Loan No. 1250   Second Shipping Project:  US$54 Million Loan of May 20, 1976;
Effective Date: October 8, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Delay in the appointments of a number of consultants, most of
which have now been made, has caused a slow start to the project and has
slowed project implementation and disbursements. The financial position of
the state shipping company (PELNI) is unsatisfactory, and further deterioration
could cause financial problems for the project entity (PANN). The Government
is considering steps to deal with this problem and with the acquisition of
high-cost new ships. Solutions likely to be proposed may require amendment
to the project description. It is expected that such a proposal will be
discussed with the Bank in June 1978.

1976; Effective Date: March 3, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979.
Tanjung Priok Port traffic during 1977 slightly exceeded appraisal
forecasts for total dry cargo, about 2.8 million tons were handled in the
first half of 1977. The first construction contract for Basin III civil works
and the second for Regional Harbor improvements have been let; container
handling and other equipment is being procured. There continue to be problems
in completing government financed works in Basin III but these works are
expected to be completed by December 1978.
Loan No. 1005   Railway:  US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement is now well under way and almost all contracts have
been signed or are about to be signed. Project execution is behind schedule
due to initial slow procurement and execution of works. Freight and passenger
traffic declined in 1976, due largely to poor service. However slight
improvements were made in the second half of 1977 after the arrival of new
locomotives and rolling stock, and with operations improved with the aid of
consultants. The financial performance of the railway deteriorated in 1976
and 1977 due mainly to the declining traffic and to an increase in cost
including a large wage raise in early 1977. The overall situation is being
reviewed with the railway administrators and the Government.
TOURISM
Credit No. 479 Bali Tourism: US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
The construction of major infrastructure and related facilities for
the Nusa Dua tourism estate is under way and scheduled for completion by the
end of 1979. The construction of the hotel training school has been completed.
The completion of project components outside the estate (i.e., roads) is
scheduled for December 1980, about two years later than planned at project
appraisal. Visitor traffic to Bali has been growing; it rose by 31% in 1976
and by a further 8% in 1977 to 286,000 visitors. Despite considerable efforts
made by BTDC and the Bank Group in promoting hotel investment at Nusa Dua, no
hotel investors have yet come forward. It is therefore highly unlikely that a
first hotel at Nusa Dua could be completed by the end of 1979 to coincide with
completion of the infrastructure.

Loan No. 1040 Jakarta Urban Development: US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The kampung improvement part of the project is substantially
complete. Some 2,080 ha 'have been upgraded as compared with the original
plan of 1,980 ha. The sites and services component is about 60% complete.
Problems which have arisen with regard to the standard of materials and the
procedures to be utilized in allocating the plots have been resolved. About
2,900 core housing units are presently being allocated, and the remaining
4,300 are expected to be available by September 1978.
Loan No. 1336 Second Urban Development Project: US$52.5 Million Loan of
November 4, 1976; Effective Date: March 28, 1977; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980.
The progress of civil works is ahead of schedule, and costs are
generally within the estimates. Although land acquisition is causing some
delays, efforts are being made to speed up procedures. Progress is being
made in developing Govern,ment capabilities in undertaking a nationwide
kampung improvement program in the future.
WATER SUPPLY
Loan No. 1049 Five Cities Water Supply: US$14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the project is now
running 24 months behind schedule. This delay together with higher rates
of inflation than anticilpated is expected to increase project costs about 15%
above the appraisal estimate. We are still waiting for the Government to
issue an interministerial decree defining relationships between the various
Ministries and the water enterprises, which was to have been signed by the end
of 1974.
