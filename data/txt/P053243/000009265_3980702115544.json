to protect rainforest reserves and\n            nearby indigenous territories. The project includes three\n            components: (i) a Project Management Unit (PMG) will be\n            set-up in the Interamerican Institute for Agricultural\n            Cooperation (IICA), which will be responsible for overall\n            project coordination, monitoring, and administration; (ii)\n            Peasant Enterprise Zone Development, which will include\n            participatory planing and implementation of land titling\n            efforts, agricultural production activities, and\n            environmental protection initiatives, and local capacity\n            building for community and economic development; and (iii)\n            an Evaluation and Strategic Design of Follow-on Action,\n            which would enable Government of Colombia to apply the\n            concept of peasant enterprise zones on a wider scale based\n            on sound economic, social, and environmental criteria."}, "docdt": "1998-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
