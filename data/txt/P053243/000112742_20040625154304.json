despite worsening\n            security conditions in parts of the Project area and\n            unexpected difficulties due to internal and external\n            factors.  Lessons were learned in the areas of: commitment\n            to community empowerment and local self-management;  working\n            in conflict zones; and programs that cross sectoral\n            boundaries and require inter-sectoral coordination. Key\n            lessons included: substantial time is required to develop\n            the model of intervention; there is value in investing in\n            participatory processes; conflict zones limit the presence\n            of government institutions; and inter-sectoral coordination\n            cannot be taken for granted"}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
