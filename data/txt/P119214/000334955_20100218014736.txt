                              Timely availability of fiscal accounts for the execution of the 2011
                                 budget; accounts published no later than 60 days after the end of the
                                 month.

                             II. Reforming the financial sector:
                               Settlement of at least 40 percent of non-performing loans (NPLs) held
                                   by Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank as of June 2007, as well as
                                   improvement in the provisioning levels.
                              Rafidain and Rasheed banks diversify their activities beyond deposit
                                  taking and payment transactions, and play a more active role in
                                  financial intermediation.
                              Improvement in the functioning of the two state-owned commercial
                                  banks, evident in the increase in loan­to-GDP ratios from 4% in June
                                  2006 to 6% in October 2010.
                              The banking system is largely adhering to the Basel Core Principles for
                                  Effective Banking Supervision.
                              Reduction in processing time of government checks and collections
                                  from 25 days to 10 days.

                             III. Improving the efficiency of the social protection system:
                               Rationalization of the Public Distribution System (PDS) has been
                                  initiated through elimination of high income civil servants from PDS
                                  eligibility, as well as other high income groups as determined by the
                                  Government.
                               A public information campaign has been launched to announce PDS

                                                      ii
                             targeting objectives and explain the process and timeline for this
                             transition
                             Piloting of Social safety net with new and improved targeting
                               mechanism under way.
                             Key provisions of the new Unified Pension Law are implemented;
                               including the discontinuation of labor force segmentation across public
                               and private sectors.

Program Development         The objective of the proposed DPL is to mitigate the impact of the current
Objective(s) and            fiscal crisis on Iraq's economy and to support its medium-term economic
Contribution to CAS         reform program, thereby helping the country improve fiscal sustainability
                            and reducing its fiscal and socio-economic vulnerability to sudden drops in
                            oil revenues.

                            More specifically, the project supports the following objectives:
                              Helping bridge the financing gap created by lower oil prices;
                              Strengthening budget management and prioritization to enable more
                                 efficient and effective use of Iraq's own resources;
                              Strengthening the financial sector;
                              Helping to cushion the social impact of lower oil revenues by
                                 reforming social safety nets and the pensions system.

                            The common theme of improving Iraq's fiscal sustainability prospects
                            brings these specific goals together. First, strengthening budget
                            management and prioritization is critical to ensure aggregate fiscal
                            discipline and reduce waste and unproductive expenditures. Second,
                            financial sector reform will help reduce the direct budgetary burden of
                            state-owned banks as well as the contingent liability they represent. Third, a
                            social protection system can only be truly efficient if it is fiscally
                            sustainable, which can be achieved through the rationalization of the costly
                            and large Public Distribution System and through pension reform.

                            This DPL is fully consistent with the Interim Strategy Note FY09-11
                            presented to the Board of Executive Directors in March 2009 and will help
                            implement and achieve ISN objectives. The ISN aims to: (i) support
                            ongoing reconstruction and socio-economic recovery; (ii) improve
                            governance and the management of public resources; and (iii) support
                            policies and institutions that promote broad-based, private sector-led
                            growth. The three DPL pillars are linked as follows to the ISN themes:
                            Social safety nets are part of the first theme of the ISN; budget management
                            and prioritization is at the core of the second; and financial sector reform is
                            a key component of the third. In all three areas there are ongoing Bank-
                            supported investment and technical assistance operations being
                            implemented in Iraq as well as past, current or planned AAA work.

Risks and Risk Mitigation   The Program faces significant risks, which include:

                            Political and economic performance risks. The ability of the Bank Group to
                            engage with Iraq would become constrained by a reversal of recent, hard-
                            won security gains. Related to that, a deterioration in the political
                            environment either in Iraq or in the Region would also affect the Bank's
                            ability to implement its assistance program. The DPL could also be
                            affected by risks related to the Government's commitment to an ambitious
                            reform program at this time. In particular, the design of a robust program
                            acceptable to the Iraqi authorities might be challenging in an electoral year

                                                      iii
and during a time where oil prices have started to rise anew. Likewise, a
new Government post elections may not agree to implement the same
program. Given these political uncertainties, the operation has been
designed as a single tranche DPL as part of a programmatic series of two
DPLs. This DPL is underpinned by a reform agenda already adopted by
the current Government. In addition, this reform program is being
implemented with support through ongoing technical assistance programs
by the Bank, IMF and other donors. It has also been designed to be
realistic, yet consist of important reforms and milestones, complementing
existing Government reforms supported by ongoing TA activities, each
with their own risk mitigation measures, and opening the door for the Bank
to engage with the Government in the medium to long term on critical
issues to improve Iraq's fiscal sustainability. The programmatic approach
of this DPL will also help mitigate the risk of relevance and ownership
across Governments.
Oil revenue volatility risks. Iraq has been subject to major fluctuations in
its oil revenues, reflecting its extreme dependence on crude oil exports.
This makes it extremely challenging to conduct fiscal policy with a
medium-term orientation, while maintaining adequate levels of public
spending. To help mitigate this risk, this operation aims to support reforms
that would help reduce Iraq's fiscal and socio-economic vulnerability to
abrupt changes in oil prices and revenues. In addition, the Bank will
conduct analytical work and provide technical assistance on oil revenue
management issues for Iraq, including assessing the feasibility of special
fiscal institutions such as oil funds.

Security risks. As in many conflict-affected countries, a deterioration of the
security situation constitutes a large source of risk for the operation.
Continuing security incidents, for example, the attacks in August 2009 and
December 2009 against several Government ministries are a manifestation
of such risks. The capacity of the Iraqi Government and whether the
international community continues to support security will be determinants
of the extent of risk that persists. However, the financing from this DPL,
and the fact that it is part of a substantial international effort that includes
IMF resources, would provide the external financing needed to fill the
budget gap. This would help the Government maintain its recurrent and
investment spending to keep the system going while still providing
essential services to the population in a fragile and volatile environment,
which may help to mitigate some domestic security risks. Support through
this DPL is the Bank's contribution to a larger package that will help Iraq
continue its physical and institutional reconstruction and thereby reduce
destabilizing factors and foster a more secure environment.
Fiduciary risks. As indicated in the section on fiduciary assessment,
financial controls in Iraq are weak and the operation's fiduciary risk is high.
Weaknesses in Iraq's institutional environment increase the exposure of the
Bank's resources to fiduciary problems. The fiduciary risks in this
operation cannot be mitigated. In the longer term, the Bank is supporting
the Iraqi Government in strengthening its public financial management
system through PFM Reform Project, which will help strengthen the
Government's fiduciary environment for budget support by supporting
improved allocation, execution, transparency and accountability in the
mobilization and use of all public resources. Furthermore, the Bank has
conducted a fiduciary assessment to accompany this operation which has
identified weaknesses and areas for improvement.


                          iv
               Program Risks. The new Government may not request the second DPL if
               the financing needs are reduced. While the new Government may be
               committed to the general principles of the DPL reform program, it may
               adopt a different set of priorities, for example, by placing a greater
               emphasis on some components, thus requiring changes in the triggers for
               the second DPL. To mitigate the risks, the programmatic approach chosen
               for this operation offers greater flexibility than a tranched operation, and
               the indicative second DPL triggers are based on reforms that are already
               underway.
               Technical capacity risks. Lack of technical capability among key
               Government agencies to implement the reform program present another
               source of risk. Companion technical assistance projects in each of the three
               pillars are designed to help build the requisite capacity.

              INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
                             PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
     PROPOSED FIRST PROGRAMMATIC FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                              TO THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ



I.      INTRODUCTION

1. This program document proposes a Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loan (DPL) in the
amount of US$250 million, which would be the first of a programmatic series of two DPLs totaling
US$500 million. The objective of the proposed DPL is to mitigate the impact of the current fiscal crisis
on Iraq's economy and to support its medium-term economic reform program, thereby helping the
country improve fiscal sustainability and reducing its fiscal and socio-economic vulnerability to sudden
drops in oil revenues.

2. Iraq is an oil-dependent economy that is emerging from years of conflict. The complexity of
Iraq's situation cannot be overstated. On the one hand, as the country recovers from conflict, its
reconstruction and rehabilitation needs ­ both from an infrastructure and from an institutional standpoint
­ are immense. Iraq requires an appropriate level of public spending to meet its reconstruction needs,
which ultimately helps maintain security and political stability. On the other hand, Iraq's excessive
dependence on oil revenues makes it highly vulnerable to abrupt changes in international oil prices.
Therefore, Iraq's main source of financing is considerably volatile and its revenue flows are largely
unpredictable.

3. Iraq's vulnerability to external shocks became particularly manifest in 2008-9 when its fiscal
position deteriorated significantly due to the sharp decline in oil prices starting in late 2008. After
holding fiscal surpluses in the order of 8.8 percent of GDP and 1.7 percent of GDP in 2007 and 2008
respectively, Iraq is projected to have an overall fiscal deficit of about 22.6 percent of GDP in 2009. A
considerable financing gap ­ in the order of US$4.9 billion ­ has emerged for the period 2009-2011. This
gap will need to be filled through external financing.

4. Together with the new Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, World Bank budget support will
help sustain an adequate level of public expenditures in Iraq to strengthen the delivery of key
public services and rebuild infrastructure. Building on lessons from the experience of other post-
conflict and fragile states, Iraq's public spending could be impacted by severe fiscal cuts that can
undermine stability and security as insurgent groups could exploit the weaknesses of a State undergoing a
fiscal crisis.

5. Through the financing it brings about, the proposed operation will help relieve immediate
pressures on Iraq's budget. Iraq's financing gap is projected to be most pronounced during 2010.
Timely external financing is critical to ensure that essential expenditures ­ including investment spending
­ are maintained at an adequate level, which is particularly important given Iraq's already fragile context.

6. Through the reform program that underpins it, the proposed operation will help focus attention
on key reforms critical to Iraq's longer-term development. These reforms are reflected in a set of
prior actions to be completed before the proposed operation becomes effective, as well as on triggers for
the second DPL in this proposed series. These reforms focus on: (i) strengthening budget management
and prioritization; (ii) reforming the financial sector; and (iii) improving the efficiency of the social
protection system. They are consistent with the thematic areas of the Bank's Interim Strategy Note 2009-

                                                     1
2011 for Iraq. The prior actions focus largely on institutions and processes. This is because many of
Iraq's institutions were rendered dysfunctional during the past thirty years of authoritarian rule followed
by war. As a result, they need to be substantially modified to fit the needs of a modern democratic state.

7. The need to help improve Iraq's fiscal sustainability prospects also provides a common goal for
the three selected reform areas. First, strengthening budget management and prioritization is critical to
ensure aggregate fiscal discipline and reduce waste and unproductive expenditures. Second, financial
sector reform will help reduce the direct budgetary burden of state-owned banks as well as the contingent
liability they represent. Third, a social protection system can only be truly efficient if it is fiscally
sustainable, which can be achieved through the rationalization of the costly and large Public Distribution
System and through pension reform.

8. The three reform areas are supported by ongoing technical assistance by the Bank and other
donors. In particular, companion Bank projects are under implementation in the areas of public financial
management, banking sector reform, and social protection. These projects have been closely coordinated
with the IMF and donors, including DFID, the European Commission, US Treasury and USAID. In
addition, the proposed operation is closely coordinated with the Stand-by Arrangement operation
expected to be presented to the Board of the IMF on in late February 2010. The Bank operation relies on
the fiscal framework established in the SBA, while the SBA is complemented by the reforms envisaged in
the Bank operation with respect to strengthening public financial management, the financial sector and
social protection.

9. In addition to providing a timely response to Iraq's financing needs, the proposed schedule of
the operation reflects the country's current political economy. This operation would provide the
Bank an opportunity to launch a well-conceptualized dialogue with the new Government and support the
continuation of policy reforms. To that end, it is vital to build on the commitment of the current
Government, and to agree on a fiscal and structural reform program so that policy moves along desirable
tracks in the period following the elections. Commitments made to international financing institutions
will help lock in the appropriate reform measures. To ensure the commitment on the part of the Iraqi
authorities, parliamentary approval of the 2010 Budget was essential to confirm the IMF and Bank
assessment of Iraq's fiscal program and to proceed with the proposed budget support.

10. This DPL would add value to the portfolio of existing Bank operations in Iraq and help achieve
the objectives laid out in the Bank's strategy to support Iraq. In particular, it brings together for the
first time different elements of Bank assistance under a consolidated, coherent reform package; lays out
prior actions and future reforms in areas not directly addressed in previous operations, such as the links
between the Iraq's Poverty Reduction Strategy and the State Budget as well as the rationalization of the
Public Distribution System; and helps accelerate policy decisions in a number of reform areas, thereby
energizing the reform agenda and providing synergy with the implementation of the investment project
portfolio.

II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

A.    Recent Economic and Political Developments

11. The Republic of Iraq--with an estimated population of about 30 million--faces substantial
development challenges. Chief among these is the need to build its infrastructure and institutions after a



                                                    2
tragic history of authoritarian rule followed by war and occupation, a task made difficult by the prospect
of political instability and the excessive dependence on one commodity, crude oil, for its revenues.

12. Wars, sanctions and weak governance have contributed to a marked deterioration in Iraq's
standards of living in recent years. For example, the infant mortality rate in Iraq is close to the rates in
the MENA region's poorest countries, Djibouti and Yemen. Furthermore, school enrollment has declined
over the past decades as a result of low quality of and low returns to education. Iraq's poverty headcount
index is relatively high at 22.9 percent. However, with a poverty gap of only 4.5 percent, Iraq's poverty
is shallow. This means that a relatively small amount of resources­through income growth or transfer
mechanisms­could lift most of the poor above the poverty line.

13. Iraq's oil dependence is reflected by the fact that revenues from crude oil exports account for
about two-thirds of the country's GDP and for almost all of its export and fiscal revenues.
Volatility of international oil prices means that Iraq's oil export revenues are highly volatile. Crude oil
export revenues are projected to drop by about 40 percent between 2008 and 2009, in light of recent
developments in international oil prices. In particular, Iraq's oil export price is expected to drop from an
average of US$91.5 per barrel in 2008 to a projected average of US$55.6 per barrel in 2009.

14. Despite these obstacles, Iraq's macroeconomic performance over the past few years has been
sound. After spiking at 65 percent in 2006, inflation has been kept at a moderate level. Notwithstanding
sharp food price increases in the first half of 2008, inflation was contained at 6.8 percent by end 2008.
This has allowed the Central Bank of Iraq to ease monetary policy by reducing the policy interest rate to 7
percent in recent months.

15. Iraq successfully concluded two Stand-By Arrangements (SBA) with the IMF in December 2007
and 2008. Implementation of the SBA program supported Iraq's macroeconomic stabilization process,
leading to much lower levels of inflation and dollarization of the economy. Successful completion of the
SBA triggered the release of the final tranche of the debt relief agreed with the Paris Club.

16. From a political perspective, the most important milestone for Iraq in the near term is the
parliamentary elections, which are scheduled to take place on March 7, 2010. The March poll will
elect new representatives in the Council of Representatives (CoR) as well as a new president and a new
government. The new polling date represents a seven-week delay over the original date of January 16,
2010. The delay was caused by lack of agreement on some key issues, mainly over the number of seats
allocated to Iraqi expatriates and minorities and which voters list to use for the governorate of Kirkuk
(Tamim).

17. The elections are expected to be of significant importance and impact on the future of Iraqi
politics. In particular, the electoral process can help address political differences without resorting to
sectarian or ethnic conflict as in the recent past. These would be the first elections with Iraqi forces
providing security over the entire country.

B.      Macroeconomic Outlook

18. Iraq maintained macroeconomic stability and good economic performance in 2008. Real GDP
growth in 2008 is estimated at 9.5 percent, while end-2008 inflation reached 6.8 percent, compared to
64.8 in 2006. The overall fiscal situation in 2008 was positive due to high oil revenues. Table 1
summarizes the macroeconomic outlook for Iraq. Total revenues totaled nearly US$73 billion in 2008.


                                                     3
Execution of the investment spending allocation in 2008 (85 percent of overall investment budget) has
increased compared to previous years, although delays were caused by the spate of bombings targeting
Government buildings in the second half of 2009. Iraq's economy still relies heavily on the oil sector for
its revenues and GDP remains highly volatile. Nominal GDP contracted by an estimated 25 percent in
2009 while real GDP expanded by 4.2 percent mainly in the non-oil sector (non-oil growth is estimated at
4 percent for 2009). Overall inflation fell by over 4 percent year-on-year.

19. Total Government expenditures increased considerably between 2007 and 2008, partly as a
response to rising oil revenues at the time as well as security improvements. Total Government
spending rose from about US$42 billion to US$71.5 billion between 2007 and 2008. This increase in
spending reflects a number of factors, such as a commensurate increase in oil revenues during this period,
a significant increase in the salary and pension bill (from US$10.9 billion to US$17.3 billion), and a more
than doubling of investment expenditures (from US$8.9 billion to US$22.6 billion), reflecting the
improved security situation and an enhanced capacity on the part of the Government to execute the capital
budget.

20. Given Iraq's oil dependence and the volatility of oil revenues, macroeconomic variables
expressed as a share of GDP need to be interpreted carefully. Because of the dominant role of the oil
sector in Iraq's economy, nominal GDP is highly sensitive to changes in oil prices. For example, Iraq's
nominal GDP is projected to drop from US$86.5 billion in 2008 to US$66 billion in 2009, before
recovering somewhat to a projected US$80 billion in 2010. Therefore, fluctuations in variables such as
the public spending-to-GDP ratio to a large extent reflect changes in the denominator as opposed to
changes in the numerator. In fact, between 2008 and 2009 total fiscal spending as a share of GDP is
estimated to have risen from 82 percent to 99 percent, while in nominal terms it declined from US$71.4
billion to US$65.2 billion (see Table 2 and paragraph 23). On the other hand, oil revenues as a ratio to
GDP are much more stable, as shown in Table 1.

21. Fiscal policy in Iraq is characterized
by three main aspects that provide some
cushion against sudden fluctuations in oil
revenues: (i) a conservative budget oil price
to guide estimates of the budget envelope; (ii)
protection of expenditures from revenue
volatility through development of borrowing
instruments and through use of MTFF; and
(iii) use of fiscal buffers (DFI balances and
Ministry of Finance balances in CBI) to
reduce the expenditure impact of oil revenue
volatility. There are no formal fiscal rules in place yet, but the Fund and the Bank are ready to engage in
dialogue on fiscal rules in the medium term through Analytical and Advisory Work.

22. However, even these fiscal safeguards did not prevent Iraq's fiscal stance from deteriorating
significantly with the decline in oil prices in the second half of 2008. After holding fiscal surpluses in
the order of US$5.5 billion and US$1.5 billion in 2007 and 2008 respectively, Iraq is projected to have an

overall fiscal deficit of US$15.3 billion in 2009, tapering off to US$5.3 billion in 2010 as oil revenues
start to recover. Preliminary sensitivity analysis ­ including downside and upside scenarios ­ illustrates
the significant impact of changes in oil prices on Iraq's revenues and fiscal stance (see Box 1).


  Box 1. Iraq: Crude oil price projections and sensitivity scenarios for the overall fiscal balance 2010-12

Under the most recent WEO baseline projection, the price of crude oil is expected to reach 76 $/b for 2010. The
2010 budgeted Iraqi oil price is 62.5 $/barrel. Under the baseline assumptions, a deficit of about US$15 billion
will arise in 2010 resulting in a US$3.4 billion financing gap for that year.

Upside scenarios. If the Iraqi oil price is 15 percent higher than the baseline scenario (72 $/b), the overall fiscal
deficit is estimated to decrease to US$8.1 billion for 2010 (47 percent less than the baseline deficit), assuming
that projected total expenditures and non-oil fiscal revenues and grants remain unchanged for the period 2010-
12. The projected financing gap would not materialize as DFI balances would increase. The overall fiscal
balance would shift to a surplus of US$11 billion by 2012 (see figure below).

Downside scenarios. If the Iraqi oil price is 5 percent lower than the baseline scenario (59.4 $/b), a fiscal deficit
of US$ 17.7 billion would emerge (15 percent higher than the baseline projection) with a larger financing gap.
The fiscal balance would remain in deficit for the whole period. See figure below.

23. The Government's response going forward aims to contain current expenditures while
protecting priority spending categories, in light of the country's reconstruction needs. A sharp fiscal
adjustment took place in 2009 with a reduction in total spending from US$71.4 billion in 2008 to about
US$65 billion, mostly due to reduced capital spending. On the other hand, current expenditures are
estimated to have increased by 4 percent between 2008 and 2009, mostly driven by additional spending
on security. However, total expenditures over 2010-2012 are projected to stabilize around US$75 billion.
In particular, the Government aims to contain current spending by refraining from public sector wage
increases, limiting public sector hiring, improving targeting of the Public Distribution System, reducing
transfers to state-owned enterprises and preventing a resurgence of direct fuel price subsidies.

the period 2010-2011. This financing gap estimate already takes into account projected reductions in the

as well as in Government deposits with CBI (from US$11.5 billion in 2008 to US$0.8 billion in 2010), in
addition to a substantial issuance of treasury bills (in the order of US$9 billion over 2009-2011).
Reflecting the country's current fiscal situation, the Iraqi authorities have expressed interest in a 24-month
US$3.8 billion successor SBA, representing 200 percent of Iraq's quota. The IMF conducted discussions
with the Iraqi authorities on a successor SBA in two missions (July and September-October 2009), joined
by Bank staff.

25. The fiscal program agreed with the IMF calls for balances to be left in the DFI and the CBI
(totaling $3.4 billion at the end of 2010). These are meant to be precautionary buffers to absorb
unforeseen shocks and are set at a level sufficient to cover three months of public sector wages and
salaries. Furthermore, Iraq has limited access to international and domestic commercial debt markets and
its spreads remain considerably higher than in other MENA countries. Therefore, it is prudent to maintain
precautionary balances in light of the volatility of Iraq's oil revenues.

export, sells at a higher discount than the Kirkuk
crude.

27. An additional fluctuation risk discount is used to determine the budgetary oil prices adopted
by the Iraqi authorities to forecast fiscal revenues. The resulting oil price is calculated as the
difference between the average petroleum spot price (APSP)2, the quality differential described above,
and an additional fluctuation risk discount (set at 10 percent) to take into account Iraq's extreme
dependence on oil revenues.3 This formula underlies the oil price assumptions used in the financing gap
calculations. This is consistent with the principle of adopting a conservative budgetary oil price, and is in
line with current practice in a number of oil-exporting countries4. While oil prices are expected to recover

   These were the benchmarks used by SOMO as of December 2009. In January 2010, SOMO announced it is considering
shifting its WTI benchmark to the Argus crude benchmark. The rationale for SOMO is twofold: (i) Iraqi crude oil exports have
shifted from the US market to Asia over the years. According to official figures, 54 percent of Iraq's crude was shipped to the US
in 2006 to currently 54 percent of Iraqi crude going to Asia; (ii) the volatility of the WTI benchmark led to wide fluctuations in
the differential between the Iraqi oil price and the WTI and a loss of income for Iraq. These fluctuations were mainly related to
US domestic conditions at the WTI delivery point and did not reflect the international market.

  That is, a simple average of UK Brent, Dubai and West Texas Intermediate spot prices for world exports of light, medium and
heavy crude oil.

  "The use of conservative budget oil prices reflects prudential considerations and/or political economy factors. Such oil price
assumptions are viewed as a prudent way to reduce the risk of a large deficit or fiscal adjustment in the event of an unanticipated
decline in oil revenue. Governments have also sought to use low budget oil prices to contain spending pressures". In Ossowski,

                                                                8
slowly from their low levels of 2008 and 2009, given their volatility and uncertainty, it is more prudent
from a fiscal standpoint to stress downside rather than upside risks. Gap assumptions are also based on
estimated export volumes for the next three years from the Southern and Northern fields. Crude exports
are expected to average 2.1 mbpd over 2009-2010. Given the fragility of the infrastructure in the oil
sector and a potential reduction in northern field exports considering the political disputes around the
status of Kirkuk, oil export volumes might also be lower than projected5.

28. On the monetary policy front, due to reduced inflationary pressures, the CBI has loosened its
stance since 2008. The CBI started to appreciate the dinar in November 2006 to counter dollarization
and reduce inflation. More recently, it has shifted from a policy of gradually appreciating the exchange
rate one of maintaining a stable rate vis-à-vis the US dollar. In addition, the CBI reduced its policy
interest rate from 15 percent to 14 percent in January 2009 and to 7 percent in June as price pressures
were restrained and to eventually encourage banks to lend money to promote private sector growth.

29. Preliminary analysis by the IMF suggests that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals. The recent fall in oil prices suggest that the Iraqi Dinar might be slightly
overvalued, but there seems to be no significant deviation from the equilibrium real effective exchange
rate. Relatively low levels of inflation also suggest that overvaluation risks brought about by rising
domestic prices are contained.

30. Iraq's international reserves have played a critical role in helping ensure macroeconomic
stability. The accumulation of foreign exchange reserves at the CBI allowed Iraq to stabilize the Dinar,
reverse the dollarization process, and contain inflation. Reserve accumulation was facilitated by the high
crude oil price up to mid-2008. For example, gross international reserves of the CBI increased from
US$31.4 billion at end-2007 to about US$50 billion at end- 2008. In light of the fall in oil prices, CBI
reserves are projected to decline to about US$44 billion in 2009. Going forward, maintaining a healthy
level of international reserves is crucial to preserve the stability of the Iraqi Dinar, and avoid the
resurgence of currency substitution and inflation, with its accompanying socio-economic effects,
particularly on the poor.6

C.        Debt Sustainability and External Financing Needs

31. Further progress was achieved in debt restructuring, significantly improving Iraq's debt
sustainability prospects. The final review of the second IMF SBA took place in October 2008 and was
completed in December 2008. Completion of this review triggered the third and final stage of Iraq's Paris
Club debt reduction agreement, for a total debt reduction of 80 percent in NPV terms. The final debt
treatment reduced the total stock of debt due to Paris Club creditors to US$7.8 billion. Based on the Paris
Club agreement, Iraq will restart making payments on this debt stock by 2011. The IMF estimates Iraq's
total government debt at US$95.6 billion at end-2008, US$90.3 billion at end-2009 and US$30.9 billion
at end-2010, assuming a debt reduction in 2010 by non-Paris Club creditors in terms comparable to the

  While exports overall were relatively steady, northern oil exports fell by 111,000 barrels per day in October 2009, largely due to
a suspension of exports from Iraqi Kurdistan and a one-week stoppage of the main northern export pipeline. The stoppage of
pumping along the Iraq-Turkey pipeline was due to an act of sabotage on the line near Mosul inside Iraq, the first such act for
months.

  The empirical literature has lent support to the view that "inflation is the cruelest tax of all" as it hurts the poor
disproportionately. See e.g., Easterly, W. and S. Fischer (2001). "Inflation and the Poor". Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,
Vol. 33, Issue 2 (May), pp. 160-178.

                                                                 9
Paris Club agreement. Furthermore, most of Iraq's commercial debt was successfully renegotiated over
2004-6, leaving Iraq with an outstanding commercial debt stock of US$5.2 billion by end-2007, down
from the original US$21.9 billion.

32. However, for these prospects to fully materialize, further progress is needed with respect to
non-Paris Club debt restructuring. Negotiations are underway with non-Paris Club creditors. The
United Arab Emirates announced full cancellation of Iraq's outstanding debt in July 2008. In addition, in
March 2009, Iraq signed a bilateral agreement with Tunisia settling an outstanding debt of US$183
million. The Paris Club Tour d'Horizon held in December 2009 indicated that comparable debt
treatments had been completed with 58 out of 73 Iraq's sovereign creditors at the time. The Paris Club
Secretariat had written to nearly all of the outstanding 15 sovereign creditors (all except Kuwait and
Sudan), urging them to grant comparable treatment. Further progress is therefore needed to resolve the
outstanding claims of official non-Paris Club creditors (mainly concentrated in the Gulf Countries) on
terms comparable to those of the 2004 Paris Club Agreement. In addition, China announced that it will
forgive 80 percent of Iraq's debt of US$8.47 billion.

33. In the short term, Iraq is projected to face a major external financing gap. Mirroring the fiscal
accounts, Iraq's current account balance will move from a significant surplus in 2008 to a major deficit in
2009. Projected estimates indicate a current account surplus of about US$13.1 billion, or 15.1 percent of
GDP, in 2008. With the fall in oil export receipts, a current account deficit in the order of US$12.8
billion (or 19.4 percent of GDP) is preliminarily projected for 2009. The current account balance is
projected to remain at the same levels ­ while still being in a deficit position ­ during 2010, due to
increased imports to pursue the reconstruction and infrastructure upgrade as well as recovery of the
private sector.

34. Oil prices are the central variable to understand Iraq's current account balance, as they explain
the behavior of export revenues. Crude oil exports accounted for 98.6 percent of Iraq's total exports in
2008. The decline in exports is estimated at US$22.7 billion between 2008 and 2009. Preliminary
simulations indicate that Iraq's fiscal and export revenues are highly sensitive to minor variations in oil
prices and oil export quantities.

D.      Poverty and Social Development

35. Iraq was once known throughout the region for the quality of its education, health and
infrastructure. However, as Iraq underwent a series of wars and international sanctions, the emphasis
shifted from investment to maintaining a minimum level of consumption. Chronic lack of investment and
maintenance in physical, institutional and human development drove down the average level of welfare
and removed the opportunities for the most well-endowed to prosper. Meanwhile, high levels of spending
on the food ration provided a floor on consumption, albeit through a highly inefficient and distortionary
mechanism.

36. The recently-completed Iraq Household Socio-Economic Survey (IHSES) shows that poverty is
relatively high but "shallow" in Iraq. In 2006-2007, socio-economic data for the nation as a whole was
collected to analyze the extent and causes of poverty, and to support development of a practical poverty
reduction strategy. Based on an official poverty line of ID 76,896 per person per month (real
expenditure), poverty in Iraq is relatively high (with a headcount index of 22.9 percent) but "shallow"
(with a poverty gap index of 4.5 percent).

37. Iraq has the lowest employment to population ratio in the region. Out of every 100 Iraqi adults
slightly over one-third (38 percent) are employed, and 5 percent are unemployed (available and seeking
work). The majority (57 percent) are not in the labor force ­ meaning they are not working and not
seeking work. The labor force participation rate for women in the non-poor group is at 13.3 percent and
11 percent for the poor.

38. Refugees have slowly started returning home as security improves, but displacement remains a
top concern. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that more than
4.7 million Iraqis have left their homes as a result of the war. Of these, more than 2.7 million Iraqis are
displaced internally, while more than 2 million have sought refuge in countries such as Syria and Jordan.
According to the UNHCR, only a small number have returned home, many of which suffered secondary
displacement as they found their property occupied.

39. Water and electricity supply remain unreliable according to the IHSES. Connection to public
water networks varies from 98.3 percent of dwellings in Baghdad to just 45.6 percent in rural areas.
However, only 12.5 percent of persons whose dwelling is connected to the public network report that their
supply of water is stable. 29.2 percent report daily interruptions; 17.6 percent report weak water supply;
and 16.4 percent report interruptions more than once a week. In rural areas, 26.1 percent of households
use rivers and creeks and 4.7 percent use public taps. The public electrical grid is identified as the main
source of electricity for 76.4 percent of individuals. However, it provides on average only 7.9 hours of
power per day. The lowest rate is in Baghdad, with only 5.0 hours of power supply per day. Only 22.4
percent of persons are able to rely solely on the public network for electricity to their housing unit. 75
percent of individuals supplement the public network with one or two other power sources. On average,
community generators provide 6.4 hours and private generators provide 4.0 hours of additional power per
day. Iraq's current electricity capacity is 7,500 megawatts, short of the country's needs of 12,000
megawatts.

III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM

40. The Iraqi Government's growth strategy aims to promote economic diversification and reduce
oil dependence by fostering private sector-led growth, rebuilding its physical and institutional
infrastructure, and developing its human capital. While some business environment reforms have

                                                    11
been introduced, the political and security situation (in addition to remaining constraints to business) have
not been conducive to sustained private investment in the non-oil economy. A coherent growth strategy
can only be fully implemented as the political and security situation stabilizes further.

41. The Government's reconstruction and recovery program is outlined in the National
Development Strategy (NDS) and International Compact with Iraq (ICI). The NDS was presented in
July 2005 and structured around four pillars for sustainable development, which remain relevant to Iraq's
present conditions: (i) strengthening the foundations of economic growth; (ii) revitalizing the private
sector as the engine for growth and job creation; (iii) improving the quality of life; and (iv) strengthening
good governance and improving security. The ICI was launched in May 2007 by Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon as a platform for Iraq's cooperation with the
international donor community. The ICI concentrates on four reform and investment areas as well as in
two specific sectors: (i) public resource management; (ii) governance and institutions; (iii) economic
reforms; (iv) social sector reform; (v) energy; and (vi) agriculture.

42. The reform areas supported by this proposed operation are fully in line with the priorities of
the NDS, the ICI and other reform initiatives by the Government. The specific areas discussed in
detail in what follows are those directly supported by the proposed DPL, and include: (i) the Poverty
Reduction Strategy and prioritization of public spending; (ii) public financial management; (iii) financial
sector reform; and (iv) reforms to the social protection system to increase its efficiency and fiscal
sustainability. The Government is now developing a new Five Year Plan.

A.      Poverty Reduction Strategy and Prioritization of Public Spending

43. Since 2003, the Government has focused on expanding the flow of oil revenue and little progress
was made in expanding services or employment-generating sectors of the economy. The
Government of Iraq's spending on social sectors remains well-below regional averages. Moreover,
within these sectors, allocation of resources among geographic regions and among categories of spending
remains largely ad hoc. For example, Iraq allocated 8 percent of total spending to the food ration in 2008;
this is large in that it exceeds the 6.2 percent spent on education and the 4.7 percent on health.

44. To remedy weaknesses in the allocation of resources, the Government has been engaged since
2006 in analytical work which will help strengthen budget prioritization. It includes:

        In 2007, the Government conducted the first national household income and expenditure survey
        since 1988. The Iraq Household Socio Economic Survey provides detailed information about
        living standards, representative at the sub-governorate level.
        A High Committee for Poverty Reduction (PRSHC) was established, including high level
        representation from all key national ministries, from the Kurdistan Regional Government, from
        Parliament and from Iraqi academia. The PRSHC has overseen the analysis of causes and
        consequences of poverty using the household survey data. The analytical work shed light onto
        the low quality of public health and educational services and identified geographic areas where
        access to services is particularly problematic.
        The PRSHC developed a Poverty Reduction Strategy on the basis of the analytical work. The
        Poverty Reduction Strategy focuses on six areas: income generation, education, health, safety
        nets, housing environment, and gender. Within each area, the strategy identifies public spending
        priorities and related policy reforms.


                                                     12
45. Spending composition is expected to change in favor of the social sectors in the medium term.
For example, health and education are allocated around 16 percent of total spending in 2009 compared to
about 11 percent in 2008. Pro-poor spending may also be enhanced as a result of the implementation of
the PRS, whose completion is a prior action of this operation. The first annual PRS monitoring report
(which is a program outcome in the matrix) will assess changes in spending on basic services as well as
related outputs and outcomes. Table 4 summarizes the recent evolution of priority spending in Iraq.

46. An assessment of recent trends in Iraq's budget composition indicates that recurrent and
capital expenditures focus on distinct sets of priority sectors. Security, education, and health have
been the priority areas for the recurrent expenditure budget. The top priority sectors for the capital budget
have been oil and electricity. This is reflected in Figure 2 below.




                                                                                 13

47. The PRS High Committee worked over the past 18 months on the development of the strategy.
In June, the PRSHC presented the poverty analysis and proposed spending priorities to a group of 120
donors and Iraqi stakeholders for their feedback. The PRSHC has also held discussions with members of
the Council of Ministers and key parliamentary committees. The PRS document, outlining spending
priorities and a plan for implementation and monitoring, was endorsed by the Council of Ministers in
November 2009, and officially launched in a ceremony on January 14, 2010.

B.      Public Financial Management Reform and Oil Revenue Management Mechanisms

48. Sound public financial management (PFM) is critical to ensuring efficiency and accountability
in the management of public resources. Iraq is resource rich and has enjoyed a substantial increase in
oil revenues in recent years. However, for the people of Iraq to benefit from its resource wealth, public
finance reforms are a priority. Weaknesses in the PFM system not only have high costs in terms of
allocative and operational efficiency but also create high levels of fiduciary risk. Iraq's commitment to
implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a positive step and signal of political
will to fight corruption, improve good governance and promote transparency in the oil and gas sector.

49. In addition to exogenous factors, such as lack of security and political uncertainty, budget
management in Iraq faces key impediments at the institutional level. They include poor budget
preparation and alignment with government priorities, poor investment project design and selection,
inconsistent and cumbersome procurement procedures, ineffective mechanisms for cash management,
monitoring and control of investment project implementation. By strengthening expenditure controls and
improving aggregate fiscal discipline, PFM reforms are a critical element in safeguarding fiscal
sustainability. In fact, some of the key impediments to fiscal sustainability in Iraq stem from
inadequacies in Public Finance Management. The Government of Iraq has identified challenges
throughout the PFM system from budget design and preparation to execution and reporting. It has also
devised a time-bound action plan (the Public Finance Management Action Plan, PFMAP) to address them
with assistance from the World Bank and the IMF.




                                                     14
50. The PFMAP is a broad program spanning several years developed by the Iraqi Government in
cooperation with the World Bank, the IMF and other donors. The PFMAP focuses on three key
areas: (i) budget design and preparation; (ii) public procurement; and (iii) cash management, control and
accounting. It brings together efforts aimed at improving budget preparation and design with execution,
accountability and control. The PFM project financed by the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) covers most areas of
the PFMAP in close cooperation with other donors. The US Department of Treasury is working in the
areas of budget design and preparation, accounting and reporting and procurement while USAID is
providing assistance in the area of information systems. UK DfID is working on areas of budget
preparation and accounting. The IMF is also assisting with the Chart of Accounts. Joint efforts involving
all the partners above included support in the redesign of the budget preparation process, a medium term
budget strategy and budget call circular, the introduction of a new Chart of Accounts and ongoing
development of accounting documentation. The design of commitment controls, cash release systems and
a Single Treasury Account is the next logical milestone in this integrated effort.

51. The Government is fully committed to implementing PFM reforms. Progress in the areas of
budget design and implementation are incremental but clear. In addition, progress has been made in areas
that constrain government discretion. In particular, since 2007 there is a Medium-Term Fiscal
Framework (MTFF) in place. A multi-year budget strategy and a budget with a hard fiscal ceiling were
introduced in 2009. Furthermore, financial reports and audits are prepared earlier and are more accurate.
In the past, it was not uncommon for closing accounts to be delayed by several months. Today, the
maximum delay is 60 days. Iraq has adopted the GFS Chart of Accounts. DFI, CBI and State Owned
Banks are audited by international audit firms and the Board of Supreme Audit reports are back on
schedule after multi-year delays in the past. Finally, in 2009 Iraq avoided the introduction of a
supplementary budget adding significantly to the credibility of the budget.

52. Work in the area of cash management and control (commitment control, disbursements and
accounting) is especially important and will lead gradually towards a Single Treasury Account.
These Government efforts will significantly reduce the amount of resources circulating in the system
reducing both inefficiency and opportunities for abuse. In addition, the work on implementing recently-
completed procurement legislation - including the establishment of a Procurement Regulatory Agency -
will significantly reduce fiduciary risks in this important area.

53. A critical element in Iraq's overall fiduciary framework is the Development Fund for Iraq. The
DFI is the sole legal account for all of Iraq's oil revenues. This is a bank account located at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. It is overseen by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB)
as established by the UN Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003). The DFI is the main financing source
for Iraq's budget. Despite shortcomings, it has afforded Iraq a level of transparency unparalleled for oil
dependent countries in the region. It also ensured the integrity of Iraq's oil revenue envelope at a time of
great uncertainty and instability with competing claims against government revenues from actors within
and outside the country. The DFI is also a precursor to a possible future petroleum revenue fund which
could fulfill revenue stabilization and saving functions. The maintenance of a single petroleum account
with robust transparency and accountability measures would be a structural benchmark under the
proposed successor SBA. See Box 2 for a more detailed discussion.

54. The Government of Iraq is moving towards fulfilling the candidacy requirements for the
Extractive Industries Transparency Inititative (EITI). The launch event of the Iraq EITI process
(IEITI) was held in Baghdad in January 10, 2010. EITI candidacy is a priority for the Government at
the highest level, facilitating management of Iraq's resources and revenues transparently for the benefit


                                                    15
for all Iraqi people. Several key steps were taken towards this goal: (i) a decree from the Council of
Ministers created the Iraq EITI National Secretariat and appointing its Head (Secretary-General); (ii) the
Secretariat is in the process of being appropriately staffed; (iii) media articles were published explaining
EITI to the public; and (iv) work is underway on a draft EITI work plan, the Multi Stakeholders Working
Group (MSWG) Charter and preparation for launch event, including publicly advertised invitations to
Civil Society Organizations (CSO) to consultation meetings. The Government is working closely with
the World Bank, which is providing technical assistance to Iraq's EITI candidacy process.

                            Box 2. Iraq's Oil Revenue Management Framework

Iraq's central mechanism for oil revenue management is the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). All of Iraq's oil
revenues are deposited at the DFI on the basis of UNSCR resolutions dating back to 1995. The purpose of the
DFI at inception is to monitor Iraq's exports under the Oil for Food program and ensure that Kuwait
compensations set aside calculated as a percentage of oil revenues are properly deducted.

The mechanism is quite simple: buyers of Iraqi oil deposit money directly into DFI. A sale is not complete
unless the money is on the account. Government of Iraq currently has full control of the account after the 5%
Kuwait Compensation set aside is deducted.

After the war of 2003, all of Iraq's frozen assets were transferred to the DFI, which was then placed under the
control of the Coalition Provisional Authority and monitored by the International Monitoring and Advisory
Board (IAMB). The IAMB includes among others the Chief Controllers of the World Bank and the IMF. The
DFI is audited annually by an international auditing firm, most recently KPMG.

The DFI account is held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Since July 2004 the account is owned by the
Ministry of Finance and managed in trust by the Central Bank of Iraq. DFI funds are protected from seizure by
the UNSCR resolutions and by a US Presidential Executive Order.

The UNSCR establishing DFI has been extended every year and was extended in December 2010 again. This is
dictated by the fact that the DFI is still needed to ensure that 5% Kuwait compensation set aside is deducted.
The Government has requesting the extension of the DFI arrangement. The US Executive Order is also extended
annually and is up for renewal in May 2010. The extension of the order is a key element in the Strategic
Framework Agreement signed between Iraq and the US in early 2009.

Most audit report qualifications do not pertain to the DFI account and its management per se, but rather
upstream and downstream from it. Most issues concern the way funds are used by spending units in the
execution of the budget.

The DFI could be interpreted as a de facto oil stabilisation fund without a withdrawal rule. Cash accumulates at
the DFI when Iraq is running a budget surplus and vice versa. The DFI offers a single transparent point for oil
revenues and is a key starting point for any revenue management policy. The key factor that distinguishes the
DFI from a typical oil fund is the lack of a formal fiscal rule governing (limiting) withdrawals from the fund.
The DFI could be seen as a precursor to an oil fund.

While well-designed oil funds can help avoid the "resource curse", particularly if they are appropriately
integrated with the budget, they are far from being sufficient. Their key contribution is to minimize the impact
of volatility on public spending and the economy at large. Well-managed oil funds can offer alternatives for
investing oil revenues and managing them over time to reduce dependence and support private sector growth.
However, a sustainable fiscal policy can be achieved through sound fiscal management and strong public
financial management systems, with or without the use of special fiscal institutions such as oil funds.

The extension of the DFI for another year under the joint monitoring of the IAMB and the new Iraqi led Council


                                                        16
of Financial Experts will preserve Iraq's oil revenue framework during a critical transitional period. In the
meantime, work should start on the development of a successor regime for DFI which fulfils the criteria of
transparency, accountability and single petroleum account. Helping Iraq maintain a material balance at the DFI
though the SBA and DPL is also important. Another key requirement for the preservation of the DFI is the
maintenance of international guarantees and protections.

Full reconciliation of financial flows within the state-owned oil companies and the budget, as well as domestic
physical flows of crude oil and oil derivatives, is critically necessary to have an accurate picture of Iraq's oil
revenue envelope. The Bank plans to collaborate closely with the Fund in assisting the Government of Iraq in
this regard as part of the upcoming Public Expenditure Review exercise. A key prerequisite is the installation of
domestic metering systems in export terminals and pipelines. The metering installation process is in an
advanced stage, and has already been completed for the Al-Basra oil export terminal.

In addition, the Bank will launch work on the Fiscal Aspects of Oil Revenue Management in Iraq, possibly as
part of the upcoming Country Economic Memorandum. This work will focus primarily on tools and policies to
manage oil revenue volatility, including through an assessment of the relevance for Iraq of special fiscal
institutions such as oil funds and fiscal rules. The goal is to help avoid "boom and bust" cycles in public
spending as a result of oil revenue volatility.


B.1. Budget Design and Preparation

55. Weaknesses in medium term fiscal planning have led to ad-hoc budgeting and pro-cyclical
government spending which contributes to fiscal sustainability problems. The ad hoc nature of
budgeting is manifested among other things in the practice of supplementary budgeting which has been
used in the last few years. This practice undermines the credibility of Iraq's budget formulation process,
since the original budget is not adhered to and a supplementary budget is customarily introduced.
Notwithstanding the fact that contingencies may arise during the year, these should be provisioned for in
the annual budget and the practice of supplementary budgets halted or a process that does not undermine
budget credibility instituted.

56. Budget preparation is also hampered by a weak connection between budget preparation and
government priority setting. Iraq also suffers from a poor quality of investment budget and project
design, further reducing the credibility of the budget and contributing to under execution of investment
programs. As noted before, the design and implementation of the PRS, combined with key PFM reforms,
would help address these concerns.

57. Efforts in this area aim at introducing a credible medium term fiscal framework on the basis of
sound economic and fiscal forecasts and the use of top down budgeting to bolster fiscal discipline.
The PFMAP calls for improving the process and content of the budget call circular and the introduction of
credible fiscal envelope and ceilings. It also calls for closer integration between government wide priority
setting and sector specific planning, on one side, and the budget process, on the other, in tandem with
quality improvement in both processes.

B.2. Public Procurement

58. Strengthening of Iraq's public procurement system is a key component of the PFM reform
process. The patchwork of old and new rules and regulations and lack of coordination between the
various bodies involved in the procurement process has been identified by the Government as a major
contributing factor to both abuse and inefficiency in budget implementation. The Public Finance


                                                         17
Management Action Plan and the new Procurement Law call for streamlining and harmonizing the
procurement process by adopting consistent government wide and sector specific Standard Bidding
Documents and procedures and establishing a Regulatory Agency to oversee uniform implementation
across government levels. The new procurement law will mark a major milestone in progress on public
procurement, and make Iraq a leader in the region in this area.

59. The Government has an Inter-ministerial task force of procurement experts, representing the
major ministers and departments to prepare a draft of Public Procurement Law to align the public
procurement system in the country with internationally recognized best practice. The new draft law
submitted to the Government of Iraq in 2008 was the result of consultations with the public sector, private
sector, and civil society through workshops in Baghdad, Erbil, and Amman.

60. An adequate implementation of the new legal framework for public procurement would
significantly improve economy, efficiency, transparency, and equal opportunity. This would be
evidenced by (i) the enactment of the new Public Procurement Law after approval by the Council of
Representatives; (ii) the issuance by Council of Ministers of the Implementing Regulations of the new
Public Procurement Law; (iii) the establishment of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA)
by a Decree of Council of Ministers; and (iv) the issuance by MoPDC of the Standard Bidding
Documents (SBDs) based on the new Public Procurement Law and Regulations.

B.3. Cash Management, Control and Accounting

61. A proper cash management, control and accounting will help attain effective budget execution
and mitigate potential risk of waste and abuse. The Government is working in addressing weaknesses
in areas such as cash management and government accounts, and the state of budget execution
particularly when it comes to investment.

62. The Public Finance Management Action Plan (PFMAP) calls for inter alia the introduction of
commitment control and cash release systems. Together with new Government Finance Statistics
(GFS)-based Chart of Accounts, these systems will allow for a more robust cash management and control.
The adoption of the Chart of Accounts and the Budget Strategy will greatly facilitate investment budget
execution. In addition, these measures are critical to improving overall PFM in Iraq, as they will allow
for better cash management and control. The aim of these measures is to increase the efficiency of public
expenditures as well as improve accountability.

63. After adopting the new GFS-based Chart of Accounts in 2007, the Ministry of Finance
proceeded to implement it throughout the system starting with monthly and annual financial
statements. This is often done by mapping the new final statements to accounts produced according to
the legacy system. The Accounting Reform Committee was established in October 2009 to codify the
new Chart of Accounts and produce an Implementation Manual which includes detailed description of the
Chart of Accounts codes and guidance notes on accounting policies and procedures.

64. The implementation of an automated Financial Management Information System (FMIS) is an
integral part of the PFMAP. It is also a prerequisite for other components, including a Single Treasury
Account. The Government of Iraq is working with the USAID and independently to introduce a system
that is compatible with Iraq's needs.

C.         Financial Sector Reform

C. 1. Overview of the Financial Sector Prior to Reforms

65. The Iraqi financial sector is dominated by the banking system, accounting for more than 90
percent of the financial assets. As of June 2008, the banking system comprised 29 banks, of which two
are state-owned commercial banks, 23 are private banks, and 4 small state-owned specialized banks.
Non-bank financial markets are underdeveloped. The capital markets, besides government debt
instruments, are practically nonexistent. Iraq had a nascent stock exchange which was closed after the
privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) program ended, and has recently resumed operations, but
trading remained thin. The state-owned insurance companies ­ largely inactive during the previous
regime ­ are small compared to the size of the economy.

66. In turn, state-owned banks dominate the banking system with around 90 percent of the banking
system's total assets, amounting to about US$26 billion. Of the total banking system's network of 550
branches, 450 are of state-owned banks. Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank are the largest state-owned
banks in Iraq (accounting for 70 percent of the system's assets), and the only ones with a national network
of branches (147 and 142 branches respectively). In addition to these two large state-owned commercial
banks, there are four small state-owned specialized banks, namely Agriculture Co-operative Bank,
Industrial Bank of Iraq, Real Estate Bank of Iraq, and the Ishtiraqi Bank--the latter was recently renamed
Iraq Bank and will soon be folded into Rafidain Bank. The state-owned specialized banks have 69
branches in total, and have about 2,000 employees.

67. The state of the banking sector reflects historical developments. Iraq nationalized its
commercial banks in 1964. Ten years later, four banks were merged into one--Rafidain Bank, which
had a commercial banking monopoly in Iraq until the second state-owned bank, Rasheed Bank was
established in 1988. Along with its normal commercial banking operations, Rafidain Bank also
conducted some transactions for the Government that are part of central bank activities in most countries.
Rasheed Bank has a large domestic branch network but no foreign branches. Before the first Gulf war,
Rafidain was the Arab world's largest commercial bank with total assets of US$47 billion and a branch
network outside of Iraq, notably in Beirut, Cairo, Amman, Bahrain, and Sanaá.

68. The private banks are small and their activities are limited to transactions services to a select
clientele. Their operation began only in 1993, when private banks with nationwide branches were
allowed to be established in Iraq. Despite the proliferation of private banks, their contribution to the
banking sector remains minor. There are also several foreign banks in Iraq, and some have invested in
Iraqi private banks that--once the security situation further improves--will bring new expertise and
competition into the system.7

69. Financial intermediation is weak in Iraq and access to finance is limited. Although the banking
sector is the main component of the Iraqi financial system, it offers few credit services, despite the fact
that many of the branches have resumed operations after the 2003 war. Compared to some other
countries in the MENA region, the deposit base and loan portfolio of Iraqi banks is small relative to GDP.
The credit culture is poor with very little extension of credit to the private sector. Total bank lending to
the private sector is equivalent to only 3.6 percent of GDP in 2008 (Table 5). Very few banks offer loans
with more than one year maturity and most banks lack the expertise to offer appropriate credit facilities or

    This includes HSBC, Westminster-Abbey, and National Bank of Kuwait.

assess risks. Correspondingly, the asset structure of state-owned commercial banks is heavily tilted
toward government securities and involves little credit to the corporate sector, be it public or private.8

70. Despite years of conflict, the state-owned commercial banks continue to be trusted by the
public, as evident in increase in deposits in terms of volume and number of depositors. They are
also the backbone of the payments system and are one of the instruments the Government has to make
social security and other nationwide payments. While the state-owned banks have wide name
recognition, command a reasonable level of public trust, and are fairly liquid, they need a clear reform
strategy to make a more significant contribution to development. Prior to reforms, the financial sector in
Iraq faced various challenges due to the low levels of competition, relatively high intermediation costs,
limited innovation, and dominance of state ownership. The banking system was burdened by high levels
of NPLs, while the non-bank segment is characterized by underdeveloped markets, thin trading in
equities, weak corporate governance, and weak infrastructure for effective payment systems.

71. In addition, the financial system in Iraq has been characterized by a weak supervisory and
regulatory framework, as well as poor financial institutional infrastructure. Prior to 2004, the
supervision functions were compliance-based rather than risk-based. The structure and efficiency of a
financial system is greatly shaped by the nature of its institutional infrastructure, which includes
information exchange setup; payments system; financial reporting; and accounting standards. In Iraq,
however, the institutional infrastructure, including credit information, the payments system, financial
reporting and accounting standards were weak and inadequate. Although Iraqi authorities are making
efforts to improve the institutional framework, there still remain large gaps. This called for the adoption
of a comprehensive reform strategy for the banking sector.

C.2. The Banking Sector Reform Program (2008-2012) and other Financial Sector Reform Initiatives

72. It became apparent by early 2007 that the Government needed to move forward with a
financial sector reform program, aimed at enhancing the sector's soundness and efficiency. This
program would contribute to building a system, able in the medium term to provide efficient financial
services competitively. This in turn would help ensure effective mobilization of funds, and allocating
them to the most productive investments.



8 State-owned   enterprises (SOEs) were financed from the budget, in the form of grants, and by hidden subsidies.

                                                                20
73. The objective of the reform program is to strengthen the performance of the banking system--
the dominant financial institution, accounting for 90 percent of the system. A key tenet is to improve
its capacity to provide quality financial services. This program has the potential to make a critical
contribution to Iraq's economic growth, prosperity, and macroeconomic stability.            Successful
implementation of the reform program would ensure that the overall financial system, and the banking
system in particular, would contribute better to economic development and growth.

74. This reform program was endorsed by the Government of Iraq in February 2009. The program
was developed with the support of the World Bank and in coordination with the different partners in
development that are actively working on developing the financial sector in Iraq. As mentioned earlier,
the program focused primarily on banking sector reform. The program was based on the findings and
recommendations of the independent comprehensive audits of the two state-owned banks that were
undertaken by Ernest & Young in 2008. It represents the most far-reaching, and comprehensive set of
financial reforms to have been ever launched in Iraq over the past decades.

75. In terms of institutional and operation restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks, the
reform program sought to develop an overall organization structure, including business units
organization.9 It includes improving human resources processes, such as the development of a personnel
strategy, clear rules and regulations for employees, assessment of skills and needs, job descriptions and
qualifications and career paths, rewards management and performance evaluation. Institutional
restructuring also involves developing the information technology infrastructure; focusing on an
information technology platform covering all operational aspects (such as marketing and sales tools,
credit tools, risk management tools, and information technology related consumer products, as well as
connectivity of branches and supervision authority); the flow of information; and the information security
system.

76. On financial restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks, the Government is committed to
clean up a large portion of the existing NPLs. Settlements would also be reached on other bad debts, and
selling of assets. An in-depth program of improvement in information technology, procedures, risk
management, governance, and staff skills would allow them to operate on a commercially viable basis in
increasingly open and competitive markets, without running the risk of incurring new NPLs. This would
entail: (i) restructuring of the balance sheets (including inherited debts and losses); (ii) capital adequacy
(classification of assets and provision policy, capital base); (iii) budgeting, planning and performance
management; (iv) accounting system in compliance with national standards and in line with international
good practices; (v) comprehensive reporting system of financial results; and (vi) cost recovery and re-
pricing of financial products. Also, positive strides have been made with regard to raising minimum
capital requirements. The settlement process of outstanding private claims as part of the liquidation of the
London branch of Rafidain Bank is well underway and the process to liquidate fixed assets has begun.

77. Underpinning the whole program was a major effort aimed at strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory authorities. CBI embarked on a comprehensive program of capacity building covering
extended areas of the regulatory and supervisory functions, with the objective of moving from compliance
to risk-based supervision. This includes undertaking a thorough and comprehensive review of banking
supervision processes; an updating and enforcement of a set of regulations in line with international


9
  This includes, retail, corporate and investment banking; risk management units; management of information systems;
governance, control and support units (audit, legal and compliance, anti-money laundering, human resources and organization,
shared services, financial functions, and risk functions).

                                                            21
standards; and making new recruitments and developing training. These initiatives are supported by the
World Bank, the IMF and the US Treasury.

78. Strengthening the financial sector institutional infrastructure is a key pillar in the reform program.
This includes improving internal audit and compliance in the banking system through developing further
the internal audit (processes, audit framework and methodology, effectiveness of internal audit); and
compliance with laws, regulations and instructions (scope of improvement, compliance framework and
methodology, as well as organization). Another key element was developing the payments, clearing, and
settlement systems through the installation of the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system in early 2009.
This will reduce total processing time of checks and transactions. Specific efforts include improving and
strengthening the information infrastructure, as well as the credit registration system.

D.      Reforms to the Social Protection System

D.1. Public Distribution System and Social Safety Net Reforms

79. The Iraqi food ration system  the universal Public Distribution System (PDS)  was
introduced in 1991 in response to the declining availability of food imports under the UN sanctions
and played a crucial role during that period. By making transfers to all households, the food ration
helped avoid a humanitarian crisis. The PDS remains equally important today: 99 percent of Iraqis have a
ration card to provide fixed quantities of 10 commodities on a monthly basis. Among the poor, who rely
heavily on the rations in their diet, the PDS provides 78 percent of calories actually consumed which
constitutes about 16 percent of their total income. Hence, given the uniquely large coverage of the
system, the reform of the PDS can only be gradual and needs to be accompanied by putting in place a
well-targeted safety net system. Just repealing the PDS is not an option and would have grave
consequences for the population, especially the poor: the poor would get poorer (the poverty gap would
double from 4.5 percent to 9.1 percent) and poverty rates (which currently stand at 24 percent) would soar
to more than 34 percent of the population.

80. The PDS is by far Iraq's largest safety net program: the other main safety net program ­ the
Social Safety Net (SSN) managed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs ( MOLSA) ­ is
comparatively much smaller. Whereas the budget of the PDS was US$5.87 billion in 2008, the budget
of the SSN was about one-eighth the size (US$0.67 billion). The Ministry of Trade operates the PDS in
close co-operation with three principal state-owned enterprises: the State Company for Grain Trading, the
State Company for Grain Processing, and the State Company for Foodstuff Trading. In addition, the
Ministry of Transport supports distribution through the State Transport Company. Procurement practices
lack transparency and do not ensure value for money, and contribute substantially to delays and prices
that are considerably above world market prices.

81. The Government decided to launch a medium-term reform program of the PDS for several
reasons. First, as indicated above, because the food ration is provided to all households in Iraq, the cost
is very high. Second, the management of the food ration is poor, making it vulnerable to waste, theft and
corruption and which leads to inefficiencies that are necessary to address. Rough calculations suggest
that it costs more than US$6 to transfer US$1 of benefits to a poor person. Third, the food ration's heavy
reliance on state-owned enterprises and non-competitive procurement crowds out the private sector and
reduces the efficiencies associated with competition. These reforms are expected to take several years to
be fully implemented.



                                                    22
82. Recognizing the rationale and impetus for reform, in 2009 the Government established a High
Committee to oversee the reform process for the PDS. 10 The High Committee is chaired by the
Secretary General of the Council of Ministers and includes Undersecretaries from the Ministries of
Finance, Planning, Trade, Labor and Social Affairs, Deputy Governors of Baghdad, Al Anbar and Babil,
representatives from the Kurdistan Regional Government and Iraqi Parliamentarians. The High
Committee is tasked with development of a concrete action plan for rationalizing the food ration which
includes the following key elements: (i) implementing proposed exclusion criteria in the current PDS,
such as exclusion of government officials from the PDS system that signals the commitment to move
towards a targeted system; (ii) devising an effective targeting tool that supports a robust transition from
universal to a targeted program ­ the SSN program would be a natural candidate to scale up if it can be
improved in terms of its targeting effectiveness as explained below; (iii) reducing the number of products
included in the ration; and (iv) assessing the feasibility of assigning management of food ration to a
decentralized level of government. Such a decisive reform of PDS if implemented would not only aid
critical improvements in the existing PDS but also afford fiscal space for developing a more
comprehensive social protection program in Iraq.

83. The existing cash transfer program (SSN Program) will need to become more efficient through
better targeting that will be facilitated through the development of a more effective targeting tool.
The SSN program was initially introduced as a policy response in 2004 to address rising poverty levels in
Iraq. Since 2004, the number of beneficiaries of the program has expanded rapidly, buoyed by the fiscal
surpluses enjoyed during 2007 and 2008, and now reaches about a million households. However, the
implementation of the program used categorical targeting11 mechanisms, which diluted its impact on the
poor ­ it currently reaches less than 10 percent of the poor population while maintaining overall budget
levels since 2008. The use of categorical targeting, while effective in initially capturing vulnerable
individuals and households, was expanded during the fiscal boom years, leading to rapid increase in the
number of included households. Little verification was done to assess beneficiary income and/or
consumption levels. The development of an objective and much improved targeting tool is therefore an
essential first step to improve the effectiveness of the SSN program. In addition, institutional capacity
needs to be developed to implement the improved targeting tool and administer the program. Once the
SSN program is targeted well, it can form the basis for streamlining across the various safety net
programs alluded to above, and especially to credibly assist a transition out of the universal PDS to a
targeted program.

84. The Government has expressed its intention to rationalize the MOLSA SSN program, and to
introduce a comprehensive and coordinated package of social assistance interventions. Foremost in
terms of rationalizing the MOLSA SSN program is the intention to gradually shift from the current simple

10
   To support intentions of reform of PDS, a high-level workshop on the PDS reform took place in June 2009, facilitated by the
World Bank. It was attended by all relevant stakeholders that are critical for the reform process, including the General Secretary
of Council of Ministers, Deputy Ministers from Finance, Trade and Planning, Prime Minister's Economic Advisor, select
members of Parliament and Chief of Staff of Council of Advisors. This workshop also benefitted from participation of the World
Food Programme and authorities from India and Indonesia who highlighted reforms and implementation challenges for
transitioning from universal to targeted programs. During the workshop, participants developed Terms of Reference for a High
Committee for PDS Reform, including development of recommendations on three topics: targeting, reducing the number of
commodities in the ration basket, and management of the PDS.
11
   The following categories are contemplated: (i) households with no income; (ii) independent individuals with no income who
are not living with families; (iii) unemployed individuals; (iv) households with disabled members; (v) widows or divorced
women; (vi) totally disabled persons including the blind and paralyzed; (vii) underage orphans (below 18 years old); (viii)
families of prisoners sentenced to more than one year in prison; (ix) displaced families, abandoned women, families who lost
their head of household (because of accidents, kidnapping etc.); (x) disabilities and injuries caused by acts of terrorism; and (xi)
married students continuing their university studies with no other source of income.

                                                                23
categorical targeting to exploring more robust targeting mechanisms informed by sound methodologies
such as proxy means testing. The authorities recognize that a robust methodology to identify the poor
will assist in achieving the overarching objective of effectively targeting the poor and vulnerable Iraqis
with adequate safety net provisions that include not only rations/cash transfer but also workfare,
microcredit, training, employment support, and unemployment insurance. Furthermore, MOLSA intends
to exploit the institutional structures they have in place to engage beneficiaries at a national scale and at
the local level. For example, in addition to the headquarters center in Baghdad, MOLSA manages two
social safety net centers in Baghdad (one each in Karkh and Rasafa), as well as social safety net centers in
all governorates, which have been involved in the application and vetting process of applicants. In
addition, MOLSA has established links with banks and post offices for disbursing the cash benefits in the
SSN program. These are all important considerations as MOLSA embarks on reform of the programs
alluded to above. However, the ambitious agenda described above will require substantial capacity
building in the medium-term to (i) manage the transition from universal to targeted PDS, (ii) devise an
effective targeting tool that can ensure minimal exclusion of the poor, and (iii) coordinate across various
diverse social protection programs to minimize overlap among beneficiaries while addressing the needs of
various vulnerable groups. The Government has requested technical support from the World Bank to
facilitate the envisaged reform.

85. In addition to the PDS and the SSN programs, the Government has also initiated a number of
other social programs to provide vulnerable groups with opportunities for productive participation
in the economy. These programs include training support, employment and placement services, as well
as microfinance. These programs have received modest budgetary allocations. In addition, these
programs were introduced in an ad hoc manner, without a comprehensive approach to the provision of a
full package of social assistance strategies to address not only income generation, but also income
protection for the poor.

D.2. Pension Reform

86. The pension reform legislation of the existing public sector pension scheme became effective in
December 2007. The pension law (Law 27) passed in January 2006 was suspended as it was widely
deemed to be unsustainable. Subsequently, the Government amended the law in December 2007 (referred
to as the Unified Pension Law in the text of the law) to improve financial sustainability and alter the
design of public sector pensions in line with good international practices. While the Unified Pensions
Law presents a significant improvement, there remain substantial challenges in terms of the
Government's capacity to implement the law, and in ensuring a sustainable old-age income protection
mechanism for Iraq. The World Bank, IMF and other international organizations have been supporting
Iraq in this reform.

87. The Unified Pension requires the merger of the public and private sector pension schemes by
2010. The amendment to Law 27/2006 includes a provision on the merger of the public and private
sector pension schemes by January 1, 2010. In particular, the National Board of Pensions (NBP) has been
established as the unifying body of the mandatory pension schemes. Those retired prior to January 17,
2006 will see little effect due to the reform. However, a new State Pension Fund (SPF) has been
established to provide pension benefits to public sector workers retiring on or after January 17, 2008. The
SPF is an administrative unit within the unifying umbrella of the NBP. Furthermore, the existing Social
Security System, the private sector pension scheme, is to be transferred under the authority of the NBP.
The envisioned merger is desirable in as much as it alleviates the segmentation of the labor market along
the public/private divide.


                                                     24
88. Even if all the implementation issues of the new Pension Law are resolved, the mandatory
pension system in Iraq will cover only one fourth of the labor force. This represents a low level from
a social protection point of view, and is 10 percentage points below the already low average coverage rate
in the Middle East and North Africa region. The coverage level of the national pension systems in
MENA is below that of the one in Iraq only in two countries: Yemen and the West Bank and Gaza. The
coverage rate reflects upon the capability of the pension system to prevent old-age poverty. A low
coverage rate does not only reflect limited overall access to the pension system, but it also signals that
only the already advantaged social groups have access to this social protection instrument. The primary
beneficiary group of the pension system is public sector employees who already possess a solid and
secure source of income compared to the uncovered masses in the informal sector. According to the Iraq
Poverty Assessment, only 15 percent of poor workers have pension coverage, compared to 34 percent of
nonpoor workers.12 Both the goals of poverty alleviation and accelerating private-sector-led economic
growth point to the direction of extending social insurance coverage over the medium- to long-term.

IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

A.       Objectives, Rationale and Timing

      i. Objectives

89. The main objective of the proposed DPL is to mitigate the impact of the current fiscal crisis on
Iraq's economy and to support its medium-term economic reform program, thereby helping the
country improve fiscal sustainability and reducing its fiscal and socio-economic vulnerability to
sudden drops in oil revenues.

90. More specifically, the project supports the following goals:
         Helping bridge the financing gap created by lower oil prices;
         Strengthening budget management and prioritization to enable more efficient and effective use of
         Iraq's own resources;
         Strengthening the financial sector;
         Helping to cushion the social impact of lower oil revenues by reforming social safety nets and the
         pensions system.

91. The common theme of improving Iraq's fiscal sustainability prospects brings these specific
goals together. First, strengthening budget management and prioritization is critical to ensure aggregate
fiscal discipline and reduce waste and unproductive expenditures. Second, financial sector reform will
help reduce the direct budgetary burden of state-owned banks as well as the contingent liability they
represent. Third, a social protection system can only be truly efficient if it is fiscally sustainable, which
can be achieved through the rationalization of the costly and large Public Distribution System and through
pension reform.




12
  By law, all public sector workers and employees of private firms with five or more employees are entitled to pensions, medical
insurance, disability, sickness, and maternity leave benefits. In reality, only 32 percent of wage workers in enterprises of 5­10
employees are covered. This increases to 84 percent of wage workers in enterprises with more than 50 employees.

     ii. Rationale

92. Budget support to Iraq should be seen in context of inherent political vulnerabilities the country
faces which could be compounded by its current fiscal difficulties. These difficulties were triggered
by the revenue shock, brought about by steeply declining oil prices in the wake of the global financial
crisis. The Bank and IMF support will help Iraq's fiscal stabilization efforts and enable the country to
continue its reconstruction and service delivery initiatives ­ a prerequisite to consolidate political stability
and security improvements as the country enters into an electoral period. Smooth economic and political
transition is critical for all stakeholders in Iraq.

93. Financial assistance to Iraq's budget by the Bank and the Fund will help sustain an adequate
level of public expenditures in Iraq, in order to strengthen the delivery of key public services and
rebuild infrastructure. Reflecting lessons from the experience of other post-conflict and fragile states,
Iraq public spending could be impacted by severe fiscal cuts that can undermine stability and security as
insurgent groups could exploit the weaknesses of a State undergoing a fiscal crisis.

94. Success in mitigating the impact of fiscal crisis on Iraq's economy will involve a combination of
additional financing and fiscal adjustment. Together with the IMF's proposed Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA), this DPL would help relieve the immediate financing pressures on the budget, and would also
help focus energies in key reform areas for the adjustment process, both in the short and medium terms.
The Bank is supporting the Government in the adjustment process, both directly and through its
participation in the design of the new SBA with the IMF. In the reform areas described in the previous
section, Bank support to the adjustment process is critical for the success of the financial turnaround.

95. In addition to assisting Iraq with a short-term financing need, the DPL would open the door for
a robust medium-term reform dialogue with Iraq. The ongoing Bank assistance and policy
engagement to Iraq create the opportunity to seek commitment in well-defined areas for reform, providing
the basis for a strong medium-term reform program for Iraq.

96. The importance of a medium-to-long term focus cannot be overstated. Although Iraq is facing a
short-term cash-flow problem, its current fiscal woes are a symptom of a medium-to-long term issue: an
excessive dependence on oil revenues and the consequent socio-economic vulnerability to abrupt changes
in international oil prices. Figure 3 shows that Iraq's real per capita GDP ­ a broad measure of welfare ­
follows a "boom-bust" pattern, with growth accelerations followed by growth collapses. Such collapses
have been cased either by falling oil prices or periods of warfare. Therefore, a reform program needs to
contain measures that can also help make inroads into longer-term development goals that help address
Iraq's vulnerability to such high degree of instability in real per capita GDP. Box 3 illustrates the short
and medium term aspects of the DPL.

        iii.                  Timing

97. The proposed timing of this DPL responds to both financing and political economy
considerations.

        From a financing gap perspective, it is critical that the Bank and Fund coordinate closely on
        the pace of disbursements from their respective operations. Specifically, Iraq would need
        budget support from the Bank during the first half of 2010. As shown in Figure 4, the
        financing gap for the first six months of 2010 is estimated at US$1.5 billion. In the second half of

                                                                                                                              27
   2010, the projected gap is US$1.9 billion. Under the proposed successor Stand-By Arrangement,
   the IMF expects to disburse US$460 million (25 percent of the quota) at Board approval, US$736
   million (40 percent of the quota) following the first review of the SBA (after end-May 2010);
   another US$1.657 billion following the second review (after end-August 2010), and US$460
   million and US$368 million in the first and second half of 2011, respectively. In addition, it
   should be noted that the IMF SBA is intended to be a mix of disbursing and precautionary, in two
   respects. First, as long as oil prices stay below US$73 per barrel for Iraqi oil, the program would
   be a disbursing SBA. If prices rise above US$73 per barrel and oil exports are above 2.1 mpbd, it
   could become a precautionary, non disbursing SBA at the Government's discretion. Second, if the
   2010 investment budget is under-executed (i.e., with a rate of execution below 93%) at the time
   of the second review, the program could also become precautionary again at the Government's
   discretion.

   From a political economy perspective, given Iraq's recent election history, it is expected that
   there would be a caretaker government in Iraq for several months after the elections. The
   previous general elections were held in December 2005 for a four-year government. Each
   province contributed a predetermined number of seats to the Council of Representatives (CoR).
   Voters chose lists representing their confessional affiliation and/or regions, and Shiite and
   Kurdish parties emerged dominant. The CoR was inaugurated on March 16, 2006. A 37-member
   cabinet led by Prime Minister Maliki was voted on May 20, 2006. Given the multitude of
   political alliances at present, it cannot be assumed that any one party or political force would be
   able to constitute a majority in the Council of Representatives. This could be expected to lead to
   protracted negotiations to form a national unity government. Waiting for the new Government to
   be in place before preparing this operation with new prior actions appropriate to the context at
   that time would substantially delay the needed financial support to Iraq. It is therefore critical to
   ensure that the proposed DPL disburses while a government committed to a reform dialogue with
   the Bank is still in place, for two main reasons: First, a timely processing of the proposed DPL
   will help lock in key aspects of Iraq's structural reform agenda, which the World Bank supports,
   and which will continue to be implemented through the ongoing TA program. Second, a
   continuing financing gap during the first half of 2010 could exacerbate potential tensions in an
   already politically-charged period, as it could compel Iraq to curtail essential expenditures,
   including investment and reconstruction spending.

                                               28
98. Furthermore, in the absence of timely external assistance to close its financing gap, Iraq's post-
election Government may be forced to rely on its international reserves to meet its short-term
financing needs. This could be an important risk factor if a post-election, caretaker government faces
pressures to increase spending in face of an uncovered financing gap, potentially undoing the hard-won
stabilization gains made over the past few years. As noted, Iraq's international reserves play a key role in
the stabilization of the Iraqi Dinar and provide an additional cushion against unforeseen shocks.13

B.        Link to Interim Strategy Note (ISN)

99. Although this DPL was not originally included in the Interim Strategy Note 2009-11 (ISN)
presented to the Board of Executive Directors in March 2009, it is fully consistent with the ISN
thematic areas. The ISN aims to: (i) support ongoing reconstruction and socio-economic recovery; (ii)
improve governance and the management of public resources; and (iii) support policies and institutions
that promote broad-based, private sector-led growth. The three DPL pillars are linked as follows to the
ISN themes: Social safety nets are part of the first theme of the ISN; budget management and
prioritization is at the core of the second; and financial sector reform is a key component of the third. In
all three areas there are ongoing Bank-supported investment operations being implemented in Iraq as well
as past, current or planned AAA work. These links are summarized in Figure 5. The DPL also meets the
selectivity criteria for new Bank financed projects that the third ISN introduced.14

100.    Furthermore, by energizing the reform efforts in three key policy areas, the DPL will help
implement the ISN and achieve its objectives. First, the DPL brings together in a single operation
different strands of the reform program supported by the ISN. Second, by frontloading support to Iraq's
reform agenda, the DPL can help meet key ISN goals more quickly than through investment projects.
Third, by providing resources to Iraq at a time of critical need, the DPL opens the door for engagement
with Iraq on its medium-term development agenda as envisaged by the ISN.

   The CBI is de facto and de jure independent. In fact, the Central Bank Law prohibits the CBI from financing the budget. It is
important to bear in mind that Iraq adopted an exchange-rate-based stabilization policy against inflation, and the independence of
the CBI was critical to ward-off pressures to finance the budget deficit. The threat to macroeconomic stability associated with a
potential dip into international reserves comes from the impact this might have on the public's confidence in the Iraq Dinar and
the level of the nominal exchange rate, and from the risks of reigniting inflation in Iraq, which is particularly harmful to the poor.

C.       Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

101.    This operation and the proposed new IMF SBA are mutually reinforcing and
complementary to each other. In designing the Bank support to the Government's reform program,
account was taken of the fact that the IMF's proposed SBA is expected to focus on many of the same
reform areas (such as PFM and banking reform). Therefore, the back-to-back mission with the IMF in
September ­ October 2009 provided an opportunity to ensure that the DPL reform program and the
Fund's structural benchmarks are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Further collaboration and
complementarity is expected in the areas of oil revenue management. In implementing its technical
assistance programs in Iraq, the Bank has also been working very closely with key technical departments
at the Fund, such as the Fiscal Affairs Department (on PFM reform) and the Monetary and Capital
Markets Department (on financial reform issues). In addition, the IMF and the Bank have been working
very closely together in the implementation of previous IMF arrangements with Iraq. In particular, Bank
support has been instrumental for the success of critical reform actions under the previous SBA such as
the design and launching of the Public Financial Management Action Plan, the Banking Sector Reform
Action Plan, the international audits of the Rafidain and Rasheed Banks, the amendment to the Pension
Law to make it fiscally sustainable, and the revisions to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) weights drawing
on information from the 2007 Household Survey.

102.     In all three pillars of the proposed DPL, the underpinning technical assistance projects are
funded through the multi-donor Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) financed by contributions from 17 donors15
and administered by the World Bank. The status of ITF projects is reported regularly through the
International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) website and through annual formal reports to
donors16. Some specific information on donor coordination for each of these Pillars follows below.

Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States.

103.    The preparation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) has been supported through a
grant from the ITF. In addition, a variety of donors have participated in workshops to provide feedback
to the Iraqi PRS High Committee, most notably the June 2009 workshop which included over 100
participants from the donor community and Iraqi stakeholders. More recently, the Bank has coordinated
closely with the UN agencies on encouraging the Government to adopt the priorities of the PRS into their
Five Year National Development Plan.

104.     The Public Finance Management project, also financed through the ITF, is carried out in
close cooperation with the IMF, European Commission, the US Department of the Treasury and
the UK Department for International Development. These partners played a direct role in the design
of the project and are joining directly in its implementation by participating in working groups and
meetings, contributing to outputs and in some instances co-financing joint activities. Furthermore, the
Government of Iraq convenes regular meetings for all interested donors in the area of Public Finance
Management to apprise them of progress in implementing the PFMAP and to solicit inputs into the
process.

105.     The authorities have also sought financial and technical support from the IMF, US, and the
World Bank to carry out its financial sector reform program. There has been close collaboration
between all development partners. The World Bank and the IMF and other donors in Iraq in banking
sector reform, namely, European Commission, US Treasury, and Financial Services Volunteer Corps
(FSVC) have been playing a vital and active role in restructuring the banking sector. The Banking Sector
Reform Project, financed through the ITF, aims to support the Iraqi authorities in the implementation of
Phase I of the "Iraq Banking Reform Strategy" (2008-2012) and its Action Plan. The World Bank has
been coordinating donors' initiatives to avoid overlap, ensure complementarity, and address key issues on
a timely and priority basis. Coordination with other donors will prevent duplication of efforts by
strengthening complementarily to help the government implement the rest of the reform agenda. To this
end, an `Iraq Banking Reform Donors Group', chaired by the World Bank, has been formed to coordinate
efforts related to both technical and financial support provided to the Government of Iraq in the area of
banking reform. This DPL will build on the ongoing Bank's efforts undertaken and at the same time
complement work being undertaken by other development partners.

106.     The World Bank has been working closely with USAID in supporting social safety nets and
pension reform. On the social safety net side, the World Bank and USAID have been working closely
since 2005 to support the capacity building for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) to
plan, manage, and implement the cash transfer program. Initially, this was done through USAID's
Second Economic Governance Program (EGII), and has recently been transferred to the USAID/Tatweer
program. The ITF-financed Social Protection Project aims to help strengthen the policy, management,
and administrative capacity of the Government to develop, manage, and monitor pension and social safety
net reforms. For pensions, the World Bank has worked closely with the IMF to ensure that the
amendments to Law 27/2006 to ensure a more fiscally sustainable pension system that is consistent with
international best practices. In addition, the World Bank has worked closely with USAID in the
development of the amendments to Law 27/2006, and in the provision of capacity building support to the
National Board of Pensions.

D.      Relationship to Other World Bank Group Operations

107.    The proposed DPL is underpinned by six key ITF-financed companion projects designed to
build capacity and provide technical assistance in each of the three pillars, namely:


                                                   31
       Public Financial Management (PFM) Reform Project (US$18 million; FY09). This project
       aims to improve allocation, execution, transparency and accountability in the mobilization and
       use of all public resources. Cross-cutting reform of the PFM will be addressed by strengthening
       budget formulation, execution and control, improving public financial reporting, strengthening
       public procurement and developing capacity in PFM, both at the central and the governorate
       levels.

       Emergency Banking Sector Reform Project (US$10 million; FY09), which supports the
       implementation of Phase I of the Banking Sector Reform Strategy--Action Plan (2008­2012),
       aiming at improving the performance and soundness of the two state-owned banks--Rasheed
       Bank and Rafidain Bank, as well as strengthening the capacity of the supervisory functions of the
       Central Bank of Iraq.

       Emergency Private Sector Development Project (US$65 million; FY05), which aims to help Iraq
       strengthen its institutional capacity and build essential communications infrastructure to help
       foster the development of the private and financial sectors, and increase investment and economic
       growth.

       Household Survey & Policies Project (US$9.1 million; FY07), which aims to strengthen the
       ability of the Government to make informed policy decisions for poverty reduction, employment
       generation and safety nets. The project has financed a comprehensive household income and
       expenditure survey, data analysis and development of a Poverty Reduction Strategy. It also
       provided extensive capacity building to the Government in support of the data collection, data
       analysis and strategy development.

       Social Protection Project, (US$8 million; FY06), which aims to strengthen the policy,
       management and administrative capacity in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the
       Ministry of Finance to develop, manage, and monitor pension and social safety net reforms.

       Proposed Pension Reform Implementation Support Technical Assistance: Improving Old-Age
       Income Security in Iraq (US$6 million; FY10), which is designed to support the Government to
       implement the provisions of the Unified Pension Law (Law 27/2006 as amended in December
       2007). The technical assistance also has medium-term objectives to support unification of the
       public and private pensions systems; and long-term objectives to support the Government to
       develop a long-term old-age income security strategy for Iraq with a focus on the expansion of
       social insurance coverage.

108.     In addition, the Bank is exploring with the Government potential technical assistance
support for Social Safety Nets implementation. Areas for potential TA support include: (i) improving
targeting of the poor and vulnerable; (ii) developing an integrated package of safety nets and social
assistance interventions; (iii) finalizing the draft Social Security Law; (iv) Enhancing institutional
capacity and improving SSN administration; (v) designing and implementing income support mechanisms
for the unemployed; and (vi) developing active labor market programs.

109.    IFC has also been active in Iraq. Since the inception of IFC's work in Iraq in 2003, IFC has
undertaken a range of investment and technical assistance activities. The primary focus of the program
has been to support for the financial sector, the construction sector, and small and medium enterprises



                                                  32
(SMEs).17 The Iraq Small Business and Finance facility (ISBFF) was approved by the IFC Board in
December 2003, and has been operational since mid-2004.18

110.     In addition, through PEP-MENA, IFC's advisory services since 2003 included: (i) training to
around 250 Iraqi bankers (ii) completing SME advisory support to INB in collaboration with Rabobank of
Holland, (iii) supporting, together with World Bank and UN-Habitat the development of a local land
development strategy and the construction industry sector; (iv) successfully implementing its SME
management training program, Business Edge; and (v) brought together key investors, government
leaders, donors, and the private sector.

111.    IFC will continue to support the development of the financial sector and banking capacity
building and restructuring in Iraq. In addition to enhancing SMEs access to finance as well as
supporting microfinance activities. IFC has been in continuous contact with Iraqi and foreign businesses
and project sponsors exploring opportunities in the country and many are poised and ready once the
investment environment improves.

E.       Analytical Underpinnings

112.    The proposed DPL is underpinned by a series of recently completed and ongoing analytical
and advisory tasks, programmatic technical assistance, and projects. The proposed policy actions
and outcomes are founded on a continuous engagement of the Bank in the three areas covered under the
proposed DPL, with a list of key analytical and advisory activities presented in Table 6.

113.     The ongoing assistance in public financial management initiated in 2005 underlined the
need for further fiscal consolidation and more efficient public spending in Iraq. The Bank has
gained insight in this area through both formal Economic and Sector Work (ESW) as well as through its
technical assistance program. A Public Expenditure and Institutional Assessment (PEIA) (2008) provides
an integrated assessment of PFM performance, highlighting the main impediments for efficient public
resource management, the impact of PFM weaknesses and prospects for reform planning and
implementation. Two prior actions for this operation are focused on improving the budget allocation
process. The PEIA highlighted the importance of rationalizing levels of public expenditure and
prioritizing sector resource allocations in order to reflect better the Government's policy priorities. To
this end, the Bank has been supporting the Ministry of Finance in developing a framework for a medium-
term budget strategy reflecting Government policy priorities and medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal
projections. A workshop was held with Bank support in May 2009 on the 2010-2012 Budget Strategy.
The National Poverty Reduction Strategy, which was informed by a Poverty Assessment (2009), will
further improve the alignment of budgetary allocations, particularly in the social sectors. The PEIA also
refers to the importance of exercising oversight of fiscal risk by ensuring that the national budget and
financial statements cover all the major revenue and expenditure programs of government and that full
reporting of the central government's financial relationships with sub-national government is essential to
maintaining fiscal discipline and accountability. A study on Sub-National Public Reform (2005) and an


17
   IFC committed US$115 million in three projects since 2003. IFC has 10 percent stake in Credit Bank (US$5 million), provided
US$12 million loan to Iraq National Bank (INB) to support SME lending, and committed US$99 million to support the
construction of the first private cement company in Suleimanya, Kurdistan.
18
   The facility has funding of US$83 million, comprising an investment component of US$68 million to provide funding to local
financial institutions for on-lending to micro and SMEs and a technical assistance component of US$15 million to create capacity
on the ground for MSME financing. Iraq National Bank (INB) was the first bank to be selected under the Facility.

                                                              33
ongoing policy note on Subnational Finance look at fiscal relations between national and subnational
units. A Public Expenditure Review is planned for FY11 to examine public expenditure policy issues.

114.     The PEIA also highlights the importance of transparency in government activities, which
encompasses making use-friendly financial information available to the public and Parliament as
well as employing a system of budget classification which permits meaningful analysis and
interpretation of that information. The prior action on the Chart of Accounts for DPL1 and the
indicative measures for the DPL2 represent milestones in achieving timely availability of information of
fiscal accounts and alignment of budget codification and the Chart of Accounts.

115.     Greater economy, efficiency and transparency in public expenditures will improve
prospects for fiscal sustainability. In 2005, the World Bank conducted an Operational Procurement
Review (OPR) of the public procurement system and provided recommendations to the Iraqi Government,
the World Bank, and the donors. The major issue facing public procurement in Iraq is the uncertainty of
public procurement laws and regulations and the scattered regulations that create opportunities for
corruption and substandard practices in public procurement, which will be difficult to prevent without a
clarification of the procurement legal framework first. Technical assistance activities were also held in
the context of the ITF-financed Second Multi-Sector Institutional Capacity Building Project. This
combination of AAA and TA have helped form the basis for the new procurement law that will constitute
a major improvement in public spending, and will make Iraq a leader in the region on this area.

116.     In the preparation of the Banking Sector Reform Project, the Bank supported the
Government in developing its Financial Sector Strategy Action Plan 2008-2012. This Action Plan
provided the main underpinning for identifying the priority areas for the financial sector reform
component of this DPL. It was based on the independent audits and full due diligence of the state-owned
commercial banks and the Central Bank of Iraq by Ernst and Young. The Terms of Reference for the
independent audits were prepared by the World Bank based on the FSAP approach. The key
recommendation from the audits and Action Plan was the institutional, operational and financial
restructuring of the two state-owned Banks. Four prior actions under this DPL were based on these
recommendations.

117.     The ongoing programmatic assistance on social protection both on the food ration system,
pension and social safety net reform identified the key priority areas for reform. There are three
main Bank supported analytical pieces for the gradual approach to rationalize the Public Distribution
System: (i) Considering the Future of the PDS (2005); (ii) Management of the PDS (2007); and (iii) a
Poverty and Social Impact Assessment of PDS reform options found in Annex 4, as well as a
programmatic series of workshops for PDS reform from 2007 to present. The reports found that the PDS
is effective in reaching the poor, but costly and inefficient, and provide recommendations on improving
the management of the PDS. The reform areas in the DPL matrix reflect the fact that this is a sensitive,
yet needed reform, given the unsustainability and inefficiency of universal coverage.

118.     The social protection reform underpinnings are embodied in a number of Bank-supported
activities. They include the technical assistance of the Emergency Social Protection Project, a policy note
on social protection, covering safety net, labor market and pension issues, together with a series of policy
workshops, a World Bank policy note ("Pensions in Iraq: Improving Financial Sustainability, Efficiency
and Equity in the Iraqi Pension System: A Concept for Reform") (2006), and an ITF-funded Pension
Reform TA project that is expected to be approved shortly. Key findings were that the existing
information base is insufficient to design social safety nets and pension systems as these require detailed


                                                    34
information on program costs and beneficiaries, that cash based safety nets have been small and not well-
targeted to the poorest and the current pension system is financially unsustainable, benefit formulas and
eligibility conditions do not respect basic norms in terms of design and coverage is limited. This
operation supports the next step in each of these reform areas.

F.        Lessons Learned

119.   As an input to the recent ISN, the Bank carried out a stocktaking of the Bank Group
engagement with Iraq over the past five years. The goal of the stocktaking exercise was to identify the
key bottlenecks for the implementation of the Bank's program in Iraq and extract lessons for future
engagement.

120.     The Bank's initial engagement with Iraq had been in the areas of emergency
reconstruction, capacity building projects, technical assistance and analytical work, though in line
with post-conflict environments, there is a gradual shift to the medium- and long-term agenda,
notably public financial management and private sector development. Difficulties in the operating
environment have led to delays in many of the active projects reaching their development objectives,
although implementation is picking up some emergency reconstruction projects have already yielded
results. Some of this experience is relevant for the DPL. Operating environment issues that affect the
implementation of the Bank program include security; the policy and institutional environment; and
counterpart engagement. Issues and lessons learned pertinent for the DPL are outlined below.


                                                         35
121.      First, for planning purposes, it should be assumed that progress in the security situation
over the year life of the DPL would continue to be slow and incremental, with a risk of reversal due
to the political situation. Therefore risks should be mitigated and expectations kept realistic. Lack
of security affects Bank Group activities in a number of ways: (i) the safety of Iraqi officials and Iraqi
Bank staff is at constant risk, and their ability to move among various government offices and project
sites is extremely limited; (ii) Bank Group staffs ability to visit Iraq is constrained and when it is possible,
it tends to be limited to secured areas in Baghdad or with high levels of security arrangements or
Kurdistan, offering limited direct interaction with high officials; (iii) most large or lengthy missions and
interactions with Iraqi counterparts are held outside the country. As the DPL is a transfer of funds and
policy dialogue, the security situation is less of a constraint for this operation than for investments which
require movement of goods, contracting workers, and visits to project sites. Policy dialogue is taking
place for each of the DPL areas through the technical assistance projects, from which the DPL will
benefit. The DPL has also been designed for Iraq's specific context with regard to the results that can
realistically be expected to be achieved. Prior actions include some process milestones which are
appropriate in Iraq's context, as they are critical to suit the needs of a modern developmental state.

122.     Second, despite the mixed results obtained thus far in terms of institution building in Iraq,
it continues to be an imperative for the Bank's engagement with Iraq, and its delivery should be
customized to Iraq's needs and the Bank's own ability to meet those needs. Iraq's policy and
institutional environment has not been conducive to a smooth implementation of the Bank Group's
assistance program. Main bottlenecks include: (i) weakened capacity of ministries and implementing
agencies as a result of the large-scale departure of talented professional staff; (ii) likewise, pre-existing
private capacity to a large extent eroded by the exodus of skilled professionals; (iii) lack of familiarity
with World Bank procedures; (iv) a decision-making process hampered by an atmosphere of uncertainty
and by a history of overly centralized processes; (v) lengthy procedural delays and inability or
unwillingness to delegate functions within ministries; and (vi) frequent changes in leadership leading to
turnover in government counterparts at all levels. As such the underpinning technical assistance projects
in each of the three DPL pillars are key.

123.     Third, interest and engagement on the part of ministries and implementing agencies should
be a criterion for Bank support. Counterpart engagement has been uneven across ministries and
implementing agencies. In addition, lack of qualified human resources combined with frequent changes in
ministry staff slow implementation and often setback progress. Government commitment exists in each
of the three DPL pillars as demonstrated by the active engagement in each of these areas.

124.    Fourth, additional flexibility is needed in the design and programming of Bank assistance,
in the scope for experimentation with alternative implementation arrangements. As the physical
investment projects encountered delays, this DPL will offer a new fast-disbursing approach which may be
more successful and pave the way for a more medium- to long-term engagement in Iraq.

125.   In addition to the Bank's stocktaking specific to the Iraq context, the 2009 Development
Policy Lending Retrospective19 indicates that programmatic DPLs have allowed the Bank to stay
aligned with country processes and respond more flexibly to changing country circumstances and
government priorities, and that this flexibility has been essential to strengthen ownership of
reforms supported by the Bank. The programmatic nature of this DPL is suitable for Iraq's changing

circumstances which require flexibility, particularly given upcoming elections and therefore ownership of
and commitment to the reform agenda.

V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

A.    Operation Description

126.     The choice of reform areas follows clear selection criteria. The reform package should
concentrate on areas which are priority for the Iraqi Government as well as for Bank support under the
Interim Strategy Note (ISN); where the Bank has a comparative advantage; and which could help mitigate
Iraq's fiscal and socio-economic vulnerability to sudden drops in its oil revenues.

127.     The proposed pillars of this DPL meet the selection criteria outlined above. The proposed
pillars are: (i) strengthening budget management and prioritization; (ii) reforming the financial sector; and
(iii) improving the efficiency of the social protection system. All three areas are clearly consistent with
the ISN themes (see Figure 5), support key aspects of the Government's reform program and reflect the
Bank's comparative advantage. They are underpinned by ongoing Bank-supported investment operations
as well as past, current or planned AAA work. In addition, and as discussed further below, reforms in
these areas can help mitigate some of the more extreme effects of oil dependence and revenue volatility.

128.      The fiscal sustainability goal provides a common thread for the three selected reform areas.
First, strengthening budget management and prioritization is critical to ensure aggregate fiscal discipline
and reduce waste and unproductive expenditures. Second, financial sector reform will help reduce the
direct budgetary burden of state-owned banks as well as the contingent liability they represent. A
functioning banking system is a necessary component of private sector development needed to diversify
the economy for non-oil growth. Third, a social protection system can only be truly efficient if it is
fiscally sustainable, which can be achieved through the rationalization of the costly and large Public
Distribution System and through pension reform.

129.     The program includes 11 prior actions for this proposed operation and 10 indicative
triggers for a successor DPL. This DPL contains a robust reform program that is appropriate to Iraq's
situation, and which complements the structural reform agenda under the IMF's proposed new SBA.
Under Iraq's circumstances, some process-oriented actions are crucial to paving the way for deeper
reforms and institution building (see subsection V.B). The proposed program will therefore prepare the
ground for even stronger policy reform actions as part of the Government's reform program. The prior
actions and indicative triggers are described in Box 4.

                                                       38
        improved targeting methods.
        The management and governance structure of the State Pension Fund (SPF), has been put in place
        through (i) approval of the executive regulations and by-laws of the SPF by Council of Ministers; (ii)
        appointment of the General Manager of the SPF by the Prime Minister; and (iii) appointment of the
        Board of Directors of the SPF by the Minister of Finance.
B) Indicative Triggers

        PDS.
        The National Board of Pensions has launched the actuarial policy analysis to assess the Unified
        Pension Law's fiscal sustainability.


130.   The prior actions and indicative triggers aim to support specific long-run policy objectives.
More specifically, each pillar of the proposed DPL supports long-run policy objectives as follows:

        Strengthening budget management and prioritization: (i) alignment of the budget with
        Government priorities; (ii) alignment of budgetary allocations with the PRS; (iii) establishment of
        a public procurement legislative and regulatory framework that achieves economy, efficiency,
        transparency and equal opportunities for the public expenditures; and (iv) a timely, accurate and
        informative financial reporting allowing for control and accountability as well as analysis.

        Reforming the financial sector: (i) institutional and operational restructuring of state-owned
        commercial banks; (ii) full adherence of the banking supervisory system to the Basel Core
        Principles for Effective Banking Supervision; and (iii) an efficient and effective financial
        transactions settlement system.

        Improving the efficiency of the social protection system: (i) improvement in the efficiency and
        effectiveness of the targeting of social safety nets, allowing for enhanced social impact, enhanced
        fiscal sustainability of the program, and reduced fiscal pressures on the budget; (ii) availability of
        package of social assistance interventions, informed by rigorous analysis of available data
        including the household survey and international experience; and (iii) provision of old-age
        income security to plan members by the pension schemes in a financially sustainable manner by
        offering adequate and affordable benefits.

B.      Policy Areas

A.1. Strengthening budget management and prioritization. 

131.    As noted in the ISN, the main policy challenge facing Iraq today is how to transform oil
wealth into public goods and services and create the conditions for a diversified economy. The
budget is the framework within which this transformation takes place. The budget reflects the
Government's policy priorities and its ability to deliver services. The budget process could be notionally
divided into two interwoven cycles - a policy cycle and a financial cycle. The first includes policy design,
planning, implementation, evaluation and review. The second includes financial planning, budget design,
approval and execution, auditing and reporting.


                                                       39
132.    This pillar aims to ensure that budgetary management and prioritization helps improve
fiscal sustainability while serving the long-term development needs of the Iraqi population. It
accomplishes this objective by identifying clear priorities for spending allocation, and by supporting
sustainability in aggregate spending levels and an efficient budget process. This pillar comprises two
areas, reflecting respectively the policy cycle and the financial cycle: (i) effectiveness of public
expenditures, in line with Iraq's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS); and (ii) public financial management
(PFM).

133.     While not directly addressed by this operation, revenue management issues are a key part
of overall budgetary management and thus of the Bank's policy dialogue with Iraq. Adequate
management of Iraq's revenues, particularly those from oil, is another key ingredient in achieving and
maintaining fiscal sustainability. The importance of oil revenue management is particularly critical in oil-
dependent economies such as Iraq and will be a key focus area for Bank's analytical and advisory
engagement going forward. The Bank has initiated work on a study on Intergovernmental Aspects of
Revenue Management in Iraq. This study will comprise one policy note on intergovernmental revenue
management and sharing catered to the Iraqi context; one policy note on non-oil taxation and assignments
showing positive examples of countries able to remobilize taxation over time; and one note on the
international experience of intergovernmental settings in managing post-commodity boom. In addition,
the Bank will launch work on the Fiscal Aspects of Oil Revenue Management in Iraq, possibly as part of
the Country Economic Memorandum. This work will focus primarily on tools and policies to manage oil
revenue volatility, including through an assessment of the relevance for Iraq of special fiscal institutions
such as oil funds and fiscal rules. The goal is to help avoid "boom and bust" cycles in public spending as
a result of oil revenue volatility.20 Furthermore, in collaboration with the IMF, the Bank plans to work
with the Government in the area of financial flows within the state-owned oil sector as part of the
upcoming Public Expenditure Review exercise. A Fiscal Sustainability Assessment (FSA) is planned to
be conducted in CY10 in collaboration with the IMF as part of the planned PER exercise.

134.     As noted in Section IV.D., the Bank is providing financial and technical assistance to Iraq
on public financial management and the development of a National Poverty Reduction Strategy
through two ITF-financed projects: the Public Financial Management (PFM) Reform project and
the Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction project. The PFM project aims to improve
allocation, execution, transparency and accountability in the mobilization and use of all public resources.
Cross-cutting reform of the PFM will be addressed by the reform of the national PFM system, through
strengthening budget formulation, execution and control, improving public financial reporting,
strengthening public procurement and developing capacity in PFM, both at the central and the
governorate levels. The project is supporting the implementation of the Government's Public Finance
Management Action Plan. The Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction project aims to
strengthen the ability of the Government to make informed policy decisions for poverty reduction,
employment generation and safety nets. The project has financed a comprehensive household income and
expenditure survey, data analysis and development of a Poverty Reduction Strategy. It also provided
extensive capacity building to the Government in support of the data collection, data analysis and strategy
development.




20
   The Bank's dialogue with Iraq on oil revenue management issues is expected to intensify in the near future. Limited
engagement in this area is the result of the political sensitivities associated with regional oil revenue sharing arrangements and
the absence of a federal hydrocarbons law, restricting the scope for the provision of Bank's inputs in this area.

                                                               40
Effectiveness of Public Spending in Line with the PRS

135.     Prior action 1: The Ministry of Finance has adopted a framework for medium term budget
strategy reflecting Government policy priorities and medium term macroeconomic and fiscal
projections. The objective of this prior action is to improve the budget's alignment with Government
priorities as a key to better budget implementation and, ultimately, service delivery. The budget is yet to
become a true fiscal expression of the Government's long-term policy priorities. Spending units often
build their budgets from the bottom-up, on the basis of long lists of poorly justified projects and with little
regard to fiscal limits. Additional efforts are needed to place the budget within the context of robust
medium term macro-economic analysis and fiscal framework. These shortcomings result in budgets
which fall short on both quality and credibility.

136.    The Government has established a framework for medium-term budgeting, including a
high level Government-wide Budget Strategy Committee. The Committee is tasked with developing a
medium-term fiscal framework, a multi-year budget strategy on the basis of Government priorities and
sector strategies. The Committee produced the budget strategy for 2010-2013 in May 2009 with
assistance from the World Bank. The Committee will continue its work in the upcoming 2011 budget
cycle and will aim to produce a budget strategy which is more in tune with Government Priorities and
Sector strategies. To this aim, the Committee will work towards closer harmonization with Government-
wide and sectoral policy setting and planning. This measure will be complemented by the issuance of
budget call circulars consistent with medium-term macroeconomic assumptions and fiscal forecasts.

137.    In February 2009, a Budget Strategy Committee for 2010-2012 was convened by the
Ministry of Finance. It included for the first time a broad cross section of stakeholders, including
spending and revenue generating units, the Central Bank, the Council of Ministers Secretariat and the
Finance Committee of the Council Ministers. Over two months the Committee, assisted by the World
Bank, UK DfID and US Treasury, systematically reviewed existing and pending government policy
documents such as the International Compact, the National Development Plan, Poverty Reduction
Strategy, sector strategies and ministerial plans. The Committee also reviewed macro-economic analyses
and fiscal projections carried out by the Ministries of Planning, Finance and Oil and the Central Bank.

138.    The Committee's work led to a workshop facilitated by the World Bank in May 23-24, 2009.
At the workshop, the various inputs were brought together to produce a Budget Strategy for 2010-2012
including a medium-term fiscal forecast and an Economic Essay. The workshop also discussed ways to
further strengthen budget process and issues of sub-national fiscal relations. The resulting Budget
Strategy was referred to a small Cabinet level committee which further sharpened its alignment with the
Government priorities. The Budget Call Circular was then issued on June 1, 2009 accompanied by the
Strategy, setting for the first time an overall expenditure envelope as well as individual Ministry ceilings.

139.   The resulting draft 2010 budget was submitted to the Council of Representatives on
October 4, 2009. For the first time, the draft budget was accompanied by an Economic Essay setting out
the Macroeconomic and fiscal context.

140.     Prior action 2: The National Poverty Reduction Strategy, which outlines public spending
priorities in the social sectors, has been adopted by the Council of Ministers. Public expenditures over
the past several decades have been poorly aligned with the long term development needs of the Iraqi
population. From the 1980s onward, public expenditures have been focused on the military and universal
consumption subsidies at the expense of the public services and infrastructure that would support
productive activities of the population. The Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) is crucial to identify clear

                                                      41
priorities for spending allocation. In particular, the PRS articulates a clear change in spending priorities
with an emphasis on enabling the poor to earn higher incomes from their labor, ultimately aiming at
achieving a private sector-led, diversified economy.

141.    The PRS is the culmination of an intense program of activities by the Government of Iraq,
supported by the World Bank.21 This program of activities had three major components, all overseen
by the Poverty Reduction Strategy High Committee.22 The first component responded to the absence of
information on the living standards of the population by conducting the first national income and
expenditure survey since 1988. The Iraq Household Socioeconomic Survey (IHSES) interviewed 18,000
in all parts of the country over a 12 month period, providing detailed indicators on employment,
education, health, demographics as well as income and expenditures.23 The second component of the
program established an official poverty line and analyzed the causes and consequences of poverty. 24
Among other things, the analysis found that Iraq has the lowest employment-to-population ratio in the
region. The third and final component of the program was the development of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy itself. The PRS was developed using a Results-Based-Management approach and was firmly
grounded in the poverty analysis.25

142.     The PRS outlines the key public expenditure priorities needed to enable the poor to develop
human capital and to generate income. The strategy also outlines the reforms needed to provide a
fiscally sustainable safety net for those who are unable to work.26 At their November 24, 2009 meeting,
the Council of Ministers formally adopted the Poverty Reduction Strategy and committed to its
implementation. The prior action for this DPL ­ adoption of the Poverty Reduction Strategy by the
Council of Ministers ­ will lead to the alignment between the priorities and the budget allocations.
Already, the draft 2010 budget, with an increased share going to development of human capital, reflects a
step in this direction. Progress on budget alignment will be monitored through annual PRS reports,
prepared by a permanent institutional mechanism established for this purpose.27 The World Bank will

21
   The World Bank has been supporting the prioritization of public expenditures to serve the long term development needs of the
Iraqi population through the Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction project (HSPR). The HSPR
project is comprised of two companion trust funds, financed by the Iraq Trust Fund: one government-executed and one Bank-
executed. The Bank-executed component provided an intensive program of capacity building for the three components,
including 44 workshops between 2006 and 2009. Prior to the signing of the grant agreement for the HSPR project an additional 9
workshops were held with support from the ITF-financed Second Capacity Building project.
22
   The Poverty Reduction Strategy High Committee represents a broad range of Iraqi institutions including Parliament, the Prime
Minister's office, key development ministries, the Kurdistan Regional Government and Iraq academia.
23
   In addition, the IHSES also provided the basis for a new Consumer Price Index and measures used in the National Accounts.
24
   The poverty line, developed by the PRS High Committee was adopted by the Council of Ministers in April, 2009. Using this
poverty line, the analysis found that 23 percent of the population is poor, although most of these have consumption levels close to
the poverty line. The Poverty Assessment also analyzed access to public services (e.g. education, health care, water and
sanitation, electricity, agricultural infrastructure and safety nets) among various segments of the population. The poverty analysis
culminated in a Poverty Assessment report, written jointly by the Poverty Reduction High Committee and the World Bank.
25
   The PRS benefitted from consultations with Iraqi and international stakeholders. In June 2009, the PRS High Committee held
consultations with ministries, civil society, and the Iraqi private sector as well as the UN and several bilateral donors.
Approximately, 120 people participated in the two-day event.
26
   The Poverty Reduction Strategy is comprised of six major outcomes: a higher income from work for the poor; improved health
level of the poor; improved education level for the poor; better housing environment for the poor; effective social protection for
the poor; and reduced inequality between poor men and women. Within each outcome, the PRS specifies outputs, the
Governmental ministry of agency accountable for accomplishing each output, and activities. A matrix of the PRS outcomes,
outputs and activities is attached as an appendix.
27
   The Council of Ministers, in their endorsement of the PRS, formed a High Steering Committee, chaired by the Deputy Prime
Minister and comprised of the Ministers of Finance, Planning, Trade, Agriculture, Labor and Social Affairs, Education, Health,
Reconstruction and Housing, and Women's Affairs. They also made the PRS High Committee a permanent body, to serve as the
secretariat of the High Steering Committee. The strategy adopted in November is for the period 2010 to 2014 at which point a

                                                                42
continue to provide technical assistance for the implementation and monitoring of the PRS through the
Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction Project.

Public Financial Management

143.     Prior action 3: The Shura Council has completed the review of the new procurement law in
order to submit the bill to the Council of Ministers. The submission process for presenting procurement
legislation to the Shura Council at the Ministry of Justice was launched in late 2008. Despite the
extremely difficult circumstances and the bombings that targeted the Ministry of Justice, the Shura
Council completed the review of the draft new law in November 2009. The new draft law will be
submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval. Subject to the Council of Ministers' vetting, the new
draft law will be presented to the Council of Representatives for a decision on enactment.

144.    Prior action 4: The Ministry of Finance has issued a decree establishing a High Level
Committee to develop the Manual for implementing the Chart of Accounts. The goal of this prior
action is to ensure timely, accurate and informative financial reporting allowing for control,
accountability and analysis. Iraq's legacy accounting framework is a hybrid of cash and accrual rules.
The largely administrative classification is excessively detailed making it less conducive to analysis and
monitoring. This is particularly the case for investments.

145.     A new Chart of Accounts was introduced in 2007 on the basis of Government Financial
Statistic (GFS) classification. Work to implement the Chart throughout public finances is ongoing.
During the transition both the legacy and the new system continue to coexist with some agencies most
notably the Supreme Board of Audit resisting the introduction of the GFS. As a result of these
deficiencies, it has been difficult to ascertain on a timely and accurate basis the state of execution of the
investment budget, as well as the level of outstanding commitments and cash balances. There have been
significant delays in the production of final audited financial statements for the central government.
These issues not only hamper accountability and control but they also frustrate efforts to improve budget
execution by denying decision-makers access to actionable data.

146.    A decree was issued by the Ministry of Finance on October 10, 2009 establishing a High
Level Committee to develop the Manual for the implementation of the Chart of Accounts. The
Committee is chaired by an official from the Council of Minister's Secretariat and includes
representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Planning, Board of Supreme Board of Audit and spending
units. The Committee is meeting regularly to prepare the Accounting Manual with support from the
World Bank, IMF, DfID and U.S. Treasury. The most recent meeting was held in Beirut during October
17-24, 2009.

147.     The adoption of the Chart of Accounts will facilitate the introduction of commitment
control and cash release systems and the gradual transition to a Single Treasury Account,
envisioned under the PFMAP. It is also a precondition for progress on the delayed Financial
Management Information System. Clarifying and codifying the new Chart of Accounts and its rollout
will also require capacity building to for both controllers and auditors.




new strategy will come into effect. In parallel with the PRS, the Government has been developing a National Development Plan,
which focuses on investment over the coming five years. The two processes have been carefully coordinated with overlapping
membership on the High Committees.

                                                             43
A.2. Reforming the financial sector

148.     This operation supports the Government of Iraq in implementing Phase I of the financial
sector reform agenda, which focuses on restructuring the state-owned commercial banks,
strengthening the regulatory and supervisory authority, and improving the financial institutional
infrastructure. These reforms aim to improving the performance of the financial sector, thereby helping
Iraq develop private sector-led growth beyond the hydrocarbons sector, ultimately reducing its
dependence on oil revenues. It comprises four policy areas: (i) financial restructuring of the Rasheed
Bank and Rafidain Banks, improving their portfolio quality; (ii) institutional and operational restructuring
of state-owned commercial banks; (iii) strengthening the supervisory and regulatory authority of the
Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) to ensure full adherence to the Basel Core Principles; and (iv) operationalizing
the real time gross settlement (RTGS) payments system, complying with international standards.

149.     The Bank has supported the Government in implementing banking sector reforms since
2004, through policy dialogue, analytical work, advisory services and technical assistance. Together
with the IMF, the Bank assisted the Government in the design of the terms of reference for the
independent audits of the two state-owned commercial banks--Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank by an
internationally reputable firm, Ernst and Young (E&Y), which was carried out and finalized in 2008.28
Based on these audits and comprehensive due diligence, the Bank supported the Government of Iraq in
developing the five-year Banking Reform Strategy (2008-2012), which was discussed in the previous
section. This program addresses financial sector weaknesses with the objective of increasing private
sector participation, promoting diversification of intermediaries and instruments, and strengthening the
environment for resource mobilization, financial intermediation and risk management.

Restructuring the State-Owned Commercial Banks

150.     Prior Action 5: Settlement of at least 20 percent of non-performing loans (NPLs) held by
Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank as of June 2007. All the state-owned commercial banks were subject
to independent financial due diligences as a prerequisite for financial restructuring. This due diligence
focused on bank portfolio quality and on the analysis of distressed assets on a stand-alone and
consolidated basis, and following International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An assessment of
the loan portfolio in the two state-owned commercial banks showed NPLs of ID 209 billion and ID 139
billion for Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank respectively. Following the recommendations of the audits,
the Ministry of Finance, the owner of the state-owned banks, took the decision to clean-up the balance
sheets of these banks. The objective of the financial restructuring of these banks is to restore their ability
to comply with minimum capital adequacy and other prudential requirements of CBI, and to restore their
full credibility with their business counterparts.

151.    Various steps were taken by the authorities to tackle the NPL issue. A Financial
Restructuring Committee has been formed to address the problem of NPLs. Decisions have been made
with regard to the resolution of many NPLs. It is worth noting that recapitalization needs arising from
NPLs are relatively modest despite the high share of NPLs (56 percent in value terms), because both
banks' loan portfolios are very small. Over the past year, progress has been witnessed in the
implementation of the audit recommendations, particularly regarding reduction of NPLs, and build-up in
provision levels at state-owned commercial banks. This has been evident in the decline of NPLs by 20
percent on aggregate as of June 2007 (financial statements audited were those of 2007) in both banks,
Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank to reach ID 165 billion and ID 110 billion respectively in December
28
     Based on the 2007 financial accounts.

                                                     44
2009. The Bank will monitor the process of recapitalization with the evolution of the capital adequacy
ratio.

152.     The Government has decided that the banks need to sort out and reconcile assets and
liability accounts, before they receive any new capital. The state-owned banks have already begun the
verification of their obligations toward foreign creditors under the Paris Club and the discussion of other,
related issues with the Ministry of Finance. Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank are making appropriate
accounting adjustments to their books. Such adjustments will be verified for accuracy by qualified,
independent, external auditors. The necessary recapitalization will then go hand-in-hand with the
progress on the operational restructuring. The settlement process of outstanding private claims as part of
the liquidation of the London branch of Rafidain Bank is well underway and the process to liquidate fixed
assets has begun and expected to conclude by end of 2009. The Government is well aware of the need to
balance the objective of compliance with regulations and the risks of recapitalizing banks where
operational and risk management processes are still being improved.

153.    Prior Action 6: The Restructuring Oversight Committee (ROC29) has endorsed the Banking
Sector Reform Strategy and the Action Plan for the operational and institutional restructuring of the
two state-owned commercial banks--Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank. One of the key measures this
operation supports is the institutional and operational restructuring of the two state-owned commercial
banks. The Bank has been providing technical support and guidance to the Iraqi authorities for the
development of a comprehensive, action-specific for banking sector reform, which was endorsed by the
Iraqi Authorities in February 2009. The strategy includes a detailed Action Plan, and is divided into two
phases, identifying key starting points for various activities with clear timeline and benchmarks. As a
result of the implementation of this comprehensive strategy, the state-owned commercial banks would
adopt modern banking practices and systems. Implementation of the strategy will entail defining, in light
of country circumstances, the mandate of the state-owned commercial banks with an initial focus on
mobilization of savings and payments. Thus, the banks' activities are likely to be narrowly limited on
deposit taking and payment transactions. As their capacity increases, they will move into other core
banking operations including the extension of credit to the corporate and household sectors.

154.     The restructuring program also includes capacity building, aimed at developing the
capacity of banks' branch staff to be able to handle basic deposit-taking transactions, using
computers, and loan officers' capacity to assess credit risks. Another key element of this reform
process is the development of risk management, including: support to the establishment of a well-
functioning, adequately managed and completely staffed risk management organization in line with
international and regional best practices; changes in the organizational structure, especially the set up of a
risk control department; and development of manuals for risk management. There have also been some
developments in the implementation of the banking reform program. Considerable progress has taken
place in the institutional, operational and financial restructuring of the two state-owned banks--Rasheed
Bank and Rafidain Bank.


29
  The Restructuring Oversight Committee (ROC) is in charge of the restructuring and reinforcing of reforms in the banking
sector in Iraq, as well as designing the strategy and setting the vision for a sound and inclusive financial system. This is a high-
level decision making body that is chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), in his capacity as the regulator and
supervisor; comprising the Minister of Finance, in his capacity as the owner; and the Chairman of the Board of Supreme Audit.
The main priority on their reform agenda over the past few years was the restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks. Key
decisions made by ROC are transmitted through the Executive Steering Committee (ESC), which is in charge of the day-to-day
implementation of the restructuring program. ESC is chaired by the Deputy Governor of CBI, and comprising high-level
representatives from the Ministry of Finance, and the Board of Supreme Audit; as well as two CBI technical experts.

                                                                45
Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Authority

155.     Prior Action 7: CBI has approved its new organizational chart and a detailed program for
capacity building in banking regulation and supervision. This prior action aims to support continued
strengthening of legal, regulatory and supervisory capacity in banking. CBI needs to implement the
corrective actions required to close the gap between existing practices at CBI and international accepted
best practices. Under the Banking Sector Reform project, the Bank is supporting capacity building for
CBI to enhance its supervisory and regulatory functions. Support includes reviewing the existing banking
supervision process, assessing the effectiveness of CBI's supervisory apparatus to the adherence to
international codes and standards, and preparing a detailed action plan to address any deficiency, gaps and
needs in coordination with the IMF. Capacity building and training of the staff of the supervision
department at CBI would also include setting up the underpinnings of a strengthened regulatory and
supervisory framework, focusing on on-site and off-site processes. CBI is currently working on carrying
out an in-depth assessment of banking supervision authority, with the support of the World Bank, IMF,
and US.

156.     The first phase of capacity building for a strengthened supervisory framework, which
started in June 2006, is well under way and focused inter alia on developing and implementing
appropriate supervisory tools and methodologies to implement the move from compliance to a
more proactive and modern risk-based supervision. On-Site Inspection is focusing on risks. Increased
attention has been directed to credit organization and policy, concentration of credit, risk management
system, IT system and internal controls. As a result, a new assessment approach for on-site supervision
has been developed with inspection teams updating the On-going Surveillance database with the data
collected in the field. Once in effect, this type of feedback will help strengthen and improve the On-
Going Surveillance reports credit institutions along a CAMELS (Capital Assets Management Earnings
Liquidity Sensitivity) based approach. Finally, a closer cooperation between On-Site and On-Going
Surveillance has been taking place, especially regarding the elaboration of the corrective actions.

157.     The On-Going Surveillance framework has developed new tools to help focus on critical
issues for an enhanced decision making process. A draft risk-oriented report regarding the strategy and
the overall performance of a credit institution has recently been issued to the top management of the CBI.
This report produced, on the basis of the CAMELS-type approach, constitutes a comprehensive review of
the banks. Produced on an annual basis, these reports will cover all risks inherent in the bank's activities,
including both quantitative and qualitative information. In a nutshell, this annual report is designed to
convey the banks' overall risk profile. The On-Going Surveillance new framework could, in the long run,
help the CBI develop an Early Warning System enabling an adequate, proactive framework to deal with
problem banks. In particular, it should help the CBI in determining the levels of capital ratios as well as
best suited remedial measures to address particular events or risk profile of credit institutions.

Improving the Financial Institutional Infrastructure

158.     Prior Action 8: CBI has introduced a real time gross settlement (RTGS) payments system
complying with international standards. A key pillar of financial sector reform in Iraq is improving the
financial institutional infrastructure. The structure and efficiency of the banking and financial system is
greatly shaped by the nature of its institutional infrastructure, which includes information exchange setup;
payments system; financial reporting; and accounting standards. Although the Iraqi authorities are
making efforts to improve the institutional framework, there still remain large gaps. Moreover, much of
what is there remains untested and not all of it is conducive to easy access to financial services. An


                                                     46
adequate and supportive institutional infrastructure is essential. The CBI is leading efforts to create a
modern payments-systems infrastructure covering systems operations, policies and regulations, and
payment-system oversight. The implementation of the RTGS system would reduce the total processing
time of checks inside CBI significantly. The state-owned commercial banks are currently working on the
introduction of the RTGS system in the Iraqi market, in collaboration with development partners.

A.3. Improving the efficiency of the social protection system

159.     The recent Council of Ministers' decision regarding expenditure prioritization reflects a key
shift from an emphasis on subsidizing consumption towards enabling the population to earn higher
incomes from their labor, in the context of a private sector-led, diversified economy. At the same
time, the Government of Iraq recognizes that there are some segments of the population that are unable to
earn even a minimal income from their labor ­ due to disability, temporary unemployment, old age or
other reasons. Acknowledging this reality means that a system of social protection is an essential part of
the expenditure strategy.

160.    This pillar of the DPL program would help the Government of Iraq move towards a more
efficient and fiscally sustainable social protection system as well as better mitigating the impacts of
fluctuations in oil revenues. It comprises three areas of social protection: rationalization of the PDS,
strengthening of the Social Safety Net (SSN), and strengthening the retirement pension system.

Rationalization of the PDS

161.     Prior action 9: The Council of Ministers Secretariat has established a High Committee
mandated to propose a time-bound action plan for rationalization of the Public Distribution System
(PDS). Currently, the Iraqi safety net is comprised of two major programs. By far the larger of these
programs is the Public Distribution System, which provides a fixed basket of commodities to nearly every
Iraqi citizen on a monthly basis. 30 The PDS is a very large program ­ absorbing 8 percent of total
Government spending in 2008 (compared to 6.2 percent spent on education or the 4.7 percent spent on
health in the same year). It provides 85 percent of required calories and reaches 99 percent of the
population. Although effective as a safety net, the PDS is enormously inefficient. Three aspects of
inefficiency are particularly noteworthy: (i) the PDS is provided to wealthy households as well as poor
households; (ii) management of the PDS is rudimentary, making it vulnerable to waste, theft and
corruption; and (iii) the PDS's heavy reliance on state-owned-enterprises and non-competitive
procurement 31 crowds out the private sector and reduces the gains in efficiency associated with
competition.32 The second, and smaller of the two safety nets is a cash transfer program managed by the
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA), referred to as the Social Safety Net (SSN). The SSN
provides beneficiaries with transfers about the same size as the PDS. However, it reaches a much smaller


30
   The PDS was introduced in 1991 in response to the declining availability of food imports under the UN sanctions and played a
crucial role during that period, helping to avoid a humanitarian crisis.
31
   The Ministry of Trade operates the PDS in close co-operation with three principal State-Owned-Enterprises: the State
Company for Grain Trading, the State Company for Grain Processing, and the State Company for Foodstuff Trading. In addition
the Ministry of Transport supports distribution through the State Transport Company. Procurement practices lack transparency
and do not ensure value for money, and contribute substantially to delays and prices that are considerably above world market
prices.
32
   Preliminary calculations suggest that it costs more than $6 to transfer $1 worth of benefits to a poor person. Analysis of the
inefficiency due to lack of targeting was conducted by the World Bank and Food Ration Reform High Committee. A summary
of this analysis is presented in Annex 4.

                                                              47
portion of the population. The reforms related to this program will be elaborated in the next prior action
below.

162.    Although the problems with the PDS have been acknowledged for several years, until very
recently there was no agreement on the segment of the population to be targeted and the
information needed to perform targeting or assess the quality of targeting was not available.33
Significant progress has been made over the past three years on both of these constraints, with support
from the World Bank and other donor institutions, and the prerequisites for reform are now in place. The
Iraq Household Socioeconomic Survey, conducted in 2007, provided the data needed to define a poverty
line and to assess the quality of targeting of existing programs. An official poverty line was developed by
the Poverty Reduction Strategy High Committee and adopted by the Council of Ministers in April, 2009.
In June 2009, a High Committee was formed by official decree, mandated to propose a time-bound action
plan for the rationalization of the PDS.34 With support by the World Bank, the Food Ration Reform High
Committee has developed a set of recommendations for gradually introduce targeting (including
exclusion criteria for each phase); a reduced number of products to be included in the basket; and
improvements in the management of the PDS.

163.     A crucial achievement was made on November 24, 2009 when the Council of Ministers
made two major policy decisions related to the PDS and the SSN. The first major policy decision was
that the PDS would no longer be provided to the entire population, but rather would be available for a
limited segment of the Iraqi people, implying a substantial reduction in the budgetary allocation required
by the PDS once the reform is fully implemented. The second major policy decision was that targeting of
the PDS and SSN would be aligned with the official poverty line through the development of an improved
targeting tool to identify the poor This achievement was the result of the work of two Iraqi High
Committees working in parallel but with close coordination: the Poverty Reduction Strategy High
Committee (see prior action 2) and the Food Ration Reform High Committee.

164.    The establishment of the Food Ration Reform High Committee is included as prior action
in this DPL because it is an essential step towards a more effective, efficient and fiscally sustainable
system of safety net programs. In the shorter term, the DPL will support the following two program
outcomes: First, rationalization of PDS will be initiated through elimination of high income civil servants
(as well as other high income groups), from PDS eligibility. Second, a public information campaign will
be launched to announce PDS targeting and explain the process and timeline for this transition.35



33
   Because of the large size of the transfers and the dominance the PDS has in the market for relevant commodities, a sudden
withdrawal of the PDS would result in a large increase in poverty as a result of both the direct elimination of transfers and as a
result of the increases in prices as the supply is shrunk. (See analysis in Annex 4). Any reform of the PDS, therefore, must be
done gradually and carefully monitored. In addition to the absence of agreement within the Government on a reform direction
and the lack of data needed for targeting, until recently the security situation and soaring public revenues made any reduction in
benefits politically difficult.
34
   The Food Ration Reform High Committee is chaired by the Secretary General of the Council of Ministers and includes
Undersecretaries from the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Trade, Labor and Social Affairs, Deputy Governors of Baghdad, Al
Anbar and Babil, representatives from the Kurdistan Regional Government and Iraqi Parliamentarians.
35
   The Food Ration Reform High Committee has already drafted a time bound action plan for targeting. This action plan starts by
excluding high income civil servants (as well as specific categories of other high income individuals working in the private
sector) from PDS eligibility. Although the fiscal impact of the first step in targeting will be relatively small, it provides an
opportunity to explain the concept of targeting to the general population through a public information campaign, demonstrating
that government officials are willing to be the first to forgo the food ration benefits. World Bank technical assistance will include
support for the targeting of the PDS and for the development of public information campaigns.

                                                                48
Strengthening the Social Safety Net

165.     Prior Action 10: The Council of Ministers has endorsed a policy of reforming the Social
Safety Net through improved targeting methods. The objective of this policy action is to enhance the
Social Safety Net program operated by MOLSA through better targeting of poor and vulnerable
households. As the envisaged rationalization of the PDS moves forward, the Social Safety Net program
will need to be more effective and efficient in targeting poor and vulnerable households. This will mean
shifting the method of targeting gradually away from the current categorical targeting of certain groups, to
a more robust method that minimizes leakage and exclusion of the poor from the program. Methods of
targeting that are based on proxy-means testing (PMT) will be explored. Objective tools such as PMT
employ observable household indictors (such as household assets, socio-economic characteristics, and
housing characteristics) to predict income levels; which can also be combined with geographic targeting
(this method bases targeting on where the household lives). The current categorical targeting that is used
by the Social Safety Net program reaches less than 10 percent of the poor. Furthermore, there are poor
governorates like Muthana with nearly 50 percent of its population below the poverty line but where only
3 percent of the households receive the cash transfer. There are enormous benefits to improving the
targeting of the program and this prior action is the first important step towards making the Social Safety
Net program more effective.

166.     MOLSA has also made progress in increasing its capacity to manage the Social Safety Net
program. Through the ongoing Emergency Social Protection Project (ESPP), financed by the Iraq Trust
Fund, and through support from USAID, MOLSA has been undertaking capacity building in two key
areas: (i) Developing human resources to manage the Social Safety Net program; and (ii) building the
systems needed to capture beneficiaries in a database and to streamline the application process through
the use of information systems. MOLSA staff have received extensive training in administrative,
managerial, and technical areas related to the Social Safety Net program, either from the ESPP or from
USAID. In addition, MOLSA has established the infrastructure to support application processing in all
governorates, as well as to facilitate the approval and decision making process. Finally, the cash delivery
mechanism is also currently served through local post offices, and a pilot using smartcards for payment is
underway. The National Social Safety Net information system, which is designed to electronically
capture beneficiary information, was launched by the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs in end-May
2009.

167.     In the medium term, MOLSA will develop the new targeting tools, using data from the
household survey, and to pilot both the tool and the full implementation process. With the policy
decision made to enhance the Social Safety Net program through improved targeting methods, the next
steps are for MOLSA to continue the process of capacity building and systems improvements, and to
move towards building the new and improved targeting tool (which may include a combination of proxy-
means testing and geographical targeting tools as indicated earlier). The process will proceed along two
stages. Stage 1 will design the targeting tools and prepare for the pilot; and Stage 2 will pilot and
calibrate the new mechanism, to test the application and benefit distribution, and to evaluate the poverty
impact of the new targeting tools. The World Bank, through ongoing and proposed projects, will provide
support to MOLSA throughout this process.

 Strengthening the Retirement Pension System

168.   Prior Action 11. The management and governance structure of the State Pension Fund (SPF)
has been put in place through (i) approval of the executive regulations and by-laws of the SPF by
Council of Ministers; (ii) appointment of the General Manager of the SPF by the Prime Minister; and

                                                    49
(iii) appointment of the Board of Directors of the SPF by the Minister of Finance. The objective of this
policy action to have the structures needed to manage the pension contributions of the SPF. The State
Pension Fund is the administrative unit within the unifying umbrella of the National Board of Pensions
(NBP) which will receive all collected pension contribution, and is the source of payment for pension
benefits. The SPF has been accumulating reserves since the enactment of the Unified Pension Law. The
establishment of the management and governance structure will allow the SPF to be administered
effectively, moving towards prudent management and investment of the accumulated reserves in the fund,
while maintaining the ability to adequately meet future liabilities of the pension system.

169.    The Unified Pension Law was enacted in December 2007 to modernize the pension system
in Iraq and bring it in alignment with international best practices, and implementation of the law
has commenced. In particular, the NBP has been established as the unifying body of the mandatory
pension schemes, and the Chairman of the NBP appointed. The NBP absorbs the Pension Directorate of
the Ministry of Finance, which used to administer the old State Pension System. Furthermore, the Unified
Pension Law requires that the existing Social Security System and the private sector pension scheme, to
be transferred under the authority of the NBP. The envisioned merger is desirable as much as it alleviates
the segmentation of the labor market along the public/private divide. A Pension Reform Management
Office has been established under the NBP and is charged with coordinating the implementation of
pension reforms.

170.     In the medium-term, the NBP is expected to initiate the data collection for the actuarial
analysis of the public pension scheme. The actuarial analysis is prescribed in the law, and is required to
(i) assess the fiscal sustainability of the SPF; (ii) initiate policy measures, if required, to achieve financial
equilibrium for the fund. In addition, the NBP will continue to develop the pension administration
processes and systems, as well as develop the investment management policies of the SPF through
support from the World Bank PRISTA project.

C.      Program Features, Loan Amount and Tranching

171.     This proposed DPL is the first of a programmatic series of two DPLs of US$250 million each,
totaling US$500 million. The loan will be denominated in US dollars at a fixed spread with a total
repayment term including grace period of 15 years (with a grace period of 4.5 years). The Front-End Fee
would be financed out of the loan proceeds (capitalized).

VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.      Consultations and Distributional Aspects

172.    In line with OP 8.60, the Bank advised the Iraqi authorities on the need to undertake
consultations on the reform program with the various stakeholders, such as Parliamentarians,
private sector, and civil society. The authorities confirmed that the Iraqi Government been conducting
consultations over the last year with the various stakeholders, and that they will be providing the Bank
team with all the supporting documentation in that regard. They also indicated that further consultations
on the reform program underpinning this proposed operation will take place in the coming period. The
Bank has also highlighted to the Iraqi authorities the importance of the consultation and participation
process, which is key to sustainability, and enhancing the program's development outcomes. The
Government intends to conduct further consultations with key stakeholders on the reform program
underlying this DPL, in line with OP 8.60 and MNA Region's Management Action Plan, and Region's


                                                       50
policy and practices for stakeholders' participation, including through disclosure, translation of program
documents, and outreach.

173.    A consultation meeting with the donor community on the DPL was organized by the
Ministry of Finance in Baghdad in October 2009. The meeting was chaired by the Ministry of
Finance, and was attended by Representatives from the United States, Japan, Italy, United Kingdom,
Denmark, Australia, United Nations, European Commission, and World Bank. Overall, there was strong
donor support for a substantial budget support to Iraq through the proposed DPL. The donors stressed the
need for additional World Bank financing above and beyond the US$500 million envelope provided for
investment lending under the Interim Strategy Note (ISN). They welcomed the proposed prior-action
reforms of the DPL, particularly in the area of public finance management (PFM). The Government
intends to hold further consultations specific to the program supported by this DPL, with civil society
groups.

174.   Consultations on key aspects of Iraq's reform program supported by the Bank were
conducted with key stakeholders throughout the process of preparing the ISN for Iraq for 2009-
2011. The ISN consultations were held with civil society and private sector representatives, the donor
community, and Government officials, including representatives of line ministries and the High
Committee for Poverty Reduction. The content of this DPL is fully aligned with the ISN.

175.     Whereas PRSs which are used for debt relief are required to hold consultations, the Iraq
PRS was undertaken at the Government's initiative and had no such requirements ­ nonetheless,
the PRSHC held consultations on the proposed strategy. The PRS was developed with the intense and
active participation of the High Committee representatives from the Prime Minister's office, the
Ministries of Planning, Finance, Education, Health, Trade, Women's Affairs, Justice, Labor and Social
Affairs, the Kurdistan Regional Government, Parliament and academia. The entire PRS High Committee
participated in a series of 13 workshops in addition to numerous meetings in Baghdad. In June 2009, the
PRSHC held consultations with other ministries, civil society, and the Iraqi private sector as well as the
UN and several bilateral donors. Approximately 120 people participated in the two day event.

176.    The Bank has been informed that Trade Unions were consulted by the Government for the
revised Unified Pension Law. The Bank had discussions with Iraqi Trade Unions in September 2009
during which the unions raised concerns over social protection and pensions. Though this discussion was
not specific to the DPL instrument, the Bank has the beginnings of a dialogue with the unions, and has
encouraged the Government to consult with them and other civil society stakeholders on the reform
agenda. During supervision of this operation, we will also encourage government to consult with civil
society groups on key policy reforms.

177.    It should be stressed that it is considerably more difficult than the typical country context to
consult with organized groups on policy reform in Iraq given its conflict-affected status. This is due
to the nascent organization of civil society and other stakeholder groups, as well as difficulty in
movement and conducting large group meetings in Iraq given the current security situation.

178.     Going forward, Iraq will continue with the process of reconstructing both physically and
institutionally after years of wars, sanctions and mismanagement. The experience with regards to
conflict-affected countries shows that economic recovery ­ especially employment ­ is a key factor in
avoiding recurrence of conflict. The literature also shows that capacity to do reconstruction develops
gradually such that governments are able to make best use of reconstruction financing only several years
after the end of the conflict. The lesson here is that Iraq is only now hitting its stride in terms of capacity

                                                      51
and its ability to make good use of financing and that halting its reconstruction could contribute to
political instability. The literature also shows that the post-conflict environment often provides a key
opportunity not only for physical reconstruction but also policy reform.

179.    In addition to consultation issues, it should be noted that the following social welfare and
distributional considerations are of particular relevance to the present loan36:

            Pillar 1: Iraq is resource-rich country, and the population can enjoy the full benefits of those
            resources with an improved public financial management. The Government is working on better
            prioritization of its spending through improvement in of information collection and enhancing its
            capacity to plan. In the education sector, for example, there have been efforts to reduce
            disparities in resource allocation among the governorates, through the increase in investments in
            these areas. Moreover, inadequate procurement, cash management and control and accounting
            systems have left public resources vulnerable to waste, theft and corruption, detracting from the
            Government's ability to deliver services to the population. Improved effectiveness of public
            expenditures in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy, and improved management and
            transparency will mean that more resources get to benefit the people.

            Pillar 2: There is a large body of research showing that a well-functioning financial system is
            linked to growth and poverty reduction. The population lacks access to finance. Although the
            volume of bank lending is growing, it is very low. Domestic credit is only 2.6 percent of GDP.
            Private sector investment is nearly all from personal savings and credit to the private sector is
            largely through translations among individuals. The population is therefore expected to benefit
            directly from the financial system reforms. Given that Iraq's financial system is dominated by
            state-owned banks, these reforms would also help reduce the budgetary drain that these loss-
            making banks currently generate, potentially creating fiscal savings for more productive
            expenditures. In addition, since the budget is implemented through these banks, reforms aimed at
            increasing their efficiency would also support higher efficiency of public spending. Finally,
            financial system reforms are key to private sector development, which is expected to be the
            engine of employment growth in the coming period.

            Pillar 3: Iraq spends a significant portion of its budget on social protection, yet the impact of
            such spending needs to be improved. The food ration system is effective as a safety net, reaching
            nearly all poor Iraqis. However, it is inefficient because it is universal, is poorly managed, and
            distorts the private sector. A second, targeted cash-based safety net is also in place, managed by
            MOLSA. The MOLSA safety net has the potential to be a far more efficient safety net because it
            is targeted, but the mechanism for targeting needs work if it is to reach a significant share of the
            poor and avoid leakage. The rationalization of the PDS and the enhancement of the MOLSA
            safety net are essential both fiscally and in order to protect the poor and vulnerable from a wide
            array of shocks. In addition to the safety nets, the pension system is a key part of the
            Government's social protection system. As with the safety nets, reform of the pension system is
            essential to guarantee fiscal sustainability and to ensure old-age income.

                                                                 52
B.       Environmental Aspects

180.     This operation is a development policy loan in support of a program of reforms for which
the environmental requirements of OP/BP8.60 apply. The proposed DPL is not expected to have
significant effects on the country's environment, forests and other natural resources. The environmental
and natural resource implications are driven to a large extent by the nature of an operation. In the
proposed operation, none of the prior actions as listed in the policy matrix is expected to have
environmental impacts or risks.

C.       Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

181.     The responsibility for implementing the program in Government rests with the Ministry of
Finance (MoF). The MoF is responsible for the implementation of the DPL as well as for
coordinating the actions among the concerned institutions (including Ministry of Planning and
Development Cooperation, Central Bank of Iraq, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs). Together
with the MoF, these institutions will collect the necessary data for the identified monitoring indicators.
The MoF and the Bank have agreed to monitor the progress in the program supported by the DPL and its
evaluation will serve to inform preparation of a next Bank assistance strategy for Iraq, succeeding the
current ISN.

182.    The multi-sector nature of this operation requires inter-agency coordination to ensure
successful implementation. Inter-agency institutional arrangements are thus needed to prepare, oversee
and monitor reform program.

D.       Fiduciary Aspects

183.     The Government has launched several actions to improve the management of the public
funds particularly since 2006, through the International Compact with Iraq37, and Iraq has committed to
implement specific PFM measures with the active support of donors throughout the past few years. This
is done to mitigate the fiduciary risks in the public sector in Iraq which are considered to be high given
the weak control environment and difficult security situation. This is the general conclusion of a number
of studies, including the 2008 World Bank-led PEIA and financial management accountability assessment
reports issued respectively in 2007 and 200938, as well as other reports issued by IMF and other donors. 39


37
   Under the International Compact, launched in 2006, the Iraqi Government committed to align its public finance management
system with international standards. More specifically, it committed to introduce a single treasury account; increase budget
coverage and transparency also to include donor-financed expenditures; establish a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF)
and credible reporting practices, including through the full implementation of IFMIS; bring budget execution and public
procurement procedures in line with internationally accepted practices; and perform regular audits of government accounts.

184.     The Iraqi authorities are working on strengthening the PFM system to address weaknesses
in Governance. The systemic weaknesses are noted in every aspect of public sector financial
management. These range from the budgeting processes to the Treasury and flow of funds, accounting,
reporting, internal controls and auditing processes. Fiduciary risks at each of these areas are considered
high and particularly aggravated by the difficult security situation. A detailed Fiduciary Risk Assessment
of the PFM was completed in November 2009 which highlighted the risk level that is likely to remain so
until the ongoing capacity development programs are fully implemented.

185.    The Government has made efforts over the past few years to address problems in budget
management, such as the introduction of GFS-based economic classification. The implementation of
the GFS-based classification is still in early stages. The budget still lacks full credibility (with aggregate
expenditures exceeding budgets by more than 15 percent over the past 3 years); in addition to the
accumulation of arrears. The system is also characterized by the maintenance of extra budgetary funds,
contingent liabilities and other quasi-fiscal activities.

186.    Treasury and flow of funds. The authorities are aware of weaknesses in the control framework,
particularly in cash management. Accordingly, the Government is working on improving the cash
management system in order to facilitate the flow of funds to speed up the budget execution, particularly
the investment budget. The cash forecasting was assessed by the PEIA to be incomplete, with irregular
updates, leading to the absence of an overall sound cash management and forecasting function. The PEIA
did not find direct evidence of misappropriations of cash, but reported on anecdotal reports of unreported
and unremitted government revenues. The predictability in the availability of cash is particularly
compromised by the absence of control over commitments.

187.     Accounting and reporting. The complementary Chart of Accounts to the new GFS-compliant
economic classification system has been introduced. The reconciliation of bank accounts was still found
to be irregular. In-year budget execution reports are produced, but comparisons with the budget can only
be done at the payment stage. Quarterly reports are more sound than the monthly reports, but further
improvement is needed in terms of timeliness and reliability of data. The same applies to the annual
accounts. The budget execution accounts for 2008 are currently being finalized. On reporting,
BearingPoint was rehired recently by USAID to finalize the IFMIS project, and substantial resources have
been allocated. However, the new system is not yet operational and the Government still relies on legacy
systems. Progress on IFMIS is crucial, given its centrality to a well-functioning PFM system.

188.    Internal controls and internal audit. The International Compact ­ set out to strengthen internal
controls, internal audit, and mitigate corruption ­ contributed to some improvements between 2005 and
2008 but more needs to happen to reach the defined objectives of transparency. The 2008 PEFA
indicators under the PEIA for this area covered: payroll controls; procurement controls; controls for other
expenditure and internal audit. It concluded that all these areas will still need significant improvements.

189.     External audit. The BSA has been aware of the need to upgrade standards and working methods,
through a re-engagement with the international community. Since 2005, it entered into twinning
arrangement with the UK National Audit Office (NAO) and received strong donor support to: modernize
audit methods; strengthen capacity to perform the audit of annual accounts; and develop tools to better
detect fraud and corruption. The last audit of the Government of Iraq accounts by the BSA to be finalized
was for the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2008, the PEIA confirmed the 2005 assessment of the

needed to Implement a IFMIS in Iraq, October 24, 2007;USAID, Iraq Financial Management Information System Situation
Assessment, January 20, 2009; The Global Integrity Report and Global Integrity Index, 2008.

                                                        54
BSA's audit scope as adequate and identified areas for improvement including the timely submission of
annual reports to the Council of Representatives (CoR).

190.   Various initiatives to reform the PFM system, increase transparency and accountability are
underway though encountering difficulties. As noted earlier, the Government is aware of the above
weaknesses and the risks entailed. The authorities have been working with various donor partners to
make progress in these areas and address the deficiencies. Key PFM initiatives include:

      The introduction of the IFMIS, although implementation has been slow;
      The enactment of the Financial Management Law, which provides the basis for the establishment
      of rules and regulations to govern the public financial management in the country and set the
      adequate control framework in the areas of budget preparation and management, treasury
      management, accounting and external audit.
      An ITF-funded PFM reform project (effective since July 20, 2009) and aiming at strengthening
      budget preparation and management, public financial reporting and control, procurement, and
      capacity development; and
      Strong donor support to the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA).

191.     These reforms represent work in progress, requiring long-term efforts to yield the expected
results and eventually lessen the level of fiduciary risks associated with the use of public funds.
Some of the reforms are more advanced than others. Some have experienced difficulties and came to a
halt such as, the IFMIS, funded and led by the USAID. Such a situation calls for a continuous dialogue
between donors and the authorities and a renewed commitment on the part of the Government. This was
the case during the discussions of this operation between the Government and the Bank with the
participation of IMF. The agreed prior actions in the policy matrix translate such a renewed commitment.
With regard to advancing the reforms in the areas of accounting, a prior action has been discussed and
agreed to further the implementation of the Chart of Accounts (COA), through the establishment of a
High level Committee that will be responsible to launch and oversee this process. The prior action aims
at getting the process started in 2009, through in particular the issuance of a Ministerial Decree
establishing a High Level Committee to oversee the implementation of the Chart of Accounts.

192.     Going forward, further efforts are also needed to issue the 2006, 2007 and 2008 audits of the
Government accounts by the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA); and the implementation of the
IFMIS. It is important to note that some of the work in these areas has been reported to be at an
advanced stage. Audits of 2006 and 2007 accounts are expected to be issued soon by the Board of
Supreme Audit (BSA), while the 2008 Government accounts are being finalized by the government and
will be sent to the BSA in the next months. Similarly, progress on the Government Integrated Financial
Management System (IFMIS) is important to ensure timely reporting and transparency of public accounts.
It will also be very important to advance the reforms in the other areas of internal controls and audits to
ensure proper checks and balances. These are areas that will need to be followed up as part of the
continuing dialogue between the Bank and the Iraqi Government, and as part of the Bank supported
Public Financial Management project.

193.    The Bank is also in discussions with the BSA to implement a TA program under the ITF.
The support would include: pursuing greater independence, developing professional capacity and
ensuring convergence with International Government Standards on Auditing. Coordination with other
donors supporting the BSA is key.



                                                    55
194.    The fiduciary risks cannot be mitigated for this DPL. The Bank, however, will require the
opening of a designated account in US Dollars for the proceeds of the loan at CBI and the requirement of
the audit of the designated account according to Terms of Reference and auditors acceptable to the Bank
to ensure that the funds are included in the budget financial records.

195.     Possible mitigating measures were considered and not retained. The project team considered
the use of a positive list of items to finance using the loan proceeds. It was concluded that while such a
list could not mitigate any of the fiduciary risks related to internal control weaknesses; and it may create
reputational risks to the Bank. As such, the positive list was deemed not appropriate for the case of Iraq
at the current time.

E.      Foreign Exchange Environment, Disbursements and Audit

196.     Foreign Exchange Environment and Central Bank. The IMF assessment of the CBI is
showing important weaknesses of the control environment over the foreign exchange and identified
structural safeguards risks. These weaknesses are particularly noted in the accounting and control areas
as reported, also, by previous independent audits of the CBI for the years 2005 and 2006. The audit
opinions were issued with qualifications due to scope limitation and weak controls over accounting
procedures. The IMF assessment concluded that the CBI operating environment requires important
modernization and that the CBI has already engaged towards important steps to strengthen its safeguards
framework. IMF is in dialogue with the CBI authorities on these steps and is monitoring their progress.
An audit of the CBI accounts for 2008 is underway.

197.    Additional research from various audit reports, published by the International Advisory
and Monitoring Board of Development Fund for Iraq, have reported continuously on a number of
weaknesses in the CBI control environment and the risks involved. The capacity building actions
proposed under this operation as well as by the ITF-financed project for the financial sector are partially
oriented towards the strengthening of the CBI control environment.

198.    Flow of Funds. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy support. Once the loan is approved by the World Bank's Board and becomes
effective, the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in one tranche following effectiveness of the DPL.

199.    The flow of funds for this operation is subject to regular DPL arrangements and standard
public financial management processes. As the loan proceeds will be deposited into the government
budget account in local currency, it will be not possible to track the ultimate use of the funds provided
under the DPL. However, the proceeds of the loan will flow, through the CBI, into a US Dollars
Designated Account to be opened by the MoF at the CBI and which will be used solely for the loan
proceeds. The CBI, acting on MoF instructions, will then credit an equivalent amount, in Iraqi Dinars, to
the Government of Iraq general budget account at the CBI. The MoF will then furnish to the Bank a
confirmation of this transfer: advising that the total sum of the loan has been received. When deposited
into the government budget account, the loan proceeds will then be subject to standard public financial
management processes and procedures. The total amount of time between disbursement by the World
Bank of the loan proceeds in US$ and the credit into the MoF's Iraqi Dinars account should not exceed 15
days.

200.    Audit of the Loan proceeds. The Government will appoint an independent auditor, acceptable to
the Bank to conduct a special purpose audit of the Designated Account opened at the CBI for the loan
proceeds. The audit will be conducted according to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and the
audit report should be submitted to the Bank no later than 4 months from the deposit by the Bank of the
Loan proceeds to the CBI account.

F.     Value-Added and Benefits

201.     The value-added of the proposed DPL vis-à-vis existing operations being implemented in
Iraq include: (i) bringing together for the first time different strands of Bank assistance under a
consolidated, coherent reform package; (ii) proposing prior actions and future reforms in areas not
directly addressed in previous operations, such as the linkage between Iraq's Poverty Reduction Strategy
and the Government budget as well as the rationalization of the PDS; and (iii) accelerating the policy
decisions on a number of reform areas, thereby energizing the reform agenda and providing key synergies
with the implementation of the investment project portfolio.

202.   In addition, the proposed program includes the following main benefits:

           Providing urgent financial resources. The first benefit would be the provision of urgent
           resources at a time of need. It is also an important operation for the Bank's partnership with
           the Government, to support Iraq at its time of need, while providing a window of opportunity
           for a longer-term engagement.

           Strengthening institutional capacity. The DPL would support the rehabilitation of some of
           the State's core functions in policy planning and public resource management. It would
           support the implementation of reforms leading to a stronger institutional capacity in
           Government and a more efficient allocation of fiscal resources. By raising fiduciary
           standards, it would reduce the implementation risk of other projects.

           Supporting the environment for private sector and governance reforms. Another benefit
           would be to reinforce and step up the improvements in the currently weak banking system,
           which is necessary for building up the private sector and it would also support policies that
           would help improve governance and transparency.

           Paving the way for a medium and long term engagement on key policy reforms. Given
           the situation in Iraq, since reengagement in 2004, the Bank, as well as the rest of the
           international community, has largely focused on urgent reconstruction needs and institution
           building. This operation would move toward the more medium- and long-term policy reform
           dialog the ISN sets out.

                                                  57
              Signaling to other donors. The Bank's support to the Government in the form of the DPL
              would be a complement to IMF SBA resources, and a possible catalyst for other donors to
              accelerate their support. The DPL and the IMF SBA would be mutually reinforcing,
              reflecting complementarity of donor assistance and the operation and each of its pillars would
              support harmonization of donor assistance by the Government to improve overall aid
              effectiveness.

G.        Risks and Mitigation

203.    This DPL has significant country (security, political and macroeconomic) and fiduciary
risks. General risks affecting the Bank's program in Iraq would also impact the operation. They include:

204.     Political and economic performance risks. The ability of the Bank Group to engage with Iraq
would become constrained by a reversal of recent, hard-won security gains. Related to that, a
deterioration in the political environment either in Iraq or in the Region would also affect the Bank's
ability to implement its assistance program.40 The DPL could also be affected by risks related to the
Government's commitment to an ambitious reform program at this time. In particular, the design of a
robust program acceptable to the Iraqi authorities might be challenging in an electoral year and during a
time where oil prices have started to rise anew. Likewise, a new Government post elections may not
agree to implement the same program. Given these political uncertainties, the operation has been
designed as a single tranche DPL as part of a programmatic series of two DPLs. This DPL is
underpinned by a reform agenda already adopted by the current Government. In addition, this reform
program is being implemented with support through ongoing technical assistance programs by the Bank,
IMF and other donors. It has also been designed to be realistic, yet consist of important reforms and
milestones, complementing existing Government reforms supported by ongoing TA activities, each with
their own risk mitigation measures, and opening the door for the Bank to engage with the Government in
the medium to long term on critical issues to improve Iraq's fiscal sustainability. The programmatic
approach of this DPL will also help mitigate the risk of relevance and ownership across Governments.

205.     Oil revenue volatility risks. Iraq has been subject to major fluctuations in its oil revenues,
reflecting its extreme dependence on crude oil exports. This makes it extremely challenging to conduct
fiscal policy with a medium-term orientation, while maintaining adequate levels of public spending. To
help mitigate this risk, this operation aims to support reforms that would help reduce Iraq's fiscal and
socio-economic vulnerability to abrupt changes in oil prices and revenues, as explained elsewhere in this
document. In addition, as part of the AAA program under the ISN, the Bank would conduct analytical
work and provide technical assistance on oil revenue management issues, including assessing the
feasibility of special fiscal institutions such as oil funds in the case of Iraq.

206.    Security risks. As in many conflict-affected countries, a deterioration of the security situation
constitutes a large source of risk for the operation. Continuing security incidents, for example, the attacks
in August 2009 and December 2009 against several Government ministries are a manifestation of such
risks. The capacity of the Iraqi Government and whether the international community continues to
support security will be determinants of the extent of risk that persists. However, the financing from this
DPL, and the fact that it is part of an international effort that includes substantial IMF resources, would
provide the external financing needed to fill the budget gap. This would help the Government maintain its

40
   The ISN adopted an adaptive approach to political and security issue to deal with these risks. Under this approach, staffing in
the Baghdad office, the frequency of missions to Iraq, and the launching and implementation of specific activities would be
tailored to the evolving political and security situation on the ground.

                                                               58
recurrent and investment spending to keep the system going while still providing essential services to the
population in a fragile and volatile environment, which may help to mitigate some domestic security
risks. Support through this DPL is the Bank's contribution to a larger package that will help Iraq continue
its physical and institutional reconstruction and thereby reduce destabilizing factors and foster a more
secure environment.

207.    Fiduciary Risks. As indicated in the section on fiduciary assessment, financial controls in Iraq
are weak and the operation's fiduciary risk is high. Weaknesses in Iraq's institutional environment
increase the exposure of the Bank's resources to fiduciary problems. The fiduciary risks in this operation
cannot be mitigated. In the longer term, the Bank is supporting the Iraqi Government in strengthening its
public financial management system through PFM Reform Project, which will help strengthen the
Government's fiduciary environment for budget support by supporting improved allocation, execution,
transparency and accountability in the mobilization and use of all public resources. Furthermore, the
Bank has conducted a fiduciary assessment to accompany this operation which has identified weaknesses
and areas for improvement. 41

208.      The Bank will also monitor the arrangements made with the IMF for the disbursement of
the possible successor SBA. Since the successor SBA would take the form of budget support, the IMF is
seeking the following program safeguards: (i) a Memorandum of Understanding between the CBI and the
Government clarifying responsibilities with regard to servicing the debt to the Fund and to the Bank; (ii)
verification of the CBI's international reserves as of June 30, 2009 by an external auditor; and (iii)
completion of an external audit of the 2008 CBI accounts. More generally, improvement in fiduciary
standards is a central objective of this program and continued Bank assistance in the areas of public
finance management will help raise these standards and improve budget implementation processes over
time.

209.    Program Risks. The new Government may not borrow the second DPL if the financing needs
are reduced or if the post election Government does not want to borrow on IBRD terms, or is not
committed to this operation. The new Government may be committed to the general principles of the
DPL but may have a different sense of priorities--placing greater emphasis on some components---thus
requiring changes in the triggers for the second DPL. To mitigate against the risks that can be controlled,
the programmatic approach offers greater flexibility than a tranched operation, and second DPL triggers
are proposed to be indicative and based on reforms that are already underway.

210.     Limitations of the civil service in the technical capability to implement the reform program
present another source of risk. Recent reforms and the companion technical assistance projects in each
of the three pillars are designed to help build the requisite capacity.

211.     In addition, the DPL would be affected by risks related to the Government's commitment to
an ambitious reform program at this time. The implementation of a robust program acceptable to the
Iraqi authorities might be challenging in an electoral year and during a time where oil prices have started
to rise anew. Likewise, a new Government post elections may not agree to implement the same program
as the previous Government's. To mitigate this risk, this operation has been designed as a single tranche
DPL. It has also been designed to be realistic, while opening the door for the Bank to engage with the

   They include: a more systematic approach to institution building based on ministry- or agency-specific institutional
assessments and action plans; strengthening of the Bank's Baghdad Country Office; continuing use of a Fiduciary Monitoring
Agent to supervise project implementation; and support to Iraq's action plan to improve public financial management, both
through the PFM Reform project and forthcoming analytical and advisory work.

efficiency of public spending.

212.     It may also be questioned why the Bank should put in additional resources when the
current Bank portfolio is disbursing slowly.42 While the physical investment projects encountered
delays, with effort on the part of Government and the Bank as well as improvements in security, the
disbursement ratio has increased from 7.8 percent in FY08 to 15 percent in FY09, and the quality of the
portfolio is assessed to be improving as reflected in a portfolio with 71 percent of projects assessed at risk
in FY07 to 50 percent in FY08 to 20 percent in FY09. This DPL will offer a different type of instrument
from the investment instrument which would be a new fast-disbursing approach and pave the way for a
more medium to long term engagement in Iraq.

213.    While this operation is risky, the risks of not providing this support would be even greater -
- for Iraq to have the financial means to keep the Government systems running and maintain public
expenditure for service delivery and reconstruction, at a time of political uncertainty, transition, fragility
and financial crisis. It is also an important operation for the Bank to remain a partner in Iraq at its time of
need, while providing a window of opportunity for a longer term engagement in Iraq.

214.     Condition of Board Presentation. To ensure the necessary political commitment on the part of
the Iraqi authorities, parliamentary approval of the 2010 Budget is a condition of the Board presentation
for this DPL. The 2010 Budget was approved by the Iraqi Parliament (Council of Representatives) on
January 26, 2010.

            ANNEX 3. RELATIONS WITH THE FUND AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

                                   February 10, 2010

Contact person: Mr. Ron Van Rooden (rvanrooden@imf.org, 1-202-623-4011)

The Fund has been closely engaged with Iraq since 2003. Initial work focused on
providing policy advice, mainly on monetary and fiscal policies, and technical assistance to
rebuild essential economic institutions. In September 2004, the Fund approved Emergency
Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) for Iraq, which--in combination with a debt sustainability
analysis--paved the way for an agreement with Paris Club creditors in 2004. Since then, Iraq
successfully completed two (precautionary) Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), whose main
objectives were to achieve macroeconomic stability; promote growth; and continue the
process of structural reforms.

Substantial progress has been made since 2003. Despite a difficult security situation, the
authorities have demonstrated their commitment and ability to implement sound
macroeconomic policies and advance structural reforms. Inflation has been reduced to single
digits and the international reserves position has improved markedly. At the same time,
domestic fuel prices were raised to eliminate direct fuel subsidies and the pension system was
put on a sustainable footing, which created room for priority spending on investment and
social sectors. Several steps have also been taken to strengthen public financial management,
improve transparency in the oil sector--including with the help of the International Advisory
and Monitoring Board (IAMB)--and rebuild capacity at the central bank, while the
authorities have initiated the restructuring of the two largest state-owned banks.

Iraq's economic performance was strong in 2008 aided by record oil prices and
improved security. Oil production rose to 2.3 million barrels per day (mbpd), the highest
level since 2003, compared to 2.0 mbpd in 2007. Crude exports reached 1.8 mbpd, compared
to 1.6 mbpd in 2007. As a result, real GDP is estimated to have grown by 9½ percent in
2008, up from 1½ percent in 2007. With the increase in oil export volumes and record-high
oil prices, crude oil export receipts reached $61 billion in 2008--65 percent higher than in
2007--and the current account recorded a surplus of 13¼ percent of GDP. The government
budget registered a lower-than-expected surplus of 1½ percent of GDP in 2008. This
reflected a significant increase in government spending that more than absorbed the higher-
than-budgeted revenues, including a large wage increase granted to compensate for the
erosion of real wages that had occurred during previous years.

Following the strong economic performance in 2008, the Iraqi economy has been
seriously affected by the drop in oil prices from their peak levels in mid-2008. Also, oil
production and export volumes have not increased as much as planned due to lack of
investment. As a result, Iraq's external position has deteriorated substantially in 2009, with
both the external current account and the overall balance of payments estimated to have
shiftedinto large deficits of about 20 percent and 20 percent of GDP, respectively. With oil
export receipts accounting for about 90 percent of government revenues, the lower oil prices


                                           75
have had a similar impact on the government's budget, which is estimated to have recorded a
deficit of over 20 percent of GDP in 2009. The CBI's international reserves declined by
almost $7 billion, to about $44 billion by end-2009l, reflecting the use of government
deposits at the CBI to finance the budget deficit. Growth is estimated to have slowed to 4
percent in 2009, even though oil production improved towards the end of the owing to quick
efforts to address bottlenecks.

While Iraq's longer-term economic outlook is strong, as oil prices and production are
projected to increase, in the near term the current account and overall balance of
payments are expected to remain in deficit in 2010 and 2011. Similarly, Iraq's fiscal
position is projected to record large, albeit declining deficits in both years, before returning to
a surplus position in 2012. The government accumulated financial savings in the DFI and in
its accounts with the CBI during previous years, amounting to about $21 billion at end-2008.
However, financing the large budget deficits in 2009­2011, even after mobilizing substantial
amounts of domestic financing and utilizing the recent SDR allocation of $1.7 billion, would
exhaust these resources and could result in the accumulation of arrears.

Against this background, the authorities have designed an economic program for the
period through end-2011 and have requested the Fund to support their efforts with a
new two-year $3.8 billion Stand-By Arrangement. The authorities view the new program
primarily as a way to provide a sound macroeconomic framework during a period of large
economic and political uncertainties.

In addition to preserving macroeconomic stability, the new program will also help the
authorities move forward with their structural reform agenda. With many of the
structural reforms still unfinished, the program aims to advance key reforms in the area of
public financial management, including the management of Iraq's oil resources, and financial
sector development, in close coordination with a Development Policy Loan (DPL) under
preparation by the World Bank.

A key element of the program is to contain current government spending in order to
reduce the budget deficit and make room for additional investment. Specifically, current
spending in both 2010 and 2011 will be kept broadly unchanged in nominal terms at 2009
levels. This will require some reduction in non-priority spending, as the 2010 budget would
need to cover the full-year cost of additional security outlays resulting from the withdrawal
of U.S. forces. At the same time, an increase in capital spending is planned for 2010, given
the urgent need to improve basic public service delivery. Thus, the budget deficit is expected
to be reduced to 19 percent of GDP in 2010, and further to 6percent of GDP in 2011, before
shifting back into a surplus in 2012. Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to
aim at keeping inflation low.

The program will also provide the authorities access to Fund resources, if needed. Iraq's
financing needs are strongly influenced by oil price movements. Over the last two years, oil
prices have been very volatile by historical standards and projections are subject to a high
degree of uncertainty. The program projections assume a conservative price for Iraqi oil of

                                              76
$62.5 per barrel in 2010 and $67.5 per barrel in 2011. As in previous programs, these prices
for Iraqi oil are based on the WEO projected prices discounted by an uncertainty margin of
10 percent and by the quality differential relative to the WEO basket. Based on these
assumptions, Iraq is expected to have a temporary financing gap of about $5 billion through
end-2011. Oil prices may turn out higher than projected under the program, however.
Therefore, the authorities will treat the SBA as precautionary if at the time of each program
review oil revenues are projected to reach levels implying that there is no longer a financing
need. In the same vein, the authorities would also treat the SBA as precautionary if
investment remains significantly below budgeted amounts.

With oil production and prices expected to gradually increase over the coming years,
Iraq's economic indicators would steadily improve:
   Economic growth is projected to accelerate to 7-8 percent a year in the coming years as
   oil production gradually increases from 2.4 mbpd in 2009 to 2.6 mbpd in 2010 and 3.1
   mbpd in 2012.

   Combined with higher oil prices, this will result in a steady narrowing of the current
   account deficit. Oil exports are projected to rise from 1.9 mbpd in 2009 to 2.1 mbpd in
   2010 and further to 2.5 mbpd in 2012, with the current account deficit declining to 2
   percent of GDP in 2012, and moving back into a surplus in 2014.

   While Iraq's overall reserves would still fall in 2010, they would stabilize in the
   following years at a level equivalent to about 6½ months of imports, before starting to
   improve in 2014.

   By containing government current spending and allowing for an increase in capital
   spending, the budget would move back into a surplus in 2012, and remain in a sustainable
   position over the medium-term.

   With appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies, headline inflation is projected to
   remain low at around 5­6 percent a year in the coming years.

   Iraq's external debt position would also reach a sustainable position, provided that further
   progress continues to be made in reaching agreements with non-Paris Club creditors.

                                            ANNEX 4. PSIA OF PDS REFORM

The Public Distribution System was introduced in 1991 in response to the declining availability
of food imports under UN-imposed sanctions. When the Oil for Food Program began in 1997,
government revenue and the ability to import food increased, and the PDS rations increased as
well--from about 50 percent of caloric needs to the present level (85 percent of required
calories). The PDS effectively reached the vast majority of the population during this period,
insulating households against food shortages and price fluctuations. Although malnutrition
remained high, the situation would likely have been considerably worse without this safety net.

Today, the food ration system remains Iraq's largest safety net, absorbing 8.6 percent of
government spending in 2008 ­ far larger than education (6 percent) or health (3.4 percent).
Although the PDS is successful in providing significant transfers to the vast majority of poor
Iraqi's, it is very inefficient as a safety net because it is a universal transfer (provided to the
nonpoor as well as the poor) and creates distortions in domestic food markets. The dominant role
played by PDS in those markets has massively distorted the incentives faced by Iraqi farmers and
private enterprises as large quantities of imported staples depresses domestic food prices,
reducing the incentive for domestic production. Low domestic prices also create incentives for
smuggling staples outside the country for sale at a higher price.

A variety of proposals for reform of the PDS have been put forth during the last years, but
assessment of likely impacts has been difficult due to lack of data. In this PSIA, we perform
micro-simulation exercises using the newly available Iraq Household Socio-Economic Survey.44

The micro-simulations we present are illustrative of the medium term impacts of several reform
scenarios: in particular, the simulations assume sufficient supplies of food are available in the
market so that there are no major changes in the market prices of food. 45 We consider the
current situation as well as three basic scenarios: elimination of the PDS with no compensating
measures; replacement of the PDS with geographically targeted cash transfers; and replacement
of the PDS with Proxy-Means-Tested cash transfers.
     The average transfer from the PDS is the equivalent of ID 10,100 per person per month.46
        Currently, 23.9 percent of the population is below the official poverty line of ID 76,896
        per person per month.
     Due to the large size of the existing system, an uncompensated elimination of this system
        would dramatically reduce the consumption of the poor as well as the nonpoor ­ in effect
        subtracting the value of the PDS ration from the ID 61,624 welfare level of the average
        poor person and from the ID 126,944 of the average Iraqi. In this scenario, the poor
        would get poorer and an additional 10.5 percent of the population would fall into poverty.

44
   The Iraq Household Socio Economic Survey (IHSES) is the first nationally representative income and expenditure survey in
Iraq since 1988. IHSES was fielded from October 2006 through November 2007 with assistance of the World Bank.
45
   A short term transition plan will be essential for any reform scenario. Because the PDS is such a large system and is
dominated by the role of the public sector for importing, storing and distributing food, a plan must be in place that helps the
private sector develop the capacity to take on these roles. Without such a plan, food prices are likely to rise dramatically, with
large poverty and redistributive impacts.
46
   The size of the transfer is calculated based on the quantities of ration products actually received by households, as observed in
the IHSES, evaluated at local market prices.

                                                                79
          Introducing targeting, by providing transfers to a smaller number of people, allows the
          size of the transfers to increase. Our geographic targeting47 scenario assumes the same
          resources as the PDS, but allocates a cash transfer only to those who live in a limited
          number of geographic areas, selected on the basis of their high poverty rates.48 Use of
          geographical targeting results in a poverty headcount of 18.6 percent ­ an improvement
          over the existing PDS system of 5.3 percentage points.
          The second targeting mechanism we consider is Proxy Means Testing (PMT), which is
          based on the assessment of a small set of household characteristics, chosen on the basis of
          their correlation with poverty, ease of verification, and difficulty in being manipulated by
          potential beneficiaries. In PMT, the information on household characteristics are
          combined with fixed weights to obtain a score which is then used to determine
          eligibility.49 The result of this simulation is a poverty headcount of 15.0 percent of the
          population ­ an improvement of 8.9 percentage points.

     PDS      with    Proxy-
     Means-Tested       cash
     transfers

In conclusion, these simulations illustrate that commonly used targeting mechanisms have the
potential to improve the poverty reduction impact of the current PDS budget ­ from 23.9 percent
of the population to as little as 15.0 percent. 50


47
   Targeting based on the location of the residence is very common due to its simplicity (see, for example, Coady, Grosh and
Hoddinott, 2004).
48
    We rank the 54 geographic areas used for sampling in the IHSES (18 governorates separately by rural, governorate centers and
other urban centers) on the basis of their poverty headcount. If we aim to reduce the headcount at a national level, the optimal
number of targeted areas is twenty-two. (This optimization reflects the tradeoff between the number of poor people covered by
the program and the size of the transfer to each beneficiary.) The accuracy of geographic targeting can be improved by use of
more disaggregated geographic areas. Too fine a disaggregation, however, creates administrative problems by creating
incentives for households to cross geographic boundaries in order to obtain benefits.
49
   In our micro-simulations for Iraq, the preferred specification includes: socio-demographic characteristics of the household
(household size, household head gender and age, a dependency ratio, educational attainment of the household head), housing
characteristics (whether the house is rented, crowding, materials of the ceiling and floor, quality of the sewage system and of the
road leading to the house), geographical location, labor market status of the household head and whether he/she works in the
public sector. If we aim to reduce the headcount at a national level, the threshold for eligibility is set at the 36th percentile of the
estimated welfare distribution.
50
   Alternatively, targeting could permit a smaller budget to maintain a constant rate of poverty.

            ANNEX 6. FRAMEWORK FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL RESTRUCTURING OF
                                     STATE-OWNED BANKS

I.          General Scope of the Program
1.       This note defines the overall framework of the program of operational and institutional strengthening
which will enable the Bank to function successfully as a modern, competitive commercial bank. Due account
is being taken of the effectiveness and reliability of the Bank's accounting, financial, administrative and
control procedures and their upgrading. The Iraq authority has commissioned a comprehensive independent
audit--to assess the Bank's performance, outline the main areas of institutional weaknesses and present
recommendations to address the weaknesses detected. The next step would be a set of detailed measures aim
at implementing an operational and institutional action plan under the scrutiny of the Restructuring
Committee headed by the Vice Governor of CBI. The US Treasury is assisting the two state-owned banks in
drafting this detailed action plan. But more technical help (consultants) should be needed to assist the two
state owned banks in the institutional and operational restructuring focusing on management functions,
human resources, and IT and MIS, as well as, strengthening accounting, reporting and auditing policies and
procedures in compliance with international best practices.

2.       More specifically, the objective of the program is to support the CBI, the state-owned bank's
board of directors and management team efforts in developing a detailed, credible business strategy and
plan, and to recommend, inter-alia, steps that should be taken to streamline operations, optimize the
branch and distribution network, and strengthen organizational, operational and management structures.
The plan proposed under the program should include a candid and detailed assessment of needed
professional skills in critical business areas (front, middle and back office), as well as staffing and staff
training. The strategy of the public banks would need to be strictly defined under its proposed business
plan to preclude lax lending policies and ensure a level playing field for all banks with private as well as
public ownership. The proposed scope of work under the program should cover ­ as detailed in the following
sections ­ the specific areas of: (i) strategic and business planning; (ii) organization structure; (iii) budgeting
and performance measurement; (iv) management information system and management accounts; (v)
operations; (vi) automation and technology support; (vii) internal audit; (viii) credit analysis and portfolio
management; (ix) asset and liability management; (x) market development and marketing; and (xi) human
resource management and training.

            A. Strategic and Business Planning

3.       The public banks should consider creating a strategic and business plan. Given the need to build and
develop the Bank in a changing economic and market environment, the completion of a comprehensive
strategic plan is a priority as it is the necessary foundation for building a program of institutional change. The
banks' mandate from the owner would provide the basis for formulating the strategy. The strategic plan must
clearly define the Bank's mission and objectives, target markets, products and services, financial goals,
resource requirements and action plans for executing its strategy and achieving its goals and objectives.51

4.       One of the program's outcomes will be to support the board of directors and management design and
implement a formalized strategic planning process for the Bank as a whole and the individual business and
staff units. That process must establish how the task of planning is organized, conducted and monitored on
an on-going basis. The role of various departments (including, if necessary a specialist strategic planning unit
within the banks) in the planning exercise must be established and the steps in the process with appropriate
deadlines for completion of tasks must be outlined and agreed with the banks' management.

51
     Page 22 of the Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank reports.

                                                              86
5.       The preparation of the strategic plan will be based inter-alia on the analysis of the external
environment, the competition, current and potential markets, and the banks' current market position. To this
end, there would be a need to conduct relevant internal analyses to identify the banks' strengths and
weaknesses in relation to the market, the competition and future business opportunities. These internal
analyses should include profitability analyses of existing businesses such as corporate and consumer lending.
It is expected under the program, that the banks' board of directors and senior management would then
address and define the banks' mission and strategy, and prepare business and action plans to execute that
strategy. This corporate strategy will then be extended into a series of plans, each covering a major business
of the banks ­ defining specific goals, target markets, products and services, resource requirements, and
actions programs as needed to provide practical guidance to each business unit and tools for monitoring and
evaluating performance.

6.      In the frame of the program, it would be expected to train banks' staff in strategic and business
planning in the course of the work, so that the banks have the ability to continue the planning process in the
future. Any identified gaps in critical skills within the banks should be reported to management.

         B. Organization Structure

7.       Once the strategy and business plans are developed, the banks must review their organizational
setting so that it may execute its strategy successfully.52 In this regard, the banks' Board and management will
work together to develop and document the organization structure of the head-office and their specific
relationships to the branch offices. This would entail a definition of each organizational unit (including
permanent committees), its mission, main responsibilities, key functions to carry out each responsibility, and
required staffing levels.

8.      To build the new organization structure, the Bank's board and management will define the specific
requirements and will be expected to prepare a plan for implementing the new organization indicating
implementation actions and responsibilities, schedule and support requirements.

         C. Budgeting and Performance Measurement

9.       The budgeting functions in the public banks are at a very early stage.53 The banks do not have a
Budgeting Committee, which is a key internal body to oversee this core function. In the current situation, the
budgeting functions are part of the finance department and report to the management. It would be best
practices to establish such an independent committee within the banks. The budgeting process within the
banks suffers from major weaknesses (no information system to prepare, compile and monitor the function's
processes, There will be a need to strengthen the banks' existing capital planning and budgeting systems. The
objective will be to ensure that the capital planning (in terms of economic rather than regulatory) and
budgeting systems are sufficiently comprehensive to meet fully the needs of the banks, including as a basis
for providing incentives for, and controlling, management and staff performance throughout the institution.
The banks will have to revise their system which should be formally linked to the strategic planning process
to ensure that the annual financial plan for the banks truly represents and reflects the strategic objectives.

10.     Beyond the necessity to close those gaps54, the budgeting process will have to ensure that individual
branches and units within the banks prepare budgets for all income and expenditure items over which they
have responsibility. The process should ensure in particular that: (i) annual budgets for the banks and its

52
   Page 24 of the Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank reports.
53
   Page 31 of the Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank reports.
54
   Page 32 to 37 of the reports.

                                                            87
departments and branches are linked to the strategic planning process and objectives; (ii) budget targets are
agreed to between head-office and individual department and branch managers to ensure challenging but
realistic targets and secure good motivation and performance from managers; (iii) detailed and relevant
variance analyses take place on a regular basis and all significant variances from the banks' targets and
objectives are highlighted and explained as necessary and corrective actions are initiated; and (iv) the
management accounts for the banks and its constituent parts are designed to report actual performance against
budgets and strategic targets..

11.      In addition to variance analysis, the banks will have to ensure that they have a comprehensive system
of measuring performance against targets through the use of a well defined set of management accounts and
reports and through a system of individual performance management (they will also have to state the
milestones at which they will measure their performances). The banks will train a core staff in the utilization
of the new systems and processes that may be developed.

        D. Management Information System and Management Accounts

12.      There is a need to define the information required to manage the banks, measure their performances
and control their risks. On completion of the banks' strategic plan, a detailed plan of the management
information required to execute the strategy will need to be completed, including management reports at each
managerial level. The new management information requirements must be integrated into the automation
strategy of the banks.

13.      In assessing the adequacy of the existing management information system and recommending
adjustments as needed, the Bank will ensure that the management information plan would cover all the key
areas of Bank operations and management, including: (i) credit and portfolio status; (ii) treasury including
liquidity, interest rate and FX risks, funding, asset and liability management, and deposits management; (iii)
operations (front, middle and back-office), head-office and branches; and (iv) strategy, budgeting and
performance measurement including the design and implementation of an appropriate management
accounting system. A key item will be improving the interconnection of bank branches with the banks'
headquarters.

14.      This will cover the accounting system needed to provide management with reliable and timeliness
financial information for each of the operational units and product lines, as well as for the banks as a whole.
The accounting system should include information on a profit and cost-center basis with appropriate transfer
pricing for inter-unit transactions. The management accounts should also be designed to give revenue, cost
and profitability information by product, customer, branch and business line.

15.     The banks' management will ensure that the new management information requirements, including
the management accounts, are integrated into the automation strategy and technology support framework of
the banks. Rafidain Bank and Rasheed bank will also need to train a core staff in the utilization of the new
systems and processes that may be developed.

        E. Operations

16.     In light of the strategic plan ­ which would have addressed the systems requirements for new
business units--the adequacy of the banks' operating systems and procedures will be assessed, together with
the need for their strengthening to ensure their effectiveness. There will be a need to ensure that any
strengthened or revamped systems would take into account the banks' planned businesses, methods of
operations, service and control requirements and the automation strategy.


                                                      88
17.      New operations systems and procedures would need to cover both head-office and branch operations
and other product/service production and distribution networks/systems, and the interconnection of the
branches with headquarters. Indeed, with intensified competition for products and services, and pressure on
margins, it would be necessary to strengthen operations at the branch level. These efforts will involve
substantial training of the banks' branch staff in handling basic deposit-taking transactions, using computers.
They will also involve development of loan officers' capacity. Unless training can be held in Iraq, these
efforts will involve training of a cadre of selected bank staff outside Iraq to act as trainers of the staff
("training of the trainers") in Iraq. The numbers trained at this stage are projected to be at least one from each
branch of the two banks. Following the training of these cadres, training programs will be set up in Iraq, if
possible linked by video conference to the original trainers of the trainers so they can provide answers to
more complicated questions. This is likely to entail travel to a centralized training center in Iraq. Finally, the
project will support better use of information technology and inter-connection of branches of the banks. At
the moment, efforts have been made to improve functions of Rafidain Bank's head office and foreign offices
but efforts are needed to train staff in the rest of Rafidain and in Rasheed.

             F. Automation and Technology Support

18.       The current information systems within the public banks run on an antiquated environment.55 There
is no information security function in the banks or formal information security policies and procedures in
accordance with international standards. In the same vein, the banks have not developed any disaster recovery
site or disaster recovery plans.

19.      Moreover, there is no IT governance or IT strategic planning in the public banks and information
security as well as IT operations is currently managed on an ad-hoc basis. To ensure that IT systems (i)
support efficiently the key current banking operations, (ii) meet the current and future business needs and
user's expectations and (iii) effectively manage, maintain and control data availability, integrity and
confidentiality, banks' management should consider defining an IT strategy development framework at short
notice and have a formal information system strategic planning document in place. This IT strategic plan will
have to support fulfillment of the overall operational banks' strategies and enable business growth.

20.      Once the management information needs have been defined, the efficiency and effectiveness of the
hardware architecture and system engineering in the Bank will be reviewed and evaluated (taking into
account any contingency plans relating to business continuity risks). In so doing, due account will be taken
of the need for congruence between the banks' strategy, business goals, and existing technology. The work
would require more specifically: (i) an assessment of the information and processing requirements, and a
definition of a set of additional application needs for the banks; (ii) an analysis of the information and
processing effectiveness of existing systems; (iii) an estimate of the cost of additional hardware, software
(especially for the basic banking functions related to customer accounting, portfolio analysis and
management, FX operations, etc...); (iv) an outline of the management, organization, manpower and training
requirements needed to implement the program; and (v) an implementation schedule together with critical
milestones. Due attention will be needed in integrating any new initiative: internally, with regard to a
compatible system of hardware, software and communications from branch to head-office; and externally,
with any new payments system and inter-Bank arrangements.

             G. Internal Audit

21.      The Ernst & Young audit concluded that the internal control system of both banks does not meet the
international standards. Several major flaws are flagged. Chief among these, (i) the banks do not have an

55
     Page 43 to 85 of the Operational diagnostic review reports.

                                                                   89
active audit committee;56 (ii) the internal audit functions are not independent and (iii) the internal audit
functions' methodology is based on compliance testing rather than a risk-based approach. Banks' internal
audit schemes will have therefore to be strengthened.

22.      In line with the strategic plans and the implications of these plans ­ in terms of organization
structure, financial instruments, operations, systems and procedures, and automation ­ there will be a need to
propose adjustments as required to the internal audit system and process with appropriate corresponding
manuals.

23.      There will be specifically a need to: (i) advise on improvements to audit methodologies, and
adequacy of audit coverage in terms of scope (e.g. credit, operations, assets and liabilities management),
depth and reporting standards; (ii) suggest required follow-up and monitoring; (iii) define the audit
organization; and (iv) identify complementary audit skill requirements. The Bank auditing staff will need to
be trained in the utilization of new methodologies (risk-based versus compliance-based). This sub-
component ­ which requires specialized skills - would call for interaction with/involvement of the external
auditors.

         H. Credit Analysis and Portfolio Management

24.      Long standing problems of portfolio quality have taken a heavy toll on the banks' operations and
financial position. The Ernst & Young asset quality reports show that loan loss reserves are largely
underestimated (239 billion IQD for Rafidain Bank and 138 billion IQD for Rasheed Bank).57 In terms of
capital adequacy, regulatory capital shortfalls ­based on Basel II requirements and worldwide practices in
terms of classification and provisioning of bad assets- may vary between 359 billion IQD for Rasheed Bank
and 15.3 trillion IQD for Rafidain Bank). 58 With regard to the credit administration process, several
weaknesses were identified within the banks: (i) the Credit Committees do not have a charter spelling out
inter alia their mission, objectives, authorization matrix;59 (ii) the banks credit functions do not forecast the
cash flows generated from loan collections and do not perform a reassessment of the collateral value; the
banks do not collect customers' financial statements.60

25.      A formalized and thorough management and operational structure delineating credit policies,
procedures and systems must be developed as a matter of priority. Special emphasis should be given to
portfolio control and problem loan management. The revised structure should bring up-to-date market skills
and techniques to the process of credit management, especially in the context of the asset quality problems
faced by the banks. The banks' management will need to enhance credit management policies, procedures
and systems, regarding both aspects of credit analysis and portfolio management, and problem loan
management.

26.     (a) Credit analysis and portfolio management. There would be a need for improvement in policies
and procedures regarding: (i) target market guidelines; (ii) portfolio limits; (iii) risk tolerance criteria; (iv)

   Amounting to US$ 204 million and US$ 117 million (IQD 1,000 = US$ 0.8521)
58
   Amounting to IQD 306 million and US$ 13.1 billion (18.4 % of GDP--the 2008 GDP would reach IQD 83.6 trillions, ie.
US$ 71.2 billion). The capital shortfall of US$ 13.1 billion (Rafidain Bank) is based on a number of adjustments which are likely
to be required. Chief among these is a difference arising from the reevaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. IQD 8.33 trillion (US$ 7.1 billion) are currently recognized as an asset due from the Ministry of Finance and are
included within "other assets" of the Rafidain Bank. This amount relates to 2006 and may be recognized as an expense in the
income statement.

credit approval authorities; (v) credit analysis, structuring and pricing; (vi) loan documentation, contracts and
security; (vii) loan disbursement procedures; (viii) loan follow-up and monitoring; (ix) credit recovery and
legal enforcement; (x) credit administration and controls, including disbursement, amendment to terms and
other sanction authorities, credit audit and policy exceptions; (xi) organization of credit within the context of
the strategic plan; and (xii) automation of reports needed to monitor asset quality.

27.      (b) Problem loan management. There would be a need to optimize policies, procedures and
organizational arrangements [including if warranted, special workout unit for certain types of problem assets)
related to: (i) problem loan definition and identification; (ii) problem loan reporting; (iii) problem loan
follow-up; (iv) delinquent loan recovery; (v) viability analysis and loan restructuring options; (vi)
repossession and legal recovery actions; and (vii) provisions and interest accruals.

28.    There will be a need to train a core staff in the utilization of each of the new processes that may be
developed.

            I. Asset and Liability Management

29.     For both public banks, the Ernst & Young asset quality reports show that the banks do not have a
formal ALM function.61 There are no centralized treasury departments to perform treasury function related
processes and there is no documented policy and procedures manual to govern ALM processes.

30.       The banks management will have to design and activate an ALM function as part of the revised
organizational structure of each bank. The skills, policies and systems required to manage these risks must be
strengthened, so that comprehensive risk management policies be developed or improved to govern interest
rate, liquidity, FX and other non-credit related risks. In this regard, the management will be responsible for
the implementation of the processes, the organization, and the information systems required managing the
range of ALM risks currently facing the banks and any additional risks inherent in the execution of the banks'
strategic plan. The management will have the responsibility of developing and documenting processes to
cover, at a minimum, such ALM areas as liquidity, interest rate and duration gap and pricing, and FX.
Further, the management will put in place an organization structure that will execute the proposed, upgraded
ALM processes - defining specific responsibilities, authorities, and functions of each unit, as well as required
staffing skills. In addition, it will be necessary to define the information required to support the ALM
processes (e.g., external and internal information, formats and time-frames). .

31.     There will probably be important needs to train key staff (treasury staff and management, and other
senior managers who will participate in, or contribute to, ALM decisions) in utilizing the ALM system and
implement the practical day-to-day functions.

            J. Market Development and Marketing

32.      There will be a need to assess the adequacy of the banks' formal marketing function and strategy and
the degree to which these are aligned to its activities and to the requirements of the market. This would
include an assessment of staff marketing and sales experience. In this regard recommendations, as needed,
regarding adjustments to the marketing function and strategy would need to be developed as part of the
banks' strategic and business plan. In this context, a market analysis might be critical to the success of the
strategic plan and vital for the proper execution of the business plan.

33.         In each bank, in conjunction and congruent with the strategic plan, the management would need to

61
     Page 113 of the Operational diagnostic review reports.

                                                              91
complete a detailed marketing plan and each of its business units covering, as the case may be, new product
introductions, service innovations and improvements. These plans should include: (i) a definition of market
objectives; (ii) an analysis of market targets, products, and growth rates and shares; (iii) an analysis of
customer needs, and marketing image of the Bank and its services; (iv) a marketing "strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities and threats" analysis for the Bank; and (v) a plan of organization of marketing and sales at
head-office and branch levels.

34.      In particular, the banks' management will have to make sure that business units are defined to meet
the requirements of customers and the achievement of the banks' strategic goals. For instance, the assessment
could be made as to whether there is a need for relationship or account managers to handle major clients, the
different organizational arrangements required for retail, small corporate, private sector clients or the possible
requirement to set up specialist units for individual product areas.

35.      The banks' management will have to ensure that skills needed for market analysis and planning, and
help institute a formalized market planning and development process within the framework of the banks'
strategic planning process are in place. The management of the banks will have to define: (i) a training
program regarding the banks' marketing strategy and methods of sales and customer service; and (ii) an
advertising and public relations program.

          K. Human Resource Management and Training

36.      For both public banks, the operational diagnostic review report show that the current situation raised
major issues in terms of human resources practices. There is no clear manpower plan (recruitments are
conducted spontaneously based on number of authorized vacancies) and no consistent selection criteria62, no
performance management system.63 There will be a need to assess the banks' human resources and their
adequacy for commercial banks operating in a competitive environment. Following the assessment of the
adequacy in terms of staff skills, recommendations may be needed to address identified deficiencies in light
of the banks business strategy and business focus and plans. To this end, a comprehensive training needs
analysis will be required and a formalized training (and as needed recruitment) plan64 should be established..

37.     A human resource management system will have to be put in place in both banks to meet both
current and future human resource requirements. There will be a need to address: (i) first the banks'
immediate needs for building critical skills and efficiently deploying the work force to staff its new
organization, and support the execution of its strategy and business plan; then (ii) the banks' medium-term
needs for developing and managing its human resources.

38.      Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank will need to implement a first set of high-priority human resource
management systems consisting specifically of: (i) a training needs analysis; (ii) a training and development
master plan, including a prioritization and planning of how all training needs will be met, and the launching
of highest priority programs; (iii) a performance appraisal system, including the assessment of the
performance and potential of employees, and the identification of major development needs; and (iv) a
staffing program which entails the effective matching of people to jobs in the revised organization structure.

39.      The banks' next order of priority is to build, implement and train staff in applying the human
resource management systems, related to: (i) manpower planning, covering supply and demand analysis,
projection of manpower gaps and excesses (over 2 to 4 years) by major skill and rank level, and plans to fill

the gaps and deal with the excesses; (ii) recruitment, with pro-active methods for finding and selecting key
talents; (iii) rewards management, along a compensation scheme that will attract, retain and motivate
managers, technical personnel and staff; (iv) management development, with methods for developing general
and technical managers; (v) performance management, through an effective system for managing individual
performance (e.g., goals, standards, monitoring, evaluation); and (vi) work culture development, under a
program for building a competitive, commercial work culture throughout the organization.

40.      These steps will include documentation of each system in the form of an operating manual, as well as
pilot implementation and training of implementation staff. In particular, as needed, the management of the
banks will be responsible of conducting on-the-job training for the staff so that the banks have the full ability
to carry on the work in the future. The management may set as a priority ­ although this would have to be
based on the training needs analysis ­ the focus on two selected and critical groups of managers: (i) branch
managers, where training should cover inter-alia, business planning, profit and cost management, human
resource management, management control and marketing; and (ii) head-office department directors, where
training should cover inter-alia, business and staffing planning, profit and cost management, human resource
management, change management, performance monitoring and measurement.

II.     Output

41.      The management will work with the board of directors of the banks to develop, along the
specifications of the framework outlined in this note, the following program: (i) a strategic plan; (ii) business
plans for individual business units; (iii) an organization structure; (iv) a budgeting and performance
measurement framework; (v) identification and framework design of required management information
systems; (vi) automation and technology support program; (vii) accounting and internal audit processes; (viii)
implementation of a credit risk management process with emphasis on management of problem loans; (ix)
implementation of asset and liability management systems for significant non-credit related risks; (x)
development and initial implementation of plan for marketing of the Bank's products and services; and (xi)
human resource management and training program including the implementation of priority human resource
management systems.

42.     It is recommended within this framework that performance indicators be established to assist in
monitoring achievements.

                   ANNEX 7. BANKING REGULATION AND SUPERVISION PROGRAM


1.       The strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework in the banking sector is a
critical part of the banking reform program. A credible, independent regulator is the necessary anchor
of an effective and resilient banking system, especially in an environment where state ownership of
banking institutions is significant (state ownership accounts for nearly 90 percent of the banking sector
assets at the end of 2006).

2.      Since 2004 the CBI has embarked on a comprehensive program of capacity building
covering extended areas of the regulatory and supervisory functions, as it is seeking to move from
compliance to risk-based supervision. The IMF has been providing assistance to the CBI since end of
2004 and has done considerable work in helping Iraq develop a banking regulatory and supervisory
system, in line with best international standards and practices. In coordination with the Federal Reserve
System, training workshops were conducted to promote the emergence of a core group of professional
banking supervisors among the existing CBI staff. Between June 2004 and January 2006, the IMF carried
out an initial cycle of classic training workshops aim at acquiring basic knowledge in banking
supervision. Then the capacity building exercise shifted replicating the work of a resident advisor in
reviewing the actual work and outputs (on site inspection report, off site analysis note etc..) produced by
Iraqi supervisors, and in providing them with feedback and guidance for off-site and on-site supervision.
This is closely coordinated with, and complements the work of, the Baghdad-based U.S. banking
supervision experts and the METAC experts based in Beirut. Now, the IMF TA is evolving to be demand-
driven and consisting of specific issues identified by the CBI. The next workshop is scheduled in January
2009 and will focus on topics to be selected by the CBI supervisors.

3.      To be effective the TA should be based on a thorough and comprehensive review of on-site
and off-site processes at the CBI. An organizational restructuring of the banking supervision function
should be carried out to set up or enhance the core functions in banking supervision such as On-Site
Inspection, On-Going Surveillance, Licensing, Macro-prudential Analysis and Regulation and
Enforcement. As a result, the banking supervision in Iraq would move from compliance to a more
proactive and modern risk-based supervision.

4.       The CBI should start new recruitments to rejuvenate the work force. Notwithstanding their
good education background, these newcomers would need training and incentives, while a new culture
based on efficiency and achievements needs to be built. To this effect, the entire banking supervision
training policy and process would be evaluated to assess if the training programs are congruent with and
responsive to the needs of the banking supervision. Training would also be useful for management to
enhance leadership capacity.

5.      When security permits, on site inspection should focus on risks. Increased attention should be
directed to credit organization and policy, concentration of credit, source of funding, risk management
system, IT system and internal controls. On site process should be upgraded to meet the risk-based
supervision requirements: (i) before the mission in sharing information with off-site supervision and the
macro-surveillance unit; during the mission in staffing the team with relevant people (especially regarding
IT); and (ii) after the mission in setting up a collegial body for reviewing the inspection findings, and
dealing in full transparency with inspection follow-up and enforcement. The CBI should also develop
guidelines to conduct standardized on-site examinations. Generally, on-site surveillance also gained
greater efficiency by sending to the concerned parties an "introductory letter" that aims at gathering the
relevant data and information before the on-site examinations start.



                                                    94
6.      The CBI should provide the inspectors with new IT tools giving them access to databases
from On Going Surveillance. On-site examiners should use those tools to run their credit risk controls
and the inspection teams will have to update the database with the data collected on the field. This type of
feedback will help strengthen and improve the On-Going Surveillance reports credit institutions along a
CAMELS based approach.

7.        Inspection teams need more trained personnel, particularly in the fields of IT and on a
medium term basis market risks. This new working environment would make significant progress on
credit risk analysis which is the main risk of the banking system in Iraq. However old habits die hard and
it will take some more time to move from a compliance approach to a fully risk-oriented banking on-site
monitoring where qualitative assessments on bank's functioning complements the compliant approach.
Continuing training sessions should be planned for the next months in various aspects of the on-site
examinations and especially to better assess bank strategies and risk management systems.

8.       A new IT system should help On Going Surveillance focus on critical issues for an enhanced
decision making process. A new IT system would need to be implemented on a timely basis to increase
efficiency and productivity. More specifically, the CBI would analyze the IT supervisory needs
(hardware, software, protocol for data collection and data administration, etc.) including the possibility to
store all official banking financial statements. In addition, both on site, and off site supervision must work
together to create a continuous, seamless supervisory cycle. The off site supervision must also develop
new tools to focus on critical issues for an enhanced decision making process (peer comparison analysis,
Camels' model analysis, Early Warning System etc...). To this purpose, the CBI has to redesign the
framework of the supervisory information flow and build a new MIS. With a new IT system being
implemented at the CBI, a risk-oriented report regarding the strategy and the overall performance of a
credit institution could be worked out. This CAMELS typed approach report would constitute a
comprehensive review of the banks. Produced on an annual basis, those reports will cover all risks
inherent in the bank's activities, including both quantitative (key figures regarding the bank's financial
position, based inter-alias on the yearly balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, along with peer
comparisons, market shares) and qualitative information (facts about main shareholders, description of the
main business activities, corporate governance, analysis of the earnings sustainability, solvency, liquidity
and market risks). In a nutshell, this annual report is designed to convey the banks' overall risk profile.

9.       A macro-prudential surveillance unit should be set up in a financial stability perspective. . The
key deliverable for this unit would be an annual Banking Sector Review. This review would deliver a
comprehensive analysis of the banking sector in dealing with macroeconomic and financial markets
developments, banking sector structure, earnings and profitability, capital adequacy, asset quality,
liquidity and other risks, and regulatory and supervisory developments. Its purpose is to address the key
developments, risks and vulnerabilities, as well as the assessment on the resilience of the Iraqi banking
sector. This initiative, in line with the Basel best practices aims at enhancing the market discipline, thanks
to a greater disclosure of the banking sector issues.

10.      All those elements should, in the long run, help the CBI develop an Early Warning System
enabling an adequate, proactive framework to deal with problem banks. In particular, it should help
the CBI in determining the levels of capital ratios as well as best suited remedial measures to address
particular events or risk profile of credit institutions. In addition to the work already accomplished, a
broad range of analysis may be needed to assess the banks capital and their ability to sustain non expected
losses, assuming that their provisions would be sufficient to cover the expected losses. The CBE should
also formalize transparent guidelines on crisis management to deal with problem banks. It would include
taking control of a bank in distress, imposing a moratorium, restructuring the bank's liabilities,



                                                     95
transferring all or part of its business to another bank or to a special purpose entity, and providing lender
of last resort facilities.

11.      Since the end of July 2008, as part of the new Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF,
Iraq has completed a first set of prudential regulations65 for commercial banks. In line with the new
regulation underway, banks, especially public sector banks66, would have to improve their credit risk
policies and develop systems for extending credit, reviewing and classifying loans, and defining realistic
provisioning needs. Regarding connected and directed lending, measures should be taken to ensure that
banks have in place an independent decision making process that would preclude conflicts of interest and
enforce arms length lending policies.

The main issues are reviewed thereafter.

12.      (a) Lending policy. The CBI has to vet fully the implementation by the banks of their lending
policies. These lending policies have to be comprehensive, prudent, and consistent with a sound
management of bank's activity. Furthermore, it is crucial to assess the skills and knowledge of the staff in
charge of credit approval, and check if banks have adequate systems to control and monitor the
implementation of such policies.

13.      (b) Loan evaluation and loan loss provisioning. The new classification will improve the
accurate knowledge of the bank loan portfolio. For the implementation of the new classification of loans,
training sessions are needed for credit officers and banking supervision examiners. This implies also that
banks have in place a credit organization and credit management systems in compliance with the new
regulation (in particular, a good credit administration). As a result, banks have to improve their systems
for granting credit, for reviewing and classifying loans, and for determining realistic provisions. The main
outstanding issues relate to how to get from companies accurate, and up-to-date financial statements with
all needed information.

14.      (c) Large exposure. The aggregation of all the large exposures must not exceed eight times the
capital base. It is necessary to provide banks with an extensive definition of close related parties. Banks
must in a comprehensive way identify and monitor credit exposures to closely related groups on the basis
of such specific guidelines.

15.      (d) Connected and directed lending. Procedures must be set up to prevent persons benefiting
from a loan from participating in the preparation of the loan assessment or in the related decision-making
process. These loans have to be approved by the Board of directors. Banks have to develop risk
management rules, procedures and information systems for lending to connected parties in order to avoid
conflicts of interest. The new regulation should also address directed lending with regards to state-owned
banks in particular. In addition, specific guidelines should be issued to improve corporate governance in
public banks and ensure that loans are made on the basis of borrower creditworthiness and debt service
capacity

16.      (e) Internal control and audit. As CBI cannot rely only on the external auditors since the quality
of their report is uneven, internal control regulation system appears to be critical. CBI would need to
enhance the quality of internal control and audit in banks and ensure bank's top and middle management

65
   This included: (i) licensing requirement processes; (ii) minimum capital requirements; (iii) loan classification and provisioning;
(iv) large exposures; (v) connected lending (transactions with related parties); (vi) investment in securities and real estates; (vii)
lending policy; (viii) internal control; (ix) compliance function; and (x) risk management.
66
   A banking restructuring action plan would support Rafidain and Rasheed banks in redesigning and implementing a new risk
management process.

                                                                 96
commitment to the process. CBI would need to support through specific guidelines what is an accurate
and comprehensive internal control system based on risk management. Consolidated supervision would
also need to be enhanced and brought in line with international standards. The setting up of a legal and
regulation unit with particular skills in the legal and accounting fields would be instrumental.

17.      Under the second set of the prudential regulations, efforts should be directed to implement
a new framework for addressing operational risk and related issues, and market risks. Currently,
there are no guidelines from CBI to ensure that banks have in place procedures and systems for
identifying, managing and monitoring operational risk. In this regard, the CBI has to develop specialized
IT examinations focusing on areas such as information system management, computer operations,
computer security, system development and networking, for fighting against fraud and keeping safe the
business activity. Existing policies and practices for inspection should be updated to become forward-
looking and risk-based with a focus on new issues such as operational risk and internal controls. On a
medium term basis, developments of financial markets would call for taking steps to control market risks.
There are still no limits to equities trading and investment, and no guidelines for banks to deal with these
risks, notably in stress testing. Capital adequacy ratio does not take into account market risks. Regarding
the FX and interest rate risks, CBI has to ensure that banks have in place adequate information systems to
identify accurately these risks. In coordination with IMF banking supervision experts, CBI has to propose
regulation amendments or new rules when appropriate.
