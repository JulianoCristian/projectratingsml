Sustainability Development Policy Loan\n            Project for Iraq were as follows: outcomes was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: This operation confirmed the importance of\n            linking the Development Policy Lending with (a) solid\n            analytical work and (b) with investment and technical\n            assistance operations, especially in the fragile environment\n            applicable in Iraq. Both applied in this case, and have been\n            a key requirement for the relative success of this\n            operation. The conflict situation and fragile policy\n            environment in Iraq makes almost any operation a high risk\n            operation in terms of achieving its outcomes. This operation\n            assumed risks, especially fiduciary risks but also\n            substantial, program\u2016 risks. It has been important to assume\n            these risks to achieve the progress made, even if this\n            judgment will be contentious. As the Lesson Learned section\n            of the project document states (paragraph 131), risks\n            should, however be mitigated. A proper analysis of risk\n            mitigation options is important and could lead in the\n            process to possible adjustments of the overall operations,\n            making the overall undertaking more successful, as risks and\n            risks mitigation strategies or options would have been\n            clarified. There is a need to be realistic in countries\n            facing conflict and a fragile situation like in Iraq. The\n            encompassing procurement and the social safety net reform\n            envisaged by this operation within more or less one year\n            would have been very ambitious under normal circumstances.\n            Realism would need to be translated into a more step-by-step\n            reform approach, a more gradual or incremental reform\n            process, which by itself could also lead to the definition\n            of more precise (and realistic) outcome indicators. This\n            seems also to be in line with the lessons learned as\n            expressed in the project document. Another way to become\n            more realistic in situations like the one in Iraq would be\n            to make more active use of political economy analysis\n            especially concerning the largest reform elements. Politics\n            is always dominant in fragile situations and institutions,\n            by definition, underperform. It is therefore not only\n            important to know what constitutes good or better policies\n            in a given situation, but it is also important to know about\n            what range of reform is feasible in a given time period, and\n            how the incentives for reform are distributed. This would\n            positively impact the risk assessment as well as inform the\n            operation\u2018s design. It must have been difficult to monitor\n            or supervise this operation in the given Iraqi environment\n            where a proper monitoring environment does not yet exist,\n            and collaboration across institutions is difficult, among\n            others because of the fragmented political situation. In\n            such a situation more reliance is then on the operation\u2018s\n            own monitoring framework and its design. It is therefore\n            recommended to critically assess the monitoring framework\n            and outcome indicators as well as the monitoring design for\n            future operations in light of the weak country system. It\n            would also have been recommendable to agree on a verifiable\n            monitoring arrangement for the main implementation agency."}, "docdt": "2012-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
