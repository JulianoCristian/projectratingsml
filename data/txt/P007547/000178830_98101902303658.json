efforts to stimulate an increased\n            level of industrial investment, (b) improve Mexico's\n            balance of payments through providing term credit to\n            industrial projects that lead to exports or substitute\n            imports efficiently, and (c) promote industrial efficiency\n            by encouraging industrial enterprises to prepare detailed\n            feasibility studies of their projects and banks to base\n            their lending decisions on a careful appraisal of the\n            projects. FONEI will provide medium and long term financing\n            to industrial enterprises through the commercial banking\n            system to help finance machinery, equipment and other fixed\n            assets for projects which will improve Mexico's balance\n            of payments by increasing exports of goods or services or by\n            substituting imports efficiently. The Bank loan will finance\n            the foreign exchange component of FONEI's financing\n            over a period of about two years."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
