Bank and\n            Borrower performances both were highly satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned pertaining to judicial reform were thus: Efforts to\n            successfully assist judical reform processes may require\n            holistic, carefully sequenced measures in order to deal with\n            the sometimes closed nature and other characteristics of\n            some judiciaries. The process might also involve winning the\n            collaboration of diverse stakeholders and other concerned\n            groups. Judicial reform efforts may also require a\n            multi-faceted program. In this case, court and political\n            leaders initially sought assistance for buildings,\n            computers, and training. But not all envisioned or\n            immediately supported the behavioral changes needed to make\n            judicial output more efficient, predictable, equitable, and\n            subject to transparent rules. Forcefully and transparently\n            addressing problems of corruption among judges and court\n            staff can make a substantial contribution to judicial\n            reform, especially in countries where justice services are\n            poor and inequitable. The Venezuelan authorities followed\n            the Constitutional changes with measures to discharge judges\n            who had been fairly criticized,televised proceedings on\n            selection of new judges, and tightened disciplinary\n            standards and activities. Another general lesson was for the\n            Bank, as a global knowledge institution, to creatively\n            leverage its contacts and expertise to involve others in partnership-and-capacity-building."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
