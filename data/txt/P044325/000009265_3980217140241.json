          aims at improving the performance of the Supreme Court in\n            terms of transparency, efficiency of administration and case\n            management, and timeliness of decisions, through development\n            of new work methods, attitudes, and behavior that would have\n            a demonstration effect in leading further judicial reform.\n            The project consists of four components. First, the\n            communications, policy research, and quality assurance\n            component will provide support to develop a program to\n            improve the institutional capabilities of the Supreme Court.\n            Second, the caseload administration component will\n            restructure the Court's internal organization, work\n            practices and behavior, as well as administrative procedures\n            to improve case-handling and preparation of decisions.\n            Third, the Supreme Court's decision dissemination\n            component will evaluate existing arrangements for\n            publication of decisions, establish information kiosks, and\n            train staff to develop publication capabilities. Fourth, the\n            administrative and management support component will\n            streamline organizational structure, computerize\n            administrative support functions, institutionalize strategic\n            planning, and develop monitoring and evaluation capabilities."}, "docdt": "1997-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
