                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the findings of the implementation support visit conducted from October 21 to 23, 2013. All activities planned under the Additional Financing (AF), are completed or
                         currently being implemented by both entities. Most Project Development Objective indicators are on track.

                         Implementation of activities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) have shown significant progress in all components.

                         Program of Additional Training (PAT) in Family Medicine has been provided and final examination was formally approved. Additional training on Family Medicine will continue to be
                         delivered in accordance with contracts with Community Health Care Centers in Sarajevo, Zenica, Mostar, and Tuzla. Under the Family Medicine Specialization Program, the Family
                         Medicine Training Centers continue to provide training for 57 Family Medicine Specialization Program residents.

                         enrolled and implementation is on track. Implementation is on track.
                         A total of 44 additional Family Medicine ambulantas (PHC clinics) have been refurbished and 55 equipped. Development of information system for Primary Health Care is also on
                         track.

                         In Component 2 – Health Sector Management Capacity Development. Teaching aids and IT equipment have been procured for Sarajevo and Mostar.
                         In Component 3 – Health Policy Formulation and Project Support. A total of 17 sub-projects (out of 68 applications received) were selected and contracts were developed to
                         implement these innovative sub-projects. The field work for the survey of the population’s health status and risk factor for NCDs is completed and final report will be ready by the end
                         of this year.

                         In Republica Sprska (RS), activities are also on track in accordance with the updated Procurement Plan.
                         In Component 1. All works under this Project are completed.
                         While only 36 FM team have valid accreditation, the training and process to accreditate the remaining FM teams was re-launched and it is expected that 240 teams would complete
                         the process by the end of the Project.
                         The only pending activity is the development and dissemination of clinical guidelines, which is planned by 2014.
                         In Component 2. The training program is on track. The number of professionals being trained by the Public Health Institute’s Health Management Center is slightly larger than the
                         number included in the contract. An additional training on hospital waste management is expected to be implemented as well.
                         In Component 3. No further progress has been made under this component since the last implementation support mission in March 2013. The new RS PHC strategy has been
                         updated and is now part of the overall RS Strategy, which reflects all sectors and Line Ministries’ contributions. The Strategy has been completed and sent out for comments but has
                         not yet been formally adopted
