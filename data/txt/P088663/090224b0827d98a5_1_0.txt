                         All activities planned under the Additional Financing (AF) have been completed or are currently being implemented by both entities. Progress toward achieving the Project
                         Development Objectives indicators indicates that 4 out of 5 indicators have been achieved and 1 partially achieved. In addition, most of the intermediate outcome indicators are also
                         achieved or on track to be achieved.

                         The four pilots to promote preventive services for Non-Communicable Diseases by introducing pay-for-performance have been implemented during the period January – December,

                         2013. The final report was submitted to the Bank. The main finding shows a significant greater performance of the 50 teams receiving the payment incentives. The reporting system
                         developed for the pilots has been adopted as standard reporting system. This new reporting system (and software) was very well accepted by the Family Medicine (FM) teams
                         because it allows the teams to analyze their own performance and also to better report their activities. In addition, one of the Cantonal health insurance funds is analyzing the
                         possibility of including similar incentive in the new contract with FM teams.

                         In addition to the planned activities, the Project financed additional works and medical equipment to repair some health facilities that were damaged during the natural disaster that
                         affected BiH in May and June 2014. The Project also financed some supplies needed for sanitation and outbreak control activities. The IDA portion of the Project is ending in
                         December 31, 2014, but additional activities financed under CEB funds will continue.
