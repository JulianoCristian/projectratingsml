F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall development objective of the project is to improve overall results for non-
communicable diseases as measured by proxy indicators and: (i) enhance health system efficiency
through restructuring and strengthening of primary health care along the family medicine model;
and (ii) strengthen the policy making process through the development and implementation of a
system for monitoring and evaluating health sector performance.



                                                    ii
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was simplified at the time of the Additional Financing as follows: (i) expand and enhance
the family medicine model of primary health care; (ii) build management capacity in the sector;
and (iii) strengthen the policy making process through the development and implementation of a
system for monitoring and evaluating sector performance.

                          xiv
1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Health Sector Enhancement Project (HSEP) was
approved on March 31, 2005. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA), in the amount of
SDR11.2 million (US$17.0 million equivalent), was signed on September 5, 2005 and the project
became effective on April 3, 2006. The original Closing Date of December 15, 2010 was first
extended to June 15, 2011, to allow processing of a project Additional Financing (AF). Project
AF was approved on March 22, 2011, in an amount of SDR 6.5 million (US$9.5 million
equivalent). As a result, a second extension of the project Closing Date was granted, until
December 31, 2014. The additional funds were to allow scaling up of key original Project activities
as well as supporting the implementation of certain new activities.

2.     The Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) co-financed the original project in the
amount of US$14.0 million. In addition, CEB reached an agreement with the government to co-
finance the project AF in the amount of US$10.0 million. Ratification of the CEB Legal
Agreement by the government was completed on July 2014. Hence, the Closing Date of the CEB
AF has been extended to December 31, 2015.

1.1    Context at Appraisal

3.      Country and Sector background. At project appraisal in 2005, BiH had become a
member of the Council of Europe and had started the long road toward European Union (EU)
accession and membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Partnership for
Peace Program (PFP). The country saw enhanced internal harmonization of the relatively
autonomous sub-national Entities, while strengthening the coordination functions of BiH’s central
State. With strong support from the international community, BiH made impressive progress in
post-war reconstruction and in economic, social, and political integration. However, BiH
continued to face a difficult economic situation, with GDP still only three-quarters of its pre-war
level and growth not sufficiently strong to make a dent in the high unemployment. As most other
sectors, health sector faced a number of challenges. The burden of disease was high and the
epidemiological profile largely dominated by non-communicable diseases (NCD). In addition, the
existing organization of the health sector required significant adjustments to ensure that the system
would be able to cope with impeding demographic and epidemiological changes, as well as
growing population expectations.

4.      Main Health Sector Issues. Challenges faced by the health system in BiH were related
to key areas, such as: (i) financial sustainability, (ii) inefficient organization model and service
delivery; (iii) limited institutional capacity and institutional fragmentation; and (iv) unequal access
to health care. The country epidemiological profile was largely dominated by non-communicable
diseases (NCD), with 50 percent of deaths being attributed to cardio-vascular disorders and about
20 percent to cancers. BiH ischemic heart disease rate (160 per 100,000) was the highest in the
Southeast Europe (SEE) region. Road accidents, injuries (including from landmines) and suicides
were at high levels and on the rise. With a rapidly ageing population, increasing mental health
issues and levels of tobacco and alcohol consumption, pollution and road accidents, the burden of
disease was expected to further increase.



                                                  1
5.      The 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) provided an overall vision for the
health sector and its main reform goals. Major health gains, improvements in service delivery and
financial savings were deemed to be achievable through working on three main axes: (i)
reconfiguring the health care delivery system, reducing inefficiencies and improving quality in the
delivery of care; (ii) reforming health financing; and (iii) building institutional capacity. The
project was conceptualized based on key pillars of the reform, and thus focused on supporting the
government efforts in two main areas: (i) the expansion of already tested family medicine pilots;
and (ii) promotion of a number of innovative features, including: (a) development and
implementation of a comprehensive reform program for PHC through family medicine expansion,
including rationalization of health centers; (b) development of structures and processes for
discussing strategic and management issues and reviewing sector performance; (c) strengthening
of management and implementation capacities for future use of country systems and fiduciary
processes; and (d) addressing political economy issues through support for consultation,
communications, and public relations campaigns to ensure that the public and policy makers are
informed about changes in the delivery system and the overall reform.

6.      Country Partnership Strategy and Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank was
the main supporter for the health system reform in the country. Under the third pillar of the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 2004): “investing in key social and economic infrastructure”,
one of the key objectives and expected outcomes was: improved health sector management and
better access to quality health care. The project was fully consistent with this CAS goal. The
Bank pursued an integrated approach for the assistance to health sector. It acquired considerable
cross-sector knowledge of the country through implementation of adjustment and investment
operations and economic sector work. The Bank was a partner of the government since the Dayton
Peace Agreement and has been regarded by the government as an important partner not just for its
direct support to the sector but also to help leverage additional funds from other bilateral and
international agencies.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The overall development objective of the project (as per PAD) was to improve overall
results for non-communicable diseases as measured by proxy indicators and: (i) enhance health
system efficiency through restructuring and strengthening of primary health care along the family
medicine model; and (ii) strengthen the policy making process through the development and
implementation of a system for monitoring and evaluating health sector performance.

8.      The wording of the Project Development Objective (PDO) was consistent throughout the
main text and Annex 3 of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). However, there is a difference
between the PDO’s wording in the PAD compared to the DCA. The PDO in the DCA is
formulated as: “enhance health system efficiency by expanding and enhancing the family medicine
model of primary health care, building management capacity in the sector and strengthening the
policy making process through the development and implementation of a system for monitoring
and evaluating sector performance and addressing inefficiencies of the sector”. The PDO wording
in the PAD includes “improving overall results for non-communicable diseases”, which is not part
of the PDO in the DCA. Meanwhile, the PDO in the DCA states: “building management capacity
in the sector” as part of the PDO, which is not included in the PDO stated in the PAD.



                                                2
      The PDO indicators were:

•     Improved efficiency and equity in the planning, financing and regulations of the health service
      delivery system,
•     Improved access to quality primary health care throughout the country,
•     Decreased number of unnecessary referrals to higher levels of care, and
•     Number of primary care providers financed under new provider payment mechanisms.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.      When the Additional Financing was processed, the project was restructured to address the
need to: (i) simplify the PDO language; and (ii) revise the project results framework. The PDO
wording referred to the original PDO in the DCA (since this was considered the “legal” language 1)
and was stated as: “(i) expand and enhance the family medicine model of primary health care; (ii)
build management capacity in the sector; and (iii) strengthen the policy making process through
the development and implementation of a system for monitoring and evaluating sector
performance”. Meanwhile, the project RF was revised, aiming at fine-tuning, based on available
information, and taking into consideration (in time and scope) the new activities under the AF
(details in the datasheet).

1.4        Main Beneficiaries

10.      Entire population of the BiH was targeted to be the main beneficiary of a better access,
utilization and quality of services, offered by a restructured primary health care. Most of Family
Medicine (FM) teams, including FM doctors and nurses, were to benefit from project support to
strengthen their capacity and adopt to the PHC reform. In addition, the PHC services were to
benefit from the project through significant upgrading of most centers (physical rehabilitation,
furnishing and supplying with medical equipment), providing the FM doctors and nurses with
necessary tools to adequately carry out their tasks. Hospital and PHC managers were to benefit
from capacity building in management area, with regard to quality improvements, regulations,
resource management, etc. Also, the MoHs and key health institutions in both entities were to
benefit from project support in strengthening the capacity for further sector reforming, including
strengthening the M&E systems.

1.5        Original Components

11.        The Project included three components:

Component 1 - Primary Health Care Restructuring: The objective of this component was to
support the government to restructure primary health care, addressing sectorial inefficiencies and
ready the sector to deal in a cost effective manner with core health issues such as the growing
burden of NCD. The component would support the restructuring of the traditional narrow
specialist based primary care system into family medicine units that would ultimately have the

    Project restructuring slightly simplified the language of the PDO as per project DCA, without revising it substantially.

                                                             3
capacity to address 80 percent of the country’s health needs, thus significantly reducing the
unnecessary high rate of cases treated at hospitals. The component would support: (i)
implementation of training programs in FM for doctors and nurses, including family medicine
specialization and the Program for Additional Training (PAT); (ii) training of faculty of the FM
Cathedra in the universities; (iii) limited refurbishing and equipping of FM facilities to provide
retrained family physicians with the minimum tools necessary to adequately carry out their job;
and (iv) communication activities to inform policy makers, providers and the public about the
reform. The curriculum for FM specialization and for the PAT would be adjusted to address more
deeply preventive services to allow FM teams to expand their scope of work.

Component 2 - Improvement of Health Sector Management Capacity: The overall aim of the
component was to support ongoing efforts in the sector to build capacity to manage and implement
essential changes in service delivery at different levels of the health system. The component aimed
to build on development and implementation of health management training initiated under Basic
Health Project (BHP). The training and professional development programs would include: (i)
training in management and oversight for hospital managers and board members, and health
centers’ managers; (ii) change management training for FM teams leading to the development of
restructuring plans for specific PHC facilities; (iii) academic degree training (Master’s and PhD
programs) for faculty of health management; and (iv) development of purchasing and contracting
skills for staff of the health insurance funds to support the expansion of health finance reforms to
be piloted under the Bank financed Social Insurance Technical Assistance Project (SITAP). In
addition, the component would provide technical assistance to carry out an accounting and internal
control review of the Health Insurance Funds (Entity and a sample of cantonal HIFs) and a sample
of the largest (in terms of expenditures) providers in each Entity with the objective to clearly
identify control gaps and devise steps to improve transparency and accountability in the use of
funds.

Component 3 – Health Policy Formulation and Project Support: The aim of this component was
to strengthen the capacity for data collection and analysis in support of sector policy formulation
and to guide priority setting and resource allocation. The component would help introduce regular
sector performance reviews. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities would support the data
and study needs of MoHs to develop reports/information required for policy and strategic
purposes. To this end, the component would support the development and implementation of a
system for monitoring and evaluating sector performance and improving the dialogue among
governments, local stakeholders and external partners. The component would support: (i) the
definition of a list of sector wide indicators and the organization of surveys and studies on key
issues, (ii) the preparation and organization of sector performance reviews; and (iii) the
organization of "health summits" at which the results of the performance reviews would be
discussed. The reviews would be conducted during the first part of each year to ensure that
recommendations from the “health reviews" can be taken into account during the preparation of
annual work programs and budgets for the succeeding year. The component would also support
health innovation funds through which grants would be made available on a competitive basis to
support: (i) jump-starting of hospital sector restructuring following the completion of hospital
rationalization plans under SITAP; (ii) improvements in the continuum of care; and (iii) NGOs
and youth organizations to develop and implement initiatives related to innovative public health
interventions.

1.7       Other significant changes

12.     Project Additional Financing and Restructuring. An AF was approved in an amount
of SDR 6.5 million (US$ 9.5 million equivalent) on March 22, 2011, to scale-up activities of the
original HSEP and enhance its impact and development effectiveness. The additional funds were
mainly to support expansion of certain original activities as well as a number of new activities.
The AF was considered the best tool to complete the primary health care restructuring, without
any significant disruption in on-going activities. The AF was fully supported by the BiH
government, as clearly shown in the Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (FY08 – FY11).
At the same time, the HSEP went through a level II restructuring, to:

      •    Simplify the language of the PDO as per the DCA, and revise the RF. The PDO wording
           was defined as: “ (i) expand and enhance the family medicine model of primary health
           care; (ii) build management capacity in the sector; and (iii) strengthen the policy making
           process through the development and implementation of a system for monitoring and
           evaluating sector performance” (as indicated under Section 1.3). Meanwhile, the project
           RF was revised, aiming at adjusting key indicators towards outcomes that were measurable
           and more closely aligned with Project activities. The following outcome indicators were
           dropped, namely: (i) improved efficiency and equity in the planning, financing and
           regulation of the health service delivery system; (ii) improved access to quality primary
           health care throughout the country; (iii) decreased number of unnecessary referrals to
           higher levels of care; and (iv) number of primary care providers financed under new
           provider payment mechanisms. A number of intermediate indicators also were dropped.
           New outcome and intermediate indicators were included and new target values were
           defined, as per the revised Project Closing Date.

      •    Reallocate original Credit proceeds (Table 1). The reallocation was needed to: (i) allocate
           funds from the Unallocated category towards Goods and Works that have been included in
           the primary health care restructuring; (ii) reallocate 7 percent of Credit funds from the
           Training to Consultants Services category (to correct previous financing of training from
           consultancy funds, during original project); and (iii) reallocate 8 percent of the Credit funds
           to the Goods category from the Innovation Grants and incremental costs, resulting from
           the reduction in the number of Innovation Grants awarded.

      •    Change the environmental safeguards category from C to B. The scaled-up Project
           triggered Bank’s Environmental Safeguards Policy 4.01. Due to the nature of the works
           planned to be supported under the AF, including significant rehabilitation and
           reconstruction of PHC facilities, the Environmental Rating was upgraded from category C
           to B.

      •    Extend the Project Closing Date. The first extension of the project Closing Date was done
           for six months (from December 15, 2010 to June 15, 2011), granted prior the AF, aiming
           at allowing enough time for the preparation and approval of the Project AF. With the AF,
           a second extension of the Closing Date was granted, adjusting it to December 31, 2014.

13.    The AF supported the following project components/activities:

Component 1 – Primary Health Care Restructuring. The AF would support scaling up of
activities related to: training programs in FM for doctors and nurses, including specialization in
the PAT; Master’s and PhD programs in FM (only for the FBiH); development of additional
clinical guidelines according to needs identified by FM practitioners (in the RS); increasing the
number of rehabilitated, equipped and furnished FM offices and ambulantas and scaling up
communication activities focused on the provision of the preventive programs (only for the FBiH).
In addition, a number of new activities were approved, including: support to the Institute of Public
Health in the FBiH to develop programs and monitoring tools for targeted non-communicable
disease preventive programs; piloting incentive based payments for provision of preventive
services in the FBiH; supporting the community nurses in the FBiH through training and provision
                                                 6
of minimum equipment; developing the rules for the health information standards in the FBiH;
and supporting accreditation process of FM teams through the Agency for Accreditation and
Quality Improvement.

Component 2 – Improvement of Health Sector Management Capacity: The AF would provide
further technical assistance for scaling-up training for hospital managers and health centers’
managers in the RS; provide change management training for the FM teams in the RS; and scale-
up academic training (Master’s and PhD programs) for faculty of health management in the RS.
Also, providing support for the institutionalization of the Health Management Centers was newly
included (short-term courses for health managers, refurbishing of the teaching rooms and premises,
equipment and technical assistance).

Component 3 - Health Policy Formulation and Project Support: The AF would continue to
support further development and implementation of a system for monitoring and evaluating health
sector performance and improving health policy dialogue among stakeholders, in both RS and
FBiH (including organization of Health Summits). The AF would also support the functioning of
the PCUs in both entities, including incremental operating costs, consultant services, training and
workshops.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The ICR team rates design and quality at entry as Moderately Satisfactory, based on the following:

14.      Financing Instrument. The project was financed from an original IDA Credit of SDR
11.2 million (US$17.0 million equivalent) and an Additional Financing IDA Credit of SDR 6.5
million (US$9.5 million equivalent), using a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) instrument. In
addition, the project benefited from a co-financing from the CEB, in the amount of US$14.0
million. A SIL was considered the most appropriate instrument, based on the fact that the designed
activities (mainly infrastructure upgrading and equipping the PHC facilities, as well as extensive
capacity building) would be most effectively accomplished through investment lending instrument.

15.      Soundness of background analyses. The project was prepared by a large team of experts.
This was the fourth in a planned series of four operations in support of BiH’s health sector recovery
and development program. Project preparation benefited significantly from the lessons learned
during the implementation of the Basic Health Project (the third operation in support of health
sector, closed in June 30, 2004). In addition, the team carefully considered key analyses and
priorities extracted from the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (prepared by the
government in 2003). Also, results of a Bank’s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in-depth
study on four completed health projects in ECA (published a year prior to project preparation),
were carefully considered by the team 2.




2
  Key lessons learned include the following: (i) great attention needs to be paid to political economy of the reform in
the health sector; (ii) simple projects with relatively uncomplicated implementation arrangements are more likely to
succeed; (iii) health sector reform is a lengthy, politicized process and expectations for the reform process in
                                                           7
16.     Assessment of Project Design. A number of alternatives were considered during project
preparation. The first alternative was having a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp). The feasibility of
adapting a SWAp approach was discussed at length, including during the Quality Enhancement
Review (QER). However, due to issues related to: (i) institutional fragmentation and weak
capacity; (ii) lack of a single-operational and budget framework; and (iii) insufficient knowledge
donors had on the sector financial management and procurement arrangements; it was decided not
to move away from the traditional project approach and engage with other partners in a SWAp. A
second alternative was proceeding with a narrow project, focusing only on expanding family
medicine. Although this was the preferred option for the FBiH government at first, during the
design process it became apparent that the project should also address the need to deepen the
reform and integrate various elements into a comprehensive approach to sector development.
Finally, expanding the scope of the project was also considered, including the areas of public health
and accreditation, previously supported by the Basic Health Project. Yet, this alternative was not
opted by the government, since the reforms in these areas were considered sustained, due to
support provided under an EU-financed project.

17.    Based on the existing government strategy for development of the health sector (under the
2003 PRSP), a wide range of issues were identified and discussed by the team during the design
phase. However, the project was designed to focus on the most critical issues, with a long-term
outlook towards implementing the health sector strategy.

18.      Project design was the outcome of a thorough assessment of health sector needs and a
cautious preparation. The team was successful in designing a project focused on key sector
priorities. Yet, the design failed to put in place an appropriate monitoring and evaluation system
for the project. This was a significant shortcoming, which negatively impacted the achievement
of project main outcomes and outputs. In addition, although critical risks and related mitigation
measures were clearly assessed during the design phase, the team overvalued the existing local
capacity and neglected the risk posed by the highly fragmented nature of the health services,
especially in the FBiH.

2.2       Implementation

19.      The ICR team rates overall implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. The project was
successful in achieving most of its expected outcomes and delivering the outputs specified under
the three components. Project start up suffered from delays. While the project was approved on
March 31, 2005, followed by signature of the Legal Agreement on September 5, 2005, the
effectiveness date was extended twice from its original deadline of December 4, 2005, to April 4,
2006 for the Republika Srpska (RS) and September 7, 2006 for the Federation. Nonetheless, the
initial phase of project implementation was rated as Satisfactory for both Development Objective
(DO) and Implementation Progress (IP).




previous projects have been too optimistic; (iv) institutional aspects of reform are as important as technically
proficient strategies; and (v) close coordination among institutions is key to the success of a project.

                                                           8
20.    However, only few months after effectiveness the project DO and IP were
downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory. The downgrade was largely based on slower than
expected progress in project implementation and stated project development objectives.

21.     Implementation progress at this stage was negatively influenced by the following key
factors: (i) considerable delays in mainstreaming of functions of the Project Coordination Units
(PCU) in their respective MoHs and the necessary capacity building within the institutions; and
(ii) highly fragmented nature of the health systems, especially in the Federation, requiring
significant efforts for coordination and consensus-building among cantons. In the Federation of
BiH (FBiH) the responsibility for health services has been delegated to the cantons, so the FBiH
health sector includes the FBiH MoH, the 10 cantonal MoHs, the Federal Health Insurance Fund
(HIF), the 10 cantonal HIFs and 11 Institutes of Public Health. While the Republic of Srpska (RS)
health system has been (and remains) centralized at the entity level, so responsibility is shared only
between the RS MoH, a single HIF and a single Institute of Public Health.

22.     The situation improved, especially close to the project MTR (September 2008). The MTR
noted that the PDO as well as overall project design remained valid. With more than 40 percent
of funds disbursed and almost 80percent contracted by the time of MTR, project implementation
was upgraded to Satisfactory. Meanwhile, the achievement of project development objectives was
kept at Moderately Satisfactory, due to: (i) slow progress in the registration of the population by
the Family Medicine, especially in the FBiH; and (ii) lack of proper evidence in the RS on
improved efficiency with information on referral trends not being still available. Following the
project MTR, two main issues were addressed, which positively influenced in further improving
project implementation: (i) dropping financing of grants to NGOs for public health related
activities (re-focusing attention on more important activities); and (ii) completion of required
information for the revised project RF. As requested by the Bank management and agreed with
the government prior to the project MTR, the task team significantly revised key performance
indicators in the project RF and started to collect all required baseline data and agree on target
values.

23.     The project continued to perform satisfactorily until the original Closing Date,
December 15, 2010. Six months before the original closing date, disbursement had reached 89
per cent of the total Credit allocation, while the remaining Credit funds were committed for
activities that were under implementation. At this stage, an Additional Financing (IDA Credit)
was approved in March 22, 2011 in the amount of US$9.5 million (following a six months
project extension for allowing the preparation of the AF). The AF was already discussed and
agreed with the government and reflected in the Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report
(FY08-FY11), in order to scale-up activities of the HSEP and enhance its impact and development
effectiveness. The AF, which had very strong support of the BiH government, was considered as
a best mechanism to maximize development impact and results than a repeater project, a new
operation, or non-lending instruments. In parallel, the project went also through a level II
restructuring (as detailed in Section 1.7).

24.     The overall performance of the project AF was satisfactory. Only a year after AF approval,
the rating for the achievement of the DO was upgraded to Satisfactory, while the implementation
performance remained at satisfactory. AF implementation faced some challenges, including: (i)
delays in implementation of the IT activities in the FBiH, mainly due to lack of proper capacity.
Following the hiring of technical assistance (firm) to support the IT implementation, the activity
                                                  9
was successfully completed; and (ii) significant delay in signing the agreement with the CEB, for
the AF. In order to bridge this shortcoming, the Bank had to modify procurement plans to allow
main activities to be financed mainly by IDA (while originally planned to be co-financed); and
(iii) uncertain financial situation, especially for the RS, due to accumulated hospital arrears, could
risk the required support to project implementation. 3 However, despite issues and delays during
implementation, the performance of the AF remained satisfactory.

25.       Key positive factors that influenced the overall project performance, included:

          (i)      Strong government commitment to reform the health sector. Despite relatively
                   weak capacity in BiH, fragmented nature and diffusion of authority of the health
                   systems in the FBiH, the government has continuously displayed a strong
                   commitment towards reforming the existing system and a clear strategic vision in
                   the sector.
          (ii)     Continuous coordination with other international organizations. The project kept
                   close coordination with other donors and international organizations. Apart from
                   the support offered by the CEB, a long partner of the Bank and BiH government
                   has been the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). Following the
                   project MTR, an assessment of the improvement towards quality and continuity of
                   primary health care in the RS was carried out, with the support of the Bank as well
                   as CIDA funding. In addition, the RS, with CIDA support, carried out an evaluation
                   of the relative efficiency of the PHC providers.

2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

26.      Design. The RF in the PAD proved to be ambitious, especially for the project key
performance indicators, in terms of monitoring and achieving them. The original RF missed the
baseline data and most target values for key performance indicators and some intermediate
indicators, with the assumption that required information would be collected within the first year
of project implementation. The project key performance indicators were mostly general and not
thoroughly adjusted towards project outcomes. In addition, a number of intermediate indicators
were not closely aligned with project activities. An M&E plan was developed and agreed with the
client, including specific reports, data collection instruments and responsible institutions.

27.     Implementation. At the beginning of project implementation, M&E was relatively
neglected. It was only after a year from project implementation start that the team was asked by
Bank management to carefully revise the RF and work with both entities to ensure baseline and
define missing target values. Lack of proper framework negatively influenced the ability to
correctly monitor project achievements.

28.    A year prior to project MTR the team started the work to intensively revise the results
framework, to promote a more effective monitoring of progress towards the attainment of PDO,
and outcome and output indicators were refined. Despite the changes made, the intended outcomes
of the project remained the same. In addition, agreement was reached with both entities on


3
    The situation was managed by the Government and did not affect project implementation.

                                                        10
collecting the appropriate information related to monitoring of performance indicators 4. Although
the revised RF was used and closely monitored by the teams, the formal approval of the revisions
was completed only at the time of project restructuring (finalized in parallel with project AF). Key
factors which influenced the delayed approval included: (i) specific complexity working with two
Entities and highly decentralized institutions in the FBiH, which brought difficulties in collecting
the appropriate information; and (ii) frequent changes of project TTLs during that period, resulting
in delayed processing of the formal project restructuring.

29.     During the project AF (March 22, 2011), a second enhancement of the RF took place,
aiming at reflecting the newly introduced activities. The RF was fine-tuned, taking into account
the proposed new as well as scaled-up activities, both in time and scope. In addition, a household
survey of the health status of the population of the FBiH and public opinion survey was carried
out by the Institute of Public Health (IPH) in 2012, with a comparison to the survey conducted in
2002. Meanwhile, in the RS a few surveys were organized, with the last one completed in
November 2014, aiming at analyzing the impact of training on the PHC staff and managers
performance.

30.     While at the beginning, project implementation experienced the lack of a proper M&E and
weak ownership, the RF and monitoring and reporting started to improve prior to project’s MTR
and continued to further improve during the AF. Overall, the RF was adequate for the remaining
project implementation period.

31.      Utilization. The surveys organized in both entities as well as the M&E report produced in
the FBiH collected data not just related to the project’s needs, but also included important
information used by the government in strategic documents (including the Systematic Country
Diagnosis - SCD) and in policy decision-making. The most thorough survey was carried out in
the FBiH by the IPH (completed in 2012) on the health status of the population, health care services
utilization and health related needs. The survey results proved to be very important in defining
priorities for adopting new strategies and health care programs and creating prevention and
promotion programs.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     The environmental category of the original project at appraisal was “C”. Physical
rehabilitation of existing facilities through remodeling and refurbishing did not include any major
structural changes and therefore only minor quantities of debris were generated. The
implementing agencies were guided by the Project Implementation Manual on workers safety, dust
and noise pollution, proper handling transportation and disposal of construction waste materials.
The Project Implementation Manual had specific provisions for and guidance on the safeguards
for preventing health impacts from direct and indirect exposure of humans to health care waste.
In addition, reconstruction activities were carried out in full compliance with national
environmental requirements and based on construction permits and urban planning documentation.


4
  In the case of FBiH data collection was part of the regular health statistics, through the Institute of Public Health
(IPH) of FBiH and through cantonal IPHs. Other information needed for monitoring was obtained through cantonal
Ministries of Health and from the database of the Federal Ministry of Health. While in the case of RS, information
was obtained through the Ministry of Health.

                                                          11
The project followed up on good measures practiced in BiH for safe management of syringes,
blades, etc.

33.     During project MTR a special environmental supervision was conducted. The supervision
confirmed that: (i) majority of implemented civil works (completed in 24 out of 33 buildings) were
considered corresponding to category “C”; and (ii) activities in the remaining 9 buildings included
leveling down the old buildings and construction of new ones. However, the assessment carried
out by the Bank team in collaboration with local government, concluded that there was no need
for any remedial measures as there were no environmental issues related to that. In addition, there
were no involuntary resettlement issues associated with the newly constructed centers.

34.     It was only at the time of the AF when the upgrade of the environmental category to “B”
was introduced, based on: (i) the nature of the works to be supported by the project (including
significant physical rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing building, as well as few new
construction); and (ii) the changing requirements of the Bank’s safeguards policy. All new
construction was done on the available municipal lands that were not being used in any matter,
and thus did not imply any of involuntary resettlement issues. Also, Environmental Management
Plans (EMPs) of both entities were developed, disseminated in country and disclosed. The EMPs
included also a monitoring plan with environmental indicators and monitoring and reporting
procedures. Overall, all the works have been carried out according to standards and environmental
guidelines and safeguards compliance has been satisfactory, throughout the original project and
the AF. This was also confirmed during the visit of the ICR team to several rehabilitated facilities.

35.     Procurement. Procurement Management (PM) functions have been carried out by the
respective Project Coordination Units (PCU) in both entities. While in the FBiH the PCU became
part of the MoH staff soon after project start up, the PCU at RS remained as a Unit outside the
MoH and was integrated only during the last year of implementation. Project implementation
faced a number of procurement issues, including: (i) lack of proper capacity within the PCU in the
FBiH. Most of the time procurement was handled by part-time consultant, which, at a certain
degree, hampered the overall performance of the Unit and negatively influenced in the overall
contract administration and physical inspections (which were not always carried in a fully
satisfactory manner) and timely updating of the procurement plans; and (ii) lack of experience in
the local private sector in preparation of bids in accordance with the WB procedures, which
resulted in delays of the procurement processes. The Bank’s teams have continuously
recommended strengthening of the procurement capacity in the implementing agencies as well as
offering training to the local private sector on WB procurement procedures, in order to avoid these
issues. In addition, there were isolated cases of potential collusion between bidders, from which
two local firms were debarred. Despite these issues, the overall performance of the procurement
has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory or Satisfactory throughout the original project and the
AF.

36.     Financial Management. The PCUs in both entities carried financial management
responsibilities in a satisfactory manner. Quarterly financial reports were prepared and submitted
on time, providing reliable financial information. The financial statements were regularly audited
by independent auditors, resulting in unqualified opinions. Despite certain delays, caused by PCU
transfers and staff changes, overall both PCUs had appropriate skills and ability to manage the
project financial management and disbursement issues.

37.     Transition Arrangements. A number of positive developments have taken place in
restructuring the PHC and strengthening the capacity building in the sector. The government is
committed to sustaining project achievements and making sector performance improvements.
Investing in reforming the PHC services is expected to result in reduced unnecessary expenditures
in hospital care. Also, a significant area of project support has been the improvement of human
resource capital (health workers in PHC). Although there exist the risk of having a number of FM
doctors and nurses trying to leave the primary care, most of project investment in the area are
expected to remain in PHC for a long time. Meanwhile, investments made in works and goods
would need regular maintenance, hence required financial resources need to be considered by the
government. This is an important issue, considering that the current financial sustainability of the
health system is threatened by poor collection of insurance contributions as well as inefficiencies
from the fragmentation of service delivery at secondary and tertiary levels of care. These are issues
to be considered during discussions between the government and the Bank on future potential
engagement.

38.     Follow-up project. The government, during the ICR mission, has expressed its strong
interest in a follow-up project that will further support the on-going reforms. The following are
among key priority areas under discussion, during the preparation process of the Country
Partnership Framework (CPF): (i) further deepening the FM reform model, which is considered as
the single largest reform implemented by the BiH government in the health sector; (ii)
strengthening governance and management capacity in the sector, including for hospitals. The
existing highly fragmented nature of the health system in BiH has resulted in limited sector
performance. Hence, further improvements in stewardship and governance would increase
efficiency and improve service delivery and health outcomes; and (iii) improving the financial
sustainability of the system, which is currently threatened by inefficiencies resulting from the
fragmentation of service delivery and insurance systems.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

39.      The relevance of objectives is rated Substantial. Reforming the health system, with
specific focus on improvement of primary health care services through the FM model and the
management capacity in the sector, was a high priority for the BiH government (FBiH and RS)
before project start and remains so at completion. Project objectives were fully relevant to the
priorities of the 2003 PRSP. In this strategy, the government clearly recognized the urgent need
to improve service delivery, reduce inefficiencies and build institutional capacity. The project has
firmly supported these goals, which have remained as priority of the current RS and FBiH sector
strategies. Also, the project has served to address key challenges in the health sector reform, which
clearly falls under one of main pillars of the Systematic Country Diagnosis (SCD), currently being
finalized, as well as the Country Partnership Framework (CPF), under preparation.

40.    The relevance of project design is rated Modest. The SIL design was the right approach to
support activities mainly related to infrastructure upgrading, equipment and capacity building.
Planned activities were relevant to the achievement of the project’s objectives. However,

                                                 13
weakness in M&E design, including lack of baseline and target values, clearly undermined the
relevance of the project design.

41.   The overall rating for relevance is Modest, based on Substantial relevance of objectives
and Modest relevance of project design.


3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.     The achievement of the PDO is rated as Substantial. This evaluation is based on the
achievement of key outcome indicators, on the analyses of the accomplishment of project
intermediate indicators and the contribution of project activities to the achievement of the PDO
(two out of three PDO parts are rated as substantial, with one part rated as modest). In addition,
the results of the survey on the Health Status in the FBiH 5 confirm the significant improvement of
satisfaction with FM services, as a result of PHC reforming. An average of 89.4 percent of the
respondents expressed their satisfaction with the approach of FM teams, as well as with the
improvement in health care quality following the introduction of FM. Also, the survey shows
improvement in a number of selected health indicators (details in Annex 5).

43.       Overall, the investment in the FM model has been the single largest reform implemented
by the government during last decade. In addition, the project has achieved significant results in
strengthening the institutional capacity in the health sector. These achievements have positively
affected the reform in other key areas, including: (i) health financing, where a new payment system
is being introduced to create incentives for providers to improve sector-wide results. Under this,
diagnosis-related group system (DRG) is introduced in hospitals. While in primary care, the
unified methodology for contracting health services is being used, primarily with FM teams 6; and
(ii) adjustment of several policy and legal frameworks, to increase the efficacy and efficiency of
the sector, to strengthen financial sustainability, and/or to improve the quality of health care 7.
These policy and legal improvements are paving the way for additional reforms in the areas of
health financing, quality improvements, service delivery, and governance; to improve health
outcomes and increase financial protection.

44.   Achievement of PDO part 1: Expand and enhance the family medicine model of
primary health care (Rating: Substantial). With project support, the family medicine (FM)
model – implemented over recent years – has been the single largest reform implemented by the


5
 Survey of the Health Status of the population of the Federation of BiH in 2102, with a comparison to the survey
conducted in 2002.

6
  With project support, incentive payments for family medicine teams were initiated, to provide the standardized set
of preventive and promotional services.

7
  RS adopted the Strategy for Primary Health Care in 2006, the Strategy for Secondary and Tertiary Health Care in
2007, the Law on Health Care in 2009 and the law on health insurance with associated bylaws. In addition, a
Strategic Plan for Strengthening of the Health System until 2020 is being prepared. The FBiH has also developed a
new Strategy for Primary Health Care and a Strategy for Health System Reform and has amended the Health Care
law.

                                                        14
government in the health sector, aiming at addressing sectorial inefficiencies and ready the sector
to deal in a cost effective manner with core health issues (such as growing burden of NCD). The
project led to successful achievement of the three key outcome indicators, associated with this
project objective. In addition, the ICR evaluation is also based on the analyses on how project
activities contributed to the overall achievement of this objective.

45.    Coverage of population through Family Medicine (FM) teams reaching a national
average of 70 percent. With the support of the project, a national average of 80.2 percent coverage
was achieved at project closure (95.5 percent for the RS and 69 percent for the FBiH). The project
supported key activities (capacity building for FM teams, physical upgrade of FM facilities and
supply with IT systems), which positively affected improvement of coverage of the population by
FM services.

46.    The project supported the establishment and implementation of the training programs in
FM for doctors and nurses, including family medicine specialization and the PAT. A total number
of 793 FM teams in FBiH and 685 FM teams in the RS were operating at project closure, not only
achieving but also exceeding the agreed target values. Capacity building of the FM teams, FM
educators and health personnel in general was significantly supported by the project, mostly
achieving the expected results. A total of 436 medical doctors in FBiH (target 523) and 227
medical doctors in the RS (target 250) successfully completed the required specialization. In
addition, 986 FM doctors in the FBiH and 148 FM doctors in the RS completed the PAT, by project
closure. Aiming at sustaining the results achieved under the capacity building support, 40 FM
educators from the faculty of the FM departments in the respective universities (both in FBiH and
RS) completed the trainings for Masters or PhD in FM. All capacity building activities were
supported by the original project and scaled up by the AF.

47.     All training activities significantly expanded on the successful experiences under the
previous Basic Health Project, while ensuring that the institutional capacity within universities is
strengthened to guarantee sustainability of all training programs. However, although the capacity
building activities clearly achieved the expected final results, evidence collected during the ICR
mission indicates the risk of specialized FM doctors lacking proper motivation and seeking
specialization in other medical specialties, mainly moving from primary to hospital care. This
signals the importance of considering a set of incentives, in both entities, aiming at preventing
future losses of trained human resources.

48.     With project assistance, both entities have carried out physical rehabilitation, furnishing
and equipping (with basic medical equipment) of a considerable number of the FM facilities. At
project closure, the FBiH has achieved and even surpassed the agreed target value (with 455 FM
offices/ambulances reconstructed or renovated, while target value is 385 FM offices/ambulances).
The same goes for the FM offices/ambulances equipped with medical equipment and/or furniture.
The FBiH has again achieved and surpassed the target value, with 488 offices/ambulances
equipped, while the target was only 426. This was supported by some savings achieved from
combining procurement processes and reducing the operating costs, especially during the project
AF. The savings were also used to solve some of the emergency needs generated by the flooding
of the summer 2014 (repair ambulances, replace small equipment, etc). Meanwhile, the process
of rehabilitating the FM offices/ambulances in the RS suffered certain delays in contracting,
especially the last four contracts. However, the end target values were mostly achieved even in

                                                15
the RS, with 213 FM offices/ambulances renovated (out of an end target of 275). Meanwhile target
value for furnishing with medical equipment and furniture was fully achieved.

49.     In addition, the project successfully supported IT activities for the FBiH primary health
care, with the objective to implement a state-of-art and nationally certified information system in
the community health care centers. Support included: (i) preparing and enacting the Rulebook on
definition of PHC health Information System Architecture, to ensure technological and functional
requirements for implementation of Health Information System (HIS) for PHC, as well as to
stipulate procedures for certification of software solutions to be used in the PHC; (ii) conducting
situational analysis to assess both quality and quantity of IT capabilities at community health care
centers in the FBiH; (iii) purchasing software applications, to improve the management of health
services and implemented performance based payments, with special focus on preventive services;
and (iv) purchasing needed IT equipment (hardware and network equipment), LAN and WAN
equipment. Due to lack of staff in the health institutions, with proper IT knowledge, certain
shortcomings were faced at the situational analysis, though without any significant impact on final
results. At project completion, agreed target values for the FM offices/ambulances equipped with
IT were achieved successfully. Although the original plan was to purchase and implement the
same Electronic Health Record across the entire FBiH, the system covered all cantons with the
exception of two cantons which did not approve the purchasing of the software applications.
Meanwhile, the IT in the RS was supported mostly through the MoH funding. Currently, the HIS
is widely being used to support decision making at FM facility level and at entity level.

50.     In order to inform policy makers, providers of primary health care and the public about the
reform in primary health care, the project provided assistance for carrying out a number of
communication activities (including preparation and dissemination of materials, media spots, press
conferences, brochures and posters, radio and TV shows). Project AF further elaborated the use
of communication activities, scaling it up to focus also on provision of the preventive care
programs for the FBiH (while no communication activity was scaled up for the RS, following the
agreement with the MoH to continue through regular communication channels). Although no
specific indicator is related to this activity, evidence collected during the ICR mission clearly
indicates the significant impact communication activities had in raising awareness of the public as
well as providers and policy makers on restructuring the primary health care, in both entities. The
results were quite positive even for the RS where, during project AF, the communication was taken
over by the government itself.

51.     Number of FM teams and Health Centers in RS meeting rigorous accreditation
standards. The project supported (via provision of technical assistance, capacity building as well
as installing a specific software which allows access to real-time information) the FM teams and
ambulantas in the RS to strengthen their overall standards, in order to complete all requirements
of the accreditation process. The support was provided only during the AF, for FM practitioners
and health centers to be accredited through the Agency for Accreditation and Quality Improvement.

52.     At project closure, this specific outcome indicator was only partly achieved: 200 FM teams
were accredited, out of the agreed target value of 260 FM teams. Two were main reasons for not
fully achieving the agreed target (i) lack of motivation for some FM teams to continue performing
as FM doctors and seek specialization in other specialties; and (ii) stripping off the original 5 per
cent incentive for accredited teams (shortly after establishing it as an important incentive), due to

                                                 16
the overall economic crises. It is strongly suggested to both entities to consider a new set of
incentives to avoid additional losses of trained FM teams.

53.     Systemic implementation of selected preventive services (i.e. hypertension, breast cancer,
prostate enlargement, smoking, etc.) in at least two major FBiH cantons. This indicator was
introduced at project AF stage. Four pilots (cantons of Sarajevo, Zenica, Tuzla, and Mostar) to
promote preventive services for NCD by introducing pay-for-performance were implemented and
successfully completed before project closure. A total of 100 FM teams participated in this
piloting, divided in two groups: experimental and control group. Also, contract models were
developed between community health care centers and their FM teams and between the FBiH MoH
and community health care centers. A final report was produced at the completion of the pilots’
implementation, indicating a significant greater performance of the 50 FM teams receiving the
payment incentives. In addition, the reporting system developed for the four pilots has been
adopted as standard reporting system in the FBiH. This new reporting system (including the
software) was very well accepted by the FM teams, because it allows them to analyze their own
performance and also to better report their activities. Also, during the mission, the ICR team
observed that one of the cantonal health insurance fund was considering to include a similar
incentive in the new contract with the FM teams; an action which positively speaks for the
sustainability of this outcome.

54.     Achievement of PDO part 2: Building Management Capacity in the sector (Rating:
Substantial). Project RF includes only one outcome indicator linked to this PDO, added during
project AF/restructuring. This is because the PAD did not specifically include this part of the
overall PDO (which was clearly included in the PDO of the original DCA as well as the project
AF). Nonetheless, the PAD included a number of activities and output indicators, which have
clearly contributed to the achievement of this specific PDO. In addition, the responses received
from the PHC managers and staff during the survey conducted in the RS (completed in November,
2014) indicate that training activities significantly helped them in the process of establishing a
quality management system and preparation and completion of the PHC accreditation process.

55.     Health Management Center operational with annual budget and regular work plan. The
indicator was fully achieved by project closure. The Health Management Center in the FBiH was
developed as a unit within the Federation Public Health Institute (FPHI). A contract was signed
between the FPHI and the School of Economics in Sarajevo to cover all training required.
Meanwhile, in the RS, training was covered by the Public Health Institute’s Health Management
Center. Project support through technical assistance, purchasing of required IT equipment, as well
as the software application for the e-learning, is considered instrumental in establishing the Centers.

56.    By project closure, most of related output indicators in support of PDO part 2 were
achieved. With project assistance, the following training programs were developed and
implemented:

   •   Training in management and oversight for hospitals and PHC’s managers. Target values
       for this indicator are achieved in both entities. The FBiH reached a total of 211 managers,
       trained in relevant managerial skills (while target value was only 131 managers).
       Meanwhile in the RS the total number of trained managers reached to 379 (against a target
       value of 300). This training program supported managers to better align with the on-going

                                                 17
       reform, implementing required changes in their institutions with regard to quality
       improvements, regulations, referrals, resource management, etc.

   •   Training in change management for FM teams. The program included support for the
       transition of service delivery to the new primary care model, enabling the teams to
       implement required changes in management concepts and skills, staff planning, patients
       flow and management. The FBiH has achieved the target, with 600 FM teams completing
       this training program within project closure. While the RS only partly achieved it, with
       385 FM teams trained, out of agreed 650 teams. Although the RS Health Management
       Center was established in time, there were delays as well as lack of incentives for some
       FM teams to complete the training.

   •   Training modules offered by the Health Management Center in the RS. This output
       concerns only the project support to the RS. 349 management staff completed one or more
       training modules offered by the Center, surpassing the target of 250 staff (the activity falls
       only under the project AF).

   •   Academic degree training (MAs and PhDs) in health management. This training program
       has produced a cadre of teachers of health management, able to teach Masters and other
       courses offered by the centers of health management. A total number of 3 PhDs and 8
       master degrees were completed, partly achieving the target for this output indicator.

   •   Training program for Continuous Education (CPE) only in the FBiH, during project AF.
       The program for CPE on health management and related rulebook was successfully
       developed, and the first cohort was enrolled. By project closure, 199 applicants completed
       the first level of training, 132 applicants the second level and 75 the third/final level;
       ensuring the successful achievement of this indicator.

57.    Achievement of PDO part 3: Strengthening the policy making process through the
development and implementation of a system for monitoring and evaluating the health sector
performance (Rating: Modest). With project support, policy making process based on use of
evidence, has significantly improved, although with some shortcomings.

58.    The project has led to important achievements, as evidenced by the following key
associated outcome and output indicators:

59.     Primary health care strategies, prepared by relevant ministries of health and ratified by
the relevant governments. This indicator was defined as outcome indicator in the original project
and was successfully achieved before the AF was approved (target met in 2010). While in the RS
the strategy was prepared by the MoH, in the FBiH the MoH was supported also by the WHO to
complete the strategy in time.

60.    The AF scaled up this outcome indicator, with the following wording: “The RS Primary
Health Care Strategy and the Federation Primary Health Care Strategy operational plans are
updated”. Both entities updated the operational plans in time and implemented (with slight delay
in the RS due to government changes during 2013). Hence, the indicator is considered fully
achieved.

                                                18
61.     The project successfully met most of the targets outlined in the RF, in reference to output
indicators, as follows:

   •   FBiH prepares the Health M&E Report. By closure of the original project, the FBiH MoH
       had developed the required set of indicators and the initial data were collected. The work
       continued during project AF and the M&E report was completed and publicly available by
       project closure. Project assistance was instrumental in the successful completion of the
       report, with support provided for: (i) technical assistance, contracted for strengthening the
       MoH monitoring and evaluation system; and (ii) establishing the website of the FBiH MoH
       and making it operational.

   •   Health status and risk factors indicators based on household survey completed and
       publicly available. The surveys have been completed successfully in both entities and the
       results have been made public. In the FBiH, project support played an important role in
       the preparatory work and required equipment for the Public Health Institute to carry out
       the survey on the population’s health status and risk factor for the NCDs.

   •   National Health Summits held with the participation of the relevant stakeholders.
       Although few summits were organized during the original project at the entity level, they
       were not based on results of the M&E systems, hence did not have the expected impact on
       policy discussions. As result, the anticipated annual review process was not fully put in
       place. The project supported this activity during the AF too, ensuring the achievement of
       the related indicator. Two health summits were held: one in Banja Luka (RS) titled “Health
       in South-East Europe common goals and responsibilities”, and the second one in Sarajevo
       (FBiH) “90 year anniversary of the primary health care in BiH”, in October 2013. Both
       summits were considered significant events in health policy discussions in the country.

   •   Program Evaluation for the Primary Health care in the RS. During the original project, a
       number of analyses were carried out to analyze and evaluate the progress of the reform in
       PHC in the RS. A complete survey at PHC level was organized towards original project
       closure. The survey was completed during project AF and served for a thorough review of
       the PHC reform in the RS.

   •   Public health grants for Innovative services: In the FBiH a number of innovative grants
       were offered, with the objective to improve general public awareness on prevention of risk
       factors for most common and mass NCDs, through different innovative prevention
       approaches, strengthening of prevention through FM teams and better understanding and
       acceptance of FM model in general public as a system of primary prevention. The grants
       were implemented in three phases, reaching a total of 40 grants successfully implemented
       by project original closure. An additional 17 grants were implemented during the project
       AF, focusing on prevention of risk factors in the most common mass noncontiguous
       diseases. These projects effectively demonstrated existing weaknesses in the area of
       organized prevention and health care for vulnerable groups.

   •   Finally, the reporting system developed for the four pilots, to promote preventive services
       for NCDs by introducing pay for performance, has been adopted as standard reporting
       system in the FBiH (as detailed under PDO part 1). This is an important achievement for

                                                19
         improving the M&E system. Also, progress achieved in establishing HIS and FM
         monitoring has clearly contributed to decision making process based on evidence use.

3.3      Efficiency

62.     Efficiency is rated as Substantial. The BiH Health Sector Enhancement project had three
components: restructure the PHC system; improve health sector management; and promote health
policy formulation and project management support. Although all three project components
generated benefits, most direct benefits of the project are from the first component, while the
second and third components generated indirect benefits by strengthening the healthcare system,
health sector management and policy development.

63.     Economic analysis (Annex 3) used the actual project costs and estimated flow of benefits
to compute the measures of economic efficiency. The analysis assumes that the project benefits
continue for 20 years. The measures of economic efficiency under the base case scenario and
sensitivity analysis under two alternative scenarios are presented in Table 1.


      Table 1: Measures of economic efficiency under base case and alternative scenarios
                                   Base      Sensitivity analysis under two alternative

      Economic rate of return (%) 19.13       14.7          9.2

64.     Under the base case scenario, the project yielded 19.13 percent Economic Rate of Return.
The sensitivity analysis showed that even under conservative assumptions the discounted project
benefits covered costs resulting in modest returns to investment.

65.     The operation and maintenance costs of the project are not significantly high when
compared with the public expenditures in the health sector in the country, as high as 9.6 percent
of the GDP.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.    The project’s overall outcome rating is based on the Substantial achievement of project
development objectives, as discussed under section 3.2 above, its Modest relevance, and
Substantial efficiency.




8
  The first scenario assumes a 20 percent reduction in benefits compared to the baseline case. The second
scenario assumes a 30 percent increase in recurrent costs.

3.5        Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

67.     The project has clearly contributed to improvements in the overall functioning of the health
system, with significant impact in the primary health care reforming. Project achievements have
impacted the overall population of BiH, including vulnerable and poor groups. The project RF did
not include any indicator specifically related to poor groups of the population. However, it
positively impacted the standardization, quality and access of the population to the primary health
care services. By doing that, the project clearly has encouraged equity in health service delivery.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

68.     The project had an important impact on institutional development and strengthening
capacity in the sector. A significant proportion of project investments was addressed to improve
the capacity of human resources in the PHC, in a number of key areas, such as: (i) capacity building
of the FM teams, FM educators and health personnel, with a total of 436 medical doctors in FBiH
and 227 medical doctors in the RS successfully completing the required specialization; (ii) training
on management for hospitals and PHC’s managers, with 211 managers trained in relevant
managerial skills in the FBiH and 379 managers trained in the RS; (iii) training for continuous
education, in the FBiH; (iv) academic degree training (Masters and PhDs) in health management
field; and (v) training of the FM teams in change management. Establishing the Health
Management Centers and having them operational with annual budgets and regular work program,
is considered an important step for further expanding and sustaining the capacity building in the
sector (more responsibilities were transferred to and properly handled by the local institutions). In
addition, study tours and most recent Health Summits organized at national level, had a positive
impact on improving institutional capacity at policy level. The evidence collected and results of
the interviews during the ICR mission clearly indicate that project support was instrumental in
strengthening institutional capacities and enabling them to further continue with significant
reforms.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

69.    During project AF phase, some savings were created from combining procurement
packages and reducing the operating costs. These savings were used to solve certain emergency
needs, generated by the flooding of the summer 2014. 9

    Such as repairing ambulantas, replacing small equipment, etc.

                                                          21
4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

71.     The risk that project development outcomes will not be maintained is Moderate. The
government (in both entities) has clearly demonstrated strong commitment in considering health
as a priority sector (despite periods of economic crises) and continuously supported the health care
reforms. In addition, it has shown commitment throughout project lifetime, aiming at achieving
and maintaining main project outcomes. This was clearly demonstrated during project
implementation, when there were delays in ensuring CEB funding for the PHC reconstruction
works and provision of medical equipment. The government took over part of the financing,
ensuring timely completion of these main project activities. In addition, it also provided financial
support to a number of cantons, which were having difficulties in providing their own part of the
financing. Also, the significant reform of the FM in primary health care is preserved in a concrete
legal framework, which clearly ensures the use of the primary care as a gatekeeper.

72.     However, there are still a few issues to be noted, which can have a negative influence on
the government commitment towards sector reform: (i) the frequent political changes may bring
high level of staff turnover in the MoHs and related institutions (in both entities); (ii) FM
specialized doctors may look for other employment opportunities, mainly in the hospital sector,
negatively affecting the capacity built in the PHC; and (iii) despite its strong commitment, the
government may not have the adequate capacity to maintain and deepen sector reform, hence a
follow-up support by the Bank and/or involvement of other donors is of significant importance.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     Preparation of the project was carried out by a large team of experts, providing needed
technical skills to produce a proper design. The project design built upon key lessons learned from
analytical work, Bank-financed health projects in the BiH and other countries in the region as well
as international best practices. A number of alternatives and main risk factors were considered by
the team during the preparation process, prior to finalizing the project design. In addition, the team
ensured that project design was in line with the government strategy (PRSP 2003) and paid
particular attention to the political economy of the proposed reforms. The ICR team noted
satisfactory feedback from the client on the working relations the Bank team kept with all involved
stakeholders, at design stage.

74.     However, the project was prepared quite fast, with less than nine months from concept
review to Board approval. Hence, the project design suffered from certain shortcomings. Most
importantly, project design did not put in place a proper M&E framework for monitoring the
implementation of project activities and assessing the achievements of its objectives. Most
indicators in the original RF were missing the baseline data. Although the design talked about
surveys to be forecasted, nothing was organized during the first couple of years of project
implementation. Despite the fact that this shortcoming was addressed during project
                                                 22
implementation, monitoring of project progress during implementation and final assessment of
project achievements were made more challenging.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was Moderately
Satisfactory. Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately
supervised and monitored. Bank supervision took place on regular basis and provided appropriate
and well-targeted advice and observations. The aide memoires provided evidence of regular
supervision and professional advice given by the Bank’s experts throughout the project’s lifetime.
The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both
in terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation. In addition, the
feedback received by the ICR mission during the interviews with stakeholders, clearly show the
government’s appreciation of the technical skills and advice provided by the Bank’s experts, not
just on project but also on health sector related issues.

76.     The Bank team has been committed not just in performing close supervision of project
implementation but also trying to overcome any shortcoming from project design stage. Hence,
prior to project MTR, the team was flexible in trying to adjust the M&E framework. Direct
involvement and leadership by the CMU and sector management side at this point was
instrumental in ensuring the required adjustments. However, the issues with the project RF
remained present until AF phase. Although the RF was revised and closely monitored by the teams
during implementation of the original project, the formal approval of the revisions was completed
only at the time of project restructuring (finalized in parallel with the AF). At preparation and
implementation of the AF the team was commendably proactive in further refining the project RF
and identifying any implementation bottlenecks and measures to overcome delays.

77.    During the entire project life (original and AF) there were in total five task team leaders.
Although there were frequent changes of TTLs, especially during the original project, they could
ensure smooth transition, which guaranteed continuity.

78.    Fiduciary and safeguards policies were well managed and reported.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     The overall performance of Bank’s teams is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The quality
at project preparation was less than satisfactory. Also, Bank’s performance during project
supervision was moderately satisfactory. Although the performance improved during project
supervision, the shortcomings from the design phase (mainly lack of proper M&E) could not be
fully overcome.

5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                23
80.     The project design was strongly supported by the government (in both entities),
recognizing the need to decisively pursue restructuring of primary health care, to ensure more
effective resource allocation. While being aware of the institutional fragmentation and capacity
constraints at almost all levels, the government was able to be selective, paying particular attention
to the political economy of sector reforms.

81.    Despite political transitions during project implementation (resulting also in staff changes),
the government kept strong commitment to project and sector reform implementation. Also, the
government demonstrated a long - term strategic vision in the sector over the project’s lifetime.
Government officials worked closely and fully cooperated with the Bank’s project team, on a
continual basis. The project MTR particularly demonstrated the commitment and involvement of
both MoHs in project implementation. Both MoHs played a key role in project monitoring,
analyzing implementation bottlenecks and proposing solutions for ensuring successful completion
of project activities. Government involvement remained the same also during project AF, its
commitment was one of key reasons for proceeding with the additional financing.

82.     The project did not experience any counterpart funding problems. While delays happened
in ensuring CEB funding, the government also supplemented Bank financing, aiming at timely
completion of main project activities (i.e. physical rehabilitation and medical equipment for PHCs).
In addition, the government took over funding of a number of activities, originally planned to be
supported by the cantons in the FBiH (due to a lack of local government financial resources).

83.     Overall, government performance in ensuring political and institutional commitment was
satisfactory. The political transitions in the government, the fact that project was implemented in
two entities, as well as strong decentralization in the FBiH negatively affected project
implementation. However, this negative impact was mostly fixed, due to continuous commitment.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

84.    The MoHs in both entities were responsible for overall project implementation. The MoHs
were fully involved and responsible for the project preparation, while during the initial phase of
implementation, technical support from local consultants was required. Following Bank’s
recommendation, the MoH in the FBiH included the project unit (composed of a number of local
consultants) within the ministry, with most of the staff being MoH employees. Meanwhile, in the
RS, the project was implemented by a PCU financed by the project.

85.      During project implementation (most of the original project and whole AF), the Federation
MoH continued to implement the project through a department of the Ministry, led by an Assistant
Minister and using contractual experts on procurement and financial management. This helped in
streamlining technical capacity within the MoH, and therefore, strengthen its longterm capacity.
However, during the first year of implementation, the FBiH MoH used the team of consultants
working for SITAP (another Bank supported project). The fact that these consultants did not work
full time on the project hampered the quality of work. In addition, there were significant delays in
hiring the experts of the PCU as civil servants. Even when the PCU was within the MoH, it lacked
a full-time procurement specialist, which has negatively affected the Unit performance.



                                                 24
86.    In the case of RS, the project was implemented by an external PCU. The experts of the
PCU were contracted as consultants and working, at the same time, on other projects. Although it
was recommended to have the Unit incorporated within the RS MoH, aiming at strengthening the
MoH capacity, this happened only in January 2014 (during project AF). Since then, the PCU staff
were hired as civil servants and financed by the MoH. According to the interviews during the ICR
mission, this transition influenced in a poorer performance of the Unit (main reason would have
been the change in benefits for the PCU staff, due to transition).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.    The satisfactory performance of the government and moderately satisfactory of the
Implementing Agency averages to a rating of Moderately Satisfactory for overall Borrower
performance.

6.     Lessons Learned

88.     Flexibility from the Bank side, to adjust to client specific institutional arrangements,
is essential for a successful implementation. The complex political environment (working with
two entities), frequent political transitions, and highly decentralized governance in the FBiH,
brought up some difficulties during project implementation. Working in such a specific complex
environment, required certain flexibility from the Bank teams, which were successful in adjusting
to the specific client arrangements and needs.

89.      The Bank and the government need to give careful consideration to the project
implementation arrangements, to ensure a smooth implementation of project activities.
Fully staffed PCUs, responsible for overall project implementation, are crucial for successful
completion of project activities. While the FBiH/PCU was streamlined in the MoH during project
implementation, yet its performance was negatively affected by certain delays in hiring its experts
as civil servants, as well as the lack of a fulltime procurement specialist. Meanwhile, the transition
of the RS/PCU (streamlined within the MoH only during last year of project implementation)
resulted in less efficient functioning and poorer performance of the Unit. Hence, it is
recommended that during the preparation of a new operation, careful consideration be given to
defining the PCU arrangements, based on analyses of the impact that streamlining in the MoHs
had during project implementation.

90.      Sustaining the achievements of the reform in PHC, through Family Medicine model,
is of significant importance. The FM model – implemented over recent years – is considered the
single largest reform implemented by the government in the health sector. Currently, there exist
the risk of specialized FM doctors and nurses, lacking proper motivation and seeking specialization
in other medical specialties, mainly trying to move from primary to hospital care. This signals the
importance of considering a set of incentives to prevent future losses of trained human resources,
as a crucial step for sustaining the achievements of this large reform.

91.     M&E is a critical part of the project design and it requires strong attention during
project preparation and implementation. The lack of a proper framework negatively influences
the ability to correctly monitor project achievements. The RF for this project was, to some extent,
neglected at design stage and its ownership was weak.
                                                 25
92.     A quick project preparation may negatively affect the quality of project at entry. The
project was prepared quite rapidly, with less than nine months from concept note review to Board
approval. Despite team efforts for preparing a thorough project, the quick preparation did not
provide the required time to: (i) produce a proper M&E framework and collect required
information; and (ii) carefully consider specific needs and situations of the country, with focus on
human capacity. As a result, project implementation endured certain bottlenecks during its first
years, which were mostly sorted out during project life.

93.     Close coordination with development partners is very important for a successful
project implementation. Coordination with key donors involved in the sector, such as: CIDA
and, most importantly, CEB (who was the co-financier for the project), was very important for a
successful project implementation. The project experienced delays in ensuring funding from the
CEB (due to late signatories of the agreement between the Government and CEB, for the original
project as well as the AF). However, because of the strong coordination between the government,
the Bank and CEB, project implementation could overcome issues, resulting in successful
completion of planned project activities.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Introduction

Health sector in Bosnia-Herzegovina is characterized by high burden of disease with an
epidemiological profile dominated largely by cardiovascular diseases and cancers. The sector has
high public health expenditures, an inefficient organization model and service delivery, limited
institutional capacity, institutional fragmentation and unequal access to health care. The
motivation for the project was the financial unsustainability and inefficiency in the health sector.
The project supported the government strategies to improve the healthcare delivery system by
reducing inefficiencies and improving quality in the delivery of care. This was achieved through
advancing primary care and public health, reforming health financing and building institutional
capacity in the sector. The project helped the Government of BiH to reform of the health sector
and improving efficiency and development of the primary health care so as to attain financial
sustainability of the health system in long run.
The project had three components:
        a. Primary Health Care Restructuring. This component was to restructure the primary
health care delivery system and to ensure that it is equipped to adequately address core health
sector issues such as the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and enable
development of an effective interface between outpatient care delivered through family medicine
(FM) and hospital care. This component supported restructuring of the narrow primary care
system into family medicine units that have the capacity to address 80% of the country’s health
needs. This has significantly reduced the unnecessary high rate of cases treated at hospitals.
        b. Improvement of Health Sector Management Capacity to strengthen the capacity of
provider managers and governing bodies to implement essential changes in service delivery at
different levels of the health system. This component provided training and technical assistance
for hospital managers, board members and managers of health centers.
        c. The third component was to promote Health Policy Formulation and Project Support to
improve data collection and analysis for sectorial benchmarking and to improve use of evidence
for priority setting and resource allocation, and help modernize the role of the Public Health
Institutes. These activities promoted health sector policy formulation.

2. Recent developments in health sector

The Health Sector Enhancement Project sought to address the inefficiencies in the health sector
like inefficient treatment protocols, duplication of services, and a neglect of primary healthcare,
which contributed to inadequate provision of services to the poor and uninsured. The impacts of
the reforms resulted in progress in health status and health outcomes in general (Table 1) over the
period since 2005, an indirect measure of the impact of the project.

The health condition of the population in BIH was poor in the early 2000s with about 16 percent
of the population in poor health (LSMS, 2004). The poor health condition was by and large due
to illness, disability due to the deterioration in access to health care and inefficiencies in healthcare
management. However, in recent years there have been improvements in the indicators of health
status and health care. Infant mortality rates increased from 6.7 in 1990 to 8 in 2000 and then fell

                                                   32
to 6 in 2013. The life expectancy has also been gradually increasing since 2000. Table 1 shows
gradual improvements in health care indicators as well.

Although there has been improvement in the above group of indicators, the population is getting
older and the incidence of diseases of the circulatory system and other diseases like cancer are
increasing.

The percentage of population in poor health and affected by serious physical limitations due to
illness is around 16 percent (LSMS, 2003 results). Mortality rates per 1000 live births increased
from 6.7 per 1000 in 1990 to 8 in 2002 due mainly to the effects of the war on health of the
population and deterioration in accessibility and standard of healthcare. Male life expectancy
increased gradually from a fairly low level at 68 years in 2002 to 73 in 2010 and 74 in 2013.
Hospital discharges for diseases of circulatory system were 861 per 100, 000 in 2006. Although
there have been improvements in health status, lifestyle related illness continue to impose high
burden disease and the population quality of life.

2.1   Health expenses

The health services in BIH continue to be costly. The percentages of population using health care
services vary by the availability of health insurance and health status. The poor do not have access
to insurance services and they continue to use public health care institutions. Private sector
healthcare is not covered by the health insurance. However, a significant proportion of the
population continues to use private sector health care at higher costs. This is because private sector
continues to offer better services, better quality and shorter wait times.

Although BiH has a network of primary care facilities, at the time of project development only
about 60 percent of the cases consulted were solved at the primary level. The rest 40 percent are

                                                 33
referred to the specialized hospitals at the secondary and tertiary care level at higher costs for the
services rendered.

Health expenditure in BIH continues to be high and payment for health services constitute a
significant share of the household expenses. More than 80 percent of the patients incur out of
pocket expenditures, out of pocket expenditures on the average account for more than 90 percent
of the total health expenditures. Although health expenditures per capita have been increasing in
the early 2000’s it has begun to fall in recent years 16.

     Table 2: Health expenditures in BIH
                                                            2000     2005      2011      2013

                                                              97       100      96.9     96.9
     expenditures on health
     Health expenditure (Per capita)                         103       246      471       449
     Public Health expenditure % government
                                                            11.4                         16.6
     expenditure
     Total health expenditure as % of GDP                     7.1      8.7       9.6      NA

However out of pocket expenditures continue to be high, accounting for more than 90 percent of
the private expenditures on health. The high health care costs have been due mainly to the
inefficiencies in health sector even when health infrastructure has been successfully rebuilt. In this
context, the project contributed to five health policy goals namely strengthened primary health
care, improved health sector management, increased utilization of quality health care, cost
containment and more efficient use of scarce resources. The primary health care model (PHC)
resulted in a significant percent of the population being covered through family medicine, leading
to lower out-of-pocket expenditures for households. The project facilitated access to family
medicine for the majority of the population resulting in improved access to primary health care,
less severe case-mix among patients, lower treatment costs and out of pocket payments. Use of
preventive care and improved access to healthcare also improved productivity through avoiding
lost productivity due to preventable illnesses and related premature deaths. Further, better health
and fewer days lost due to illness will also improve overall productivity. The low-income groups
and people without insurance also benefited the most from the expanded family medicine network.

3         Methodology, data and assumptions

In order to conduct the economic analysis the actual project costs and the estimated benefits are
used.

3.1 Project costs

The actual project costs for the three components by years are presented in Table 3. Primary
healthcare restructuring component accounted for 88 percent of the project costs followed by third
component at 8.3 percent.

The project costs show that the primary emphasis of the project was in restructuring of the primary
healthcare services delivery system for improvements in efficiency and to ensure that it is equipped
to adequately to address core health sector issues such as the growing burden of non-
communicable diseases (NCD) and enable development of an effective interface between
outpatient care delivered through family medicine (FM) and hospital care.

3.2. Project benefits

The project scaled-up the PHC to provide improved access to care in family medicine practices to
about 80 percent of the population. The second and third components improved financial
sustainability and institutional capacity in the health sector and policies to increase efficiency in
healthcare delivery. Among the above three project components, most benefits accrued from the
first component that incurred about 88 percent of the total project costs. The second and third
components contributed to the overall project benefits. The direct and indirect benefits from the
project are outlined below.

    a. Reduction in unnecessary hospital admissions and bed days as a result of the increase in
quality of family medicine and primary care. The project facilitated improved family and primary
care treatments that reduced the number unnecessary referrals to specialist and hospital admissions.
As a result of this intervention specialist hospital admissions dropped overall, due in part to the
decline in unnecessary self-referrals at specialized hospitals. This is because the trained providers
in PHC clinics could provide primary care, early diagnosis and treatment plans that reduced the
need for specialist care and admissions resulting in significant drop hospital admissions and about
30 percent of those savings could be attributed to the project.
We do not have data on actual cost of inpatient care to estimate the above savings from bed days
avoided. Hence cost of inpatient care is estimated from the total health spending, recurrent budget
for inpatient care and total number of hospital days. It is further assumed that about 75 percent of
the total health spending goes to hospital care, resulting in total cost per inpatient day at US$ 184.
In addition the recurrent costs, including salaries and drugs are estimated at a 50 percent above the
total estimate at US$ 92.
                                                 35
    b. Reduction in disease incidence in days and thus averted losses in productivity due to
diseases and lost workdays. Averted productivity and lost man-days arise from fewer disease
incidence, reduced inpatient admissions and bed days from inpatient admissions. Productivity is
valued based on the average daily wage per person at a labor participation rate of 45 percent. The
reduced productivity losses are estimated to be 0.5 days per referral. Similarly, fewer admissions
and fewer bed days resulted in savings in productivity.
    d. Reduction in travel costs to hospitals and specialist clinics and out of pocket expenditures.
Out of pocket expenses and travel costs to the hospitals are in general higher than for visits to
support primary care centers. Hence a reduction in specialist consultation will result in savings in
travel costs and out-of-pocket expenses. Based on LSMS findings out of pocket expenditures for
travel to PHC is estimated at $1.8 per visit. For hospital stays it is estimated at around US $ 3.8.
The above expenses are then adjusted for inflation.

   e. Reduction in-patient waiting times at primary health centers. Streamlining the appointment
process reduced the patient waiting time at the care centers. The average waiting time has been
reduced by about 5 percent. The resulting savings in waiting time is valued at the daily wage rate.
    f. Savings in potential life years as a result of reduced mortality from diseases. Better quality
of treatment and preventive measures averted chronic diseases, mortality and the burden of
diseases. According to the World Health Organization’s Atlas of Health in Europe improved
monitoring and treatment of respiratory and circulatory system diseases as well as early detection
of diseases of digestive system reduces mortality rates from these diseases. Based on available
evidence from surveys and evidence from other published works, early detection through higher
utilization of PHC services and better quality of care reduced the mortality reduced by about 2.9
percent over ten years. In order to compute the gains from reduced mortality it is assumed that
each death averted results in nine life years saved. The monetary value of life years saved was
then estimated from the per capita incomes over nine years. The project supervision documents
and the beneficiary surveys showed that the benefits started to materialize from the second year
after the project was implemented.

3. 3 Measures of economic efficiency

As outlined in the previous section, the project benefits include the savings from reduction in
hospital inpatient care and admissions, reduction in disease incidence and savings and averted
losses in productivity, savings in potential life years as a result of reduced mortality and reduction
in travel costs to hospitals and specialist care centers. Under the base case scenario, most project
benefits started to accrue in the third year and are expected to continue until 20 years. The costs
and estimates of benefits were discounted at 5 percent to compute the measures of economic
efficiency (Table 4)

 Table 4: Base case scenario: Measures of efficiency (5 % discount rate)

 Net present value (Million $)                    28.7
 Benefit/Cost ratio                               2.01
 Economic rate of return (%)                      19.13


                                                 36
All three measures of economic efficiency show modest returns to the investment and economic
efficiency. The estimated measures of economic efficiency are very close to the expected results
at project initiation as presented in the Project Appraisal Document.

3.4.      Sensitivity analysis

The project benefits and measures of economic efficiency are sensitive to alternative scenarios.
Reduction in one or more of the benefits or an escalation in recurrent costs could affect the net
present values and rates of return. The sensitivities of the project results to the following two
scenarios are considered.

    i)       Scenario 1: Reduction in benefits by 20 percent compared to the baseline situation.
    ii)      Scenario 2: There is an increase in recurrent costs by about 30 percent.

 Table 5: Sensitivity analysis under the two alternative scenarios (5 % discount rate)
                                       Scenario 1            Scenario 2
 Net present value (Million $)         18.7                  15.1
 Benefit/Cost ratio                    1.76                  1.3
 Economic rate of return               14.7                  9.2

The sensitivity analysis shows that the returns from the project are positive even under the above
two scenarios. The effect of an increase in recurrent costs seems to have higher impact on the
returns from the project. On the whole these results under the base case scenario and the alternative
cases are comparable to the ex-ante results presented in the Project Appraisal Document.

4. Conclusion

The analysis showed that the project generated positive benefits with modest rates of return on the
investment. The increase in access to primary health care, particularly for the poor with no health
insurance, benefited the poor and low-income groups who may not have a formal employment.
The positive rates of return and the facilitation of primary health care to all groups, particularly
the poor and lower income groups are notable features of this project. The operation and
maintenance costs of the project are not significantly high when compared with the public
expenditures in the health sector in the country as high as 9.6 percent of the GDP. Compared with
such high share of public health expenditure, the recurrent cost impacts of this project on the state
budget are not significant.

FOREWORD

This documents is a research study into health status of population of the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (FBIH) in 2012. This study was jointly carried out by the Federation of BiH Ministry
of Health and the Federation of BiH Public Health Institute under the Health Sector Enhancement
Project (HSEP) financed by the World Bank's IDA credit funds.

This extensive population research was carried out on a representative sample of adult population
of the FBiH and it also represent a study that effectively monitored major health determinants such
as risk factor prevalence in development of chronic diseases, availability of health care, utilization
of health care providers and population satisfaction with health care provided, since the baseline
study was carried out in 2002. Using almost identical methodology that relies on international
recommendations, the 2012. Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Adult Population Health
Status Study provides good basis to evaluate effects of health reforms and health care system,
evaluate health care and also promotion of health in the past decade. When compared to earlier
baseline study carried out in 2002, data obtained now will allow for evaluation of adopted policies
and implemented programs, identification of priority health issues and issues faced by health
sector. At the same time, this study also allows monitoring of population's health condition and
risk factor prevalence trends, as well as a careful look at real health needs in order to define
immediate operational goals in further improvement of health system. The analysis showed that
we are yet to face ever increasing challenges caused by modern society and social and economic
transition in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which altogether has substantial
implications on health condition of population.

Federation of BiH Ministry of Health is dedicated to continue to work to increase health care for
population, in particular primary health care and health prevention services, to increase general
risk factors awareness and awareness on self-responsibility for health in population, which would
in turn result in sustained improvement of health outcomes.

Primary goal is to enhance health which in long-term should involve activities aimed at
strengthening skills and abilities of individuals and changes to social and economic conditions
which should mitigate their (potentially negative) effects on health of individuals and community
and also provide more efficient and quality health care for longer life and better life quality of
people.

METHODOLOGY OF THE SURVEY

The survey has been conducted as a cross sectional study on the area of the ten cantons in the
Federation of BiH in 2012.

Sample

Target population
Members of the population of the Federation of BiH aged 18 and over and present in the country
for at least a full year have been selected as the target population. Collective households such as
student homes, children's homes, homes for the elderly, infirm, retired, prisons, monasteries and
the like are not included in the target population.


Sample selection frame
The sample selection frame is a master sample of enumeration districts and households from 2009,
established and updated by the Federal Institute for Statistics.
Households and individuals aged 18 and over are the units of observation, whereby the sample
was designed to be representative on the level of individuals aged 18 and over, as well as on the
level of households.


Family medicine utilization
More than two-thirds of respondents in the FBiH have their family doctor (68,9%), more so
respondents living in urban (72,6%) than those living in rural areas (66,4%).



                                                   72.6

Territorial availability of family medicine
        Almost half of the respondents in the FBiH reside less than 1501m away from the nearest
health care facility providing family medicine services (48.4%), which is more often the case
among respondents living in urban (69,9%) than those living in rural areas (33,9%).
        Over a third of respondents in the FBiH (35,7%) who receive family medicine services
reside more than 2000m away from the nearest health care facility, which is true for almost half of
the respondents in rural areas (48,1%) and a significantly lower percentage of respondents living
in urban areas (17,1%).

Visits to a family doctor
        One third of respondents have visited their family doctor in the past 4 weeks (33,7%), while
a similar percentage of respondents visited their family doctor in the past 12 months (32,1%),
respondents in both urban and rural areas have done so in almost equal percentages.
        More than a quarter of respondents in the FBiH have visited their family doctor more than
a year ago (28,1%). On the other hand, 6,1% of respondents have never visited their family doctor.

The main reason for the last visit to a family doctor
The highest percentage of respondents in the FBiH, over a third, indicated illness as the main
reason for their last visit to their family doctor (36,9%), this did not differ significantly between
respondents in different types of settlements.
Over one fifth of respondents in the FBiH indicated a health check-up as the main reason of their
last visit to a family doctor (22,5%), which was more often the case among respondents living in
urban (24,5%) than among those living in rural areas (19,8%). One fifth of respondents in the FBiH
indicated drug prescription as the main reason for their last visit (22,1%), which was again more
often the case among respondents in urban (24,9%) than those in rural areas (20,1%).
Other reported reasons for the last visit to a family doctor in the FBiH were: referral (7,4%), full
physical examination (4,2%), doctor's note (1,3%), and other reasons (1,4%).

         Graph 6 - Main reason for the last visit to a family doctor in the FBiH, %

Slightly more female (24,2%) than male (20,6%) reported a health check-up as the reason for the
last visit to their family doctor. Twice as many female (9,7%) as male (4,9%) reported referral as
the reason for the last visit to their family doctor. On the other hand, a physical check-up was more
often the reason for the last visit among male (6,3%) then female (2,2%), as well as an injury (6,7%
of male and 1,8% of female).
In terms of the respondents' age, illness was the most frequent reason for the last visit among
respondents in the 18-24 age group (54%) and the least frequent reason among respondents in the
65 and over age group (21,6%). On the other hand, drug prescription as the main reason for their
last visit to a family doctor increases in line with age, whereby it was the main reason among 50%
of respondents in the 65 and over age group, and among only 2,8% of respondents in the 18-24
age group.

visited their family doctor (79,9%), this was more often the case among respondents in rural
(84,7%) than among those in urban areas (73,5%).
13,0% of respondents waited 2-3 days for an appointment with the doctor. Lower percentages of
respondents waited 4-5 (4,0%) and more than 5 days (3,1%) to be seen by the doctor, which
occurred more often in rural then in urban areas.

Satisfaction with health care services
Satisfaction with services provided by a doctor of medicine in the public and private sectors
Respondents that have visited a doctor of medicine in the public sector, have mostly been satisfied
with the services provided by a family doctor (89,4%), more so respondents in rural (91,3%) than
those in urban areas (86,8%).
More than four-fifths of respondents have been very satisfied or satisfied with the services
provided by a doctor of general medicine (86,2%), a doctor of occupational medicine (82,5%) and
a medical specialist (87,0%) in the public sector, without significant difference between
respondents living in different settlement types.
91,4% of respondents have been satisfied or very satisfied with the services provided by a medical
specialist in the private sector.

       The Survey on risk factors of non-contagious diseases in the Federation of BiH in 2002
was conducted on a sample of adult population members aged 25-64 years. For purposes of
comparison, the same age group has been observed within the Survey of the Health status of the
Population of the Federation of BiH 2012.

RECOMMENDATIONS
        The results of this survey point to priorities and activities necessary for the advancement
of the health of the population of the Federation of BiH.
        It is necessary to increase the availability of preventive care and promotional health care
services through the implementation of the existing strategic commitments:
    • Risk factor monitoring in family medicine teams needs to be further strengthened
(anthropometric measurements, blood fat and sugar elves, blood pressure control, addictive
diseases)
    • The scope of advising done by health workers needs to be increased (health impact of
nutrition, promotion of physical activity prevention of obesity, prevention of addictive diseases,
prevention of heart and blood vessel diseases, mental health and oral health)
    • Addictive disease rehabilitation services have to become more prominent in the public
sphere (with a focus on family medicine teams and mental health centers)
    • Physical and regular check up and risk group immunization coverage has to be increased
    • Risk group screening coverage has to be increased: early detection of breast, cervical and
colon cancer.

    The active participation of all the relevant sectors in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle is very
    important:
    • Education and information activities have to be carried out with the aim of changing habits
(proper nutrition, physical activity, addictive disease prevention, mental health)
    • Inter-sector programs have to be implemented(healthy schools, healthy workplaces,
healthy communities)
    • Thematic campaigns of health promotion in the community have to be organized

    Course of Implementation of the Project

    Component 1 – Primary Health Care Restructuring

    Objective

     Objective of this component is to support PHC strengthening through development and
expansion of FM and restructuring of community health care centers in order to reduce inequality
in access to health care, allow health care continuum between different levels of health system
based on local community needs and cost-effective way in dealing with issues such as large-scale
noncontiguous diseases.

    This component includes the following activities:
            • Training in family medicine provided though the Program of Additional Training
      for doctors and nurses and two-year and three-year family medicine specialization
      program;
            • Equipping of Family Medicine Ambulantas with a standard set of equipment and
      furniture, as well as refurbishment of interior of Family Medicine Ambulantas phased out
      in three stages;
            • Equipping of family medicine training centers with IT equipment, professional
      literature, anatomical training dummies needed for practical classes, including missing
      furniture and medical equipment
            • Equipping of all community health care centers with network and IT equipment
      (hardware and software for Primary Health Care with focus on Family Medicine).

    Also, performance-based incentive payments were made to Family Medicine Teams for
provided health promotion services in four community health care centers in Sarajevo, Mostar,
Tuzla, and Zenica.

    Subcomponent 1.1 – Family Medicine Training Programs

    1.1.2 Training for Family Medicine teams

    Objective

     Primary objective of this assignment was to enable, through program of additional training,
Family Medicine teams to acquire skills needed for practicing of family medicine by PHC
specialists in areas other than family medicine, doctors without specialization and nurses. Strategic
direction that Federation of BiH Ministry of Health pursued was to use the one-year training
program and speed up the process of including the sufficient number of Family Medicine teams
into the primary health care system based on the number of population in each catchment area.



                                                 51
     Another key task was to develop and improve the Family Medicine Specialization Program
including academic development of faculty with the Family Medicine Departments at medical
schools and with Family Medicine Training Centers in community health care centers of Sarajevo,
Mostar, Tuzla and Zenica.

    Results achieved

     In order to ensure continuity of training family medicine training process during the period
between the end of the Basic Health Project and the beginning of the Health Sector Enhancement
Project, we continued to work with the Queens University from Canada by signing the contract in
November 2005. Based on the agreed project activities and timeline, we continued with the on-
the-job training for doctors and nurses (PAT program) and two-year and three-year family
medicine specialization program without any gap between the academic years. During this
assignment, a number of activities aimed at improving the existing family medicine training
programs (both PAT and the specialization training programs) were implemented after being
meticulously revised to reflect principles of modern procedures and evidence-based medicine.
Continued support was also provided in the process set up and operation of the professional
association, i.e. the Association of Family Physicians of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and its induction into the European and World family medicine association (WONCA). In this
way, a significant number of family medicine teams was able to actively participate in WONCA's
conventions and conferences and was able to exchange experience in the areas of operation and
development of family medicine with their colleagues from the region and beyond.

    Difficulties in implementation and lessons learned

      Although the training was provided on-the-job and both physician and nurses were trained as
a single Family Medicine, a number of Family Medicine teams have been unfortunately lost and
they do not practice Family Medicine. One of the main reasons for this is a huge turnover of staff,
in particular in PHC, followed by lack of staff, in particular young physicians in small towns and
rural areas, as they do not stay long in PHC and basically once they go through PAT they tend to
pursue other specializations within PHC or specializations offered by hospitals. On the other hand,
there is no legislation to prevent such drain in PHC/Family Medicine and the Federation of BiH
Ministry of Health has no jurisdiction to impose any such legislation. The key problems are the
fact that there is no staff planning for Primary Health Care and the sluggish process of health sector
financing reform, and the systemic approach to human resource planning at the cantonal and
municipal level is unsatisfactory and it lacks comprehensiveness.


    Subcomponent 1.2 – Support for Family Medicine Training Centers

    Results achieved

    Since the training in family medicine (practical classes under the Family Medicine
Specialization Training Program and the entire Program of Additional Training) is provided in the
Family Medicine Training Centers with community health care centers (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Mostar
and satellite centers located in Zenica and Bihać), it was necessary to improve capacities of these



                                                 52
centers by providing adequate equipment and learning aids. Thus the Project procured for this
purpose several anatomical training dummies, professional literature, missing furniture, commuter
equipment and video link equipment so that training centers can effectively communicate with
each other and with other centers in the region. Also, the training centers’ premises were
refurbished and this substantially improved training, both theoretical and practical.
     The Project also supported academic training for the centers’ staff by providing financial
support to a number of employees of the training centers to complete their Master’s or PhD
degrees. This effectively created necessary prerequisites to ensure that the centers can now
autonomously provide Family Medicine training and CPE trainings for health professionals.

   Subcomponent 1.3 – Limited refurbishment and procurement of equipment for Family
Medicine Ambulantas

    Results achieved

     Outstanding results have been achieved in the area of improvements to the infrastructure.
Refurbishment of interior of Family Medicine Ambulantas and procurement of equipment for
those Family Medicine Ambulantas was carried out in five phases, which resulted in total of 455
refurbished and 488 equipped Family Medicine Ambulantas.
     During this process, SPI coordinated with cantonal ministries of health and visited the sites
and met with directors of local community health care centers and their staff.
     At the same time SPI intensively worked on activities aimed at developing tenders for
purchase of medical equipment and furniture. Based on the situational needs analysis for each
individual Family Medicine Ambulantas, technical specifications of the equipment and furniture
were revised at each stage of the procurement process and improvement in technical terms.

    Difficulties in implementation and lessons learned

     Number of cantons, or rather their municipalities demonstrated significant willingness to try
and ensure co-financing from local communities and some other sources in order to provide, built,
and prepare proposed PHC sites to the extent that would allow effective support to be provided by
the Project. On the other hand, support to number of originally proposed was canceled at some
point due to construction and structural issues of Family Medicine Ambulantas, unresolved
ownership issued, or because it was simply not cost-effective to invest in such structures. Use of
medical equipment has been satisfactory, and there were no major complains to quality of the
equipment procured under the Project.

    Designs for FM Ambulantas under Refurbishment Phases 4 and 5

     While the Project was waiting for the funds for Additional Financing to become effective, the
decision was made to go ahead and conduct adequate preparations regarding the continuation of
refurbishment of Family Medicine Ambulantas nominated by the cantonal ministries of health
under remaining phases of refurbishment and provision of equipment. As a result, the Federation
of BiH Ministry of Health signed a contract with a selected design company which visited FM
Ambulantas, prepared, and developed project documentation for 60 Family Medicine Ambulantas




                                               53
proposed for refurbishment under the Additional Financing of the health Sector Enhancement
Project.

    Difficulties in implementation and lessons learned

     Due to delay in effectiveness of funds from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB)
in relation to already effective IDA loan on the beginning of the Project, refurbishment of Family
Medicine Ambulantas included under Phase 1 faced a number of difficulties, including delayed
payments to contractors once the works completed, and altogether led to slow down of the entire
refurbishment process and significant delay in civil works.
     In addition to these delays, procedure to purchase medical equipment and furniture was also
delayed and that resulted in delayed delivery to the Family Medicine Ambulantas that by that time
were already refurbished and ready to receive the medical equipment and furniture. Preparation
and implementation of other phases of refurbishment and procurement of equipment for Family
Medicine Ambulantas were realized for the most parts in accordance with the timeframe as
provided under the contracts with contractors/suppliers and without major difficulties.

    Purchase of IT equipment – Co-financing of Computerization Project in the Sarajevo
Canton and selected sites in Hercegovina-Neretva Canton

     In the final year of the Project, the plan was to purchase ultrasound imaging devices for
community health care centers in the Federation of BiH using the remaining co-financing funds
provided by the Government of the Federation of BiH. SPI formally advertised the purchase of the
devices in accordance with the World Bank’s procedures. However, even though received bids
were evaluated, the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health decided to cancel the purchase because
the Government of the Federation of BiH decided that health care sector computerization is
priority.

    Subcomponent –Primary Health Care Informatization

     Support to improved information system for Primary Health Care was provided through the
Project’s Additional Financing. Subcomponent under which the PHC Informatization was
implemented was carried out in two stages – preparation and implementation.
     Under the preparation stage this subcomponent’s project plan was defined, and the focus
was placed on definition, finalization, and enactment of required legislature in support of
development of Health Information System for PHC. Rulebook on Definition of Primary Health
Care health Information System Architecture (Federation of BiH Official Gazette No. 82/13) was
enacted to ensure technological and functional requirements for implementation of Health
Information System for PHC. This Rulebook also stipulated procedure for certification of software
solutions to be used in the Primary Health Care.
     Beyond this, a situational analysis was conducted to assess both quality and quantity of IT
capabilities at community health care centers in the Federation of BiH..
     Also, WAN’s were installed at remote sites in Sarajevo Canton, city of Mostar, and Tuzla
Community Health Care Center under continued efforts to procure IT equipment in accordance
with the Decision of the Federation of BiH Government.




                                               54
     Under the implementation stage of this subcomponent SPI started procedure to purchase
missing IT equipment on the basis of the situational analysis.
     In addition, the Rulebook on Technological and Functional Requirements for Introduction of
Integrated Information System (hereinafter referred to as the Rulebook) was formally enacted and
this Rulebook was used as a basis to formally certify software solution in Primary Health Care by
the Expert Committee appointed by the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health in accordance with
the Rulebook.

    Difficulties in implementation and lessons learned

      Due to immense workload and frequent changes in the field, findings of the situational
analyses had to be revised several times by IT supervision from the time the analysis complete
until such time as the purchase of network and IT equipment was carried out.
      In principle health institutions do not have any staff with IT knowledge and skills needed to
support the situational analysis. This resulted in certain gaps and shortcomings in recording actual
IT needs at number of sites. Another element that made this analysis even more complex was the
fact that a huge number of sites were included in it.
      Although the original plan was to purchase and implement Electronic Health Record across
the entire Federation of BiH, the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health did not obtain approval
from two cantons go purchase the software applications for Primary Health Care and such concept
was botched.

    Subcomponent 1.4 Communication Activities and Media Campaign

    Objective

     Under this specific project assignment, the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health defined the
following priorities and objectives which were to be achieved by the media campaign:

    • Adequate, timely and continued presentation of new elements in the health sector reform
      with focus on development and benefits of family medicine model, and also the process of
      patient registration.
    • The second objective was to promote health, in particular healthy living styles aiming to
      improve health habits of the population.

    Results achieved

      This project assignment was realized within the timeframe as provided under the contract and
was coordinated by ad hoc expert board appointed by the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health.
In order to implement tasks of the media campaign, it was necessary to select a number of cantonal
family medicine representatives and representatives of cantonal stakeholders who received the
relevant training and then actively participated in realization of the campaign. During the
realization of this project assignment, the Consultant developed timeline of activities and
methodological framework and ways of interpretation of ten creative packages of the campaign
titled “We Change the Health Care System, You Change Your Habits.” These packages that
included a number of press conferences, production and distribution of flyers and brochures,


                                                55
posters and billboards, radio and TV shows, jingles and TV clips that effectively focused on
specific topics. As a result of the media campaign, general public’s interest increased in topics
related to Primary Health Care, general health sector-related issues and it was reported that media
actually increased coverage of health related topics either though media reports or special TV and
radio shows. One of the effects of the media campaign is the continuation of collaboration between
the Federation BiH Ministry of Health and major media outlets in the Federation BiH.

    Performance-Based Payment

   Promotion and Prevention Task for Family Medicine teams – Performance-Based Incentive
Payments model testing

     Goal of this subcomponent was to implement performance-based contracts for
implementation of relevant promotion and prevention tasks and to standardize the set of promotion
and prevention tasks to be implemented by Family Medicine Teams.
     A standardized set of promotion and prevention services, based on life cycle needs assessment
model, should serve as a foundation for formulation of result based incentives paid to Family
Medicine Teams. These promotion and prevention services covered most common risk factors to
the health of population in Federation of BiH including high blood pressure, obesity, physical
inactivity, smoking, high blood sugar, and high blood lipids. They also included screenings for
most common malignant diseases (breast cancer, colon cancer, and cervical cancer).
     Based on the Rulebook and contracts signed with pilot community health care centers/Family
Medicine Teams in Sarajevo, Zenica, Tuzla, and Mostar, the Project tested implementation of
provision of the prevention and promotion services set and incentive payments to Family Medicine
Teams.
     During the implementation of these activities SPI made quarterly payments for the services
provided on the basis of agreed payment indicators. A web application was also developed in
support of this assignment’s implementation.
     It is important to note here that the set of prevention and promotion services has been
incorporated into the new reporting forms and it can be expected that it will be possible to monitor
and collect information about this segment of health services though routine health statistics
system.

    Difficulties in implementation and lessons learned

     Although the Project facilitated framework for prevention activities and models for incentive
payments, sustainability of these activities is unclear and implementation of this concept across all
Family Medicine teams is uncertain, and this is responsibility of the cantonal authorities.
Specifically, health insurance institutes should made decision and go ahead and formally include
incentive payments for such activities provided by Family Medicine Teams and incentive payment
for excellence in implementation of a set of prevention and promotion services in contracts with
community health care centers.

    Component 2 – Improvement of Health Sector Management Capacity

    Objective

     Overall aim of this component is to support sustained professional development in health
sector and development of capacities needed for implementation of essential changes in the way
health care services are provided at different levels of health system. Special focus was placed on
strengthening and implementing health management training that was previously initiated under
the Basic Health Project
     Another very important objective was to create, through implementation of this project
assignment, necessary prerequisites that were to allow sustainability of the system put in place to
strengthen managerial skills/health management in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

    Results achieved

     Under the Health Sector Enhancement Project, the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health
appointed both Expert and Management Board of the Health Management Center which included
representatives from the three medical schools in the Federation of BiH, representatives from the
Federation of BiH Health Insurance and Reinsurance, the Federation of BiH Public Health
Institute, and the School of Economics. The project activities were implemented in Sarajevo,
Tuzla, and Mostar Medical Schools and in the Bihać Health Care Center. The training process
included gradual involvement of local experts in health management who also actively participated
in the trainings, in particular in the training for family medicine doctors and nurses. As a result of
this process, 600 family medicine teams received the training in change management; all directors
of community health care centers and 51 member of middle management received the training in
business and strategic planning; and 54 specialists from health insurance institutes received the
training in contracting skills.
     Because this project assignment aimed at ensuring establishment of a sustainable health
management system in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, SPI and the Consultant
developed the specific levels and formally responsibilities for the training in health management.
Thus graduate and PhD academic development in health management is now provided by medical
schools, while short training including targeted courses in health management (for which there is
a far greater need within the health system) are responsibility of the Federation of BiH Public
Health Institute. This is why this agency formed a Health Management Unit. In fact, the Federation
of BiH Ministry of Health believes this agency will be our future partner in continued process of
strengthening of managerial skills, which was also planned under the HSEP’s Additional
Financing.
     Starting from September 2014 total of 199 trainees successfully completed Basic Program,
132 trainees successfully completed Intermediate Program, and 75 trainees successfully completed
Advances Program.
     This continued professional development process continued after the Project ended its support
and the Health Management Center now provides the training in this area independently.




                                                 57
    Project Component 3 – Health Policy Formulation and Project Support

    Objective

     Primary objective of this component is to provide assistance to key stakeholder agencies
aimed at strengthening of the capacity for data collection and analysis in support of sectorial policy
formulation and to guide priority setting and resource allocation in health sector.
     This component also provides grants for different innovations projects aimed at prevention of
diseases and promotion of health. This component also included a survey titled “Evaluation of
Primary Health Care Reform with focus on Family Medicine Model." Findings of this survey
served as starting point to design and develop project activities and then implement them through
the Project's Additional Financing.

     Subcomponent 3.1 Technical assistance in improvement of monitoring and evaluation
system

    Further Development of Monitoring and Evaluation System

     Another goal of the Project’s Additional Financing was to continue to build capacities of
ministries of health, public health institutes, and health insurance institutes for data collection and
analysis by strengthening their routine health statistics system (improved data collection system)
and its harmonization with the WHO and EU requirements (type and form of data, data
standardization). The goal was also to establish framework for monitoring and evaluation of
strategic goals by implementing strategic plans in the Federation of BiH health sector. The Project
also worked to prepare for implementation of this framework addressing day-to-day operations of
the relevant institutions (the Federation of BiH Public Health Institute and the Federation of BiH
Health Insurance and Reinsurance Institute) which are required to do so under the law.

    Survey

    Objective

     The purpose of this survey was to evaluate reform in number of selected areas of primary
health care with a focus on the development of a Family Medicine model and to review the
achievement of specific goals featured in the Primary Health Care Development Strategy.

    Results Achieved

     The survey was a cross-section study which used surveying, interviewing and focus group
methods. The tool which were used included questionnaire for Family Medicine physicians and
Family Medicine nurses, questionnaire for patients, guidelines for semi-structured individual
interview, guidelines for focus groups to include directors of community health care centers,
guidelines for focus groups to include specialists with community health care centers other than
Family Medicine specialist.
     The survey results provided several general facts: considerable progress has been made in
training of staff members, equipping and refurbishing of Family Medicine clinics. Respondents



                                                  58
felt that progress has been made in improving the availability and quality of health care and that
the community health care centers in the Federation of BiH are being gradually reorganized as the
Family medicine model grows. However it was also felt that there are objective and subjective
factors which impede the process of the implementation of the Family Medicine model in the
Federation of BiH.
      Key findings of the survey primarily identified lack of human resources, in particular doctors
in the primary health care, slow reforms of health services financing and lack of adequate
allocation of funds within community health care centers, as well as the need for new regulatory
mechanisms and legislation that will speed up further development of family medicine model.
      Based on these key findings, the Consultant provided recommendations for future actions
regarding the health policies. Beyond this, the survey also served as groundwork for development
of concept of the Project's extension and definition of priority subcomponents.
      Another survey was conducted through the Project’s Additional Financing – it was actually a
follow up survey into health status of the Federation of BiH’s population

    Subcomponent 3.2 - Innovation Grants

    Objective

     Objectives of the grant projects included improvement of general public awareness on
prevention of risk factors for most common and mass non-communicable diseases through
different innovative prevention approaches, strengthening of prevention through Family Medicine
teams and promotion of healthy life styles habits and life styles through introduction of new
preventive methodologies for provision of health care services, better understanding and
acceptance of Family Medicine model in general public as a system of primary prevention. In order
to achieve these general objectives, grants were awarded to project that involved different
prevention and educational programs.

    Results achieved

     Thus far total of 57 innovation projects were implemented. The projects were phased out in
three cycles – 8 in first cycle, 13 in the second cycle, and 19 in the third and final cycle, whereas
another 17 innovation projects were implemented through the HSEP Additional Financing which
focused on prevention of risk factors in the most common mass noncontiguous diseases.

    Difficulties in implementation and lessons learned

     Each of these projects helped in the process of providing health care services, they developed
cooperation between health care sector, other social sectors and non-governmental sector. What is
even more important, these projects provided health care services to targeted population groups
for which official health sector institutions still do not have capacities to provide. Another
significant result of these projects for the health system is the fact that these projects effectively
demonstrated existing weaknesses of the health system in terms of organized prevention and health
care for vulnerable groups and that such type of cooperation should continue in health care
provision. Also, as demonstrated by results achieved under this subcomponent, it is obvious that
efforts should be made to secure adequate funds and provide health care to everyone. Beyond this,



                                                 59
the assignment exposed weaknesses of local communities and poor understanding of local
authorities in terms of benefits of such interventions.

    Subcomponent 3.3 – Project Support

     During the course of the transition period, or rather in the first year of implementation, the
Project utilized local consultants who were already working with the SITAP Project
Implementation Unit (PIU). This resulted in a series of problems and hampered their full-time
work on the Project which effectively depended on their engagement. On the other hand, procedure
to recruit and hire staff for the SPI through the Civil Services Agency was taking too long in
relation to the needs and dynamics of the Project. Although both Project Appraisal Document and
Project Implementation Manual envisioned that all members of the PIU team would transition into
the SPI as full-time employees, this did not happen although the vacancies were advertised:

    Full time staff of the project team has included:

            •   Assistant Minister
            •   Financial and accounting manager
            •   Technical monitoring officer
            •   Administrative assistant

     SPI outsourced, though consultancy contacts, an interpreter, a procurement consultant and a
financial management consultant.
     In the course of the Project’s Additional Financing, Sector for Project Implementation hired
an expert advisor to coordinate project activity. The expert advisor was already a civil servant
employed at the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health. As the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health
previously formed Monitoring and Evaluation Department, the monitoring and evaluation
specialist left the SPI. Another employee of the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health was hired
by SPI to monitor realization of refurbishment and provision of equipment for Family Medicine
Ambulantas.
     An IT consultant was hired to coordinate activities related to the Primary Health Care
Informatization and coordination of activities in the area of performance-based incentive payments
for Family Medicine Teams for prevention and promotion activities they provided was conducted
also by a hired local expert/consultant.
     During the entire duration of the implementation, the Project had seen difficulties with regards
to hiring a full-time procurement specialist which has significantly encumbered performance of
this very demanding Project. Generally, SPI is not staffed at the level that could effectively meet
requirements and challenges of the Project and the project activities, although Staffing Rulebook
calls for additional positions to be staffed. SPI still needs to fill out two vacant positions. The
priority is to hire a full-time procurement specialist and financial manager, in particular because
SPI was required to maintain 'double' accounting and financial reporting – in accordance with
requirements of both creditors and local legislation.




                                                 60
    Procurement

     The Agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the International Development
Association (IDA) on financing of HSEP defined guidelines for procurement of goods, works, and
services. The Project Agreement stipulated that all purchases made under the Project should be
made in accordance with agreed Procurement Plan and on the basis of the World Bank's guidelines.
     Procurement of goods and works has been conducted in accordance with the World Bank's
Guidelines on Procurement of Goods, Works, and Non-Consultancy Services under IBRD loans
and IDA Credits and Loans of May 2004 as revised in October 2006, May 2010, January 2011,
and July 2014. Different types of available procurement methods have been used.
     Procurement of constancy contracts has been conducted in accordance with the World Bank's
Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants for World Bank Borrowers under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits and Grants of May 2004 as revised in October 2006, May 2010, January
2011, and July 2014. Different types of available procurement methods have been used.

    Financial Management

     SPI maintained an adequate financial management system which provided all necessary
financial functions and operations, as well as an accounting system, financial reporting and audit
in order to provide timely information that can be relied upon in terms of sources and expenditures
of the Project.

    Project’s financial management has successfully sustained the following financial functions:

   •   Definition of budget, definition of plans and controls of all financial, logistic, and
       administrative operations and staff-related operations including payments, purchasing and
       registration of Project supplies and fixes assets;
   •   Relations with the banks and the government institutions;
   •   Development of reports for the World Bank and the Federation of BiH Government.

     The accounting system has entailed a computerized accounting process that used specific
accounting software.
     Pursuant to the Legal Agreement on the Project, within 6 months following end of each fiscal
year SPI provides to both the World Bank and CEB annual audited financial project reports
acceptable for the creditors. The Project has been subject to financial audits three times and the
each time the external auditors provided positive opinion. Financial management provides routine
quarterly reports to creditors.
     As regards the reporting in accordance with the legislation of the Federation of BiH, SPI has
reported on quarterly basis to the Federation of BiH Ministry of Health on status of the Project.
     After the end of each fiscal year, independent auditors hired by the BiH Ministry of Finance
and Treasury, being a signatory to the Credit Agreement, audited financial management of the
Project. The audits never identified any issues with financial operations of the Project. Findings of
the audits were also provided to the BiH Ministry of Finance and Treasury, the World Bank, and
the Federation of BiH Ministry of Finance, as a signatory of the Subsidiary Credit Agreement.
