Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The overall development objective of the project is to improve overall results for non-communicable diseases as measured by proxyindicators and:
 (i) enhance health system efficiency through restructuring and strengthening of primary health care along thefamily medicine model; and (ii)
 strengthen the policy making process through the development and implementation of a system formonitoring andevaluating health sector
 performance.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?
 Yes

 Board Approved Revised Project Development Objective (If project is formally restructured)PHRPDODEL
 The objectives of the Project are to (i) expand and enhance the family medicine model of primary health care; (ii) build managementcapacity in the
 sector; and (iii) strengthen the policy making process through the development and implementation of a system for monitoring and evaluating sector
 performance.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Health Sector Enhancement Project will be fully disbursed by the closing date of the AF credit
 (December 31, 2014), and all activities are expected to be completed and the project development
 objectives met. The original Credit in the amount of US$17.0 million equivalent was approved on March 31,
 2005 and became effective on April 3, 2006. The original closing date was extended from December 15,
 2010 to June 30, 2011 to allow the processing of the AF.
 The original project has been successfully implemented and the project development objective is rated as
 Satisfactory with significant achievements in a) restructuring of the primary health care system based on the
 Family Medicine (FM) model; b) building management capacity through the training of individuals with
 higher education degrees in health management or related degrees; and c) building capacity for monitoring
 and evaluating the sector including the establishment of an inter-agency working group responsible for
 sector evaluation. Based on these achievements, the authorities of BiH requested Additional Financing to
 scale up project activities to enhance the development impact by expanding the education of more Family
 Medicine doctors, the retraining of more existing primary health care teams and to reach more communities
 through the upgrade of the Family medicine offices. With the support of the Additional Financing credit, the
 Project delivered a complex set of interventions to improve the conditions of the primary health care
 facilities, updated the medical equipment of these facilities, trained FM teams (doctors and nurses), develop
 protocols, developed and implemented quality standards and quality control mechanisms, supported IT
 components including software applications to improve the management of health services, and
 implemented performance based payments with special focus on preventive services.
 Savings achieved by combining procurement processes and reducing operational cost were used to provide
 additional training and increase the number of primary care facilities rehabilitated and equipped, but also to solve
 some emergency needs generated by the flooding of the summer of 2014 (repair ambulantas, replace equipment,
 equipment to control outbreaks, etc).
