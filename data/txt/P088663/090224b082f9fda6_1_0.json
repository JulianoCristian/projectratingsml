follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance

Some lessons learned included:\n            flexibility from the Bank side, to adjust to client specific\n            institutional arrangements, is essential for a successful\n            implementation.  Bank and the government need to give\n            careful consideration to the project implementation\n            arrangements, to ensure a smooth implementation of project\n            activities.  Sustaining the achievements of the reform in\n            PHC, through Family Medicine model, is of significant\n            importance.  M&E is a critical part of the project\n            design and it requires strong attention during project\n            preparation and implementation. The project was prepared\n            quite rapidly, with less than nine months from concept note\n            review to Board approval. Despite team efforts for preparing\n            a thorough project, the quick preparation did not provide\n            the required time to: (i) produce a proper M&E framework\n            and collect required information; and (ii) carefully\n            consider specific needs and situations of the country, with\n            focus on human capacity. As a result, project implementation\n            endured certain bottlenecks during its first years, which\n            were mostly sorted out during project life."}, "docdt": "2015-06-23T13:26:03Z"}
