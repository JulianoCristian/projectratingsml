follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: donors can be effective with a limited technical\n            role, setting benchmarks consistent with international best\n            practice and putting the client institution in contact with\n            top microfinance practitioners. Maintain focus on program\n            objectives rather than short-term performance issues and the\n            missteps that are inevitable during program development,\n            especially in large organizations. When missteps occur along\n            the way but the client's institutional commitment to\n            the program's objectives is strong, keeping the focus\n            on the commitment and de facto results can prevent\n            overreaction. Transparency can be a powerful tool to keep\n            the focus on sustainability. Explicitly taking into account\n            subsidies in the assessment of the workings of development\n            financial institutions will help management and donors keep\n            the emphasis on low costs on the one hand and portfolio\n            quality on the other."}, "docdt": "2007-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
