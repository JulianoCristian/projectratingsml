Re:
Brazil: Loan No. 4554-BR (Northeast Microfinance Development 
Project) First Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Mr. Queiroz:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement) for the Northeast 
Microfinance Development Project between the Banco do Nordeste do Brasil S. A. (the 
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), 
with guarantee of the Republic Federative of Brazil, dated August 3, 2000.
The Bank hereby amends the Section 3.04 (b) by replacing the date "September 30, 
2000" by the date "September 30, 2001".
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and dating the two 
originals of this letter and returning one fully signed original to us.  Upon receipt 
by the Bank of such fully signed original, the amendment set forth in this letter will 
be effective as of the date of its countersignature.
We wish to confirm also that the formula set forth in Annex 3 of the Minutes of 
Negotiations related to the Loan Agreement dated March 23, 2000 inadvertently omitted 
the negative sign in front of the formula, and that such omission has been corrected. 
A revised Annex 3 is being faxed today for your records.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
   AND DEVELOPMENT
