targeted\n            assistance to the Northeast Region which constitutes the\n            largest concentration of poverty in Brazil. The project\n            addresses the lack of access of the poor to financial\n            services, an important constraint to improved productivity\n            and incomes. The project's overall objective is to\n            improve the access of microenterprises throughout the\n            Northeast Region to sustainable, formal financial services\n            by supporting expansion of the program known as\n            \"CrediAmigo\" in Brazil. The project has three\n            components. The first provides funds for CrediAmigo to make\n            loans for working capital and investment to solidarity\n            groups and individual solidarity group clients who have\n            \"graduated\" by virtue of a good loan repayment\n            record. The second component strengthens the capacity of\n            CrediAmigo by hiring consultants to assist it to develop\n            promotional and marketing strategies; build risk management\n            capabilities; enhance loan officer productivity; increase\n            cost-effective geographic coverage using projections,\n            bolstering legal and regulatory requirements, and providing\n            training and support needs; identify and design new loan and\n            savings products; conduct evaluations of the environmental\n            management program; and to support loan administration. The\n            third component finances technical assistance to design,\n            implement, and analyze statistical surveys."}, "docdt": "2000-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
