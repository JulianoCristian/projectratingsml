moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: flexibility in supervision to\n            adapt to changing scenarios is essential for success, both\n            when the changes are marginal and when they are fundamental\n            to the point of rendering the attainment of the operation\n            objectives impossible. The Bank can help in building lasting\n            reforms by limiting the scope of the projects to what can be\n            accomplished within a certain political and economic\n            environment, even if not fully market-oriented. Donors such\n            as the Bank can add value by setting benchmarks consistent\n            with international best practice and putting the client\n            institution in contact with top practitioners in each field.\n            In principle, a viable and broadly independent microfinance\n            institution can be set up within an existing public sector\n            bank and there may be benefits to doing so. However, this\n            leaves it open to influence by the prevailing political\n            climate. It may be tempting in some political environments\n            to expand outreach at the expense of sustainability. The\n            Bank's decision to remain engaged was anchored on real\n            successes achieved in terms of outreach, which illustrates\n            dilemmas about outreach versus sustainability. Subsidies can\n            be explicitly taken into account through a Subsidy\n            Dependence Index provided it is well defined. While\n            institutional aspects are crucial for the delivery of\n            financial services to microenterprises, national economic\n            policies are equally crucial."}, "docdt": "2014-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
