The Rasuwa - Nuwakot Rural\n            Development Project will aim: (a) to consolidate the\n            investments made during the earlier phase of development by\n            making all physical facilities fully operational, and by\n            improving the qualities and coverage of agricultural support\n            services and the services of the institutions responsible\n            for rural infrastructure development and maintenance.
