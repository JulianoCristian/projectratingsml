The project only\n            achieved a few of its objectives, it impact on institutional\n            development was negligible, sustainability is unlikely, and\n            the performance of the Bank was satisfactory while the\n            Borrower's was unsatisfactory. A few key lessons that\n            can be learned from this project are: 1) the Bank should\n            have suspended the project when it discerned the problem of\n            biasness, rather than attempting in vain to persuade an\n            unwilling Borrower to accept its recommendation of\n            restructuring the project; 2) before a new project is\n            designed, lessons learned from previous experiences in the\n            country concerned should be reviewed and perhaps put on a\n            checklist which should be consulted to avoid lapses of\n            memory during the design of subsequent projects; 3) when the\n            TA component is crucial for effective project\n            implementation, the Bank should insist on financing the\n            component to ensure that it can supervise the component\n            directly; and 4) the Borrower should not let a project be\n            handicapped by frequent changes of senior staff and\n            positions left unfilled for long periods of time."}, "docdt": "1994-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
