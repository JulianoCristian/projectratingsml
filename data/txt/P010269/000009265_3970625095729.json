Region of Nepal, which\n            was completed in June 1984. The Rasuwa - Nuwakot Rural\n            Development Project will aim: (a) to consolidate the\n            investments made during the earlier phase of development by\n            making all physical facilities fully operational, and by\n            improving the qualities and coverage of agricultural support\n            services and the services of the institutions responsible\n            for rural infrastructure development and maintenance. It\n            would also seek (b) to further improve the agricultural\n            production base and the socio-economic infrastructure; (c)\n            to expand forestry plantation and soil conservation\n            programs; and (d) to promote development of effective local\n            level planning and implementation of rural development projects."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
