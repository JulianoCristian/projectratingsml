The project consists of three\n            components.  The investment finance component will be onlent\n            to eligible participating financial intermediaries (PFIs)\n            through an apex arrangement at the Reserve Bank of Malawi\n            (RBM) to finance projects in the productive sectors promoted\n            by foreign and indigenous entrepreneurs.  The industrial\n            sites component will ensure timely availability of\n            industrial infrastructure to industrial sites and factory\n            shells to encourage investment by indigenous and foreign\n            investors, especially those investing in export-oriented\n            activities.  The institutional capacity development\n            component will provide technical assistance and training to:\n            (a) strengthen RMB's monetary policy management\n            capability; (b) assist the government to develop the\n            institutional framework for the promotion of foreign and\n            domestic investment; (c) support programs for\n            diversification into merchant banking; (d) restructure the\n            Post Office Savings Bank into an autonomous and efficient\n            financial institution; and (e) train local financial\n            institutions' staff in project appraisal-related\n            issues, especially the institutions that support small and\n            medium enterprises and women entrepreneurs."}, "docdt": "1991-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
