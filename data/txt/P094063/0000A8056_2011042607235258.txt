                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project, together with the associated project, Support for Philippine Basic Education Reforms (SPHERE) Trust Fund financed by AusAID and managed by the WB, support the
                         Philippines' Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda. While there was moderate improvement in terms of the overall outcome indicators, the task team noted the slower than
                         expected progress since the Sixth Implementation Support Mission in August 2010, particularly in terms of attaining the agreed-upon results indicators and in terms of effectively
                         addressing the identified obstacles to continuing and institutionalizing the reforms.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1) Review, revise, and make operational the planned reform implementation arrangements to lead and manage the implementation of an integrated reform agenda
                         2) Revise the Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda Implementation and Accountability Plan to include the expansion of the basic education cycle and other new priorities.
                         3) Ensure issues of equity are addressed particularly in the provision of critical resources to the disadvantaged/marginalized population
                         4) Ensure compliance to the NPSBE loan covenant to avoid any potential delays in the payment of progress claims
