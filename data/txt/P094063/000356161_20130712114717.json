REFORM PROGRAM", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7393", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the National Program Support\n            for Basic Education Project for Philippines were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            institutionalization of reforms requires a long- term\n            commitment on the part of government and the donor community\n            to support the reform agenda. School Based Management (SBM)\n            is an important tool for decentralizing an education system\n            and improving learning outcomes. Public private partnerships\n            are important for ensuring the long-term availability of\n            adequate resources to support community schools. Solid\n            analytical studies on system reforms during the\n            implementation period are essential for making appropriate\n            decisions on the elimination of bottlenecks to the reform\n            agenda. Strong financial management systems are critical for\n            ensuring the efficient use and accounting of resources. A\n            report-based disbursement system is more efficient than a\n            statement of expenses disbursement system for a large\n            education bureaucracy. Bank support can play an important\n            role in leveraging money for government policy reforms."}, "docdt": "2013-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
