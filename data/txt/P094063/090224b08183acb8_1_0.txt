                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Need to document the extensive lessons learned from this project, given the comprehensive nature of the reforms it supported. The project completion report to be prepared by
                         both the Bank and the Government would be important 'venues' to highlight these.
                         2. Need to support the convergence efforts of the government especially the Cabinet Cluster on Human Development and Poverty REduction for a unified and multisectoral
                         approach to the multidimensional challenges in education.
