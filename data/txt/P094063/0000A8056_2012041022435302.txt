                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project, which was extended by another year to complete the procurement of textbooks, is already winding down. As of the last Mission, which ended on March 22, 2012, the
                         various components and sub-component activities of the project have been almost completed. In terms of the outcome indicators, while there have been improvements registered
                         compared to the previous two missions, these fell short of achieving the targets

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1) Complete the pending activities which will be critical to achieving the milestones set under the project
                         2) Focus on core priorities to avoid spreading resources (esp manpower) too thinly
                         3) Ensure compliance to the NPSBE loan covenants to avoid any potential delays in the payment of progress claims
