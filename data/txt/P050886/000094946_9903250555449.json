seeks to test and evaluate an approach for the\n            provision of demand-driven support services necessary to\n            develop an efficient, sustainable small irrigation\n            sub-sector in Burkina Faso. There are four project\n            components. 1) The first component will finance the project\n            technical executing agency and its capacity building. 2) The\n            second component will promote new technologies through\n            on-farm and off-farm support services including technical\n            feasibility studies for micro irrigation and related\n            investments. This component focuses on providing target\n            beneficiaries (small irrigation farmers, private operators\n            involved in the marketing and processing of irrigation\n            products, and providers of farm inputs and services to\n            irrigation activities) support services aimed at increasing\n            their incomes and employment. 3) The third component will\n            help the target beneficiaries establish a record in the\n            formal credit system, thereby gaining access in the future\n            to the formal banking sector. 4) The fourth component will\n            support the establishment of a strong monitoring and\n            evaluation capacity. 5) The fifth component will set up a\n            financial coordination unit, which is responsible for the\n            financial management of the project."}, "docdt": "1998-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
