Interesting lessons\n            suggest the following. The approach developed by the project\n            has shown that rural private entrepreneurs can efficiently\n            replace public services, for advisory services or equipment\n            dissemination. However, this does not happen all of a\n            sudden, rather requires targeted supports: training, both on\n            technical aspects and entrepreneurship skills; economic\n            organization of artisans, and, the institutional\n            organization of distribution networks. Experience shows the\n            objective of entrepreneurial development should be\n            reinforced in further operations. Moreover, the project\n            demonstrates that small scale irrigation can be a profitable\n            activity, and an efficient tool to increasing\n            producers' incomes. To this end, public resources\n            should not only target large irrigation schemes, but promote\n            the development of private networks for the dissemination of\n            such technologies and techniques. Further lessons show how a\n            private institution may indeed be competent and efficient in\n            implementing a project using public financing resources,\n            able to progress and improve its institutional capacity, and\n            to avoid managing all activities by itself, rather the\n            contrary, delegating execution to subsidiary institutions\n            and private firms under contractual arrangements."}, "docdt": "2005-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
