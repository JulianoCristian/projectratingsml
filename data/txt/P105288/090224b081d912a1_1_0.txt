                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework offiscal responsibility. Through improved
                         services the Project aims to support the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and to increase social equity. To this end, the Province
                         prioritized a set of interventions through the sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2012 specifically aimed to:
                         i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province, to implement the InfrastructureProgram following sound fiscal policies to
                         ensure convergencetowards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework.
                         ii. Improve and maintain high priority segments of the non-concessioned paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen
                         regional competitiveness.
                         iii. Enhance access to water, sewerage, sanitation and urban drainage services, especially for the low-income segments of the population living in highly vulnerable
                         areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense.
                         The specific Project Development Objective is to improve the social and environmental welfare of approximately 5,000,000 people through the improved provision of
                         transport, water and sanitation and drainage services.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. This ISR covers the period of December 2012 to May 2013. It includes the main findings of the supervision mission carried out on May 24 to 31, 2013.

                         2. The project remains on track to achieve its development objectives of enhancing the welfare of people in the Province of Buenos Aires through improving the provision of
                         infrastructure services. All civil works under this project are completed, except for the Finochietto drainage subproject which is currently at 94% of physical execution and is expect to
                         be completed before project closing on August 15, 2013.

                         3. The less advanced components are the technical assistance and capacity building ones. Although there has been progress under the three technical assistance sub-components
                         since December 2013, a number of technical assistance activities under implementation and several ongoing bidding processes cannot be completed before the project’s current
                         closing date. These delays are partly due to administrative delays experienced by the Province of Buenos Aires as a result of the April 2013 flooding.

                         4. USD 261.87 million (96.99 percent) of the revised loan amount has been disbursed.

                         5. Regarding social and environmental safeguards, the Province continues to provide adequate attention to these aspects under the Project.
