APL) is to enhance the provision of water and\n            sewerage services for the benefit of low-income people, in\n            particular for those people living in highly vulnerable\n            areas; to improve high priority road segments of the\n            borrower's road network; to mitigate urban flooding;\n            and to support the reactivation of the borrower's\n            economy and strengthen its regional competitiveness. The\n            changes are necessary because of considerable increases in\n            construction costs in Argentina, which are affecting the\n            availability of funds to finance the works initially\n            foreseen in the program (both APLs), thus justifying the\n            present restructuring. The changes described in this Project\n            Paper will only affect the additional financing and include\n            the: 1) revising the scope of the civil work components to\n            reflect construction cost increases; 2) reallocating project\n            costs among components accordingly; 3) adjusting the target\n            values of project indicators to account for the revised\n            project scope; and 4) changing the loan financing\n            percentage. This restructuring does not imply any changes to\n            the project development objective or implementation arrangements."}, "docdt": "2012-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
