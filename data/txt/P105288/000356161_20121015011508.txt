7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province
within a framework of fiscal responsibility. Through improved services the Project aims to support the
return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and to increase social equity. To this
end, the Province prioritized a set of interventions through the sector wide Infrastructure Program for the
period 2005-2012 specifically aimed to: i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with
the priorities of the Province, to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to
ensure convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework. ii. Improve and maintain high
priority segments of the non-concessioned paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial
economy and strengthen regional competitiveness. iii. Enhance access to water, sewerage, sanitation and
urban drainage services, especially for the low-income segments of the population living in highly
vulnerable areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense. The specific Project Development Objective is to improve
the social and environmental welfare of approximately 5,000,000 people through the improved provision of
transport, water, and sanitation and drainage services.
