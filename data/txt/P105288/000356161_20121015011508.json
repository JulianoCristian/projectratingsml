    living in the borrower's territory through the improved\n            provision of transport, water supply and sanitation, and\n            drainage services. The restructuring, jointly with the\n            restructuring in parallel for the APL one (and Additional\n            Financing), will update the program funding structure and\n            its activities to the current context, thus providing the\n            grounds for an adequate and timely program implementation,\n            aiming at full achievement of the project development\n            objectives of both APLs (first and second).
