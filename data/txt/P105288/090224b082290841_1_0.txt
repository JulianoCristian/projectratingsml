                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework offiscal responsibility. Through improved
                         services the Project aims to support the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and to increase social equity. To this end, the Province
                         prioritized a set of interventions through the sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2012 specifically aimed to:
                         i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province, to implement the InfrastructureProgram following sound fiscal policies to
                         ensure convergencetowards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework.
                         ii. Improve and maintain high priority segments of the non-concessioned paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen
                         regional competitiveness.
                         iii. Enhance access to water, sewerage, sanitation and urban drainage services, especially for the low-income segments of the population living in highly vulnerable
                         areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense.
                         The specific Project Development Objective is to improve the social and environmental welfare of approximately 5,000,000 people through the improved provision of
                         transport, water and sanitation and drainage services.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR covers the period of May to December 2013. It is the last ISR for this Project, which closed on December 31, 2013. The Project was restructured (Type II) on August 6, 2013
                         to extend the closing date from August 31 to December 31, 2013 and to reallocate funds across disbursement categories.

                         The Project met its development objectives of enhancing the welfare of people in the Province of Buenos Aires through improving the provision of infrastructure services. All civil
                         works under this Project are complete (16 WSS works, 16 road works and the Finochietto drainage work) and all PDO-level indicators have been met. In the technical assistance
                         components (4, 5 and 6), 20 out of the 25 studies and activities financed under this Project are complete. The remaining five are almost finalized, with only a few specific sub-
                         activities pending completion. The Province informed the Bank that these activities would be completed outside of the original loan’s timeframe with counterpart funding. The Project
                         met all but one of the institutional strengthening indicators.

                         The Province adequately supervised the social and environmental aspects of the Project. The Province held several social and environmental training workshops and documented
                         best practices. These lessons will be detailed in the Project’s ICR, currently under preparation.

                         There are no outstanding FM or procurement issues at this time. The Procurement Post Review Mission was carried out from September 17 to 19, 2013, and the resulting report was
                         shared with the PIU.
