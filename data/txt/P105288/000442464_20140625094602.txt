F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The overall purpose of the APL program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the
Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility. Through improved services the Project aims to
support the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and to increase
social equity. To this end, the Province prioritized a set of interventions through the sector wide
Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2012 specifically aimed to:

     i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province,
          to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to ensure
          convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework.
     ii. Improve and maintain high priority segments of the non-concessioned paved road network
          to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional
          competitiveness.
     iii. Enhance access to water, sewerage, sanitation and urban drainage services, especially for
          the low-income segments of the population living in highly vulnerable areas of the
          Conurbano Bonaerense.


                                                                                                  iii
The Project Development Objectives (PDO) as outlined in the Loan Agreement (LA) of the APL II is
to improve the social and environmental welfare of approximately five million people living in the

Context at Appraisal

1.      The Buenos Aires Infrastructure Sustainable Development Program Project Phase II (APL2,
P105288) was part of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) that was designed in 2004. Although the
Program was split into two phases, the activities and goals of the APL1 (APL1, P088032) and APL2
were closely intertwined. In fact, the APL2 adopted the institutional logic of the APL1 and built on
the established implementation mechanisms already in place with the agencies involved. As such,
understanding the context at the time of appraising the APL1 is critical to understanding the APL2.
Furthermore, the two Projects overlapped for the entire period of implementation of the APL2:
although the APL2 began three years after the start of the APL1, the APL1, which received an
Additional Financing (AF, P114081) in 2011, is still under implementation. It is set to close in May
2015.

2.     At the time of the appraisal of the APL Program, Argentina was in the process of recovering
from the 2001 to 2002 financial crisis. The crisis led to one of the most severe losses of household
income on record. The percentage of the population under the poverty line increased from 20.5
percent in 1999 to 54 percent in 2002. The Province of Buenos Aires (PBA), the largest province in
Argentina, represented 39 percent of the Republic’s population, accounted for 36 percent of the
country’s GDP and contained the most extensive pockets of poverty in the country. The PBA’s
recovery from the crisis was crucial for the economic recovery of the entire country. 2

3.      During the financial crisis, the Government of the PBA (GoPBA) substantially reduced
infrastructure investment,3 magnifying already existent coverage and quality issues. The
infrastructure base began to deteriorate at an increasing rate, the basic needs of vulnerable groups
grew, and growth prospects were constrained. At the time of the appraisal of the APL1,
approximately 50 percent of the people living in the PBA had household connections to the water
network, and only 25 percent were connected to the sewerage network. 4 The PBA also suffered from
recurrent floods due to inadequate drainage systems, and high travel times and vehicle operating costs
due to poor road quality.5

4.      Despite the mounting need for increased infrastructure investments, the PBA faced scarce
internal financing and limited external financing options given Argentina’s fiscal uncertainty. In
response, the World Bank and the GoPBA, started addressing the difficult economic situation through
counter cyclical spending, joining forces to design a major infrastructure investment program that
responded to the most pressing infrastructure needs. The PBA and the Bank identified the following
key objectives: (i) the rehabilitation and maintenance of key segments of the provincial primary road
network to reduce logistic cost in the PBA and strengthen regional competitiveness; (ii) the
rehabilitation and expansion of basic Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) services for low income

  In 2002, at PBA’s level, investment represented 0.1 percent of GDP and 0.7 percent of total spending, compared with 0.7 percent and 7.8 percent
respectively between 1993 and 1997 (Project Appraisal Document).

segments of the population; and (iii) the expansion of urban drainage systems in areas of high
vulnerability.

5.      Given Argentina’s difficult fiscal outlook, the APL Program emphasized the need to support
the PBA’s infrastructure priorities within a fiscal responsibility framework. For the APL1, the
provincial authorities designed a framework that ensured fiscal space to service debt obligations and
to invest in infrastructure. The framework facilitated compliance with the Government of Argentina’s
(GoA) August 2004 Fiscal Responsibility Law.6 Highlighting the importance of fiscal responsibility
for the Program, the GoPBA designated the Ministry of the Economy (ME) to lead implementation
even though the Program was focused on infrastructure. In addition, the APL Program had a series of
triggers, which included a trigger on compliance with the fiscal framework, the PBA had to meet in
order for the second phase of the APL to begin.7

6.      All of the triggers except the fiscal framework trigger for the APL2, “Evidence of satisfactory
implementation of the fiscal framework that would enable accommodating the second loan, without
jeopardizing convergence towards a sustainable fiscal situation,” were met. The fiscal framework
contained various fiscal targets that ranged from debt stock levels to expenditures on personnel. At
the time of appraisal of the APL2, the PBA had made progress with respect to the targets under its
control, such as provincial revenue levels and debt stock and debt services as a proportion of net
current revenue.8 Nevertheless, the Province did not meet the targets for monitoring personnel
expenditures and the primary balance. The PBA’s failure to meet these targets was not a result of
poor fiscal management. Rather, structural changes in Argentina’s fiscal policy towards the provinces
altered the revenue balance between the Federal Government and the provinces and made the fiscal
targets that reflected expenditure variables inapplicable. As the GoA began withholding more
revenue from the provinces, the PBA became increasingly dependent on the Federal Government’s
discretionary financial assistance and less able to control its compliance with expenditure targets. The
APL1’s provincial fiscal framework no longer served to measure the availabili ty of fiscal space to
execute the project or the PBA’s medium-term debt sustainability.

7.      At the time of the appraisal of the APL2, the PBA’s main fiscal risks included: (i) the lack of
inter institutional clarity regarding the implementation of the 2004 Fiscal Responsibility Law9 and (ii)
the gradual erosion of the PBA’s fiscal performance.10 To mitigate the impact of the PBA’s fiscal
risks on the APL2’s implementation, the Bank committed itself to closely monitor fiscal and
financing conditions throughout implementation.11 Likewise, the PBA focused on exercising fiscal

6
 In August 2004, the Argentine Congress approved a Fiscal Responsibility Law. The Law set out broad principles for provincial fiscal conduct. Under
Argentina’s federal system, adherence to this law was voluntary for individual provinces, but required for those provinces that wanted continued
financial support from the Federal Government. The Law became the axis for Federal Government financing of provincial deficits. Among other
features, the Law established that: (i) nominal primary public spending should not surpass projected nominal GDP growth; (ii) debt service payments
should not exceed 15% of current revenues; and (iii) new provincial indebtedness was subject to Federal Government approval. Adherence to the law
and fulfillment of its conditions would make the Province of Buenos Aires eligible for continued financial support from the federal Government to meet
its financing needs.
7
  Trigger points included: evidence of satisfactory implementation of the fiscal framework and evidence that institutional policy and regulatory
frameworks were strengthened.
8
 In 2005, the PBA’s revenue target was met (own revenue/net current revenues (NCR) equaled 57%), debt stock/NCR was 188% (target 180%) and
debt service/NCR was 14% (target 17%).

prudence within the constraints imposed by the GoA. For instance, the PBA emphasized increasing
its own revenues, both through improved tax administration and via new taxes.12 The APL1’s
successful implementation also illustrated that the APL2 could be implemented effectively despite
fiscal risks.

Original Project/Program Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The overall purpose of the APL Program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services
in the Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility.

9.     The PDO of the APL2 is to improve the social and environmental welfare of approximately
five million people living in the Borrower’s territory through the improved provision of transport,
water and sanitation, and drainage services.13

10.    The PDO outcome indicators were: (i) High-Traffic (HT) productive road assets preserved
with an acceptable average roughness (HT IRI) to reduce operational and travel time costs and
avoided accumulation of future liabilities in the overall network (AVG IRI on total paved primary
network); (ii) reduced waterborne diseases and improved sanitary living conditions; and (iii)
improved flood management capacity measured as flood persistence times. The Project also had 10
intermediate outcome indicators, which are detailed in the Data Sheet.

Revised PDO and Key Indicators

11.     The PDO was not revised during the life of the Project. The PDO-level indicators were
restructured and approved by the Board in September 2011 to better align them with the outcome and
the revised scope of the Project as well as the APL1 indicators. The outcome indicator on WSS
services was revised to better align the indicator with the Project’s core objective of increasing access
to more people in the PBA. The original indicator measured a reduction in waterborne disease, which
reflected factors such as hygiene practices that went beyond the scope of the Project. The new
outcome indicator was the additional number of poor people with access to: (i) water connections; (ii)
available sewerage service lines; and (iii) active sewerage connections.14

12.     The flood management capacity indicator was removed because the impacts in terms of flood
persistence times (original indicator) would not have been fully observed until after the Project’s
closing. The Bank financed the optimization and expansion of macro-drainage infrastructure, while
the micro-drainage infrastructure investments (necessary for the operation of the system) were
financed with other provincial and municipal funds and were not expected to be finished until March
2014. The target for the roads outcome indicator was also revised to reflect the reduced scope of the
Project’s investments. In addition, nine intermediate indicators were restructured during the life of the


12
  At the time of appraisal of the APL2, the PBA had increased its own revenues and reduced its debt stock and debt service as a proportion of net
current revenues. The PBA’s fiscal prudence was complemented by the country’s strong economic growth (from 2003 to 2006, annual GDP averaged
nine percent, poverty fell from 59 percent in 2002 to 31 percent in 2006, and unemployment fell from 21 percent in 2003 to approximately 11 percent in
2006), which resulted in national surpluses and streamlined transfers to the PBA.
13
  This description was taken from the APL2 Loan Agreement,which is the basis for evaluation; however it differs slightly from the description in the
PAD, which reads: “The specific Project Development Objective is to improve the social and environmental welfare of approximately 5,000,000 people
through the improved provision of transport, water and sanitation and drainage services.”
14
  Active sewerage connections, the sewerage connections that are effectively connected to the network, were estimated based on a connection rate
calculation developed in the PBA that took into account the expected lag between the construction of the line an d household’s decision to connect.


                                                                                                                                                      3
Project and six new core intermediate indicators were added. See the Implementation Section and the
Data Sheet for further detail.

Beneficiaries

13.    The Project expected to benefit approximately five million residents in the PBA through
enhancing road networks, expanding access to WSS services, and improving drainage. The Project’s
WSS component had a poverty lens and targeted 450,000 people living in communities with
households averaging 40 percent or higher in the Index of Household Material Deprivation (IMPH).15
The Project also aimed to expand drainage to 500,000 people.16 The road network works were
expected to have a direct global impact on economic growth in the PBA through reducing travel
times and costs, increasing the competitiveness of small and medium-size enterprises, and generating
new employment opportunities in the construction sector.

14.      The Project aimed to benefit sector agencies and government ministries through a number of
institutional strengthening activities, including: (i) creating a strategic framework for provincial
infrastructure development; (ii) carrying out sector studies to guide informed infrastructure
investment decisions; (iii) implementing activities to promote competitiveness and job creation in the
PBA; and (iv) improving information, monitoring and maintenance systems.

Original Components

The Project components, as presented in the Loan Agreement, are as follows:

15.    Part 1: Provincial Roads (US$159 million, of which US$107 million is IBRD). This
component included:
    a) Carrying out of rehabilitation works (such as asphalt concrete overlaying) of about 10 selected
       road sections of the non-concessioned interurban primary road network (representing
       approximately 335 kilometers in the aggregate), of which two adjacent road sections
       (representing approximately 56 kilometers) will be rehabilitated under the terms of a
       CREMA17 Contract.
    b) Carrying out of rehabilitation works (such as asphalt concrete overlaying) of 1 selected road
       section of the non-concessioned primary paved road network (representing approximately 70
       kilometers) located within the Conurbano Bonaerense.
    c) Carrying out of rehabilitation works (such as removal and replacement of existing pavements)
       of non-concessioned road accesses to the Dock Sud and the Bahia Blanca ports (representing
       approximately 11 kilometers).
    d) Carrying out of rehabilitation works (such as resurfacing, asphalt concrete overlaying or
       reconstruction of the existing structure over a recycled base course) of about 6 selected road


15
  The IMPH was developed by Argentina’s National Institute of Statistics and is based on an index of hereditary depr ivation and current resource
depravation. To avoid the exclusion of borderline low-income areas, it was agreed that subprojects in vulnerable zones with IPMH ratings between 30
and 40 percent could be considered eligible for financing on a case-by-case analysis so long as they do not represent more than 15 percent of total
resources assigned to the component.
16
 There was no overlap between the beneficiaries targeted for drainage and WSS works and very little overlap between the beneficiaries targeted for
water and those targeted for sanitation works.
17
  Performance-based roads rehabilitation and maintenance contracts (CREMA) aimed to increase private sector participation in the maintenance and
management of the roads networks.


                                                                                                                                                      4
        accesses of the non-concessioned secondary paved network (representing approximately 68
        kilometers).
     e) Carrying out of: (i) widening and rehabilitation works (within the existing right- of-way) of
        about 2 selected roads of the Borrower’s non-concessioned urban primary paved network; and
        (ii) construction works (which works consist of replacing intersections by more efficient
        round-about arrangements) of about 2 selected critical black spots of the primary paved road
        network.
     f) Carrying out of the 2009-2011 annual routine maintenance programs of the non-concessioned
        primary unpaved road network.

16.    Part 2: Water and Sanitation (US$140 million, of which US$110 million is IBRD).
Carrying out of demand-driven18 water and sanitation infrastructure investments, which consist of the
construction of secondary water and sanitation networks.19

17.     Part 3: Drainage (US$41 million, of which US$32.4 million is IBRD). Carrying out of
drainage investments in selected urban and peri-urban areas in order to mitigate flooding caused by
rainfalls of high intensity and relatively short duration, which investments consists of, inter alia, the
optimization and expansion of storm drainage systems and primarily macro-drainage infrastructure
based on integrated urban drainage plans.

18.     Part 4: Technical Engineering, Feasibility, Design and Benchmarking (US$4.61 million,
of which US$4.38 million is IBRD). Carrying out of the following Project activities involving
design and implementation of a strategic framework for provincial infrastructure development
constitute an expansion of the scope of the activities carried out or to be carried out under the Buenos
Aires Infrastructure Sustainable Investment Development Project‒ Phase I: (a) design of master
infrastructure investment plans; (b) carrying out of feasibility studies of infrastructure investments
and final engineering design of investments identified by the plans mentioned in (a) above; (c)
identification of infrastructure needs, and thereafter, establishment of a set of strategic priorities so as
to avoid financing infrastructure investment bottlenecks; and (d) upon completion of the study, to
design a strategy for coastal erosion control (which is being carried out under APL 1),
implementation of the recommendations of said study (including the Bank’s views, if any), which
recommendations may include the design of infrastructure investments.

19.    Part 5: Pre-Investment for Competitiveness and Job Creation (US$8.42 million, of which
US$8 million IBRD). Carrying out of the following Project activities constitute an expansion of the
scope of the activities carried out or to be carried out under the APL 1:
    a) Identification of the economic sectors and regions which are likely to play a fundamental role
       in provincial development, and thereafter, carrying out of sector studies on economic
       development.
    b) Design of territorial guidelines to promote regional development and stimulate provincial
       growth and employment.
    c) Carrying out of a review of the regulatory framework governing the investment climate across
       the economic sectors to identify those regulations which may affect the investment climate;

18
  The WSS investments were focused on areas where concentrations of low-income families with limited access to basic services (identified using the
IPMH) were high and where there were ongoing or planned construction of main supply lines, collectors and treatment plants.
19
  Primary networks were already available (in cases where the primary network had limited resource, the Project financed reservoirs). Areas
neighboring the Project areas oftentimes already had good service. The Project supported DIPAC’s master plan by complementing service in unserved
pockets.


                                                                                                                                                      5
      and (ii) thereafter, design a plan which will include, inter alia, actions to promote
      competitiveness, employment and value added generation, and to strengthen institutional
      capacity to implement private sector development policies.
   d) As a result of the carrying out of the studies mentioned above, implementation, on a pilot
      basis, of selected policy recommendations to promote competitiveness and employment
      generation.

20.     Part 6: Institutional Capacity Building for Provincial Infrastructure Service Provision
and Oversight (US$8.52 million, of which US$8.22 million IBRD). Carrying out of the following
Project activities below constitute an expansion of the scope of the activities carried out or to be
carried out under the APL 1:
    a) Carrying out of technical audits and certification of Subprojects.
    b) Provision of technical support to: (i) DPV, DIPAC and DIPSOH to assist MI in supervising
        and monitoring Subprojects (including the annual road routine maintenance programs referred
        to in Part 1 (f) of the Project), and in the planning and design of future infrastructure
        investments; and (ii) DPV in the design and implementation of policies for the control of axle
        loads.
    c) Implementation of selected actions identified in the action plan resulting from the carrying out
        of DPV’s institutional diagnosis under the APL 1, which actions will assist the DPV to: (i)
        monitor road network conditions; (ii) make an efficient use of resources; (iii) strengthen its
        environmental capacity; and (iv) adopt results-oriented management techniques.
    d) Provision of technical support to the Borrower, through the ME, to continue the
        implementation of a program to strengthen the capacity of the agencies whose mandate is to
        regulate and control the provision of public services.
    e) Strengthening of the integrated financial management system to continue supporting the
        development and implementation of said system.

Revised Components
21.     Increasing construction costs, delayed procurement processes, as well as efforts to
synchronize the implementation of the APL2 with the APL1 to maximize impact, resulted in the
revisions of the components outlined in Table 1. The revisions (beyond the number of road works and
WSS works) were part of the Project’s first Board-approved restructuring, which included changes to
the PDO-level indicators. The Project’s three restructurings are described in more detail in the
Implementation Section.

Table 1. Restructured Elements
Component        Restructured Elements
Component 1      Number of road works reduced due to increased Project costs.
Component 2      Number of WSS works reduced due to increased Project costs.
Component 3
Component 4      The traffic congestion solution study associated with the increase in port
                 activities was canceled since the development of a port master plan within the
                 framework of the APL1 made the study redundant.
Component 5      The pilot implementation of policy recommendations from the competitiveness
                 and employment studies was canceled because the final results of the studies
                 were not available in time to be implemented under this Project.

                                                                                                     6
Component 6              The following activities were removed: (i) the requirement for technical audits
                         given that the implementation capacity of the involved agencies improved
                         substantially; (ii) the implementation of an action plan generated from the
                         institutional diagnostic of the DPV since the entity began regularly monitoring
                         road network conditions, allocating adequate resources to road maintenance, and
                         utilizing results oriented management techniques through performance-based
                         rehabilitation contracts; and (iii) the strengthening of the financial management
                         system since, in carrying out this activity, the Borrower did not require new
                         technologies or external consultants.


Section 2: Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.     Soundness of background analysis. As this was the second phase of the APL, the Project
relied on the thorough background analysis done for preparation of the APL Program. Like the APL1,
the Project directly supported the GoPBA’s key infrastructure investment priorities, ensuring a high
level of client ownership. In addition to supporting the high level goals of the GoPBA, the APL2 was
directly linked to the World Bank’s 2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Report Number AR -
34015, which emphasized reducing the extent and severity of poverty in Argentina through sustained
economic growth, social inclusion, and improved governance. The CAS pinpoints infrastructure
investments as one of the key building blocks for sustained economic growth.

23.      The Project also incorporated lessons learned from the APL1 on the design of eligibility
criteria for works, safeguard frameworks and fiduciary management tools among others. The Bank’s
rationale for supporting this Project was clear given the PBA’s demonstrated commitment to the APL
Program, the PBA’s fulfillment of the APL1’s triggers,20 and the PBA’s continued need to close the
growing gap in access to basic services.

24.     Assessment of the Project’s design. On the whole, the Project design responded to the
PBA’s priorities. The design also directly supported the Bank’s 2006 CAS, which emphasized social
inclusion and infrastructure investments. The decision to design the Program as an APL as opposed
to a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) permitted a longer-term outlook and flexibility in the
implementation schedule. This was strategic from a design perspective given that the uncertain fiscal
situation and the cross sector nature of the Project implied a higher probability of implementation
delays in some or all of the components.21 In addition, the longer-term outlook of the APL permitted
the inclusion of meaningful institutional strengthening activities, which oftentimes require an
extended time period for consolidation.



20
   The PBA met all but one of the triggers required for the launch of the APL2. By the time of the APL 2 design, the GoA had put in place a new legal
framework that significantly contributed to the improvement of the fiscal situation of the PBA, making the fiscal trigger irrelevant.
21
  Specifically, the APL design enabled adjustments to the implementation pace according to the evolution of the fiscal framework as well as flexibility
in cases where subprojects depended on investments to be executed, operated and maintained by other agents, without restraining progress in other
components. For example, at the time of design of the APL1, the WSS sector was undergoing significant changes (private concessions were being
transferred to public utilities), and it was unclear whether all the WSS works could be completed within the timeframe of the APL1. The APL provided
the flexibility to shift these works to the APL2.


                                                                                                                                                        7
25.      The APL Program’s overall purpose, to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the
Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility, captured the core objective of the Program and
the two APL Projects. The APL2 PDO “to improve the social and environmental welfare” of PBA
residents was vague, but the APL2 PDO’s sub-objectives (improved provision of transport, WSS, and
drainage services) directly reflect the outcomes of the Project’s key activities. The first three Project
components focused exclusively on roads (Component 1), WSS (Component 2), and drainage
(Component 3). While components four, five and six focused on supporting strategic infrastructure
development within a frame of fiscal responsibility. The activities under components four, five and
six reflected the needs of the PBA at the time of appraisal, but the large number and wide scope of
the activities limited cohesive impact and increased the complexity of Project implementation. The
institutional strengthening activities, however, were of secondary importance to the Project’s
achievement of the PDO. Grouping the disbursement categories for components four, five and six
together also minimized the potential complication associated with having six components.

26.     At a first glance, the implementation arrangements appear complex. The Unit for
Coordination with Multilateral Credit Organizations of the Ministry of the Economy (UCO) was
responsible for overall coordination. The Provincial Roads Agency (DPV), the Provincial Directorate
for Water Supply and Sanitation (DIPAC) and the Provincial Directorate for Hydraulics and
Sanitation (DIPSOH), under the Ministry of Infrastructure (MI), were in charge of supervising,
contracting and implementing roads, WSS and drainage works respectively. The MI created a unit,
the UCPO, to coordinate these three agencies and to maintain communication with the UCO (which
became the Sub-Secretariat for Coordination of International Credit from Countries and
Organizations (SCEOCI) at a later stage in the Project).

27.      Despite the apparent complexity, at the time of design the APL1 was utilizing the same
implementation arrangements successfully. From a design perspective, adopting the same
arrangements was crucial given the parallel implementation and integrated nature of the two APL
Projects. The SCEOCI team viewed the APL1 and APL2 Projects as one Program. The arrangements
were also logical given the cross-sector reach of the Program and they set the tone for a fruitful
collaboration between the ME and the MI. In addition, the designation of the ME as the lead
implementing agency facilitated synchronized implementation of the Project’s infrastructure and
institutional capacity building activities (actually, it helped to maintain a focus on institutional
strengthening components complementary to the works throughout implementation), minimized
counterpart financing problems and limited conflicts between state government dependencies and
agencies. In addition, the decision to implement the Program within one Province diminished the risk
of complications due to political discord between the entities.

28.     The PBA had a high capacity to implement the APL2. As noted above, the PBA was
successfully implementing the APL1, which followed a very similar structure and financed activities
of a similar nature. Although the Project was infrastructure based, the design also included innovative
aspects, including performance-based road rehabilitation and maintenance contracts (CREMA).

29.     Fiduciary and safeguards aspects. Financial Management (FM) arrangements were
appropriate. The Borrower had adequate FM systems, software, and trained staff. A thorough FM
assessment was conducted for the APL1 Project and a less-detailed FM assessment was carried out
for the APL2 to ensure the adequacy of the arrangements already in place. The Borrower also had
adequate procurement arrangements at the time of Project design, but still several procurement
strengthening measures were agreed at appraisal in order to mitigate potential procurement risks (see
par. 32).


                                                                                                       8
30.     The APL2 ranked as a “Category B” Project. The APL2 adopted the safeguards framework
developed for the APL Program given the effectiveness of the framework (a specific assessment of
APL1 compliance with safeguards was performed). Individual environmental assessments of
subprojects for the first year were prepared following the guidelines established under the APL1. The
safeguard policies triggered for the Project (OP 4.01, Environmental Assessment, OP 4.11, Physical
Cultural Resources, and OP 7.50, Projects on International Waterways) were appropriate given the
Project’s original design.

31.     Adequacy of Government’s commitment. The Project directly supported the PBA’s
infrastructure program, generating a high level of Project commitment and ownership. The PBA
requested that the Bank increases the size of this Project (from US$150 million to US$270 million) to
accelerate the achievement of the overall Program objectives and expand the provision of basic
services to a greater number of the poor. The PBA also requested an accelerated preparation schedule
for the Project given its importance for the PBA’s development. The PBA prepared numerous
bidding documents prior to the launch of the Project. In addition, the PBA’s active and satisfactory
implementation of the APL1 illustrated a strong level of commitment and set the basis for sound
preparation and implementation of the APL2.

32.      Assessment of risks. The Project design anticipated all of the major risks. The risks identified
for this Project were based largely on the risks identified in and experienced during the APL1 Project.
The Bank team identified Moderate institutional risks regarding FM (auditing, reporting, and the use
of Project resources) and procurement (still limited experience and capacity in Bank Procurement by
sub-implementing agencies and risk of escalation of prices in procurement processes, among others)
and developed detailed institutional strengthening measures to mitigate these risks. The Substantial
fiscal risks and Moderate road sector risks due to possible market distortions were closely tied to
external, macroeconomic factors, and the proposed mitigation measures, which called for close
monitoring and high levels of adaptability, were adequate given the scope of the Project.

Implementation

33.     Progress towards the PDO was Satisfactory from effectiveness to the December 31, 2013
closing date. The Loan was fully disbursed and all contracted infrastructure works were finalized by
the closing date. The Project benefited from the PBA’s experience with Bank processes through the
ongoing APL1 as well as an established relationship with the Bank team. The Project also benefited
from the PBA’s pro-active preparation of the bidding documents, as a result of which during the first
eight months of Project implementation approximately 50% of the loan had been committed and
some US$15 million disbursed. The Project’s biggest internal challenges were administrative in
nature.22 The Project experienced a 14-month lag in effectiveness because of a delay in the signing of
the Guarantee Agreement. The Project also encountered various difficulties outside its control during
implementation, including rocketing construction prices and historic floods. The Bank and the PBA
adapted the Project to the changing circumstances through three restructurings that maintained focus
on the Project’s core objectives and enabled effective implementation.

34.    The March 2011 Mid-Term Review (MTR) revealed the need for adjustments in the scope,
timeframe, and safeguards of the Project. A sharp rise in crude oil prices (see Table 2) caused
construction prices to rise, limiting the Project’s financial wherewithal to carry out all planned

22
  Administrative delays were caused by inter alia: (i) lengthy and cumbersome internal administrative processing to get authorization to launch bidding
processes, to have contracts signed, and to carry out any amendment, and (ii) procurement difficulties related to the Argentinian market.


                                                                                                                                                      9
activities. The Bank and PBA approached this limitation with a solutions-focused mindset. For
example, funds were transferred from the DPV’s institutional capacity building activities to WSS
works given that the DPV’s improved monitoring, operational and maintenance capacity made some
activities, such as an institutional action plan, unnecessary. Additionally, the MTR provided a
platform to discuss the measurable impacts of the Project’s components, yielding adjustments in
certain indicators. The drainage PDO-level indicator, for example, was dropped to reflect the
difficulty of measuring flood capacity until the micro- and macro-drainage were operating together,
which would lag until September 2013. The drainage impacts were still measured by the ‘drained
area’ as works were implemented, and in fact the drainage system functioned remarkably well during
the heavy rains of January 2014. The number of beneficiaries from the drainage component was
unaffected. The WSS PDO-level indicators (initially measured by reduction in waterborne disease)
were also changed to reflect more measurable and pragmatic Project impacts, such as number of
beneficiaries with improved WSS services. The Project’s closing date was also extended by 18
months, from February 15, 2012 to August 15, 2013, to allow for completion of activities given slow
procurement processes (discussed in the Procurement Section below) and other administrative delays.
The MTR also revealed the need to retroactively trigger the involuntary resettlement safeguard
(discussed in more detail in the Safeguards Section below).

35.     The choice of an APL as opposed to a SIL proved to be key to facilitate successful
implementation. Construction costs continued to rise during implementation (roads works increased
in cost by approximately a factor of two), leaving the Project with a US$16.3 million deficit to fund
the completion of ongoing roads and WSS works in October 2012. Rather than reduce the Program’s
scope and drop ongoing works because of inadequate funding, the parallel nature of the APL Projects
permitted the Bank team and the PBA to restructure the APL2, transferring the remaining US$16.3
million in works (one roads work and four WSS works) to the APL1/AF, which had an uncommitted
balance. The Project’s third restructuring in August 2013 was a straightforward four month extension
of the closing date (that brought cumulative extension to 22.5 months) to accommodate potential
contingencies in the closure of the Finochietto drainage work and to permit the completion of

                                                                                                  10
institutional strengthening activities. The restructuring also included adjustment in the allocation of
loan proceeds to better accommodate the use of the remaining resources.

36.     Safeguards. As mentioned above, the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard policy was
triggered after the March 2011 MTR. According to preliminary sub-project designs, involuntary
resettlement was not foreseen at the time of appraisal. However, a case of involuntary resettlement
arose during the implementation of a road rehabilitation work due to a technical modification. This
was, however, an isolated case. The PBA handled it satisfactorily and in compliance with OP 4.12 by
applying the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) developed during the preparation of the APL1’s
AF.24 The MTR, however, did show that social and environmental procedures and capacities of the
PBA needed to be improved in order to reach the Bank’s socio-environmental requirements in
projects planning, implementation and supervision. As a result of this analysis, the SCEOCI and the
UCPO of the MI appointed specialized staff to oversee and ensure that social-environmental
procedures were being implemented. In addition, the PBA consolidated the capacity of the sub-
executing agencies through the implementation of several training workshops, including a Socio-
Environmental Management Strengthening Program for socio-environmental personnel, project
engineers and technical work supervisors. The PBA adopted a systematic monitoring model and
began publishing inspection reports on the SCEOCI webpage regularly.

37.     Procurement. The Project experienced slow procurement processes, especially for technical
assistance activities. The Province has quite lengthy administrative processes, which impacted the
duration of procurement processes. In addition, Argentina has several restrictions to purchase goods
produced abroad and to contract and pay international companies. Most of the institutional activities
were related to IT purchases, sophisticated roads equipment and international consulting firms. These
made the contracting even lengthier. The most significant procurement challenge the Project faced
was a mis-procurement of a US$5.9 million bid to a roads work contract in 2009 and the subsequent
cancellation of funds. The PBA rejected all bids for the works contract based on an assessment that
the bid prices were too high and to send a push back signal to the construction industry against
inflated prices. The Bank objected to the rejection. This was an isolated case and did not reflect the
PBA’s procurement capacity. The Bank and the PBA worked closely to overcome these procurement
issues and managed to overcome hurdles without significantly impacting implementation or
achievement of the PDO.

38.     Financial Management. The Project complied reasonably well throughout its life with the
prescribed FM arrangements and Bank requirements, providing acceptable periodic interim financial
reports and up-to-date accounting records. The reports provided reasonable assurance that the Loan
funds were used for the intended purpose. Project transactions were mainstreamed in the general
budget of the PBA and subject to the PBA’s internal controls. Project transactions were also subject
to the external oversight of the Province Court of Accounts, whose audit reports submitted to the
Bank consistently showed unqualified audit opinions on the Project’s basic financial statements,
statement of expenses and the designated account. The Bank’s financial specialists reviewed the audit
reports throughout implementation and found them acceptable.

39.     Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase. The AF of the APL 1 is still ongoing. The
infrastructure works financed under the AF will help consolidate the advances made under the APL1
and APL2. The coordinating agencies and the sub-executing agencies involved in implementing this


24
     See Annex II for more detail.


                                                                                                    11
Project will also remain in place after the Project’s closure.25 In addition, the APL Program supported
the development of a number of tools to assist the sub-executing agencies monitor the sustainability
of the works. For instance, the APL2 supported the acquisition of ten vehicles and mobile axle-
weight measuring devices to monitor the axle-loads on the network. One of the main anticipated risks
is adequate budget allocation for operation and maintenance activities and continued much-needed
infrastructure investment.26 The PBA expressed its desire to build on the satisfactory experience and
progress made under the APL Program through future investment projects.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

40.     M&E Design. Two of the original PDO indicators’ scope went beyond the reach of the
Project. The original PDO-level indicator related to WSS services measured increased access to the
services through a reduction in waterborne diseases. The reduction of waterborne diseases is
correlated with improved WSS services but also considers aspects, such as hygiene, that the Project
did not include. The WSS PDO indicator was restructured and the resulting set of WSS outcome
indicators were straightforward and directly reflected the desired outcome of the Project’s
investments (that water lines and sewerage service lines are built and people connect to them). The
PDO-level indicator related to the drainage works that measured improved flood management
capacity through flood persistence times anticipated that the drainage works would be completed at
an early stage of the Project. This was an optimistic assumption given the complicated engineering
required to construct the drainage works and the funding required from outside sources to build the
micro-systems. This indicator was dropped, but an intermediate indicator reflecting the impact of the
drainage work was maintained. The PDO-level indicator for roads (decreased IRI) was very
straightforward and directly measured the impact of rehabilitating the roads.27

41.      The ten intermediate indicators (and six core indicators that were added during the first and
second restructurings) were also very straightforward and provided a means to clearly measure the
Project’s key outputs. The results framework was designed and restructured in parallel to the APL1’s
result framework, enabling easy comparison and compilation of overall Program results.

42.      M&E Implementation. The M&E framework was implemented successfully throughout the
life of the Project. The PBA (through the SCEOCI, in coordination with the UCPO) collected data on
the indicators and informed the Bank of progress through semester progress reports and during
missions. The indicator on active sewerage connections proved difficult to accurately measure given
the PBA’s limited experience projecting active sewerage rates and the WSS operator’s limited on -
the-ground monitoring capacity to track active connections. In general, however, the straightforward
nature of the indicators facilitated calculation and collection of data. The Bank missions also involved
many field visits, which served to confirm the general reach of the activities and their respective
indicators.

43.     M&E Utilization. The Project supported three initiatives to further the use of M&E
indicators in the investment analysis process. First, the APL supported an initiative within the

25
  The PBA is using the same implementation structure to carry out projects with the BID and the CAF. The SCEOCI and UCPO were institutionalized
during the life of this project.
26
  For instance, a lack of investment would reverse the steady-state condition of the roads network that the APL helped achieved. The maintenance
backlog would reach over an unacceptable level of more than 20 percent over the next five years with the proportion of roads in bad condition
approaching or exceeding 10 percent.

     Vehicle operating costs decrease with decreased IRIs while travel time improves.


                                                                                                                                                   12
statistics unit to collect more frequent and detailed household surveys. Second, the Project supported
the development of a pilot budget management tool that tracks not only financial data on agencies’
annual expenditures but also concrete data on the agencies’ achievement of annual indicators and
goals. The PBA plans to use this M&E-styled budget to inform investment decisions. Third, the APL
Program supported the design and implementation of a provincial public investment system (SPIP) to
facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of investment projects and inform the assignation of future
investment funds.


Section 3: Assessment of Outcomes

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

44.     The basic premise of the Program and the APL2 Project (providing access to basic services,
improving the provision of transport, and improving urban drainage) remains very relevant in the
PBA. The PBA hopes to develop other projects that would follow the model and build upon the
achievements of the APL Program. The APL2 is also still very relevant from the Bank’s perspective.
It is closely aligned with the objectives of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) discussed by the Executive Directors on June 9, 2009 (Report No. 48476-AR), which focuses
on three pillars: (i) sustained growth with equity; (ii) social inclusion; and (iii) improved governance.
The CPS also envisions infrastructure assets as one of the building blocks for sustained economic
growth. The APL Program was a precursor of the Bank’s twin goals to alleviate poverty and promote
shared prosperity. The ultimate objective of the APL Program was “to support the return to a
sustainable path of economic growth, to end extreme poverty and to increase social equity”28 through
infrastructure.

Efficacy
Rating: Substantial

45.     The Project fully achieved its key objective. By the time of the APL 2 design, the GoA had
put in place a new legal framework (the National Fiscal Responsibility law) that significantly
contributed to the improvement of the fiscal situation of the PBA. In addition, the PBA undertook a
series of structural reforms to ensure the quality of fiscal management. In 2007, the GoPBA enacted
the Financial Administration Act, created the National Revenue Agency of the PBA and implemented
tax reforms. The PBA successfully reduced its debt in terms of Gross National Product, going from
24.6 percent in 2002 to 8.5 percent at the Project’s close. The PBA paid close attention to the
prioritization of works based on social and structural needs (See the Overarching Themes, Other
Impacts and Outcomes Section), did not over-expend on works and did not exceed their financial
capacity.

46.     The APL2 PAD estimated that the project was going to benefit about five million people. This
estimate was achieved by the Project: the improved road network benefits 780,000 people directly on
an annual basis and additional 1.7 million people indirectly29 (benefiting around five million during
the lifespan of the Project), 330,000 directly benefited from the WSS works, and 345,000 directly

  The DPV calculated 1.7 million beneficiaries that live in the areas nearby the improved roads. The 780,000 direct beneficiaries are people who use
the improved roads network regularly, though these people may be the same from one year to the next.


                                                                                                                                                   13
benefited from the drainage works.30 In addition, the positive externalities created by the Project
investments (increased economic activity and land value) as well as the increased institutional
capacity to operate, maintain and implement further works have and will continue to benefit countless
residents of the PBA.

Roads
47.     The Project improved the road network through financing the rehabilitation of 251.3 km of
roads, the widening of 35.20 km of roads and the enhancement of two intersections. The Project had
a network-focused approach in order to maximize the impact of the works. The Project achieved its
output indicators as well as its outcome indicator, keeping the average roughness (measured through
the International Roughness Index -IRI) of High Traffic31 roads below 3.7 and the average IRI of the
network below 3.3. Project design targeted High-Traffic roads and assumed roughness of said roads
would decrease (from 3.5 to less than 3). During implementation traffic increased significantly and
the number of roads that fell under the HT category increased, however given budget limitations, the
number of roads intervened by the Project did not increase accordingly. Therefore, the average
roughness for the roads classified as HT increased and target was restructured. Without the Program,
the overall roughness of the network (AVG IRI) would have reached 5.7 (projection from the -
HDM).

48.     In addition, the Project introduced the implementation of CREMA contracts, which are being
used by the DPV for investments outside the scope of the Project. The Project met all of its roads-
related indicators. Investments on the road network over the last couple of years have helped the PBA
reach a steady-state condition with a maintenance backlog (roads with IRI>4) of less than 15 percent
and a proportion of roads in poor condition (with IRI>5) of less than 5 percent. As a result, vehicle
operating costs for the provincial vehicle fleets using the network have been reduced by nearly 15
percent.

49.      The Project also played a significant role in strengthening the road asset management capacity
of the DPV. For instance, the Project supported activities to: (i) consolidate the use of the HDM as a
planning tool to design efficient and prioritized multi-year rehabilitation programs; (ii) operationalize
a comprehensive Routine Maintenance Management System developed under the APL1 by hiring
consultants to collect data on the network in order to feed the system and installing software in all the
regional districts to elaborate a more rational and efficient annual program of routine maintenance
activities over the entire provincial road network; and (iii) improve the DPV’s capacity to monitor
axle-loads in the network,32 to carry out network and traffic surveys and to carry out environmental
and social assessments of projects.

50.      The budget allocated to the DPV has been in constant evolution since the 2002 economic
crisis, going from US$100 million per year to about US$200 million per year in 2012. The PBA has
still not reached pre-crisis (1995-2000) levels of US$300 to US$350 million per year, but has
assigned between 10 and 25 percent of its total budget to the routine maintenance of the provincial
road network over the past five years. That effort has translated into improved primary paved road
network conditions. Table 3 includes detailed information on the condition of the non-concessioned
paved network throughout the APL1 and APL2.

     These numbers are lower than the estimated number of beneficiaries during appraisal because of cost increases.

   Average traffic exceeds 4,000 vehicles per day.

   According to information provided by DPV, the axle-load control helped reduce the proportion of overloading/infractors from ten to four percent in its
first year of implementation.

Water Supply and Sanitation
51.     The Project improved the provision of WSS services through financing the construction of
9,045 water supply service lines and 82,508 sewerage service lines in poor areas (works targeted the
poor through applying the IPMH index). These new lines provided water connections to 34,698
people, made available sewerage connections to 298,368 people and active sewerage connections to
112,200 people. The Project achieved all outcome and output indicators with the exception of active
sewerage connections, which was missed by approximately 16 percent. The target for this indicator
was estimated based on a formula developed by DIPAC and the Aguas Bonaerenses Sociedad
Anónima (ABSA) that attempted to capture the lag that is always present between available access
and actual connection to the network.33 Although the target has not been met according to the formula
at this time, information provided by the WSS service providers indicates that the percentage of
beneficiary households connected to sewer lines will increase to 80 percent and that the Project will
achieve the target by 2017.

52.     The WSS component of the APL2 was especially important given the volatility of WSS
service provision in the national context as well as the low capacity of the utilities involved in the
Project to invest in extending WSS, especially sanitation, services. Key members of DIPAC’s staff
commented that without the Project, the utilities would not have had the financial capacity to invest
in sanitation. The APL Program also played a fundamental role in developing the capacity of the
PBA to manage WSS works. During the APL1, the MI established a unit for provincial water and
sanitation (UPAS). During the implementation of the APL Program, the UPAS (which had eight staff
members) became a separate directorate, the DIPAC, with 40 staff members and a budget of
AR$300,000,000. The DIPAC was consolidated because of the APL Program and became ingrained
in the MI. When established, the DIPAC only managed WSS works with external financing. By the
close of the APL2, the DIPAC was managing more works financed by local sources than external
sources.

33
  Given the importance of having the population effectively connected to a network, the Bank and the PBA agreed at restructuring to add this more
refined indicator. Nevertheless, given Argentina’s lack of experience in estimating and monitoring this indicator this data should be considered with
room for error.


                                                                                                                                                        15
Drainage
53.     The Project improved the provision of drainage services through financing the macro-system
for the Finochietto Drainage System (the micro systems were financed with local funds). The system
covered 1,200 ha of drainage, achieving its respective output indicator. The communities covered by
the system have already seen home values increase as much as five times.34 In addition, in February
2014 the PBA experienced heavy rains and the area surrounding the system, which was highly prone
to flooding, did not flood. During Project implementation, the population living around the drainage
system increased, necessitating the construction of a safety railing in the final part of the drainage
system. The PBA is currently in the process of constructing this railing with its own funds.

54.     The APL Program also played a key role in increasing the capacity of DIPSOH. At the start of
the APL1, drainage works could not be carried out because DIPSOH did not have an established
method for designing works that considered the basin as a whole. As a result, during the APL1,
DIPSOH developed the Manual for the Master Plan Designs to Improve Infrastructure and
Management for Urban Drainage, which was formally approved by the GoPBA (Decree 2,647,
October 10, 2006). The Manual outlines a holistic method for assessing the technical viability of
urban drainage works that includes an analysis of: (i) hydraulic and hydrologic design; (ii) the
structural and non-structural measures to be undertaken; (iii) compliance with environmental
measures; and (iv) the importance of the works as part of a major drainage plan. During the APL2,
DIPSOH fully adopted the Manual and began applying the approach to drainage projects in the PBA
regardless of the source of financing. The success of the Manual spurred the development of further
measures to strengthen the non-structural aspects of drainage. For instance, the GoPBA passed
decrees to strengthen integrated coastal planning and to establish a hydraulic plan at the provincial
level during the APL2 (See Annex 2 for more information on the decrees).

Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

55.   The overall Efficiency rating of the APL2 is Substantial. The ex-post economic analysis
showed that both the roads and drainage components performed better than expected at appraisal.
Although the WSS component did not achieve the projected Internal Economic Rate of Return
(EIRR), it was still economically efficient.35

At the time of appraisal of the APL2, the DPV carried out an economic evaluation taking into
account a sample of roads that were proposed to be financed under the APL2 (the bulk of which
corresponded to rehabilitation works of interurban roads), that demonstrated high economic rates of
return, with an average EIRR of 50.9 percent and a Net Present Value of US$59.4 million. In 2014,
the DPV updated the evaluation with a representative sample of the works, the real costs of the works
and updated traffic volumes. That evaluation showed that despite the increase in cost that occurred
for the works the economic returns remained high; the average EIRR was 110 percent and Net
Present Value was US$310,000/km at closing. These higher rates of return are explained by different
factors including: (i) higher traffic volumes; (ii) higher user costs as a result of which higher benefits
related to savings in operating costs are accrued; (iii) the differences in the road samples used during
appraisal and completion and particularly the fact that the bulk of the roads used in the appraisal

samples included lower volume roads which were later substituted by widening works in roads
segments within the conurbano with much higher traffic volumes.

56.    For WSS, the ICR analysis utilized the same methodology as at appraisal: a cost benefit
analysis with an avoided cost approach to measure the benefits. Benefits were measured as the
resources saved from going from septic tanks (with corresponding cleaning costs) to conventional
sewerage connections. For drainage works, benefits were measured as the averted financial loss from
reduced or eliminated flooding risk.

57.       Results of the evaluation show that the Project had important benefits for the PBA. In
drainage, net benefits reached US$25M, and the works generated returns of 25 percent (higher than
expected). In WSS, the works yielded net benefits (NPV) of US$42M and returns of 17 percent
(similar to expected). See Annex 3 for more detail on the economic analysis.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The ICR rates the overall outcome of the Project as Satisfactory based on “High” ratings for
relevance, and its “Substantial” rating for efficacy and efficiency.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
58.     The WSS works were implemented in areas where average IMPH was 40 percent or higher,
ensuring that the poorest segments of the PBA’s population benefited from the Project. The
strengthening of the multiple agencies involved in Project execution will assist in the effective future
expansion and rehabilitation of roads, WSS and drainage works, promoting economic and social
development as well as poverty reduction.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59.     Before the launch of the APL Program, the PBA had a small project implementation unit with
capacity to implement development policy loans, but limited knowledge on the general processes
required for implementing international organizations’ structural investment loans as well as a limited
capacity to coordinate provincial agencies. As a result of the APL Program, a new unit was
consolidated to implement the Program. The unit gained experience in contract negotiations, financial
management, procurement processes and safeguard supervision among other areas. Given this
increased implementation capacity, the PBA began soliciting and executing loans from other
international organizations. The UCO went from unit status to agency status, and finally, to being a
sub-secretariat. The SCEOCI team was recognized at a national level for being one of the best-
organized teams in the country; representatives from a number of other provinces visited the SCEOCI
                                                                                                     17
in order to gain insight on how to strengthen their own teams. The APL Program also contributed to
the consolidation of the DPV, DIPAC and DIPSOH. For instance, as mentioned in the Efficacy
Section, the DIPAC went from being a unit with eight employees to a directorate with 40 employees
and a budget for investments of AR$300,000,000.

60.     The APL Program also supported the development of tools to help the PBA prioritize
investments based on social and structural need. The DPV utilized the HDM 4 model to prioritize
road segments in need of repair. The DIPAC utilized the IPMH model, based on an index of
hereditary deprivation36 and current resource deprivation, to target investments towards communities
with high levels of poverty.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
61.     An unexpected impact has been the strengthening of the PBA’s environmental and social
supervision capacity. During the APL1, all environmental and social requirements were met, but the
PBA did not have the tools to move environmental and social management beyond compliance. The
environmental and social specialists worked closely with the PBA to develop monitoring tools to
streamline the supervision process. The APL2 also supported workshops not only for social and
environmental specialists, but also for works inspectors and contractors. This hand-in-hand work
improved safeguard supervision for the Project and resulted in an institutional shift in the PBA. The
PBA recognized the need for systematically monitoring social and environmental safeguards and is
utilizing the developed tools for monitoring all projects whether Bank financed or not.


Section 4: Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

62.      The risk to the development outcome is Moderate. In general, the institutional strengthening
activities have improved the capacity of the executing institutions to strategically plan and monitor
investments. For instance, the DPV recently carried out a network-level economic evaluation with the
HDM-4 model, showing that it has an adequate tool for designing multi-year rehabilitation programs,
and has a new system for the management of routine maintenance. In addition, the budget allocated
to the DPV has been in constant evolution since the 2002 economic crisis, going from US$100
million per year to about US$200 million per year in 2012; and the PBA has assigned between 10 and
25 percent of its total budget to the routine maintenance of the provincial road network over the past
five years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of the improvements in the roads network depends heavily
on the ability of the GoPBA to finance the DPV’s list of priority investments . The APL Program has
played a key role in developing the PBA’s capacity to attract external sources of credit. Since the
launch of the APL, the SCEOCI and UCPO have been involved in the design and implementation of
six internationally financed projects, totaling over US$400 million in credit for different sectors.

63.     A financial analysis of the two largest WSS operators in the PBA, ABSA and the Obras
Sanitarias Mar del Plata-Batán (OSSE), shows that there is high probability that the WSS works will
be sustainable. During implementation, both operators improved their financial results. ABSA and
OSSE have a sound capital structure with liabilities lower than 20 percent of their assets, and equities
higher than 80 percent. OSSE has tariffs that fully cover its operating cost and partially cover
investment. ABSA has not achieved tariffs that fully cover operating costs, yet it has improved its

Country). Despite the internal financial shortcoming of ABSA, the GoPBA has demonstrated a high
level of commitment to supporting this operator by regularly covering its deficits (following the
overall policy in the sector in Argentina).


Section 5: Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     During the three-month preparation period, the Bank team performed a comprehensive
analysis of the APL1, integrated lessons learned into the APL2 and updated objectives and activities
to align the Project closely with the PBA’s strategic vision and infrastructure plan. Project
preparation was streamlined by drawing from the existing institutional arrangements of the APL1.
For example, the implementing agencies (ME and MI) incorporated these new activities into their
work program according to their experience with the APL1. Implementation manuals and
procurement processes followed the same guidelines as the APL1, which significantly facilitated
discussions with the PBA. The similarity between the two Projects also facilitated early
implementation processes. During the first eight months of Project implementation (loan became
effective on August 2008), US$15 million was disbursed and approximately US$188 million was
committed. Actual and committed expenditures represented approximately 50% of the loan (May
2009 ISR).

65.     The Bank team maintained enriching policy discussions with DPV authorities to increase the
cost-efficiency of the use of the scarce budgetary allocations for the preservation of the road network
to ensure that the standards and technical solutions used for upgrading, paving and rehabilitation
corresponded to optimum economic alternatives that yielded the maximum value to the community.37
This dialogue, initiated during the APL1, led to an agreement in the APL2 to: (i) optimize the
technical standards of road works through the adoption of individual interventions that were both cost
efficient and technically reasonable; and (ii) the introduction of the CREMA. In addition, during the
implementation of the APL1, the Bank team created an updated data bank for the cost of road works
based on official estimates and bidders’ estimates. The data bank played a key role in the preparation
of more realistic official budget estimates for works under the APL2. The Project’s design-related
shortcomings were minor. Namely, the PDO was vague, and the WSS PDO-level outcome indicator
went beyond the scope of the Project.

Bank Performance in Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

66.    The Bank team played a very active role in supervision, processing three timely restructurings
and adapting the Project to steady increases in construction costs. When construction costs exceeded
Loan and counterpart funds, the Bank team smoothly transferred works to the APL1 and its AF. The
Bank team also synchronized indicators for the APL2 and the APL1 enabling easy calculations for
the overall impact of the APL Program. This proactive behavior helped smoothen implementation
and indicated good communication with the PBA. In addition, the environmental and social

specialists, who were based in Argentina, played an especially active role in developing the capacity
of the PBA to systematically monitor safeguards, environmental and social impacts. The PBA
highlighted the positive working relationship with the TTLs. According to the ISRs, the PDO rating
has been Satisfactory since effectiveness. The PBA, however, expressed frustration over the Bank’s
inability to move funds for emergency relief in April 2013 after the heaviest rainfalls in more than a
century, but noted that this was beyond the reach of the Bank task team to resolve. The PBA also
noted that procurement support varied from specialist to specialist and that the Project would have
benefited from more hands-on support and clearer communication in this field.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

67.     Given the Bank’s Moderately Satisfactory preparation and Satisfactory supervision of the
Project, the ICR team rates the Bank’s overall performance as Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

Government of the Province of Buenos Aires Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

68.    Throughout Project implementation, the GoPBA’s performance was exemplary. The presence
of the Ministers of Economy and Infrastructure during several Bank’s supervision meetings was a
testimony of the high sense of commitment and ownership displayed by the Government. Also, the
GoPBA tried its utmost to overcome the financial challenges posed by inflation and increased
construction costs, enabling the Project to meet its development objectives. The GoPBA plans to
finance the few activities not completed (five sub-activities within Component 6, amounting to
approximately US$500,000) in the Project’s lifetime with its own funds. The GoPBA may also
finance the Ports and Marina study, which was canceled; this additional investment would bring the
PBA’s post-completion financing to US$1.9M. The GoPBA has also followed the environmental and
social specialists’ recommendation and set aside funds to install safety railings along the open
channel segment of the Finochietto River.

Implementing Agency (Coordinating and Executing Agencies) Performance Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

69.     The SCEOCI and sub-executing agencies were actively involved in the implementation of the
Project and were committed to ensuring the Project’s Satisfactory completion despite a difficult
operating environment (given the financial and environmental challenges). Strong coordinating teams
within the MI and ME overcame the complexity associated with having many entities involved in
project execution through close communication and investment in the development of staff members.
During Project implementation, the agencies significantly increased their environmental and social
safeguard monitoring capacity. The agencies were also actively working to streamline and
systematize procurement processes throughout implementation. The administrative delays the Project
experienced were largely due to lengthy internal processes that were outside the scope of the Project.
The PBA successfully supervised the implementation of the Project, enabling the Project to close
with full disbursement and satisfactory outcomes.




                                                                                                   20
Section 6. Lessons Learned

70.     The Adaptable Program Loan provided flexibility that was key to the Project’s successful
implementation given the unstable fiscal environment. The APL structure provides flexibility in
unstable implementation environments. The APL structure enabled the Bank to finance an expansive
program (US$470 million at the time of appraisal) in an uncertain fiscal environment with decreased
risk. The Program provided the PBA with a source of credit for approximately ten years, enabling
strategic, medium-term, pro-active planning. This was especially important for the PBA given the
absolute paucity of financing and credit lines at the time of the APL’s design. At the same time, the
inclusion of required advances to trigger the launch of the APL2 limited the risk that the Bank was
undertaking in financing such a large project in a time of high fiscal uncertainty. The similar structure
and shared goals and indicators of the APL1 and APL2 also enabled flexibility in implementation
schedules given the easy transfer of activities from one project to the other. This proved especially
important given that at the time of the APL1’s design, the WSS sector was undergoing a major
reform. The reforms took longer than planned and constrained project implementation to a greater
degree than expected; for the first two years of the APL1’s implementation, WSS activities were
stalled. Rather than cancel the WSS activities, the parallel structure of the APL Program enabled the
easy transfer of these activities to the APL2, and roads activities, which were advancing as planned,
from the APL2 to the APL1.

71.     Project implementation arrangements can strategically foster institutional strengthening.
The involvement of the ME as the leading implementing agency was a strategic decision to ensure
that focus on the institutional strengthening activities was maintained throughout implementation to
complement the works. The ME and MI leveraged their common interest in seeing this Project
through to foster collaboration, and even shared the same Minister for some time.

72.     The Project also played a key role in developing the SCEOCI. The PBA had a small project
implementation unit to implement development policy loans before the start of the APL Program. As
a result of the APL, the PBA consolidated a unit dedicated to implementing projects with credit from
international organizations that had sufficient capacity to coordinate other ministries and institutions
within the Province (such as the MI). In the ten years since the launch of the APL Program, the
SCEOCI has become integrated in the operating structure of the GoPBA, going from unit status to
agency status to becoming a sub-secretariat. The establishment of a sub-secretariat with significant
experience implementing projects with foreign credit has had a multiplier effect, facilitating the
GoPBA’s capture of international credit from other organizations. The APL Program has also played
a key role in developing the DIPAC. At the time of the design of the APL Program, the PBA was not
planning and executing WSS works. The MI established the UPAS at the beginning of the APL
program. The UPAS (now DIPAC) went from being a small unit with eight staff members developed
largely for the implementation of the APL to a separate directorate with 40 staff members and a
budget for investments of AR$300,000,000, that is thoroughly ingrained in the MI. Today, the
DIPAC plans more works with local financing than with external financing and has developed its
own strategic vision for growth.

73.     The ‘hands-off’ model for promoting connection to sewerage systems employed by WSS
Operators in the PBA proved to be effective. Most of the WSS operators in the PBA do not monitor
whether people are actually connecting to new sewerage networks. The operators have no real
incentive to do so given that residents are required to pay a tariff whether or not they have a
household connection. The residents also have no real disincentive to delay their connection to the
network, as they are paying for sewerage service and the cost of cleaning the septic tanks is relatively
high. Although residents may hesitate to connect to the system because of initial connection costs,
anecdotal data from the WSS operators and wastewater flows arriving at wastewater treatment plants
                                                                                                      21
show that within two years of construction, around 80 percent (a high connection rate in the region)
of the residents are expected to connect to the system. For Project monitoring and evaluation
purposes, however, measuring active sewerage connections is an important action that relates to the
actual impact of investments, and it requires an active supervision jointly by the infrastructure
implementing agencies and by the WSS operators.

74.     Working at the province level facilitates implementation. The APL Program benefited from
directly engaging the PBA to design and implement the Program’s activities. This design decision
helped provide a direct channel to build provincial capacity to work with international organizations,
build a close working relationship with the counterpart and tailor the Program closely to the
Provinces’ needs.


Section 7: Comments on Issues Raised By Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

1 – Cancellation of US$ 5.9 million (Section 2. Implementation paragraph 37)

75.      The Bank cancelled an amount of US$ 5.9 million from the loan when the Province rejected
the offer corresponding to Lot 2 of LPI 5/07, “Repaving section RO 17-RN 3 lot 2 of RP21,” the
justification being that said process was not carried out according to the procedures established by the
Bank’s Policies and the Loan Agreement.

76.     The Province of Buenos Aires points out that the Bank violated the right of the contracting
party to accept or reject any offer according to clause 33.1 of the Specific Bidding Document
applying to said procedure, which states: “The Contracting Party reserves the right to accept or reject
any offer, and to cancel the bidding process and reject all offers, any time before the contract has
been awarded, without incurring any responsibility towards the affected bidder(s), or being obligated
to inform the affected bidder(s) of the motives of the Contracting Party’s decision.”

2 – Cancellation of the “Study for the design of production strategies for the Province of
Buenos Aires.” (Intermediate Outcome Indicator(s) Table, Indicator 8)

77.    The Province does not condone the Bank’s decision to cancel the bidding process, then in the
technical proposal evaluation stage, due to the following reasons:

   a. The Province, in contrast to the Bank, understands that Memo N° 1 did not modify the terms
      of payment, since it only clarified that the payments would be realized in the legal currency of
      the Republic of Argentina, according to the tributary administration’s national regulation,
      which was informally agreed with the Bank. For this reason, said Memo was drafted as a
      Clarifying Note rather than a Correction as understood by the Bank.

   b. The Province took the necessary actions to promote a competitive process among consulting
      firms, attempting to foster the largest quantity and highest quality possible of proposals, and
      publicizing it through all appropriate avenues and formally inviting several firms to present
      their own experience. Hence, the Province disagrees with the Bank regarding the modification


                                                                                                     22
       of the terms of payment, which would not have discouraged the participation of foreign
       consultants and reduced the competitive nature of the process.

   c. Regarding the Bank’s declaration of invalidity of the only proposal, the Rules establish that
      the Borrower's rejection of all proposals should only be considered justified if all of them are
      irrelevant and none respond to the requirements, either because of significant shortcomings in
      complying with the terms of reference, or because their cost is considerably higher than the
      initial estimate. Thus, as none of these conditions apply to the only existing proposal, the
      Province considers that said proposal remained valid.

   d. The Bank’s suggestion to begin the process afresh was unacceptable as it was virtually
      impossible to carry out a new selection process and have the signed contract before the
      closing date of the Project.

   e. In this regard, we must point out that the tight schedule was compounded by the 4 months the
      Bank took to review the terms of reference. While the request for No Objection to the Terms
      of Reference was emitted on 27/04/12, the Bank's No Objection was only received on
      23/08/12.

3 – Funds reallocation and extension of the closing date (Section 2. Implementation paragraph
35)

78.     Given the flooding that occurred on April 2nd and 3rd, 2013, in the city of La Plata and its
surrounding area, the Province proposed a reallocation of funds to allow the acquisition of anfidraga
equipment, and an extension of the Project’s closing date by one year in order to install guardrails to
ensure the safety of residents who live on both sides of the open canal of the Finochietto River.

79.     While this issue was discussed in the Supervision Mission held in May 2013 and was
recorded in the corresponding Aide Memoire, the Bank only granted an extension period of 4 months
and a reallocation of funds to complete the planned activities of the Program.

Water and Sanitation Projects

The primary objective of the WSS component was to increase low-income households’ access to
sewerage systems by financing secondary sewer networks in the Conurbano. The APL2 aimed to
provide secondary sewer networks and the corresponding connections to about 100,000 households.

Methodology

At appraisal, a cost benefit analysis was conducted for the sanitation component. Benefits were
measured as the resources saved from substituting septic tanks, which have a recurring cleaning cost,
with conventional sewerage connections. The costs consisted of: investment, operating and
maintenance, internal connection costs, and hygiene education costs. The evaluation was carried out
for eight sub-projects to be implemented under the Project. The results showed that all sub-projects
were economically viable with returns ranging from 17% to 37%, and with an average return of 22%.

For the ICR, a cost benefit analysis that followed the same approach as the one used at appraisal was
applied. The evaluation was done for the whole Program using actual costs incurred and actual
benefits obtained with the implementation of the Project. The net benefit of the Project was estimated
as the incremental benefit from two scenarios: with and without the Project. The without Project
scenario assumed that the situation existing at time of appraisal remained; the with Project scenario
included benefits already attained with the works. As done at appraisal, the cash flows were
discounted using a 12% discount rate and a 20-year lifetime for the Project. In order to compare the
results with those reached at appraisal, the costs and benefits were adjusted to 2008 prices by taking
out exchange rate and inflation rate fluctuation.

Benefits

The benefits were measured for the whole Program. Sewerage beneficiaries were classified in two
categories: (i) those who will benefit from the secondary sewer network, but do not have household
connections yet; and (ii) those who are connected to the network. The first group was gradually
included in the evaluation as projections estimate that 80% of them will connect to the network. The
second group was included in the evaluation as they are already receiving benefits.

Table 1 shows that there are 82.5 thousand households benefiting from the service lines, but only
38% of the beneficiaries are actually connected. The number of households benefitting from
sewerage service lines was 16% less than expected at appraisal. The appraisal target was revised
during supervision, and the reduced target was fully accomplished. Active connections, however,
were expected to be 45%. The Project resulted in a 38% household connection rate. This evaluation
estimates the benefits using current active connections (30,974) plus annual increases until the active
sewerage connection rate reaches 66,000, or 80% of potential.

The septic tanks costs used for this evaluation were based on actual costs in the areas where the
Project was implemented. A cost of US$29 per month per household was used, and it corresponded
to the average from a sample of subproject implemented and evaluated during implementation.38

The benefit obtained from the savings generated by substituting the existing septic tanks with a
conventional sewerage connection was partially offset by the cost of in-house adjustments needed to
connect to the sewer lines and by the monthly bill the new sewerage customer had to pay to the
operator. Both of these costs were included in this evaluation based on the actual tariffs and costs of
in-house adjustments. The information was obtained from the operators and from records of
subprojects implemented during the APL2 and was adjusted to 2008 prices. The cost of in-house
adjustment at 2008 price was about US$238, which corresponded to US$199 when 23.5% taxes were
taken out. Sewerage bills were estimated as a percentage of the water bill and averaged
approximately US$2 per household per month.

Costs

Costs included in this evaluation consisted of actual costs of works implemented in WSS, which
corresponded to US$154 million, 5% lower than foreseen at appraisal (Table 2). The financial plan
was similar to what was predicted: IBRD’s share was 78%, while counterpart funds were 22%. At
appraisal, it was expected that the IBRD would finance 79% and the counterpart would finance 21%.

When actual costs are expressed in Argentinean Pesos, the differences are partially explained by
exchange rate fluctuation and inflation. As figure 1 shows, the exchange rate went from AR$3.08 per
USD at the time of appraisal to AR$5.54 in 2013, representing an 80% cumulative depreciation of the
Argentinean Peso against the US dollar during the period. Inflation at the same time reached 71% at
the end of the period.

To understand the impact of these fluctuations in the project costs, the actual costs of works in
nominal prices were compared against the actual costs transformed to 2008 prices. This analysis
focused only on the WB proceeds (without counterpart funds), as there was no detailed information
on the counterpart funds on a year-to-year basis.

Impact of the exchange rate fluctuation was estimated transforming the yearly USD disbursements to
local currency using the average annual exchange rate; the result was then compared with the amount
obtained using the exchange rate at appraisal. Results show a 34 percent increase on the amount
received in local currency due to the depreciation of the Argentinian peso. At appraisal the exchange
rate was AR$3.08 per USD and the average obtained during implementation period was AR$4.14 per
USD. Impact of inflation was estimated comparing the disbursement amount in nominal prices,
against the amount disbursed expressed in 2008 prices using the inflation rate from 2008 to the year
in reference. Results show an average increase of 27% in prices due to inflation.

  The data for Argentina are officially reported by INDEC. The IMF has, however, issued a declaration of censure and called on Argentina to adopt
remedial measures to address the quality of the official GDP data. In this context, the Bank is also using alternative estimates for the surveillance of data
in Argentina.

Depreciation allowed receiving more money than expected with each USD disbursement. However,
inflation did the contrary, taking out purchasing power on local currency. Results show that the 34%
gained with depreciation was partially offset by 27% inflation. The remaining 7% corresponded to
real increases in the costs of the WSS works (Table 3).

Results show that the outcome of the Project had important benefits for the Province of Buenos Aires,
as actual net benefits were 34 percent higher than costs, producing a net benefit of about US$ 42
million. The EIRR generated by the Project is 17%, similar to the one expected at appraisal.

The results are satisfactory given that actual investment costs - without inflation and exchange rate
differences - were 7 percent higher than expected at appraisal, and the actual connections were lower
than expected.

The biggest winners were the customers, who will save US$153 million during the lifetime of the
works by closing septic tanks and connecting to the sewer lines. This benefit is partially offset by the
bills the households will have to pay for the sewerage service, and the cost paid for the in-house
connections. The Government had a net loss of US$92 million, which corresponds to the difference
between the outflow of the grant to pay investment, minus the inflow that come from the taxes
received.

Drainage

At time of appraisal two criteria were adopted for drainage works: (i) for small drainage secondary
basins affecting the poorest segments of the population and whenever the rate of recurrence in the
design of the micro and macro drainage systems is below 5 years, the least cost alternative shall be
selected, independently of the net present value yielded by each alternative; (ii) for basins with
permanent or semi-permanent courses of great dimension with design recurrence rates over 2 years,
whether they are micro or macro drainage networks, the rate of return shall be at least 12%.

During implementation a cost benefit analysis was used for the works implemented in the Finochietto
basin, which corresponded to the second type of basin. The same evaluation was used for the ICR
using actual costs and benefits expressed in 2008 prices to make them comparable to the ones used at
appraisal.

The benefits of drainage works were measured in the form of losses that were averted when risk of
flooding was eliminated or reduced. Damage costs were projected for two scenarios: with and
without project. The Project’s net benefit corresponded to the difference of incremental benefits of
both scenarios. For the without project scenario it was assumed that flooding situation present at the
time of appraisal remained. For the with project scenario, the actual reduction of floods was included.

Costs. Drainage works implemented in the basin were AR$125M, which converted at economic
prices, using the same conversion factors as the ones used at appraisal, resulted in AR$91.3M.
Operation and Maintenance costs according to DIPSOH equal AR$520 thousand every two years.

Benefits or Averted damage costs were estimated based on flooding maps for both scenarios, with and
without the project, and damage cost associated with each recurrence period. A curve was built for
each scenario including damage costs versus the probability of occurrence. The area under the curve
corresponded to the expected damage cost for each scenario. The difference between the areas of
expected damage cost with and without project, corresponded to the expected averted losses, or
expected benefits of the project.

Damages were estimated for residential properties and varied according to flood intensity, water
level, and extension of flooded area. The size of flooding areas showed the magnitude of the problem,
as without the project 90% of the area was flooded for 10-year recurrence events. With the
implementation of works, no dwelling was affected for 2-year recurrence periods, and for a 10-year
period the area affected was reduced to 30 percent.

Damage costs for residential sector included damages to the infrastructure as well as to the
equipment inside the properties. The number of dwellings and the damage cost were estimated using
the cadaster database of the municipality for each category given for property tax purposes (A highest
income level, B medium, and C lower).

The results of the economic evaluation show that net benefits generated by the project were AR$77
million (USD 25M) with 25% return.

Roads

In 2007, at the time of appraisal of the APL2, a revised economic evaluation that utilized a
representative sample of works was carried out by the DPV. The evaluation showed high economic
returns, with an average EIRR of 50.9% and a Net Present Value of US$59.4 million for a total of
543 km of road intervened, i.e., about US$109,392/km (compared to an EIRR of 38 percent in 2004
at appraisal of the Program). In 2014, the DPV updated that evaluation, taking a representative
sample of the works effectively intervened and introducing the real costs of the works and updated
traffic volumes. The evaluation showed that despite the increase in costs the economic returns have
remained very high throughout project implementation, with a final average EIRR of 110 percent and
a Net Present Value of US$310.010/km at closing. These higher rates of return are explained by
different factors including: (i) higher traffic volumes; (ii) higher user costs as a result of which higher
benefits related to savings in operating costs are accrued ; (iii) the differences in the road samples
                                                                                                         36
used during appraisal and completion and particularly the fact that the bulk of the roads used in the
appraisal samples included lower volume roads which were later substituted by widening works in
roads segments within the Conurbano with much higher traffic volumes.
Another element that confirms the efficiency of the Project is that had the Project not been executed,
more than 50 percent of roads in the network would be in poor condition (with an average roughness
of 6 IRI). Currently (with the Project), five percent of the roads in the network are in poor condition
(with an average roughness of 3 IRI). The improved condition of the roads translates to lower
vehicle operating costs for the provincial vehicle fleet that uses the network; operating costs have
been reduced by nearly 15 percent.

In addition, procurement for the works was generally a success since out of 16 road subprojects, the
bid price exceed official estimates by more than 15percent (between 18 and 21 percent) in only two
cases. In terms of overall averages, bid prices were 5 percent below official estimates.

1. CONTEXT

1. The Buenos Aires Province Infrastructure Sustainable Investment Development Project (2004-
2010) was designed at the end of the severe economic crisis that ravaged the country in 2001-2002
and in particular in the Conurbano Bonaerense, and pushed the number of persons living below the
poverty line to 64 percent in 2002 (19.5 percent in 1994).

2. In a crisis context, fiscal discipline became a priority for the provincial government, which had to
cut the infrastructure, housing, and public services budget by 53 percent between 1999 and 2002.
This situation was compounded by the following infrastructure management problems:

         (i)    The virtual cessation of large-scale, strategic projects.

         (ii)   The halting of projects under way owing to insufficient funds (hospitals, court
                buildings, gas pipelines, etc.).

         (iii) Water services were provided to 65 percent of the population in the Greater Buenos
               Aires area and sewerage services, to 35 percent, with low-income income population
               groups being most affected by this situation.

         (iv) The drying up of external sources of financing, which affected both the provincial
              government and sector enterprises.

         (v)    The province’s road network, which had deteriorated significantly.

         (vi) The need for a solution to water treatment in the Cuenca Deprimida of the Salado
              River basin.

3. The province’s fiscal situation improved as a result of tax measures adopted and a small primary
surplus was achieved in 2003. Despite the more austere expenditure policy, the provision of basic
and essential services continued, mainly for the social classes hardest hit by the crisis.

4. Based on projections for 2004, a year for which encouraging signs of economic recovery were
beginning to emerge, the possibility of designing a Buenos Aires Province Infrastructure and Public
Services Management Plan was introduced, which was organized around identification of the
following five policies and ten central themes:

         (i)    Incentivizing economic development, productivity, and employment;

         (ii)   Expanding the provision and quality of public services;

         (iii) Supporting the socio-cultural development of the population;

         (iv) Increasing physical/territorial integration; and

         (v)    Strengthening institutional management and community participation.

                                                                                                    41
5. Based on the infrastructure program, the province identified investment requirements amounting to
approximately US$700 million for the period 2004-2010 in two main infrastructure sectors: roads and
water (particularly sewers and drainage). Given the magnitude of the infrastructure needs identified,
the Bank, provincial government, and national government agreed in 2004 to conclude a two-phased
Adaptable Program Loan, in order to support the Buenos Aires Infrastructure Program. The first
phase of the program (APL 1) stood at US$200 million and the second, at US270 million (APL 2).



2. BRIEF OVERVIEW AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

2.1. Project Purpose and Objectives

6. The purpose of the project was to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province
while contributing to sustainable economic growth that paves the way for poverty alleviation and
increases social equity. In particular, it sought to:

         (i)    Expand the coverage of basic water, sanitation, and urban drainage services for the
                population, especially for low-income groups living in highly vulnerable areas of the
                Conurbano Bonaerense;

         (ii)   Support the productive reactivation and growth of the provincial economy by
                improving the conditions and sustainability of the road network; and

         (iii) Gradually develop the respective sectoral infrastructure programs in a sound fiscal
               framework that ensures convergence toward a sustainable fiscal situation.



2.2. Investment Problems and Prioritization

7. Road Problems. In 2003, the Strategic Road Plan for the Province of Buenos Aires was prepared
and takes into account the following variables for prioritizing investments:

         (i)    Transport and its composition (AADT, cars, light trucks, heavy trucks and buses);

         (ii)   Road conditions (roughness - IRI); cracks; patching; deflection and rutting; and,

         (iii) Provincial regionalization, defined in two major areas—metropolitan and interior.

8. Different priorities were identified in the road sector, which included:

         (i)    Reducing the cost of travel and operations in the Province through the rehabilitation of
                the primary paved interurban network;

         (ii)   Reducing congestion and increasing transport efficiency in the Conurbano Bonaerense
                by expanding and rehabilitating key urban sectors of the primary paved network;
                                                                                                     42
         (iii) Improving road access to provincial ports;

         (iv) Improving the linkage of local communities with the primary paved network through
              the rehabilitation of their access roads; and

         (v)   The need for a paved and unpaved road network maintenance program to support its
               long- term sustainability.

9. Water and Sanitation Problems. Water and sanitation services in the Province of Buenos Aires
(PBA) were very much affected by the crisis described. Under the program, a proposal was made to
increase the expansion of water and sanitation services to the disadvantaged and vulnerable
population groups, particularly in the Conurbano Bonaerense. The provision of this basic
infrastructure became a short-term priority, along with compliance with a new regulatory framework,
equitable regulatory treatment for public and private providers, and the independence of the
regulatory entities.

10. Drainage Problems. The Province of Buenos Aires is particularly vulnerable to urban and rural
flooding. The increase in the number of spills, blocked pipes, and the elevation of free ground water
levels (water table) along with the fact that it is located in a very flat and low area increase the
vulnerability of the Province of Buenos Aires to flooding. The increase in groundwater levels has a
particularly big impact on the suburban areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense and the agriculturally-
rich area of the Humid Pampas.

11. The lack of regulation or enforcement of urban planning has led to unplanned settlements,
particularly among low-income residents in the more flood-prone areas.

12. Institutional Strengthening Problems. In order to properly address current infrastructure
problems and foster the long-term sustainability of the program, a series of structural weaknesses
noted by the different provincial government entities, both during the planning and execution phases,
need to be taken into account.



2.3. Components

13. On this basis, three works components were identified for infrastructure investment and three, for
improvement:




                                                                                                   43
COMPONENT                  OBJECTIVE

Road                       Rehabilitation of high-priority segments of the non-concessioned interurban road
                           network through traditional customized contracts and the introduction of
                           Performance-based Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contracts (CREMAs);

                           Elimination of critical bottlenecks by: (i) widening provincial roads within the
                           non-concessioned paved network in the Conurbano Bonaerense that connects
                           large industrial areas and ports to production and consumption centers, and (ii)
                           making significant road safety improvements at certain junctions and
                           intersections;

                           Rehabilitation of non-concessioned roads that provide nearby towns with access
                           to the primary road network; and

                           Implementation of a well-designed maintenance program for the entire non-
                           concessioned provincial road network.

Water and Sanitation       Expansion of coverage for the provision of basic sanitation services in the
                           Province to benefit close to 100,000 low-income population groups who, for the
                           most part, live in highly vulnerable areas from a sanitation standpoint that are
                           under the responsibility of the ABSA, particularly in the Conurbano Bonaerense.

                           Priority will be given to investments in areas where (i) there is a high
                           concentration of low-income families; (ii) there is a high degree of environmental
                           health vulnerability; and (iii) plans already exist or are being prepared to build
                           main supply lines and collection and treatment plants. Most interventions will
                           take place in areas for which the ABSA is responsible, particularly in the
                           Conurbano Bonaerense.

Drainage                   Expansion and optimization of macro-drainage infrastructure in urban and peri-
                           urban areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense. The proposed investments are part of
                           an integrated drainage plan and follow the methodology adopted with the support
                           of the APL 1.

Technical engineering,     Services to strengthen the execution of the program and to improve the selection
feasibility, design, and   of eligible investments that are ready to be implemented.

Institutional Capacity     Building institutional capacity to provide provincial infrastructure services and
Building                   supervision for the purpose of strengthening the capacity of the agencies involved
                           in the implementation of the subprojects of each component, strengthening
                           technical assistance programs started under previous projects, and supporting the
                           improvement of information systems and implementing an analytical work
                           program to monitor processes related to the implementation and impact of the
                           program.

3.2. Changes in the Components

14. During execution of the Program, the works components were, for the most, part, carried out.
The situation related to the capacity-building components is different, since they had to be revised.

15. In restructuring loans APL 2 and APL 1 FA, the scope of the activities of APL 2 included in the
pre-investment, institutional capacity-building and technical feasibility components were revised so
as to adapt them to the financial situation. The outcome indicators were revised and several
institutional activities were eliminated from components 4, 5, and 6.

4. OUTCOMES

4.1. Conceptual Evaluation of the Project
16. Objectives – indicators achieved. The works were strategically important to efforts to make
progress toward economic growth, poverty reduction, and increased social equality in the province.

              (i)      The 35-kilometer stretch of new roads, the more than 250 rehabilitation works, and the
                       improved road junctions contributed to increased productivity and regional
                       competitiveness in local and international markets.

              (ii)     Investments in water and sanitation improved health and sanitation conditions by
                       increasing access to water service and sewerage connections for 147,200 residents
                       living in the Province’s highly vulnerable areas.

              (iii) Improved drainage over a 1,200-hectare area through investments in urban drainage
                    helped reduce flooding triggered by rains that led to significant losses for households,
                    in particular low-income households, as well as for industries and commercial
                    activities, both directly and indirectly, owing to disruptions in transport and other
                    services.

21. The Program’s institutional strengthening activities helped build the management capacity of all
the participating organizations. The hiring of consulting firms and individual consultants, training
activities, and the production of support materials for each component generated lessons and new
management techniques in the various provincial organizations, thus ensuring the sustainability of the
Program’s activities.




                                                                                                   51
4.2. Impact Evaluation

22. The impact of the Program’s works will be evaluated using the information gathered from
INDEC’s 2001 and 2010 National Population, Household, and Housing Census (CNPHyV). The
nature of the available information facilitates measurement of the impact of the program on potable
water supply and sewerage connections installed. Many evaluation studies focus in particular on this
variable because it is the key to the success of this type of infrastructure works.

23. A difference-in-differences analysis will be used to measure the pre- and post- program impact on
the areas in which works were carried out, as well as the program’s hypothetical impact.

24. It is important to bear in mind that in light of the survey date for the 2010 CNPHyV, only an
examination of the scope of the program in the short term (to very short term) is possible in the case
of some works, and that others could not be fully addressed (especially APL2 works). In the latter
case, consideration must be given to the characteristics of the region in which the works were
conducted in order to evaluate the program’s impact based on the outcomes of the works assessed.



5. FINAL EVALUATION

5.1. Sustainability

25. Actions Executed by the Province to Ensure Achievement of Project Benefits. The Program
addresses long-term sustainability by (i) monitoring fiscal conditions so as to assess the adequacy of
fiscal resources available to successfully execute the infrastructure program; (ii) prioritizing the
works between sectors and within each sector in order to adapt to the fiscal space available and
prioritize high-impact, high-return subprojects, meeting the Program’s specific objectives; (iii)
ensuring the implementation of adequate road management strategies and the provision of stable
financial resources to ensure ongoing maintenance of the network; (iv) ensuring the implementation
of the subprojects in a context of economic and financial equilibrium for water and sanitation
operators, in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Framework Agreement; and (v)
developing a strategic framework for investments, infrastructure policies, and the definition of
guidelines on sector and territorial development in the province.

26. In the water and sanitation sector, the Project does not include investments specifically designed
to address the service operators’ management or operational deficiencies, focusing instead on
expanding services to low-income population groups. Despite this proposal and the absence of
investments geared specifically toward enhancing efficiency or operations, the Project will have an
impact on these deficiencies, helping the provincial government to develop and implement proper
regulations and mechanisms with a view to maintaining and increasing efficiency targets, and
improving the sustainability and capacity to generate new investments.



                                                                                                   52
27. More importantly, sustainability is underpinned by the provincial government’s firm decision to
implement the proposed Program and the requisite institutional and policy frameworks.

28. Assessment of the Risk of not Sustaining Project Outcomes. The Project’s overall risk level is
deemed to be relatively low. The outcomes achieved under APL 1, the experience gained in the area
of implementation by the executing agency, and the ongoing and firm commitment of the provincial
government to achieving the program’s objectives appear to support this assessment.



5.2. Changes in Original Design

29. On September 30, 2011, a restructuring paper for the Program was approved with a view to
implementing the involuntary resettlement safeguard policy (OP/BP 4.12). The following changes
were also made: (i) revision of the scope of the Project’s selected activities in order to adapt to the
prevailing financial situation; (ii) revision of the outcome indicators in order to better account for the
revised Project scope and facilitate monitoring of progress in order to achieve the Project
development objectives; and (iii) an 18-month extension until August 15, 2013, of the Project closing
date in order to complete works under way. With respect to point (i), the amount allocated in the
Water, Sanitation and Drainage Works Cost Matrix was increased, in view of the fact that funds
became available upon the elimination of a number of institutional strengthening activities that were
either redundant or no longer needed.

30. In October 2012, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development approved the
restructuring of Loans No. 7472-AR and 7947-AR. With a view to covering a portion of the
estimated shortfall in the Works Components, the sum allocated to Water and Sanitation Works was
increased by US$4 million. Given that this increase covered a portion of the shortfall, the transfer of
certain works from IBRD-7472 to IBRD-7947 was approved in an effort to help complete works
being executed under APL2, the resources of which had been depleted. This restructuring exercise
was of critical importance to the ability to complete the four water and sanitation works and one road
work under IBRD-7472-AR, which, without this additional financing (IBRD-7947), would have had
to have been completed with local resources. The transfer of works was based on a prioritization
process that took into account the percentage of physical progress made in the Program’s works and
the impact of these works on the outcomes to be achieved (Program indicators).

31. In August 2013, an extension of the project closing date to December 31, 2013 was approved and
funds were reallocated across a number of disbursement categories, particularly with a view to
completing sanitation works on the Finochietto river basin.



5.3. Lessons Learned
           (i)    Leadership by the Ministry of Economy with respect to project implementation
           (ii)   Knowledge and relevance with respect to management of external financing
                                                                                                       53
          (iii) Team work between the civil servants and technical personnel from the province and
                the World Bank was key to achieving agreements and finding quick, efficient, and
                effective solutions for the difficulties and challenges faced during execution of the
                Program.
          (iv) The Program’s planning, action, and public investment strategy designed a
               comprehensive approach model that takes into account not only efficiency in the
               execution of the works, but also the quality of these works, measured in accordance
               with the beneficiaries’ interests and needs.
          (v)    Institutional strengthening activities promoted the development of environments that
                 promote cohesion and confidence within the public administration, thus also
                 facilitating the execution of projects with multilateral lending agencies.


5.4. Achievements
          (i)    Creation of a professional, technical policy, multidisciplinary and interagency team
                 that belongs to the SCEOCI, UCPO, DIPAC, and DIPSOH.
          (ii)   Growth of the institutional role and responsibilities of the SCEOCI and UCPO,
                 which, over time, were significantly strengthening their capacity in areas relating to
                 project development and management (procurement, financial management,
                 monitoring and evaluation), while also being converted into sub-secretariats in their
                 respective line ministries.
          (iii) Organization of the Planning Unit for water and sewerage services into a Provincial
                Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation [Dirección Provincial de Servicios
                Públicos de Agua y Cloacas DIPAC], consolidating the planning process for the
                expansion of water and sewerage services.
          (iv) Implementation of the institutional agreements between the government of the
               province of Buenos Aires and water and sewerage operators.
          (v)    Methodological change in the design and management of urban drains, and
                 subsequent approval of the “Manual for the design of master plans to improve
                 infrastructure and management for urban drainage.”
          (vi) Execution of structural measures using local funds and national resources and
               implementation of non-structural measures, for urban drainage.
          (vii) Capacity building in planning and evaluating investments in road works, through the
                incorporation of modeling and programming tools.
          (viii) Incorporation of high-tech equipment (deflectograph, mobile axle-weight measuring
                 devices) for activities designed to maintain and improve the provincial road network.
