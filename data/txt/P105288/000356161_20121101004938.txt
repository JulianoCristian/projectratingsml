7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province
within a framework of fiscal responsibility as a means of supporting the return to a sustainable path of
economic growth, to alleviate poverty and increase social equity. To this end, the Province is prioritizing a
set of interventions through a sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2010 specifically
aimed to: i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province,
to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to ensure convergence towards a
long-term sustainable fiscal framework. ii. Enhance access to water and sewerage services to low income
people living in highly vulnerable areas and to mitigate urban flooding. iii.       Improve high priority
segments of the productive paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and
strengthen regional competitiveness. The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) of this operation as
stated in the Loan Agreement are: (i) to enhance the provision of water and sewerage services for the
benefit of low-income people, in particular for those people living in highly vulnerable areas; (ii) to
improve high priority road segments of the Borrower’s road network; (iii) to mitigate urban flooding; and
(iv) to support the reactivation of the Borrower’ economy and strengthen its regional competitiveness.
