                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY

1.      This is a proposal to restructure the Buenos Aires Infrastructure Sustainable
Investment Development Adaptable Program Project APL1 (P088032), which includes
an Additional Financing. The APL2 (P105288) of the Program was restructured in
parallel, through a separate Project Paper.

2.     The proposed restructuring, jointly with the restructuring proposed in parallel for
the APL 2, will update the Program funding structure and its activities to the current
context, thus providing the grounds for an adequate and timely Program implementation,
aiming at full achievement of the Project Development Objectives of both APLs (I and
II).

3.      The proposed changes are necessary because of considerable increases in
construction costs in Argentina, which are affecting the availability of funds to finance
the works initially foreseen in the Program (both APLs), thus justifying the present
restructuring.

4.      The proposed changes described in this Project Paper will only affect the
Additional Financing (AF) Loan No. 7947-AR and include the following: (i) revising the
scope of the civil work components to reflect construction cost increases; (ii) reallocating
project costs among components accordingly; (iii) adjusting the target values of project
indicators to account for the revised project scope; and (iv) changing the loan financing
percentage.

5.     This restructuring does not imply any changes to the PDO or implementation
arrangements. Safeguards screening category will also remain unchanged and no new
safeguards policies will be triggered.

PROJECT STATUS

6.     The US$514 million Buenos Aires Infrastructure Sustainable Investment
Development Adaptable Program (APL) to improve infrastructure services in the
Province of Buenos Aires within a framework of fiscal responsibility consists of this
operation (APL1 - P088032) in the amount of US$200 million, which includes AF in the
amount of US$50 million, and APL2 (P105288) in the amount of US$264 million.

7.    The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) of this operation as stated in the
Loan Agreements of APL1 and AF are: (i) to enhance the provision of water and
sewerage services for the benefit of low-income people, in particular for those people

                                             4
living in highly vulnerable areas; (ii) to improve high priority road segments of the
Borrower’s road network; (iii) to mitigate urban flooding; and (iv) to support the
reactivation of the Borrower’s economy and strengthen its regional competitiveness.

8.       Project implementation and progress toward achieving the PDOs for APL1 have
consistently been rated satisfactory. All civil works and most technical assistance
activities of the original project have been satisfactorily completed and the respective
outcomes have mostly been achieved. The original loan is fully disbursed, but the
Borrower still has resources in the special account to complete the technical assistance
activities.

9.      The AF in the amount of US$50 million was approved by the Board on July 27,
2010. It aims at filling the financing gap caused by unforeseen cost increases and scale up
of the project to include additional works. Because of reasons outside of the Borrower’s
control the AF loan only became effective on February 17, 2012, 18 months after its
approval by the Bank’s Board. The Borrower has already carried out the bidding
processes for works in the amount of approximately US$34 million. Contract signing and
the start of these works are expected to take place in October 2012. No disbursement
from the AF loan has yet taken place.

PROPOSED CHANGES

10.     The proposed changes will only affect the AF loan and include the following: (i)
revising the scope of the civil work components to reflect cost increases; (ii) reallocating
project costs among components accordingly; (iii) adjusting the target values of project
indicators to account for the revised project scope; and (iv) changing the loan financing
percentage. These changes are described in detail below.

Revision in the Scope of Civil Work Components and Adjustment of Project
Indicator Targets
11.     Due to significant construction cost increases and hard budget constraint, the
Borrower will not be able to finance the completion of all ongoing works under APL2.
Technically it does not make sense to rehabilitate a road and leave a small section
incomplete or construct a sanitation facility and leave it unfinished or not connect the
planned dwellings. Therefore, the Borrower decided to complete the ongoing civil works
under APL2, for a total amount of US$16,252,431.60, with funds of this operation (a
restructuring of APL2 is processed in parallel).

12.     The table below shows the ongoing works that cannot be completed with funds of
APL2, their degree of completion in physical and financial terms on June 30, 2012, and
the activities and amounts to be executed and financed under APL1/AF.

13.     There will be no financing overlap between APL2 and APL1/AF since the
Borrower made a cut-off of these works in physical and financial terms on June 30, 2012.
This means that the works executed until June 30, 2012 will be financed with funds of
APL2 and the remaining works will be financed with funds of APL1/AF. The Bank team
verified the accuracy of the information related to this cut-off based on the payment
certificates (Certificados de Pago por Obras) and price adjustment certificates
(Certificados de Ajuste de Precios) provided by the Borrower. The project’s Operational
Manual will be updated to reflect the cut-off of works to be financed under APL2 and
APL1/AF.

14.    The completion of these civil works under APL1/AF does not require changes to
the implementation arrangements and does not have any implications in terms of
safeguards. In substance the safeguards requirements of APL2 are in line with those of
APL1/AF and the procedures and instruments applied by the Borrower are unified for
both operations.

15.     Similarly, since the 2011 restructuring of APL2, the procurement rules and
procedures applicable under APL2 and APL1/AF are identical. However, since the civil
works under APL2 were contracted previous to this date, the Borrower will amend the
five works contracts to be financed under this operation to include the current version of
the anticorruption clause and update the source of financing.

16.    Considering higher than expected increases in construction costs since the
appraisal of the AF in 2009, the Borrower decided to prioritize the funds of the AF to
complete ongoing works and implement those works already bid. Therefore, the

                                                                                                 6
following works initially envisaged under the AF will not be carried out: (i) rehabilitation
of Provincial Road 25, Access to Paraná de las Palmas, with a length of 11.5km; (ii)
sewage infrastructure works in Campana; and (iii) drainage works of the San Francisco
Basin. In addition, the sewage infrastructure works of Pta. Catonas II, Catonas III and
Berazategui will be reduced in scope, which means that the size of these infrastructure
works will be smaller than planned and the number of connected dwellings will be
reduced. These changes will impact the indicator’s targets of the Project, as mentioned in
the paragraph 16.

17.  The following table shows the works original expected to be contracted under
APL1/AF and those now excluded from the project scope.

18.     Balancing the additional works included from the APL 2, and the reduction of
scope of works initially envisaged in the AF, the Project end target values of five custom
project indicators will be reduced or increased as shown in Annex 1 Results Framework
and Monitoring. As examples, the target of the outcome indicator HT IRI 1will increase
from > 3.3 to >3.82; and the target of the outcome indicator related to number of
beneficiaries from WSS access will increase from 259,073 to 267,270.

19.    Taking the opportunity of the proposed restructuring, six core indicators that have
already been monitored in the ISRs will be formalized in the Project’s Results
Framework through their inclusion in Annex 1.

20.     Considering the delays in the AF’s effectiveness, t he works will require until June
2015 to be completely finalized and the indicators’ targets fully met. Therefore, the
revised Results Framework (annex 1) presents the final targets until June 2015. In view
of AF’s current closing date of December 2013, the Government has expressed its plan to
submit to the Bank a request for extension of closing date within the next 6 months. The
Government has also indicated its commitment to finalize the works with local funds, in
the case that the Bank is unable to extend the closing date.

    This apparent increase actually represents a “downgrade” in terms of roads quality.

21.    The Loan Agreement of the AF will be amended to reflect the changes in the
scope of the civil work components of APL1/AF.

22.    Finally, this restructuring, in particular the change in scope of the civil works, is
not expected to imply any risks additional to the ones identified in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) of APL1 and the Project Paper of the AF.3

AF loan will be increased from 75% to 100%. This change in the disbursement
percentage will enable the Borrower to maintain the pace of the civil works.

 The fact that the APL 2 finishes before the APL 1/AF does not represent additional risks to the
implementation schedule, since the unfinished APL 2 works that are being transferred to the APL 1/AF
have a cut-off date of June 30, 2012; and other remaining works financed with APL 2 funds are well
advanced and should be concluded by the current APL 2 closing date (August 15, 2013).

       *The baseline and target values for these two indicators have a one-year lag due to their calculation mode. The Borrower’s current severe financial constraints together with
       the rapidly increasing construction costs in Argentina have reduced the total amount of road rehabilitation and maintenance works on the road network. This has worsened
       the road conditions and justifies an increase of the project end target values of the outcome indicator related to the preservation of high traffic (HT) and average (AVG) road
       assets.
