Development Project\n            for Argentina were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory,\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the APL provided flexibility\n            that was key to the project's successful implementation\n            given the unstable fiscal environment. Project\n            implementation arrangements can strategically foster\n            institutional strengthening. The hands-off model for\n            promoting connection to sewerage systems employed by water\n            supply and sanitation (WSS) operators in the Province of\n            Buenos Aires (PBA) proved to be effective. For project\n            monitoring and evaluation purposes, however, measuring\n            active sewerage connections is an important action that\n            relates to the actual impact of investments, and it requires\n            an active supervision jointly by the infrastructure\n            implementing agencies and by the WSS operators. The APL\n            program benefited from directly engaging the PBA to design\n            and implement the program's activities."}, "docdt": "2014-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
