REPORT AID RECOfIAENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA
1.        I submit the followring report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$15.7 million for
a highway project to the Republic of Costa Rica.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed project is the second highway project to be financ-
ed by the Bank in Costa Rica. In 1961 a joint Bank/IDA Loan/Credit
of US1l1 million was made to help finance the National Highway Program
(Plan Vial).
3.        The proposed project w>xas submitted to the  Banlc in October 1967
and was appraised in August 1968. Because it app:ared that public
savings would be inadequate to support the greatly enlarged public invest-
ment program which the Government proposed to undertake in the early
1970s, the Bank decided not to proceed wjith negotiations at the end of
1968. Howiever, a markred improvement has since taken place in the fiscal
and balance of payments situation for reasons described in the attached
economic memorandum, and the project iwas accordingly reappraised in Febru-
ary 1970.  Negotiations were conducted in W-ashington on Ilarch 2 through
March 4, 1970.  The Government was represented by Rodolfo Mendez, Vice-
Minister of Transport, Enrique Angulo, Subdirector of the Directorate of
Highways of the Ministry of Transport and Alfonso Guardia, M'inister
Counselor of Economic  lffairs of the Costa Rican anbassy in T.ashington.
4.        The proposed loan, the eleventh to Costa Rica) would increase
the Bank's total lending from US$69.2 to USP84.9 million.   The followving
is a summary statement of Banl loans and IDA credits to Costa Rica as of
February 28, 1970.

1/ Of the original credit of US$5.5 million, US$949.758 was cancelled.
5.        Disbursements of the loan for agricultural credit (538-CR) have
made a slow start, mainly because there were still funds available to be
drawn for this purpose from other external loans. These funds have now
been mostly committed, and the Bank loan is beginning to be used. Pros-
pects are good that the loan will be fully committed by the end of 1970.
6.        A port project in Costa Rica, which is closely linked with the
proposed highway project, is currently under appraisal and should be ready
for presentation to the Executive Directors around the end of calendar
year 1970. A further loan, for agriculture, is also being prepared for
consideration by the Bank during the coming fiscal year.
7.        As of February 23, 1970, IFC had a loan and equity investment
of US$111,083 in Productos de Concreto, S.A.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Highway
Project, Costa Rica" (PTR - 2b) is attached.
10.       An efficient transport system is of particular importance for
the economy of Costa Rica becauise of its heavy reliance on foreign trade.
The country is in the very unusual position of having no highwiay connection
between its capital and chief manufacturing cenf,er and its principal port,
and the proposed project wiould remedy this deficiency.  There is already a
road between San Jose and Siquirres, and the construction of the remaining
section from Siquirres to Limon would provide the first modern road linkc
between the densely populated Central Valley and the Atlantic Coast. It
would be part of the basic infrastructure of the Central American Common
Market. The railway, which has hitherto carried most of the through
traffic between Limon and San Jose, would be able to concentrate in future
on the banana traffic for which it is best suited.
11.       The project consists of the construction of a 57 Im road link
between Siquirres and Limon, including the construction of 19 bridges,
river defense wiorks and about 150 drainage structures. The project also
includes a feasibility study for the existin- San Jose-Siquirres road, as
this is in need of improvement and will reach capacity shortly after the
Siquirres-Limon section has been built.   Project costs are estimated at
US$19.4 million equivalent. The amount of the proposed loan of US$15.7
million represents the presently estimated foreign exchange cost of
US$12.9nflion, together with interest and other charges on the Bank loan
of US$2.8milhion. The balance would be provided by the Government. The
project is expected to be completed b, the end of 1974.



12.       The project would be executed by the Ministry of Transportation
through the Direccion General de Vialidad which has carried out the feasi-
bility study and detailed engineering. The U.S. Bureau of Public Road(s
has provided technical assistance for preparing the project and w-ould help
to supervise construction. All construction work under the project would
be carried out by contracts let on the basis of international competitive
biddin-, the project being divided into two road contracts and one bridge
contract, and qualified contractors would be allowed to bid for one or
more of them. These arrangements should be adequate to prevent a recur-
rence of the delays encountered in the execution of the earlier Bank
highway project in Costa Rica, where a large number of small contracts
were involved, and supervision was difficult. Disbursements for construc-
tion workc would be made on a percentage basis, while direct payments
would be made for the foreign exchange cost of consultant services.
13.       The project has high priority in Costa Rica's public investment
program. Completion of the road from San Jose to Limon is important not
only for the development of the country's foreign trade, but also for
opening up new^ areas on the Atlantic Coast. The economic rate of return
on the investment from savings in transport costs alone is 17 percent.
This does not take into account some additional benefits which are not
readily quantifiable such as time savings for passengers and goods, lower
rail freight rates and reductions in losses of perishable products.
PART IV - LEGAL IINSTRUET-,,TS A-M AUTHORITY
14.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Costa Rica and
the Bank, which contains the covenants normally included in highway pro-
jects, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Ececutive Directors separat %r,
PART V - THD EGCOiOTVY
15.       Last June, in presenting to the Executive Directors loans for
powier and telecommunications in Costa Rica, I drew attention to the
difficulties which the country has experienced in mobilizing public
savings for development and indicated that an improvemant would be needed
in the fiscal situation oefore the Bank could proceed uith projects calling
for a budgetary contribution to meet local costs. A considerable improve-
ment has since tacen place in the finances of the Central Government and
is reflected both in the results for 1969 and in the outloolc for 1970,
which are described in the attached economic memorandum. Last year, for
the first time in many years, the Central Government reduced its debt to
the Central Bank, while credit expansion to the private sector was held
within moderate limits.   Real GDP, stimulated by a continued export boom,
increased b- over 8 percent or about 5 percent per capita, with very little
rise in domestic prices, and net foreign reserves rose by some US$16
million to a new high of US$38 million.



16.       Thanks in large part to the favorable trend of exports, Costa
Rica's economy is now on a much sounder footing than it was when the
present Government took over four years ago, and its external debt profile
has been greatly improved. External debt service requirements fell frcm about
18 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1967 to some 11 percent in 1969.
Costa Rica can therefore be considered creditworthy for the proposed loan.
The country is, however, embarking on a rapidly increasing program of
public investment, and its creditworthiness for additional external borrow-
ing in future will depend to an important degree on the action taken on
the tax measures now before the Assembly and on the economic policies to
be followed by the new Government, which takes office in May.
PART VT - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
17.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
18.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

MaE14ORA.T3UM ON RECJN? Ec0 :MTC D?VSLOPME`T
ATD PROSPECTS OF CUSTA RICA
1.   Throughout the 1960's the economic situation in Costa Rica was marked
by high rates of economic growth accompanied by substantial fiscal deficits.
The last economic report (WH-185a distributed to the Executive Directors
on November 29, 1968) concluded that Costa Rica had the potential for con-
tinued substantial growth over the next few years based on the prospects for
a large increase in banana exports, new agricultural exports and continued
expansion of manufactured exports to the regional market. But the key to
the realization of these favorable growth prospects was an improvement in
the fiscal performance of the Government, which was to provide the basis for
substantial increased investment in infrastructure. The deterioration of
government finances had been largely responsible for the difficult balance
of payments situation in 1966 and 1967, and this would have to be corrected.
Public Finance
2.   The current surplus of the Central Government in 1969 was slightly higher
than in the previous year, in place of the deficit which had been expected,
and a larger surplus is projected for 1970 (see Table 1). Buoyant revenues
and record sales of bonds to the private sector were key elements in strength-
ening the Central Government's financial position and enabling it to finance
a considerably higher investment level, repay floating debt and reduce its
net indebtedness to the Central Bank despite a renewed upswing in current
expenditures. Central Government revenues increased by over 13 percent as
compared with 1968, raising their proportion to GDP to about 13 percent or
roughly one percentage point higher than two years earlier. The factors res-
ponsible were the continuous rapid expansion of the economy, further improve-
ments in the administration of both income as well as consumption taxes and
an extremely favorable response by tax payers to the Government's intensive
appeal to pay taxes.
3.   Given the high present and expected levels of coffee prices, and Costa
Rica's system of taxing coffee at higher rates as prices rise, the revenue
outlook for 1970 is even more favorable. If the administrative improvements
already initiated are continued, and if the Government is successful in
limiting current expenditures to the budgeted 8 percent increase - as against
13 percent in 1969 and 5 percent in 1968 - the fiscal situation in 1970
should improve further. For subsequent years the willingness of the new
Administration - scheduled to take office in mid-1970 - to continue the
efforts of the present Government to strengthen the tax base by passing the
tax legislation now before Congress is crucial. The President-Elect, Mr.
Jose Figuerres, has expressed his intention to deal effectively with this
problem and has announced the reappointment of the present Minister of Finance,
who was instrumental in bringing about the recent improvements.



-2-
4.   In 1969 the Government demonstrated an unprecedented ability to tap
private savings through the sales of bonds to the non-banking priva-e sector.
This wasnot,merely a reflection of the continued high degree of liquidity in
the economy, but also was a sign of increased confidence in the Government's
improved financial management.  However, the bonds generally carry a repur-
chase guarantee, and this makes it particularly important that confidence
should be maintained and inflationary pressures kcept under control. 1N1oreover,
the servicing of such a substantially increased level of internal indebtedness
has materially contributed to the rapid growth of current expenditures. A
large portion of the excess of actual over budgeted current expenditures
last year was precisely in that category.  A substantially lower net level of
such domestic borrowing is contemplated for 1970. This should make it easier
for the Authorities to achieve a contemplated reduction in the growth of
current expenditures.
Growth and Balance of Payments
5.   During 1969 real GDP increased by over 8 percent, or about 5 percent
per capita. This is the fifth consecutive year that such a high growth rate
has been maintained. The rapid expansion of the economy continued to be ac-
companied by a vigorous increase in domestic savings, which between 1966 and
1969 rose from about 15 to 20 percent of GDP. Private sector liquid assets
held by the banking system and the Government increased from an equivalent
of 27 percent of GDP to 34 percent between 1966 and 1969. This improvement
in the mobilization and channeling  of resources has been instrumental in
overcoming Costa Rica's recent financial difficulties.
6.   Exports were the main growth factor during 1965-1968, increasing annuall;-
by about 15 percent. Bananas have accounted for about half of incremental
exports in these years, the remainder being distributed between industrial
products to the rest of the Central American Common Market and other agri-
cultural exporus.  During 1969 the rate of import growth has accelerated
over the already rapid expansion of the recent past, thus raising the current
account deficit (Table 2). However, this has been more than offset by a
large private capital inflow attracted by the promising investment opportuni-
ties in the banana sector and in industry, resifting in an overall balance of
payments surplus.
7.   These developments brought about a reversal of the previous exchange
rate movement. During the 1967 balance of payments crisis a dual exchange
system was introduced and the free market rate in 1968 depreciated to 08.25
per US dollar, while the official parity remained at 6.65. In 1969 the free
rate moved to 6.90, and the authorities at the end of the year were able to
abolish the dual system and return to the 2dJ parity for all transactions.
8.  NIet official capital inflows during the past four years as a whole have
been substantially below previous levels as a result of high repayments of
short-term debt and a slow-down in disbursements from project loans.  Costa
Rica's external debt is 6f'nanagoable proporticns. Dospito the r0payrtont
of all external payment arrears w,hich had arisen as a result of the rationing



-3-
of foreign exchange under the dual exchange system, net internatinnal re-
serves rose by sone US$16 million in 1969 to an all-time high of US$38
million, equivalent to 2.1/2 months of imports. Only three years earlier,
net reserves were negative by US$15 million.  Furthermore, Costa Rica has
largely repaid its drawings from the liF and is now in its gold tranche.
Outlook and Creditworthiness
9.   The outlook for a continued rapid growth of the Costa Rican economy
is good. Considerable additional investment in bananas is presently being
implemented and important further expansions are planned for the next two
to three years. In addition to bananas, coffee is expected to contribute
materially to the expected rapid medium-term export growth as a result of
the sharp price increase caused by the recent Brazilian frost. In the
longer run, alumina exports could replace bananas and coffee as the dynamic
elements in Costa Rica's exports.  Congressional approval of a contract with
Alcoa fora $60 million investment is expected shortly. Prospects for con-
tinued growth of some minor agricultural exports and industrial exports
within the Central American ommon arket are also good.
10. IUith these favorable export prospects, and taking into account the
recent improvement in Costa Rica's external debt profile resultinp in a
considerable reduction of the service burden on existing debt (from around
18 percent of foreign-exchange earnings in 1967 to about 11 percent
in 1970). Costa 'tica will be creditworthy for substantial borrowJinc on con-
ventional terms, provided that prudent fi'scal and debt management policies
are maintained.
