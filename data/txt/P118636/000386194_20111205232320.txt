1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

Over recent decades, Samoa has performed strongly in terms of growth, economic
management, and delivery of social services. Samoa is a small remote island country,
with a population of around 182,000, and GDP of around US$605 million. Like other
small remote island countries, Samoa’s economy is narrowly based around remittances,
tourism, and foreign aid. Rapid increases in remittance and aid flows have supported
strong economic growth, with Samoa achieving average per capita GDP growth of
around 3.5% during the fifteen years to 2008. Up to 2008, prudent fiscal policies saw
public debt decline to comfortable levels. Tariffs have been substantially reduced, a
broad-based value-added tax has been introduced, and the financial sector has been
liberalized – including the removal of interest-rate controls. Public enterprises have been
progressively corporatized and privatized to reduce the role of the state in the economy
and improve the efficiency of service delivery. Important public sector management
reforms have been introduced, including the use of output budgeting, forward estimates,
and greater strategic planning. Improved social services have supported important gains
in human development, with life expectancy increasing to 71.4 years, literacy reaching
98.7%, and Samoa achieving the highest Human Development Index score among Pacific
countries.

Vulnerable to external shocks, Samoa was hit hard by the Global Economic Crisis.
Strong growth performance was interrupted in 2009, with remittance flows declining by
21% in real terms in 2009, and tourist numbers declining by around 7% primarily due to
unfavorable global economic conditions. Downsizing of an automotive components
plant led to the loss of 1,550 formal sector jobs and contributed to an overall decline in
formal sector employment of 9.3%. Loss of general business confidence contributed even
higher levels of risk aversion among commercial banks which had already demonstrated
variable willingness to finance viable tourism projects in the context of limited banking-
sector competition and ongoing efforts to reduce non-performing loans. Private sector
credit growth slowed and liquidity increased, despite accommodative monetary policy
implemented by the Central Bank of Samoa. The resulting 5% overall decline in GDP in
FY2008/09 represented Samoa’s worst economic performance in two decades.

Challenges of the Global Economic Crisis were compounded by the impacts of the
food and fuel crisis. By the time the Global Economic Crisis struck, poor Samoans had
already been facing mounting pressures due to the impacts of food and fuel price
increases. Between 2006 and the first half of 2009, average domestic fuel prices in Samoa
increased by 35% and the total food import bill increased by 30%. The fuel and food
crisis led to an inflationary peak of 18% in late 2008 and contributed to a recorded
increase in basic needs poverty in rural areas in the 2008 Household Income and
Expenditure Survey – with an additional 11.5% of the rural population of Upolu and an
additional 12.7% of the population of Savai’i falling below the Basic Needs Poverty Line
between 2002 and 2008.

                                            1
The Government of Samoa and the international community responded quickly to
the Global Economic Crisis. In the face of projected significant declines in revenues,
the Government of Samoa worked with donors to manage the impacts of the Global
Economic Crisis and formulate a major fiscal stimulus package.1 The Government of
Samoa sought to address the immediate need to boost economic activity and create
employment, while laying the foundations for stronger longer-term growth, through a
program of investment spending concentrated in infrastructure development.
Development expenditure increased from US$73 million in FY2008/09 to US$108
million in FY2009/10. The Government of Samoa negotiated with donors to finance the
some expenditure through grants, and the resulting substantial fiscal deficit – around 10%
of GDP – through highly concessional loans.

In September 2009, Samoa was hit by a major tsunami – the worst natural disaster
since Samoa’s independence in 1962. The tsunami left approximately 143 people dead,
and more than 5,300 homeless – around 2.5% of Samoa’s population. 502 homes were
destroyed, and another 360 suffered severe damage. Costs of physical damage were
estimated at US$85 million, while costs arising from disruption of economic activity
were estimated at a further US$40 million. In agriculture, the destruction of infrastructure
assets threatened food security and cash incomes in semi-subsistence rural areas, as well
presenting challenges for fledging commercial agricultural producers. In tourism, which
contributed some 14% of GDP and 65% of export earnings in FY2008/09, more than a
quarter of overall capacity was destroyed in some of the most popular tourist areas.

The Government of Samoa responded rapidly and effectively to this natural disaster.
Samoa’s Disaster Advisory Council provided immediate humanitarian relief to the
affected population with support from international aid agencies. The National Disaster
Management Office worked closely with the World Bank and other development partners
to design and implement a recovery framework, which focused on maintaining access to
essential services, rebuilding agricultural and fisheries livelihoods, and rehabilitating the
environment while increasing resilience to future disasters. With Government finances
already stretched by the impacts of the Global Economic Crisis and the associated
stimulus package, substantial donor assistance was required to finance disaster
reconstruction over the medium-term.

The World Bank moved to support Samoa’s recovery through a program that was
coordinated with other donor responses and strongly aligned to Government
recovery priorities. The World Bank, having been in discussion with the Government of
Samoa regarding possible policy responses to the economic crisis, pledged US$20
million for a single-tranche Economic Crisis Recovery Support Credit program (the

                                             2
program), partially financed through the Crisis Response Window Pilot Program. The
Asian Development Bank simultaneously implemented a two-tranche, US$28.6 million
budget support operation, including policy actions fully concordant with those of the
World Bank. Budget support financing from the World Bank and ADB came alongside
US$9.3 million of IMF assistance through the Exogenous Shocks Facility, and
significantly increased project and recovery support from bilateral donors.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The program was designed to support the government’s policy agenda in four key areas:

   i)      Economic recovery from the impacts of the global economic crisis and the
           tsunami.

Two prior actions were specified in this area. The first prior action was for the
Legislative Assembly to approve a supplementary budget to finance the costed and
prioritized expenditures of the Emergency Recovery Plan. The tsunami left a
reconstruction bill exceeding 30% of GDP, with more than two-thirds of these costs
borne by the GoS. Through the proper authorizing channels, the GoS prepared a
supplementary budget for the full cost of the early recovery program – US$29 million.
This spending focused on crucial aspects of the reconstruction process, including
maintenance of essential services, restoring infrastructure services, rebuilding agriculture
and fisheries livelihoods, and rehabilitating the environment while building resilience to
future natural disasters. The supplementary budget was endorsed by Cabinet in December
2009, and passed by Parliament in January 2010.

The second prior action was the provision of a credit line to tourism operators to be
made available through the Development Bank of Samoa. With tourism crucial to
broader economic recovery, the Samoan authorities implemented several measures to
assist in the rebuilding of the Samoan tourism industry and damaged tourism assets. The
Central Bank of Samoa introduced a credit line, with a total value of SAT 5 million, with
a five year term, an interest rate of 3%, and grace period of twelve months, to the
Development Bank of Samoa for on-lending for tsunami reconstruction projects in the
tourism sector. Leveraging the Development Bank of Samoa’s greater local knowledge,
the facility was intended to increase access to finance for tourism operators in the context
of a lack of available financing from commercial banks. Commercial banks have
exhibited high levels of risk aversion since the onset of the Global Economic Crisis, and
were unwilling to support even viable tourism operations. This scheme was introduced in
the context of other measures to support the tourism sector, including implementation of
a government financed marketing campaign to promote the resumption, accessibility, and
advantages of tourism in Samoa, and two grant schemes for both small-scale beach fale
operators, and a concessional finance (interest subsidy) scheme for resorts, funded from
the New Zealand Aid Program.



                                             3
Two performance indicators were specified in this area. The first was the achievement
of progress in rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and housing.
The second was the recovery of tourism numbers and earnings towards pre-tsunami
levels.

   ii)     Protecting the vulnerable.

In this area, the prior action was the waiver of primary school fees. In order to
cushion vulnerable households from the combined impacts of the food and fuel crisis, the
Global Economic Crisis, and the 2009 tsunami, the Government accelerated progress
with existing plans for improving access to education, and implemented a waiver of
primary school fees at all public, special, and missionary schools. Accompanying the
implementation of the fee-waiver scheme, the Government of Samoa provided a new
program of accounting and financial management assistance to primary schools to
encourage good management of financial resources, with technical advisors hired by the
Ministry of Education, Sports & Culture. While funded by donors for the first two years
of operation, the Government of Samoa has agreed to take on more of the financing
burden over time, with 70% of the costs of the fee-waiver scheme to be met by
Government by its fifth year of operation. At the time of program implementation, non-
enrolment of primary age children was estimated at 550 children. The performance
indicator in this area was the maintenance of primary enrolment levels, reflecting the risk
that increased pressure on household budgets would lead to a reduced ability to meet the
cost of school fees among poor families in the absence of a fee-waiver scheme.

   iii)    Public financial management reform.

Two prior actions were specified in this area. The first prior action was the finalization
of all pending audits of public accounts, and submission of all backlogged accounts (for
FY 2006/07, FY 2007/08, and FY 2008/09) to the Samoa Audit Office. The Government
of Samoa is strongly committed to strengthening public financial management and, in
2008, implemented the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) to
address particular weaknesses identified through the 2006 Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability assessment, including accounting, reconciliation, and timeliness
of annual financial statements; timely preparation and submission of public accounts;
regular reconciliation of bank accounts and improved cash-flow management. Substantial
capacity building efforts were mobilized in the PFM area, including support for updating
and documenting of basic processes, changing mindsets for adopting new systems,
improving the skills of managers, and reviewing and correcting figures to improve the
quality of public accounts data. During the early stages of the Global Economic Crisis, a
cash management committee, consisting of Ministry of Finance directors was also
established to identify and manage emerging cash management issues before they
became a constraint to service delivery.

The second prior action was that the Government had taken satisfactory steps to
make operational the financial autonomy of the Land Transport Authority. As part
of ongoing reforms of the Ministry of Works, Transport, and Infrastructure (MWTI), the

                                             4
Land Transport Authority (LTA) was established in June 2008. The LTA was set up to
take over the transport licensing and regulatory functions of the Transport Control Board
and the road asset management functions of the MWTI. The Bank supported these
reforms through the Infrastructure Asset Management Program (IAMP). Following a
successful reform process, during which the LTA continued to operate under the
management of the MWTI, the Government of Samoa sought to grant full operational
and financial independence to the LTA in order to better manage its resources and
improve service delivery, both in the medium-term, and during the immediate
reconstruction phase of post-tsunami response. Under new arrangements, fees and
charges related to vehicle registration, driver licensing, and fines are collected by LTA
for financing of its operations. The Ministry of Finance continues to collect the petroleum
levy and petroleum terminal fee for financing of the national budget, with additional
financing requirements of LTA being met through the budget process. A high degree of
financial and management accountability is retained through requirements that LTA
submit quarterly and annual reports to the SOE monitoring division of the Ministry of
Finance. The first quarterly report was submitted in late 2009, and judged to be
satisfactory.

Three performance indicators were identified in this area. The first was consolidation
of mechanisms to prevent delays in the preparation of public accounts, to ensure that the
FY 2009/10 public accounts were submitted within four months of the end of the
financial year. The second was consolidation of new systems for management of cash-
flows, with the cash management committee continuing to monitor the cash-flow and
conduct reconciliations on a weekly basis. The third was timely submission of quarterly
reports by the LTA during FY 2009/2010.

   iv)     Public enterprise reform to strengthen infrastructure service delivery.

The prior action in this area was achievement of progress with the legal steps
required to grant administrative autonomy to the Office of the Regulator on matters
related to employment of staff. Reform of telecommunications has been a key priority
for the Government of Samoa, given its status as a small island economy, heavily reliant
on external connections for markets and economic development. As part of a broader
reform process involving liberalization of the telecommunications and postal sectors in
preparation for privatization, the Office of the Regulator was established with regulatory
oversight functions. Since its establishment, the Office of the Regulator set up
interconnection rates, conducted spectrum management, issued licenses, established a
universal access policy, managed ASH cable landing, and prepared a cost-based model
for interconnection rates. Despite these achievements, the OR was constrained by an
inability to hire and retain suitably qualified and skilled staff. A key step in
telecommunication reform was therefore the granting of independence to OR in the
management of its human resources, beyond broader public sector guidelines and policies.
With legal steps towards these reforms in progress, the regulatory environment was
considered appropriate for the privatization of SamoaTel (a telecommunications SOE).
Towards this end, transaction advisors were engaged to outline strategic options, and
guide the Government of Samoa through the transaction process.

                                            5
Two performance indicators were identified in this area. The first was completion of
the transaction for the privatization of SamoaTel within the timetable agreed between the
Government of Samoa and the transaction advisor. The second was that the OR recruits
the technical and legal experts it requires to carry out its functions effectively.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

The PDO and key indicators were not revised during implementation.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The program supported reforms in policy areas most relevant to responding to the
Global Economic Crisis and tsunami. The program focused on: i) effective government
response to the impacts of the global economic crisis and tsunami, given the vital role of
government in maintaining service delivery and providing stimulus to the private sector
to maintain incomes and employment during a devastating series of external shocks, ii)
recovery of the tourism sector, given its importance to the Samoan economy as a source
of foreign exchange, its key role in providing employment opportunities and cash
incomes to Samoans, and the damage sustained to vital assets within the sector during the
tsunami. The ECRSC focused on protecting the vulnerable through emphasizing access to
primary education, given the large risks to incomes and service delivery to poor
households during the period of the economic crisis and subsequent tsunami. The ECRSC
also focused on public financial management reform through: i) improving basic
financial reporting and cash management processes within the Ministry of Finance, given
the importance of sound financial management in supporting good outcomes from
increased public expenditure resulting from the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami
response efforts of government and donors, and ii) strengthening the financial autonomy
and accountability of LTA, given its key role in delivering core components of
reconstruction programs. Finally, the ECRSC focused on public enterprise reform to
strengthen infrastructure service delivery through supporting increased and effectively
regulated private participation in the telecommunications sector, given the importance of
telecommunications service performance to improved resilience to future natural
disasters, local livelihoods of the vulnerable, and broader, long-term economic
development.

The ESCR also supported the identified reform priorities of Government. Objectives
of the ESCR were strongly aligned with the Government of Samoa’s own policy matrix,
as agreed with donors during broader consultations on policy actions to be prioritized
during the economic crisis and tsunami response. Objectives included in the policy
reform matrix of the Government of Samoa and supported by the prior actions for the
ESCR included: i) addressing post-tsunami reconstruction, ii) enhanced economic
contribution of SOEs, iii) targeted support to the most vulnerable members of the
community, and iv) enhanced public financial management.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The operation was selective and strongly aligned to priorities to which the
Government of Samoa was committed. The operation focused on areas that were a
priority for the Government of Samoa. As previously mentioned, the operation was
entirely congruent with actions identified in the Government of Samoa’s own policy
reform matrix and the Strategy for the Development of Samoa. The operation responded

                                             7
to the Government of Samoa’s request for assistance in responding to the economic
impacts of the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami, and focused on key sectors
considered to be of highest priority for economic recovery (especially tourism). The
engagement of the Bank and donor partners also supported the Government in sustaining
a broader reform momentum (in areas not directly linked to immediate recovery) which
could easily have slowed as the Government’s attention was diverted to crisis
management.

Coordinated donor responses allowed Samoa to avoid macroeconomic instability.
Achievement of program objectives could have been undermined by a deeper or more
sustained deterioration in macroeconomic stability in the context of the Global Economic
Crisis and tsunami. Immediate economic stabilization through fiscal stimulus and
reconstruction was only affordable due to the rapid and coordinated actions of major
donors. While actual disbursement from donors appear to have fallen short of
commitments, more than US$50 million of additional grant assistance was provided to
Samoa during FY 2009/10 and FY 2010/11, with highly concessional loans also being
provided. Without this assistance, Samoa is likely to have experienced a far greater
contraction in output, employment, and incomes, with implications for Government
revenues, limiting the plausible extent of recovery operations and maintenance of
services.

The operation focused on areas where the Bank had greater understanding of
context and/or comparative advantage. The operation included only six prior actions,
many of which were in areas where the Bank had existing or planned project engagement.
Examples include: 1) Bank support through the Infrastructure Asset Management
Program to assist in greater natural hazard risk resilience in infrastructure planning; 2)
Bank support through an Emergency Response Credit to support rehabilitation and
reconstruction of tsunami-affected communities; and 3) regulatory advisory support to
the telecommunications sector to support liberalization. Active project engagement in
these sectors allowed the Bank to select realistic and relevant prior actions and
performance measures, and provide necessary support to the Government of Samoa
through dialogue around projects as issues arose.

The Bank worked closely with other donor agencies to define appropriate actions in
other areas. In key sectors where the Bank did not have active project engagement, the
program team drew selectively on analytical work and advice from other donors to ensure
that identified actions were appropriate and addressed key challenges. This approach
allowed the Bank to engage quickly across a broad range of sectors without established
engagements.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The performance indicators were selected well, and reflected the need to minimize
compliance costs on the Government of Samoa in a data-scarce environment and a
crisis context. Performance indicators were adequate to measure progress against the
broad intent of policy reforms included as prior actions. Performance against indicators

                                            8
could be assessed using existing data sources and through dialogue with trusted partners,
and did not require the creation of new information systems or the imposition of
additional reporting requirements in the context of stretched government capacity.

The ongoing monitoring and evaluation activity associated with the program was
undertaken largely through associated Bank projects, and on-going donor programs.
The establishment of a liaison office in Apia (joint with the Asian Development Bank)
improved information flows on developments in Samoa and aided program monitoring.
The choice of monitoring indicators and the above noted modalities of monitoring
allowed the Bank to efficiently utilize limited staff resources. Important among these was
strong Bank engagement in and knowledge of developments in relevant sectors through
associated projects. The Government’s generally strong implementation performance
throughout the duration of the project was an additional positive factor.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Options for follow-up engagement are currently being considered. The current
program is regarded as a success by both the Bank and the Government of Samoa. In the
context of deepened engagement facilitated through the ESRSC and a general preference
for movements towards budget support modalities being expressed by the Government of
Samoa, options for similar future engagement are being considered. Important
considerations for the Government of Samoa include the financing terms of any future
assistance and the overall sustainability of its debt position over the medium-term.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

Design reflected uncertainties of the post-crisis context and avoided overstretching
the capacity of Government. This operation was implemented at a time when Samoa
was dealing with both the most severe economic shock of the past two decades, and the
most devastating natural disaster to have struck the nation since independence. The extent
and duration of the Global Economic Crisis remained unclear. The project team identified
the clear risk of overstretching government reform capacity in a context where
emergency relief and maintenance of service delivery remained the priority. While the
Government of Samoa managed to meet both immediate recovery needs and maintain
progress with its broader reform agenda, this outcome was not assured at the time of
implementation. The modest ambition of prior actions and performance indicators
included in project design ensured that attention would remain focused on key reforms
while also keeping compliance costs associated with negotiating, implementing, and
monitoring the program low, and targets achievable. In retrospect, slightly more
ambitious reform objectives may have been able to be supported through the program,
but a careful approach was warranted in the context of substantial uncertainty.


                                            9
There was strong alignment between the program objectives, the current priorities
of the Government of Samoa, and the pillars of the Regional Engagement
Framework for Pacific Island Countries. As discussed above, the program objectives
were fully congruent with reform priorities included in the Government of Samoa’s own
policy reform matrix and in the Strategy for the Development of Samoa. The program
actions also directly addressed the most significant challenges facing Samoa in the
context of the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami – specifically, ensuring fiscal
stimulus and adequate resourcing for reconstruction efforts, ensuring the protection of the
vulnerable, improving public financial management systems (particularly in
infrastructure) to ensure good use of resources allocated to reconstruction, and continued
progress with broader reforms in the telecommunications sector to enable a resumption of
strong growth performance over the medium-term. The program objectives also reflected
the contents of the World Bank’s Regional Engagement Framework for the Pacific
Islands, which emphasizes: 1) strengthening government capabilities to deliver services;
and 2) improving the incentives for private sector growth and employment.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Achievement of PDOs

Rating: Satisfactory

The satisfactory rating for the overall achievement of PDOs reflects strong
performance against all DPOs. Four DPO areas were included in this program. Ratings
of ‘highly satisfactory’ have been given against two of the areas, and a ‘satisfactory’
rating has been given against the other two. Reflecting the uncertain economic context
during implementation, the ambition of policy actions and outcomes included as prior
actions and performance indicators was appropriately limited. Specified actions have,
nevertheless, all been either achieved or exceeded. Samoa has made very substantive
progress in tsunami recovery and reconstruction, while protecting macroeconomic
stability, and without losing focus or momentum across a broader range of reforms in
public financial management and SOE reform.

Economic Recovery from the Impact of the Global Economy Crisis and the Tsunami

Rating: Satisfactory

The highly satisfactory rating in this area is based on the strong contributions of the prior
actions towards facilitating economic recovery, and strong ongoing performance against
the outcome indicators specified in the program documents.

Two prior actions and two performance indicators were specified in this area. Prior
actions in this area are: 1) approval of a supplementary budget to finance the costed and
prioritized expenditures of the Emergency Reconstruction Plan; and 2) provision of a
credit line to tourism operators affected by the tsunami in accordance with the
Memorandum of Understanding entered into between the Development Bank of Samoa

                                             10
and the Central Bank of Samoa. Performance indicators in this area are: 1) Progress in
reconstruction and rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and housing; and 2) tourism
arrivals and earnings begin to rise towards pre-crisis levels.

The 2009 supplementary budget provided a vital economic stimulus and source of
financing for reconstruction. The Global Economic Crisis led to a 5.2% contraction of
Samoa’s economy in 2008/09, with collapsing remittances and declines in tourism and
manufacturing. Even with pressure on revenues, the Government made a deliberate
choice to move to an expansionary fiscal position in order to provide a vital stimulus to
the economy, and support incomes and livelihoods. The post-tsunami supplementary
budget further increased spending, and refocused already-planned expenditure on tsunami
recovery priorities. Prudent fiscal management over the previous fifteen years ensured a
positive response from donors in providing highly concessional loans and grants, and
meant that there was fiscal space for the Government of Samoa to increase its external
debt to finance reconstruction expenditure. Stimulus has been effective in stabilizing
growth and revenues, with GDP declining by just 0.2% in 2009/10, and expected to grow
by 2.8% in 2010/11. Government is now moving to normalize its fiscal stance faster than
expected, with the fiscal deficit expected to decline to around 5-6% of GDP in FY
2011/12, and is likely to be able to stabilize debt levels within its medium-term target of
40% of GDP. Stabilizing debt at this level would provide room to absorb future external
shocks.

Tourism operators have benefited from the credit line provided through the
Development Bank of Samoa. Of the SAT5 million allocated by the Central Bank of
Samoa to the Development Bank of Samoa credit facility, SAT4.4 million has so far been
disbursed, with an additional SAT0.9 million project currently in the pipeline. Nineteen
projects (of a total estimated 54 operators impacted by the tsunami) have been supported
across eleven villages, with loans being disbursed between April 2010 and March 2011.
Individual loans have ranged in value from SAT3,000 to SAT2.3 million. As most
projects are still within the grace period, information does not yet exist to assess the
repayment performance of individual projects. Neither the Development Bank of Samoa,
nor the Samoan Tourism Authority, foresee any problems in operators meeting
repayments. While some informal fale operators have found interest rates and compliance
requirements under the scheme prohibitive, and reconstruction of small-scale fale
operations has lagged in comparison to more commercial operations, the authorities
generally consider the scheme to have been a success. The scheme is considered to have
fitted well within the broader program of support offered by the Government of Samoa
and development partners, providing support to medium-sized tourism operators in
addition to the grants scheme for small operators (typically providing basic, beach fale
accommodation) and interest subsidy for larger commercial operators provided by NZAP.
The Samoan Tourism Authority currently estimates that 90% of tourism infrastructure
affected by the tsunami has now been reconstructed, and reports no capacity constraints
across the sector. Reconstruction efforts are also considered to have brought some
broader benefits in terms of encouraging formalization and increased resilience to future
disasters due to eligibility requirements under assistance schemes.



                                            11
Substantial progress has been made in reconstruction and rehabilitation of
damaged housing and infrastructure. The tsunami destroyed 502 homes and inflicted
severe but reparable damage to a further 360. The Government of Samoa approved a
scheme for replacement of destroyed homes using a standard design that provided for
cyclone resistant structure, including sanitation facilities and a water tank. Supplies for
reconstruction of all 502 destroyed and 360 damaged homes have now been distributed,
and around 95% of distributed supplies have so far been utilized. Delays and unevenness
in providing water-tanks and distributing reconstruction kits has been a cause of
complaint in some areas. Electricity was rapidly restored to affected regions. Progress in
restoring water supplies to inland relocated communicates has been slower, due to
capacity constraints and the need to identify a new water source, but progress with
reconnections is now accelerating. Restoration of former road transport services has been
completed. Six new access roads, stretching more than 20 kilometers, have been
completed, allowing the establishment of communities in inland areas, away from
tsunami risk. Progress on the construction of one of two new inland arterial routes is
underway, with the LTA expected to let the contract for construction within the next few
months.

Tourism numbers have begun to rise, but have not yet reached pre-tsunami levels.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, tourism arrivals exceeded arrivals for the same quarter
in 2009 by 13%. Early indications suggest that this increase has been sustained through
early months of the 2011 year, with January arrivals up by around 3%. Tourism receipts
followed a similar pattern. Tourist arrivals and receipts remained slightly below pre-
tsunami levels throughout 2010. But with no reports of capacity constraints and 90% of
affected tourism infrastructure reconstructed, continued low numbers may also reflect
continued poor economic conditions in major tourist markets, including New Zealand and
the United States.

Protecting the Vulnerable

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

                                             12
The highly satisfactory rating in this area is based on thorough and sustained
implementation of the prior action and accompanying measures, and the effectiveness of
the prior action in achieving improvements against the performance indicator.

One prior action and one performance indicator were specified in this area. The
prior action was the waiver of school fees at all public, special, and missionary schools,
in order to maintain and broaden access to primary education during a period of declining
incomes for many households. The performance indicator was maintenance of primary
enrolment rates.

The Ministry of Education, Sports & Culture working with donor partners, has
successfully implemented the Samoa School Fees Grant Scheme (SFGS) and
accompanying measures, contributing to an increase in primary enrolment. Primary
school enrolment fees were waived in public (government and village), special needs, and
mission schools from FY 2010/11, with WST100 per student provided to every primary
school by the Government of Samoa using donor financial support. Alongside the
provision of additional donor and Government financing to primary schools, efforts were
mobilized to improve financial management and accounting practices within schools. A
team of six technical advisors has been hired by the Ministry of Education, Sports &
Culture to assist schools in these areas, and visits most schools on a monthly basis to
ensure compliance with accounting and reporting requirements. The team provides
quarterly reports on compliance to the Education Advisory Committee, comprising
Government officials and donors with oversight of education sector issues. Technical
advisors report a steady improvement in the quality of financial management and
compliance. Survey evidence shows increasing acceptance of the scheme by principals
and school committees, despite initial concerns about loss of financial control. The
Ministry of Education, Sports & Culture has also established a database to track progress
of all students through the education system, which provides a valuable tool for assessing
trends and changes in enrolment. An estimated 550 children were not enrolled in primary
school at the time of program implementation. The Ministry of Education, Sports &
Culture currently estimates non-enrolment at slightly lower levels. While the SFGS has
been an important factor in maintaining enrolment levels during the economic crisis and
tsunami, the Ministry of Education, Sports & Culture notes that additional barriers – such
as inadequate transport links – continue to constrain enrolment in some areas.

Public Financial Management Reform

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Highly Satisfactory rating reflects the broad maintenance of progress around prior
actions and consolidation of efforts to improve the timeliness of reporting, and full
achievement against the specified performance indicators, including strong performance
and adequate financial reporting from LTA.

Two prior actions and three performance indicators were specified in this area.
Prior actions in this area are: 1) finalization of all pending audits of the public accounts

                                              13
and submission of the accounts for FY 2006/07, FY 2007/08, and FY 2008/09 to the
audit office; and 2) taking satisfactory steps to make operational the financial autonomy
of the Land Transport Authority. The performance indicators in this area are: 1)
consolidation of mechanisms to prevent delays in the preparation of public accounts, to
ensure that the FY 2009/10 public accounts were submitted within four months of the end
of the financial year; 2) consolidation of new systems for management of cash-flows,
with the cash management committee continuing to monitor the cash-flow and conduct
reconciliations on a weekly basis; and 3) timely submission of quarterly reports by the
LTA during FY 2009/2010.

Improvements in processes for the preparation of public accounts have led to timely
delivery of reports to the audit office. Public accounts have remained up-to-date, and
annual accounts for FY 2009/10 were submitted to the audit office in October 2010, well
within the specified four-month timeframe. The complete audit process, however, is still
taking longer due to many audit queries and adjustments required to the draft public
accounts before an audit opinion can be issued. The causes of these delays should be
addressed through ongoing PFM reforms. Several new disclosures were included in the
FY 2009/10 accounts, largely relating to tsunami response related expenditures. The
Accounts and Reporting division of the Ministry of Finance considers recent
improvements in processes to have been consolidated. These improvements have
occurred in the context of broad continuing efforts in the field of PFM reform. The
Ministry of Finance is now considering further improvements and reforms to PFM
systems under Phase II of the Public Financial Management Reform Plan, based on the
Government of Samoa’s second PEFA assessment, carried out in 2010. Priorities include:
1) expanding the scope and coverage of audits; 2) moving towards use of international
standards in reporting; 3) delegating greater accounting responsibilities to line ministries;
4) strengthened budgeting through the inclusion of development partner funding in
budget estimates, and increased stakeholder consultation on budget priorities; 5)
establishment of a procurement unit to provide training and support to line ministries on
new government guidelines, and 6) introduction and implementation of a new Debt
Management Strategy and Aid Cooperation Policy.

Cash management systems have been improved, and the cash management
committee has continued to play an oversight role. Improved cash reconciliation
processes, following several years of delays arising from a major system change and
subsequent capacity gaps, have played an important role in strengthened reporting.
Technical assistance has strengthened capacity and allowed substantial reductions in
delays, and cash reconciliations are now carried out on a monthly basis for the vast
majority of Government accounts. The main treasury account is now reconciled on a
daily basis. While some small accounts, including those administered overseas by high
commissions, are reconciled less regularly, these hold only around SAT2.5 million. The
Ministry of Finance is working closely with the Central Bank of Samoa to improve
reconciliation processes for these small accounts. Prudent management has seen the
Government of Samoa strengthen its cash position throughout the post-tsunami period,
and cash reserves are currently exceed SAT170 million. As a result, the cash
management committee has ceased meeting on a weekly basis, and now convenes on an

                                             14
issues basis, with the ACEO of the Accounts and Reporting Division circulating a weekly
email to committee members to flag any upcoming issues or problems. A cash
forecasting model has been developed and is being operated by the Accounts and
Reporting Division.

Financial autonomy of the LTA has been maintained, and it has continued to meet
accountability requirements through timely submission of reports. Established in
June 2008, faced early challenges in implementing a large component of post-tsunami
reconstruction activity. The LTA is broadly considered to be performing strongly, and
has successfully delivered on its reconstruction commitments in the field of road
rehabilitation (as discussed above). The LTA has submitted quarterly reports on time to
the SOE monitoring division within the Ministry of Finance, and these have been judged
to fully comply with content requirements. There has been some delay in the delivery of
annual audited reports due to continuing issues arising from the separation of LTA from
the Ministry of Works, Transport, and Infrastructure. While draft annual reports have
been submitted, these cannot be finalized until the Attorney General approves the transfer
of MWTI assets to LTA books. This is expected to occur by the end of May 2011,
allowing submission of audited annual reports. More generally, the SOE Monitoring
division reports substantial improvements in enforcement and infrastructure delivery
since the separation, and considers the separation to have run smoothly.

Public Enterprise Reform to Strengthen Infrastructure Service Delivery

Rating: Satisfactory

The satisfactory rating reflects sustained maintenance of progress around the prior action,
and slightly delayed success in achievement of the performance indicator.

One prior action and two performance indicators were specified in this area. The
prior action in this area was issuance of instructions to proceed with the legal steps
required to grant administrative autonomy to the Office of the Regulator on matters
relating to the employment of staff. The performance indicators were: 1) privatization of
SamoaTel proceeding according to the schedule agreed between the transaction advisor
and the Government of Samoa, and 2) the Office of the Regulator recruits the technical
and legal experts it requires to carry out its functions effectively.

Instructions were issued to proceed with the legal steps required for the Office of the
Regulator to be issued full operational autonomy. Amendments to the Telecom Act
2005 were drafted by the Office of the Utility Regulator based on the cabinet directive
issued May 2009 approving the introduction of staff recruitment processes separate from
the Public Service Commission processes. The Attorney General's Office, however,
rejected the amendments on the basis that they were inconsistent with the original cabinet
directive. The Office of the Regulator is now preparing another Cabinet paper seeking
approval for required amendments to the Act. As a result, while the Office of the
Regulator is exempt from general payroll controls, recruitment processes are likely to
remain subject to Public Service Commission processes for several months until

                                            15
necessary legislative amendments can be processed. The Ministry of Finance and the
World Bank’s telecommunications project team report that the Office of the Regulator’s
capacity within the telecommunication sector has substantially strengthened through
hiring and training specialists in the fields of spectrum management, interconnection, and
laws and regulation. The next challenge for the office is to build capacity in new areas of
responsibility relating to broadcasting, postal services, electricity, and water.

The transaction for SamoaTel was completed following several largely unavoidable
delays. The privatization of SamoaTel was successfully completed at the end of March,
2011, with 75% of shares sold to AST Blue Sky, and 25% sold to the Unit Trust of
Samoa. Already repeatedly delayed, the initial timeline agreed between the Government
of Samoa and the transaction advisor specified late 2010 as the target date for
privatization. This deadline was missed, and the transaction delayed by a further three
months. There were several reasons for this continued delay, including: 1) illness and
absence of the leader of the team of transaction advisors providing advice and support to
the Government of Samoa; 2) requests for additional information from the utility arising
from bidders; and 3) the subsequent lapse in gaining cabinet approval of the transaction
prior to the dissolution of parliament during the elections, requiring further delay until the
formation of a new government. These delays were largely beyond the control of the
Government of Samoa, but have led to a Satisfactory, rather than Highly Satisfactory,
rating against this DPO area. Aside from the delays, the transaction is broadly considered
a success. The negotiated transaction represents a fair deal for the Government of Samoa,
in terms of the final sale price, at a time when global appetite for investment in the
telecommunication sector was at a low. Blue Sky is a telecommunications business (not
only a financial investor) and will contribute to the re-invention of SamoaTel to face
competition and seize new opportunities that the undersea cable, and future regional
connectivity projects, will offer. Increased competition arising from the privatization in
the context of an adequately independent and capable regulator is expected to lead to
improved telecommunications services and lower costs over the medium-term.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Satisfactory outcome reflects a Satisfactory rating against relevance of
the DPOs objectives, design, and implementation, and a Satisfactory rating against
achievement of program development objectives. The program was designed to
provide immediate assistance to the Government of Samoa in the context of a major
economic contraction and natural disaster. The policy actions supported through the
program were intended to align with the Government of Samoa’s immediate economic
recovery and tsunami reconstruction priorities, while maintaining a focus on important
medium-term structural and PFM reforms. Reconstruction and rehabilitation operations
in infrastructure, housing, and tourism, are widely considered to have been successful,
and the policy actions in this area were unambiguously achieved. Moreover, the
Government of Samoa, even while dealing with the impacts of the Global Economic
Crisis and tsunami, has maintained momentum with its broader reform agenda, achieving

                                             16
substantial gains against policy actions in the areas of improved Public Financial
Management and reform of public enterprises. In retrospect, a more ambitious series of
policy actions could have been supported through this program, achieving greater
additional benefits from Bank engagement and support. Uncertainties at the time of
implementation – including those regarding the duration and extent of the Global
Economic Crisis, and the extent of challenges arising from tsunami reconstruction –
mean that the modest scope of program objectives was appropriate.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There is a limited knowledge base for tracking distributional outcomes in Samoa,
but some indicators suggest a deepening of basic needs poverty and inequality over
recent years. The policy actions supported by the program have almost certainly
reduced poverty in Samoa. The recovery in economic growth and maintenance of public
services financed supported through fiscal stimulus has benefitted the poor.
Reconstruction and rehabilitation following the tsunami benefited many rural
communities reliant on tourism for cash incomes. The waiver of primary school fees has
reduced pressure on poor households. In broader terms, however, the Government of
Samoa and donor partners have expressed concerns regarding more general increases in
inequality and deepening poverty (reflected in increases in Gini coefficient and basic
needs poverty incidence during the 2008 HIES), resulting from the exposure of poor
households to external price shocks in the absence of adequate formal social protection
systems, and exclusion of some rural households from employment and income
opportunities arising from growth in the commercial tourism sector. Improving
information about the incidence, distribution, and causes of poverty remains a priority.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Most policy actions supported through the program contributed to strengthening of
Samoa’s institutions. While reflecting immediate economic stimulus and tsunami
response needs, the policy actions supported by the program also involved sustainable
strengthening of institutions to deliver benefits over the medium- and long-term.
Technical assistance provided to schools in support of the School Fees Grant Scheme is
already reported to have had a positive impact on the financial management and
accounting practices of primary schools. Substantial institutional improvements have
already been made through the Public Financial Management Strengthening Program
within the Ministry of Finance, and these gains are expected to be entrenched and built on
as the program enters its second phase. The program also provided support to policy
actions that have demonstrably strengthened the Land Transport Authority, and the
Office of the Regulator through changes to institutional arrangements and associated
technical assistance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

The rating of Low risk to development outcomes reflects: 1) the once-off and non-
reversible nature of some of the policy actions around tsunami reconstruction and
rehabilitation, 2) improvements in macroeconomic conditions and outlook since the
implementation of the program, and 3) the Government of Samoa’s continued
commitment to maintaining the momentum of its reform agenda.

Several policy actions supported through this program were of a once-off and non-
reversible nature. Rehabilitating of tourism, transport, and housing infrastructure in
tsunami affected areas has now largely been achieved. Benefits from reconstruction have
already been felt, especially through the removal of supply constraints in the tourism
sector. Integration of increased disaster resilience in rehabilitation plans, designs, and
construction has been thorough and consistent. Gains from the reconstruction of
infrastructure are unlikely to be reversed. Similarly, the institutional reforms of the Land
Transport Authority and the Office of the Regulator, and the privatization of SamoaTel,
are broadly considered to have been successful and now entrenched.

The macroeconomic context and outlook has improved. Fiscal stimulus was
successful in stabilizing output and employment in the context of collapsing tourism and
remittance receipts. This stimulus was sustainably managed. While the debt position has
deteriorated, debt remains at manageable levels, with some remaining room to deal with
future shocks. Strong donor support has seen Samoa remain on track to achieve its debt
target of 40% of GDP over the medium-term, and the FY 2011/12 budget is expected to
include movements towards sooner-than-expected normalization of the fiscal stance. The
economy is projected to grow by around 2.8% in 2010/11, due to the impact of
reconstruction activity, and continue to grow modestly in FY 2011/12. Tourism is
recovering strongly, although not yet at pre-crisis levels. Remittances continue to be
negatively impacted by global economic conditions, and inflationary pressures arising
from rebounding commodity fuel prices pose downside risks. Overall, while remaining
subject to volatility and changes in global conditions, Samoa seems to have weathered the
worst impacts of the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami.

The Government of Samoa remains committed to maintaining reform momentum.
Throughout the challenges of the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami, the Government
of Samoa has continued to progress a broad reform agenda across Public Financial

                                             18
Management, business environment, public service delivery, and SOEs. Achievement of
policy actions in these areas during the program suggests continued commitment to
maintaining existing reform momentum. Benefits arising from reform of LTA are clear
and recognized by the Government of Samoa, and privatization of SamoaTel is likely to
produce additional benefits through improved performance and competition in the
telecommunications sector. The School Fees Grant Scheme enjoys broad support from
the Ministry of Education Sports & Culture, schools, and the general public, and the
Government of Samoa has reiterated its commitment to taking on a greater proportion of
the costs of the scheme over coming years.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Satisfactory rating reflects the Banks choice of an appropriate instrument,
appropriate balance between support to immediate and medium-term policy objectives,
and the program’s strong alignment with broader priorities of the Government of Samoa,
donor partners, and the World Bank.

The use of a single-tranche ECRSC reflected the need for a timely, effective
response to the impacts of the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami. This instrument
assisted the Government of Samoa in its timely response to the crisis while supporting
policy dialogue, and specific key policy reforms. Given the immediate financing
challenges facing the Government, and the urgency of the situation, this choice of
instrument appears appropriate.

Policy actions supported through the program achieved an appropriate balance
between short and longer-term priorities. While two policy actions focused on
immediate tsunami response, a longer-term perspective was also reflected in design.
While contributing to meeting immediate challenges, there was a clear intent to maintain
focus on underlying reforms that would both support the effectiveness of the tsunami
response (for example, reforms in the LTA and broader PFM systems), and serve the
longer-term development priorities for Samoa (such as privatization of SamoaTel).

The program reflected strong alignment with the priorities of the Government of
Samoa, donor partners, and the Bank. The program objectives were fully congruent
with reform priorities included in the Government of Samoa’s own policy reform matrix,
as previously agreed with donor partners, and in the Strategy for the Development of
Samoa. The program objectives also reflected the contents of the World Bank’s Regional
Engagement Framework for the Pacific.



                                           19
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Formal monitoring and evaluation processes were limited, but appropriate
performance indicators were selected and the Bank maintained fairly good
knowledge of progress against policy actions. A formal monitoring and evaluation
process was not set up. Instead, the Bank relied on knowledge gained from project work
within specific sectors to maintain a broad understanding of progress and constraints.
With strong performance on behalf of the Government of Samoa, this approach appears
to have been appropriate. But greater attention to monitoring and evaluation through the
duration of the program may have led to greater awareness of serious issues were they to
have emerged. However, it can be argued that the approach was appropriate also in light
of limited staff resources, and the fact that information flows improved considerably with
the establishment of a joint Bank-ADB liaison office in Samoa. Further given that other
countries in the region, with lower capacity than Samoa, were also facing economic
crises, the Bank’s allocation of its staff resources was efficient. Performance indicators
selected against prior action were appropriate and useful.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Satisfactory rating reflects Satisfactory performance against ensuring
quality at entry, and Satisfactory performance against quality of supervision. The
ECRSC was an appropriate instrument, and supported policy actions reflected a balance
between immediate and medium-term priorities. The program achieved strong alignment
with broader priorities of the Government of Samoa, donor partners, and the World Bank.
Performance indicators were selected to keep compliance costs low, while providing
good information regarding overall reform progress. Limited resources were devoted to
monitoring of ongoing progress, which may have led to delays in Bank response if major
problems were to have emerged.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

In the context of the Global Economic Crisis and the aftermath of a severe natural
disaster, the Government of Samoa remained committed to specified policy actions
and achieved good outcomes against all performance indicators. Any implementation
delays to policy actions supported by the program were largely due to circumstances
beyond the control of the Government of Samoa. The overall policy response to the
economic crisis and tsunami was well-coordinated and prudent. Reconstruction and
rehabilitation activity provided a pro-poor fiscal stimulus, with medium-term benefits.
With the worst of the crisis now passed and much reconstruction and rehabilitation
                                           20
activity completed, the Government of Samoa taking appropriate steps to normalize its
fiscal stance, protecting ongoing macroeconomic stability. Throughout the crisis,
momentum in key reform areas – including strengthening Public Financial Management,
liberalizing telecommunications, and increasing access to basic services – was
maintained, with the Government of Samoa already building an ongoing reform agenda
around the gains achieved through policy actions supported under the program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Most agencies performed strongly in implementing policy actions supported by the
program. The Disaster Management Office is generally regarded to have performed
strongly in coordinating immediate post-crisis humanitarian assistance, and providing
ongoing assistance to affected communities in improved disaster resilience and awareness.
The newly-established LTA has delivered against its reconstruction responsibilities in the
context of ongoing institutional change. Despite delays and some ongoing challenges,
substantial progress has been made by the power and water utilities in restoring service to
affected areas. Under leadership from the Samoan Tourism Authority, reconstruction and
rehabilitation of key tourism infrastructure is well underway, and capacity is no longer
constraining tourism arrivals. The Ministry of Education, Sports & Culture has
successfully implemented the School Fee Grants Scheme and taken additional steps to
ensure that its impacts are maximized and can be evaluated, including the development of
the unified database to track student progress. The Ministry of Finance has supported
sound macro-fiscal management throughout the crisis and tsunami response, while
progressing a broad range of structural reforms. Capacity within the Office of the
Regulator has been strengthened, with the institution taking necessary steps to adequately
perform in its expanding roles.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The overall Highly Satisfactory reflects the Government of Samoa’s success in
maintaining macroeconomic stability and laying the foundations for economic recovery
under very challenging circumstances.

6. Lessons Learned

The program demonstrated the potential for increased use of budget support
modalities in Samoa. The program was successful in achieving important development
objectives, despite low monitoring effort and limited Bank engagement in ongoing policy
dialogue around program implementation. This largely reflects the extent to which the
Government of Samoa was committed to progressing its own reform and rehabilitation
agenda, even under very challenging circumstances of the Global Economic Crisis and
tsunami. The Government of Samoa is currently encouraging major donors to pursue

                                           21
increased use of budget support modalities. The outcomes of the program suggest that
risks associated with such approaches are manageable in the Samoan context.

Close coordination and engagement with other donors in the identification of policy
priorities is a useful approach in sectors where the Bank has limited knowledge and
engagement. In the Pacific Island Countries, the Bank does not have sufficient presence
to maintain in-depth knowledge of all sectors across all countries. In key sectors where
the Bank did not have active project or policy engagement, the program team drew
selectively on analytical work and advice from other involved donors to ensure that
identified actions were appropriate and addressed key challenges. In the context of
substantial time pressure, this approach proved effective in allowing the Bank to quickly
build its knowledge and reach judgments regarding policy priorities across a broad range
of sectors where previous engagement had been limited. The success of this approach
may suggest that it can be duplicated in the design of budget support operations for other
small Pacific Island Countries.

Development policy operations can be quickly mobilized and achieve good results in
the context of strong reform momentum. With the Government’s strong ownership of
a broad on-going reform agenda the Bank was able to identify substantive and realistic
policy actions to support through the program within short timeframes. Rather than
starting from a blank slate, the Bank was able to pursue a policy dialogue on a range of
actions that were already part of the government’s reform agenda. While there was
sufficient commitment to undertake reforms, the Bank’s engagement provided
momentum at a time when the reform agenda could have gone off-track due to the
challenges posed to government capacity in managing the crises.

Project-level engagement can assist in identifying key priorities to be supported
through policy operations. Prior project engagement provided a vital foundation for
design, implementation, and monitoring of the program. Through project engagement, the
Bank was able to identify key policy reforms that could drive further progress in
important sectors, including around the LTA and telecommunications. Support to
institutions where the Bank had project engagement allowed assistance to be provided in
implementing reforms, and progress to be closely tracked. This leveraging of project
engagements for policy programs could be duplicated in any future budget support
operation in Samoa, or replicated in other small Pacific Island Countries where the Bank
may not have wide-ranging policy dialogue.

Coordinated management of international aid flows, in the context of prudent fiscal
policy, can provide vital support in mitigating impacts of external shocks in small
Pacific states. Without the international support provided to Samoa in responding to the
Global Economic Crisis and the tsunami, the impacts of both would almost certainly have
been more extensive and longer lasting. Donor assistance played a vital role in financing
coordinated fiscal stimulus, supporting recovery in employment, services, and incomes,
while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The importance of coordination between
macroeconomic policy and donor flows in managing these economic shocks, and the
strong role played by local agencies with responsibility for aid coordination, may provide

                                            22
broader lessons for other small Pacific countries facing relatively frequent external
economic shocks.

Improved knowledge and data is required to track the impact of reforms on the
extent and distribution of poverty in Samoa. There is a high degree of confidence
among the Government of Samoa and donors that the program and broader policy
response to the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami has positive impacts on the poor.
There is, however, a limited evidence base to support this. Improved and more up-to-date
information regarding the extent, nature, and causes of poverty in Samoa would provide a
valuable input to ongoing policy dialogue between the Government of Samoa and donors,
and allow increased consideration of poverty impacts in design and implementation of
future programs.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Government of Samoa considers that the program has been successful. The
Ministry of Finance generally considers that donor assistance had played an
indispensable role in supporting Samoa through the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami
response. Without such assistance, the impacts of the economic crisis would have been
more severe, and far less would have been able to be achieved in reconstruction and
rehabilitation following the Tsunami.

The Government of Samoa considers that the Bank took an appropriate approach
to the provision of assistance. The Government of Samoa considers that prior actions
and performance indicators selected by the World Bank to support through the operation
were appropriate to the context, and reflected adequate consideration of the challenging
economic and disaster-management context. The Bank’s ability to quickly design and
implement an operation, and disburse funds on a timely basis was appreciated by the
authorities.

The Government of Samoa believes that some opportunities for improved
coordination in Tsunami response may have been missed. The Ministry of Education,
Sports & Culture believes that the education-related policy actions supported by the
program have been highly successful, but consider that scope existed for improved
coordination between sectors during reconstruction and rehabilitation. For example,
transport infrastructure needs for improving education access could have been more
strongly reflected in plans for road reconstruction.

Comments received from Government of Samoa by email on 21st June, 2011:

Please find in the attached our comments on the Completion report of the WB Emergency
response mechanism.

The Government of Samoa considers that the program has been successful. The Ministry of
Finance generally acknowledges that donor assistance had played an important role in supporting
Samoa through the Global Economic Crisis and tsunami response. Without such assistance, the
impacts of the economic crisis would have been more severe, and far less would have been able
to be achieved in reconstruction and rehabilitation following the Tsunami within the first year of
the Recovery Plan.

The Government of Samoa considers that the Bank took an appropriate approach to the provision
of assistance. The Government of Samoa considers that prior actions and performance indicators
selected by the World Bank to support through the operation, were appropriate to the context, and
reflected adequate consideration of the challenging economic and disaster-management context.
The Bank’s ability to quickly design and implement an operation, and disburse funds on a timely
basis was appreciated by the authorities.

The Government of Samoa believes that some opportunities for improved coordination in
Tsunami response may have been missed. The Ministry of Education, Sports & Culture believes
that the education-related policy actions supported by the program have been highly successful,
but consider that scope existed for improved coordination between some sectors during
reconstruction and rehabilitation. For example, transport infrastructure needs for improving
education access could have been more strongly reflected in plans for road reconstruction.

The Government considers the use of a policy action matrix to serve as triggers for budget
support as an advantage and is interested to ascertain from the Bank what other more ‘ambitious’
reform activities could have been supported under the program.

The Government notes the approach taken by the Bank in finding out the scope of
implementation in sectors it was not engaged in through existing donors programs; however it
also wishes to inform the Bank that the aid coordination mechanism of the country is robust and
cross sectoral and was in a position to provide the information as desired.
