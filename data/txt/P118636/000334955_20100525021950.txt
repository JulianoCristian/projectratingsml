                    CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

Borrower       Independent State of Samoa (GoS)
Implementing   Ministry of Finance
Agency
Financial      IDA Credit from the Crisis Response Window Pilot Program
Data           Standard IDA terms; Amount: SDR 13.2 million (US$20 million equivalent)
Operation      The proposed operation is a stand-alone Development Policy Credit (DPC),
Type           which consists of a single tranche SDR 13.2 million (US$20 million
               equivalent) to be disbursed upon project effectiveness date.
Main Policy    Policy areas the proposed operation will support include: (i) economic recovery
Areas          from the impacts of the global financial crisis and the tsunami; (ii) protecting
               the vulnerable; (iii) public financial management reform; and (iv) public
               enterprise reform to strengthen infrastructure service delivery to support
               medium term recovery.
Key Outcome    Expected outcomes under the operation include: (i) recovery of the tourism
Indicators     sector with support from a credit line facility in combination with other
               programs; (ii) maintenance of primary school enrollment in a time of crisis
               through a school fee waiver scheme; (iii) successful implementation of
               reconstruction projects through adequate provision and disbursement of
               budgetary funds; (iv) public accounts are compiled and submitted in a timely
               manner; (v) strengthened delivery of key infrastructure services by the Land
               Transport Authority; and (vi) progress on telecommunication reform and
               achievement of key milestones in the privatization process.
Program        The Samoan economy suffered a major external shock from the global
Development    economic crisis and its prospects of a quick recovery were virtually eliminated
Objectives     by the tsunami. The main development objective of the proposed operation is
and            to support the GoS' efforts to counter the impacts of these crises and facilitate
Contribution   medium term recovery. Even in these challenging circumstances, the
to CAS         government has stayed broadly on-track with its reform agenda, largely
               articulated in the Strategy for the Development of Samoa. The policy actions
               included in this operation will help maintain the reform momentum, while at
               the same time supporting the government's economic recovery measures.

               The proposed DPC is consistent with the Bank's overall strategy for Samoa and
               the Pacific Islands more broadly.         The Pacific Regional Engagement
               Framework (REF) is based around the twin pillars of: (i)  strengthening
               government capabilities to deliver services, and (ii)  improving the incentives
               for private sector led growth and employment. The REF highlights the
               susceptibility of the Pacific Island countries to natural disasters, and the
               important role for the Bank in disaster risk reduction as well as responding to
               reconstruction needs following such disasters.

                The Bank Group is currently in the early stages of preparing a new strategy for
                the Pacific region. The starting point for the new strategy is recognition of the
                systemic vulnerability and volatility of the small and remote Pacific island
                countries. Key themes for structuring Bank Group engagement are: (i) 
                generating new opportunities for Pacific islanders from greater global and
                regional integration, and (ii) building resilience to shocks. Supporting this, the
                Bank Group is significantly scaling up the advisory and financial services it is
                able to provide to the Pacific Islands.
Risk and Risk   The main risks of this operation and their associated mitigation measures are as
Mitigation      follows:
                Delayed fiscal consolidation. The fiscal cost of dealing with the impact of the
                global economic crisis is very large and has been exacerbated by the recent
                tsunami. The deficit for FY2009/10 is projected to be some 10 percent of GDP.
                The risk is that the needed fiscal consolidation, i.e., return to the government's
                target of 3 percent of GDP, may be delayed. The concessional resources
                provided through this operation will be a welcome cushion in the government's
                strained fiscal situation. The government's continued commitment to making
                progress on its medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) and public
                financial management (PFM) reforms should also help mitigate this risk. The
                recent IMF Article IV consultations and the joint debt sustainability analysis
                (DSA) have also provided analytical inputs to inform the government's fiscal
                consolidation efforts.
                A weaker than anticipated global recovery. A deeper or longer downturn than
                anticipated in the current global context represents a risk, contingent on
                developments in partner country economies such as Australia, New Zealand
                and the US who are key to the flow of tourists as well as remittances into
                Samoa. One mitigation strategy is to ensure the rapid recovery of Samoa's
                critical tourism sector, which has been supported by the proposed operation. A
                further mitigation strategy is to continue the implementation of reforms that
                encourage private sector development, including through better infrastructure
                and more efficient telecommunications. The GoS has shown commitment to
                making progress in these areas some of which are also supported under the
                current operation.
                Capacity constraints of the government. Public sector capacity constraints are
                typical in a small, remote island economy such as Samoa. The global economic
                crisis has stretched the GoS' capacity for reform efforts and placed greater
                demands on service delivery, a situation exacerbated by the recent tsunami.
                The risk is mitigated through the coordinated approach taken by the Bank and
                other donors to support the government-led recovery framework. This will
                provide both technical and financial assistance to the government while at the
                same time minimizing transaction costs of engagement.

                      IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR
          A PROPOSED ECONOMIC CRISIS RECOVERY SUPPORT CREDIT
                  TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF SAMOA
 

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.       The proposed operation will assist Samoa to recover from the impact of the global
economic crisis, while helping it to sustain its reform momentum. The global economic
crisis, coming on the back of the global food and fuel crisis, hit Samoa hard in FY2008/09.
Samoa's GDP contracted some 5 percent, the worst slump in two decades. The damaging impact
on economic activity and fiscal balances has continued well into FY2009/10, with Samoa's
ability to recover quickly from the global economic crisis undercut by the effects of a significant
natural disaster in the first half of FY2009/10. The proposed operation will support policy and
institutional measures that will help Samoa sustain its economic reform momentum, while
assisting it to recover more quickly from the exogenous shocks it has suffered recently. The
proposed operation is complemented by support under the IMF's Exogenous Shocks Facility, a
loan from the ADB for economic recovery, and assistance from Samoa's major bilateral donors.

2.      Samoa is a small remote island economy. Samoa consists of four inhabited islands in
the South Pacific, with a total population of approximately 182,000. In terms of population and
income weighted distance measures, out of the 219 countries for whom such a calculation has
been made, the Polynesian countries ­ a group to which Samoa belongs ­ have an average rank
of 207. The population is predominantly rural, with two-thirds of the labour force employed in
agriculture. GDP per capita at market exchange rates is approximately US$2,700. Being a small
open economy, Samoa is highly vulnerable to global economic shocks. In addition the country is
greatly exposed to natural disasters like cyclones and tsunamis.

3.      In common with many small island nations, remittances are very important for
Samoa, amounting to almost a quarter of GDP. There are approximately 100,000 Samoa-
born people living overseas. Slightly over 50,000 of these emigrants live in New Zealand, with
Australia, American Samoa and the continental United States being the next most important
destinations, each with approximately equal numbers. Remittances provide over half of foreign
exchange earnings in Samoa, and are the equivalent of approximately 22 percent of GDP. Given
that remittance flows to Samoa tend to be counter-cyclical, remittances are the most significant
and reliable form of social protection available to recipient households. By comparison, tourism
­ which is also very important to the economies of many small island nations ­ provides around
30 percent of foreign exchange earnings in Samoa, while the tourism sector contributes some 14
percent of GDP. Aid ­ which is very significant in all Pacific Islands ­ is the equivalent of 7­10
percent of Samoa's GDP.

4.      Samoa has been a successful economic reformer for more than two decades. During
this time, prudent fiscal policies have been firmly established, and public debt reduced to a
comfortable level. Tariffs have been substantially reduced, a broad-based value-added tax has
been introduced, and the tax-free threshold for income tax has been raised to give relief to low-
income groups. Samoa has implemented a comprehensive market-based financial liberalization
programme, including the removal of credit and interest-rate controls, the use of auctions of
central bank securities as the main monetary policy instrument, and the strengthening of the
capacity of the central bank. Public enterprises have been progressively corporatized and
privatized to improve the efficiency of service provision. Samoa has also adopted a wide-
ranging programme of reforms, in pursuit of modern public-sector management practices.
Output budgeting and strategic planning have been introduced in the public sector, and line
agencies have been given increased autonomy.

5.     Samoa has reaped the benefits of its reforms, in sustained economic growth and
increases in human development indicators. In the 15 years to 2008, Samoa achieved per
capita GDP growth of 3½ percent, a level significantly higher than for any relevant peer group.
Between 1985 and 2007, Samoa's Human Development Index (HDI) increased from 0.686 to
0.771, currently making Samoa the top-ranked country in the Pacific Islands. In that period, life
expectancy in Samoa increased to 71.4 years, and adult literacy increased to 98.7 percent.

6.     Samoa suffered a major external shock from the global economic crisis, with severe
consequences for domestic economic activity. A critical impact of the global recession in
Samoa was the downsizing of a plant for automotive parts ­ which had been the backbone of the
manufacturing sector in this small, undiversified economy. This resulted in the loss of 1,550
formal sector jobs by March 2009, comprising just over 7  percent of formal employment.
According to official estimates, real GDP fell some 5 percent in FY2008/09, recording the worst
slump in two decades. Had it not been for resilient tourism and remittance receipts, the
economic contraction would have been much greater.

7.      The fiscal impact of the global economic crisis has been large. As a consequence of
the economic slowdown, tax revenues have been declining between FY2007/08 and FY2009/10.
Despite careful prioritisation and restraint of current expenditures, the Government of Samoa
(GoS) has gone from maintaining near-fiscal balance in the middle of this decade, to running
increasingly large budget deficits. Notably, as a result of both the weakening of the economy
and the introduction of an economic stimulus package in response to the crisis, the deficit for
FY2009/10 was budgeted to be over 10 percent of GDP. The government intends to reduce the
fiscal deficit to less than 3 percent of GDP over the medium term once economic recovery is
complete.

8.      The Bank's dialogue with the GoS under the current operation began with a focus
on its policy response to the economic slowdown. In mid-2009, the Bank and the GoS ­
together with other development partners ­ assessed possible policy responses to the impacts of
the global economic crisis on Samoa, including a fiscal stimulus program. The country was then
hit by a tsunami ­ the worst natural disaster since Samoa became independent in 1962 ­ which
considerably dimmed the prospects for a quick recovery from the global economic crisis.
Subsequently, the Bank ­ in consultation with the GoS and other development partners ­
adjusted the proposed operation to account for the impact of the tsunami on Samoa. The tsunami
of September 29, 2009 left 143 people dead and almost 5,300 people ­ some 2½ percent of
Samoa's population, many of them in rural areas in one of the poorest regions in the country ­
without homes. Beyond the human cost, the physical damage is estimated to be US$85 million
(over 14 percent of GDP).

9.      The proposed operation aims to support the government's efforts to counter the
impacts of the global economic crisis that have been exacerbated by the tsunami, and
facilitate medium term recovery. Even in these challenging circumstances the government has
stayed broadly on-track with its reform agenda, largely articulated in the Strategy for the
Development of Samoa (SDS). The policy actions included in this operation will help maintain
the reform momentum, while at the same time supporting the government's recovery measures.
The operation selectively covers a small set of policy actions in four key areas: (i) assisting with
economic recovery, particularly in the tourism sector; (ii) instituting mechanisms to protect the
vulnerable; (iii) progressing on public financial management reforms to ensure that fiscal
discipline is maintained at a time when public expenditure is increasing rapidly; and (iv) public
enterprise reform to strengthen infrastructure service delivery to support medium term recovery.
The Supplementary Budget passed in January 2010 increased allocations to protect the
vulnerable and support private sector activity. GoS requested all stakeholders including the
development partners to assist in this effort.

10.     The proposed operation will provide US$20 million in budget support to help
cushion the fiscal pressure arising from the crises. In doing so, the Bank, together with other
development partners, is responding to the GoS' call for concessional financing from the
international community. In the absence of concessional financing, GoS would be unable to
respond to the needs of the immediately affected populations or revive economic activity. This
would risk derailing service delivery to the vulnerable in the immediate term, particularly in the
vital, but costly, health and education sectors. The proposed operation, together with assistance
from other development partners, notably Australia, New Zealand and the Asian Development
Bank, is designed to mitigate those risks.

11.     The proposed operation carries a moderate risk on account of the limited
institutional capacity of the GoS which is currently stretched due to the major crises that


                                                 3 
 
have occurred in the last two years. In addition the external economic environment, while
improving, remains unsettled. Samoa's high vulnerability to external economic factors implies
that the government's ability to maintain macroeconomic stability, restore growth and achieve
fiscal consolidation in the medium term will continue to be tested.

                                  II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN SAMOA

12.     Samoa has been hit hard by the global economic crisis in the last two years.
Samoa's GDP contracted some 5 percent in FY2008/09, the worst slump in two decades, and
Samoa's budget deficit exceeded its policy targets for maintaining macroeconomic stability. The
damaging impact on economic activity and fiscal balances has continued well into FY2009/10,
with Samoa's ability to recover quickly from the global economic crisis undercut by the effects
of the tsunami in September 2009. The proposed operation will support policy and institutional
measures that will help Samoa sustain its economic reform momentum, while assisting it to
recover more quickly from the economic crisis.

13.     Samoa is a small remote island economy. Samoa consists of four inhabited islands in
the South Pacific, with a total population of approximately 182,000 and a total GDP in 2009 of
approximately US$555 million. The population is predominantly rural, with two-thirds of the
labour force employed in agriculture. GDP per capita at market exchange rates is approximately
US$2,700. As measured in the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey in 2008, the
level of food poverty in Samoa is 3.3 percent of households, while the level of basic needs
poverty is 20.1 percent of households.

14.     Along with other Pacific Islands, Samoa is remote from main centres of economic
activity or markets. Potential market remoteness measures based on GDP weighted distance
indicate that the average pacific island country is 11,500 kilometres from any other randomly
selected country. Out of the 219 countries for which this calculation has been made, the
Polynesian countries ­ a group to which Samoa belongs ­ have an average rank of 207.

15.     In common with many small island nations, emigration and remittances are very
important for Samoa. There are approximately 100,000 Samoa-born living overseas. Slightly
over 50,000 of these emigrants live in New Zealand, with Australia, American Samoa and the
continental United States being the next most important destinations, each with approximately
equal numbers. Samoa is also highly dependent on remittances, which are equivalent to almost
one quarter of GDP. Given that remittance flows to Samoa tend to be counter-cyclical,
remittances are the most significant and reliable form of social protection available to recipient
households. Recent research on the Samoa-NZ migration lottery quota of 1,100 per year reveals
that the poverty rate amongst individuals living in households with a migrant is 23  percentage

                                                4 
 
points lower using the basic needs poverty line, and migration under the NZ lottery quota
resulted in a 62 percent reduction in headcount poverty in Samoa.

16.     Samoa has been a successful economic reformer for more than two decades. During
this time, prudent fiscal policies have been firmly established, and public debt reduced to a
comfortable level. Tariffs have been substantially reduced, a broad-based value-added tax has
been introduced, and the tax-free threshold for income tax has been raised to give relief to low-
income groups. Samoa has implemented a comprehensive market-based financial liberalization
programme, including the removal of credit and interest-rate controls, the use of auctions of
central bank securities as the main monetary policy instrument, and the strengthening of the
capacity of the central bank. Public enterprises have been progressively corporatized and
privatized to reduce the role of the state in the economy and improve the efficiency of service
provision. Samoa has adopted a wide-ranging programme of public sector reforms, in pursuit of
modern public-sector management practices. Output budgeting and strategic planning have been
introduced in the public sector, and line agencies have been given increased autonomy. A
medium-term expenditure framework ­ including three-year forward estimates ­ has been
introduced in the annual budget process.

17.    Samoa has reaped the benefits of its reforms, in sustained economic growth and
increases in human development. In the 15 years to 2008, Samoa achieved per capita GDP
growth of 3½ percent, a level significantly higher than for any relevant peer group (see Figure1).
Between 1985 and 2007, Samoa's Human Development Index (HDI) increased from 0.686 to
0.771, currently making Samoa the top-ranked country in the Pacific Islands. In that period, life
expectancy in Samoa increased to 71.4 years, and adult literacy increased to 98.7 percent.

18.     In the 2010 Doing business report, Samoa ranked 57 out of 183 countries in terms of
overall ease of doing business, an improvement of 11 places. Of significant improvement in
the last year is the ease of starting a business ranking, which moved from 131 in 2009 to 20 in
2010 reflecting amendments to the Companies Act which came into force in July 2008. These
amendments considerably reduced the time, cost and complexity associated with registering a
new company, and provided new flexibilities for companies in Samoa. A new companies
register is now being constructed, which will provide an accurate record of all active companies
and also serve as a valuable information tool for private sector development policy.

19.    The global economic crisis came on the back of the global food and fuel price shock.
Between 2006 and the first half of 2009, average domestic food prices increased by 35 percent
and Samoa's total food import bill increased by more than 30 percent. By the first half of 2009,
food imports represented 29 percent of the total value of imports, as opposed to 17 percent in
2006 ­ a proportion that is above the average for Pacific Islands. With fuel imports already
representing over 15 percent of the total value of imports in the year before the global spike in oil


                                                 5 
 
prices, Samoa was also hurt by the fuel crisis ­ although the full extent of the impact was
mitigated by Samoa's innovative bulk purchasing program for fuel.1 The food and fuel crisis
drove an inflationary peak of over 18 percent in late 2008.

20.     The food and fuel crisis that preceded the global economic crisis is estimated to have
had a substantial detrimental impact on the poor. The food basket and non-food
expenditures used to calculate the food and basic needs poverty lines in analysis of Samoa's
2008 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) were costed in the first quarter of 2008.
Thus, the higher levels of poverty measured by the HIES in 2008 capture part of the impact of
the food and fuel crisis on the poor in Samoa. Comparing the 2008 HIES to the 2002 HIES, the
proportion of households falling under the basic needs poverty line increased from 19.1 percent
in 2002 to 20.1 percent in 2008. However, the Government of Samoa (GoS) and UNDP estimate
that, had the food basket been costed in the fourth quarter of 2008, its cost would have been 25
percent higher.2 That would have pushed a further approximately 13,000 people below the basic
needs poverty line, raising the proportion of the population living in poverty by around 7
percent.3

21.     The global economic crisis has been a major shock to the Samoan economy.
Manufacturing was particularly hard hit by the global downturn. By March 2009, the
downsizing of a plant for automotive parts had led to the loss of 1,550 formal sector jobs ­
mainly held by women. Given the lack of economic diversification, the downsizing of this one
enterprise and the consequent loss of employment had a major impact on the overall economy.
This decline in manufacturing employment was the primary driver of the drop in formal sector
employment as a whole, which suffered a 9.3 percent fall in the second quarter of 2009, relative
to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Moreover, as in other countries, business
confidence in Samoa was depressed by the uncertainties created by the global economic
situation. Samoa's banks became highly risk averse, and cut back lending to even viable
businesses. The decline in real GDP of some 5 percent recorded in FY 2008/09 represents
Samoa's worst economic performance in two decades. But for the strength of tourism receipts,
the economic contraction would have been much greater.

22.     The effect of the global recession on the fiscal position of the GoS has been severe.
Even in nominal terms, tax revenues recorded small declines in FY2007/08 and FY2008/09, and
were budgeted to continue to decline in FY2009/10 (see Table 1). In real terms, the decline in
revenue experienced by the GoS is stark. Against trend growth of around 3½ percent per annum,
tax revenues declined 6 percent in FY2007/08 and 12 percent in FY2008/2009 in real terms, and
were budgeted to decline a further 13 percent in 2009/10. Prudent fiscal management has seen
the GoS identify non-essential expenditures and prioritise essential expenditures, resulting in the
overall restraint of current expenditures over the same period. In real terms, current expenditures
were reduced by 5 percent in FY 2007/08 and 4 percent in FY2008/09, and were budgeted to fall
a further 5 percent in FY2009/10 (see Figure 2).4 The overall impact of these changes has been a
steady increase in the fiscal deficit: from around 2 percent of GDP in FY2007/08, to nearly 4
percent of GDP in FY2008/09, to a budgeted deficit of over 10 percent of GDP in FY2009/10.

23.     In response to the domestic economic impact of the global recession, the GoS
formulated a major fiscal stimulus package. National consultations were undertaken on
Samoa's economic predicament in early 2009, and a stimulus package was formulated for
inclusion in the FY2009/10 budget. The focus of the stimulus package was on infrastructure
development. This addressed the immediate need to boost economic activity and generate
employment opportunities, while laying a firm foundation for expanding the productive capacity
of the economy in the medium term. The increase in infrastructure spending under the stimulus
package is part of the rise in `development expenditure' from some US$ 73 million in
FY2008/09 to US$ 108 million in FY2009/10 (182 million tala to 271 million tala, Table 1).5 In
order to maintain sound fiscal management and ensure the sustainability of public debt, the GoS

                                                            
4
    Note that these figures exclude the extraordinary budget allocation in FY2007/08 for the South Pacific Games.
5
    The magnitude of the expenditure increase tends to exaggerate the expected impact of the stimulus since certain
expenditure components would typically have a sizable imported content in a small economy.

                                                               7 
 
negotiated with donors to fund this increase in infrastructure spending through grants and
concessional loans. The GoS also increased its allocation of funds to the LTA, to enable it to
play its part in implementing these infrastructure projects. The deficit of over 10 percent of GDP
budgeted for FY2009/10 was driven by the additional expenditure required for this stimulus
package, in conjunction with the expected decline in tax revenues from the economic slowdown.

24.     The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) has taken strong measures to ease monetary
policy in order to cushion the impact of the global shocks on the domestic economy, and to
provide an environment conducive to economic recovery. Since mid-2008 the CBS has
lowered policy rates by nearly 300 bps. However, the impact of this monetary stimulus has been
limited by the policies of commercial banks in Samoa, which have tightened their risk
management and built excess liquidity. Remittance flows helped cushion the impact of the
global recession on the balance of payments, with official reserves remaining above the CBS's
target of four months of imports. The IMF assesses that the credibility of Samoa's exchange-rate
basket peg helped to anchor inflation expectations, so allowing headline inflation to subside
quickly, after peaking in late 2008, in line with global prices for food and commodities.

25.    The tsunami that hit Samoa in September 2009 was the worst natural disaster since
Samoa's independence in 1962. Despite resilience-building policy and institutional measures
being undertaken in the past, the tsunami left approximately 150 people dead and some 5,300
people ­ 2½ percent of Samoa's population ­ homeless. These people were already among the
poorest in the country, being concentrated in rural areas in one of Samoa's poorest regions. The
tsunami also caused extensive damage to Samoa's infrastructure, although the main government
buildings and the airport in Apia have remained intact. A team of donors led by the World Bank
estimated that the physical damage of the tsunami will cost US$85 million to repair (over 14
percent of GDP).6 The expected loss in economic flows due to the temporary absence of
destroyed assets is estimated at US$40  million (nearly 7  percent of GDP) over the next few

years. The cost of restoring infrastructure, maintaining access to basic social services, providing
social safety nets to the affected population, and investing in disaster risk reduction, is expected
to be some 21 percent of GDP during the next three to four years.

26.     The GoS responded rapidly and effectively to this unprecedented natural disaster.
Samoa's Disaster Advisory Council provided immediate humanitarian relief to the affected
population, with support from international aid agencies. The National Disaster Management
Office then worked closely with the World Bank and other international donors to design and
commence the implementation of a recovery framework that focuses on the crucial aspects of the
reconstruction process. These include maintaining access to essential services, restoring
infrastructure services, rebuilding agricultural and fisheries livelihoods, and rehabilitating the
environment while increasing its resilience to future natural disasters (see section on
Relationship to Other Bank Operations below for the Bank's role in strengthening Samoa's
resilience to natural disasters).7 The GoS prepared a supplementary budget for the full cost of
the first phase of this recovery framework, which was endorsed by Cabinet in December 2009
and passed by Parliament in January 2010.

27.     Going beyond the significant rehabilitation costs, the timing of the tsunami ­ coming
as it did, after the global food and fuel crisis and global economic crisis ­ means that this
natural disaster has undercut Samoa's ability to recover quickly from the global recession.
As the assessment led by the World Bank indicated, significant losses in economic flows will
accompany the unprecedented damage to physical infrastructure that Samoa has suffered.
Agriculture and tourism are the two key sectors that threaten to undermine Samoa's economic
resilience. In agriculture, the temporary absence of destroyed assets has implications for the food
security and cash-earning opportunities of significant segments of the population engaged in
semi-subsistence production, as well as for the fledgling commercial agricultural development.
In tourism, which contributed some 14 percent of GDP and 65 percent of export earnings in
FY2008/09, the tsunami destroyed approximately one-quarter of the sector's capacity in some of
Samoa's most popular destinations. Under the assessment led by the World Bank, between 1½­
3½ percent of GDP was expected to be lost in the first year after the tsunami due to this damage
to the tourism sector (based on cross-country recovery experience and Samoa-specific seasonal
and structural patterns of tourism demand).

28.     The IMF has approved a US$9.3 million loan to help spur recovery and
reconstruction in Samoa following the September 2009 earthquake and tsunami. The loan
­ which came from the rapid-access component of the IMF's Exogenous Shocks Facility ­
bolstered Samoa's external reserves and helped cover expected shortfalls in export earnings. The
Exogenous Shocks Facility is concessional financial assistance designed for countries that have a
good track record and reasonable policy credibility, but need assistance because they are

       These activities will be conducted on the basis of the `build back better' principle.

suffering an external shock. In order to ensure fiscal sustainability, the government agreed with
the IMF that any remaining financing needs be met primarily through external grants or highly
concessional borrowing.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

29.     Real GDP is expected to contract by 3 percent in FY2010/11. Prior to the tsunami, it
was expected that Samoa would not have fully recovered from the impacts of the global
economic crisis by FY2010/11, and the government was projecting a contraction of 0.6 percent.
In the wake of the tsunami the economic contraction is expected to be sharper. Not only
agriculture and tourism, but also the commerce, transport and communication sectors are
expected to perform worse than they would have done in the absence of the tsunami, due to the
extensive damage incurred to their infrastructure.
 
30.     Given this outlook for the real economy, a substantial widening of Samoa's current
account deficit is unavoidable. Prior to the tsunami, the GoS was already expecting the current
account balance to be under pressure, from decreased tourism earnings as a result of the global
recession, as well as from increased imports as a result of a pickup in domestic private sector
activity (mainly as a result of the sizeable fiscal stimulus envisaged in the FY2009/10 budget).
In the wake of the tsunami, the GoS now expects the current account deficit to widen sharply
(Table2), primarily because of the expected shortfall in tourism receipts and substantial increases

in imports related to infrastructure rehabilitation. While remittances increased in the immediate
aftermath of the tsunami and helped mitigate current account pressures, the extent to which they
will be maintained, is unclear as yet.

31.     A widening of the fiscal deficit to 10 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10, both to provide
the fiscal stimulus needed prior to the tsunami and to fund the first stage of post-tsunami
reconstruction efforts, is also unavoidable. The GoS is committed to returning the budget
balance to within 3 percent of GDP in the medium term, when its tsunami-related reconstruction
strategy has been completed, in accordance with its policy commitment to sustained
macroeconomic stability in the national development strategy. The increasingly large deficits
that Samoa has been running as a result of the series of external shocks that have hit its economy
in recent years is, however, resulting in increases in the level of public debt. Prior to these
shocks, public debt had been declining steadily, as a result of Samoa's prudent fiscal
management. Between FY2001/02 and FY2007/08, Samoa's public debt had almost been halved
­ to around 30 percent of GDP.

32.     The results of the recent debt sustainability analysis suggest that, even after taking
into account the large deficits envisaged in FY2009/10, FY2010/11 and FY2011/12, Samoa's
debt outlook remains favourable8. It is the view of the World Bank and IMF that Samoa's
Public Debt Management Strategy has served it well over the last decade, in achieving a low
level of risk to fiscal sustainability. Even with the fiscal stimulus implemented by the GoS in
response to the global recession, the net present value of public debt stood at 28 percent of GDP
as of June 2009. This is significantly below sustainability thresholds indicated for low income
countries. Taking into account post-tsunami reconstruction expenditures, the net present value of
public debt can still be stabilised at a level below 40 percent of GDP, which is a sufficiently
comfortable level to give Samoa room to absorb future external shocks. To maintain this
favourable outlook for public debt, it will be important for Samoa to maintain the prudent fiscal
management that it has developed a reputation for over the last decade. Potential risks to this
favourable outlook are posed by Samoa's publicly guaranteed debt (approximately 4 percent of
GDP), and its ongoing vulnerability to large external shocks.

33.      The GoS is committed to minimising the overall fiscal burden and capacity risks
arising from its post-tsunami recovery program. To limit the adverse impact of recovery
program expenditure on Samoa's fiscal position and debt sustainability, the GoS has committed
itself to carefully review existing medium-term development spending plans in consultation with
key donors, with a view to identifying synergies with the recovery framework and ­ to the extent
possible ­ re-directing funds to infrastructure rehabilitation. Not only could this go some way in
closing the still unidentified tsunami-related financing in succeeding years, it could also mitigate
capacity constraints that may be encountered in respect of both government administration and

the economy. In addition, the GoS has committed itself to seek savings of non-priority current
expenditure, where possible, to provide for basic social needs.

34.     The macroeconomic policy framework in place is adequate and suitable for the
purposes of this operation but subject to uncertainty. This is due, first and foremost, to the
unprecedented scale of the damage caused by the tsunami ­ making predictions regarding the
recovery highly imprecise. In particular, Samoa faces a downside risk in respect of its tourism
industry, if it takes an unusually long time for Samoa to restore its reputation as a safe tourism
destination following the tsunami. Secondly, the uncertainty is due to the difficulty in
pinpointing the timing of Samoa's recovery from the impact of the global recession, since there
is also uncertainty over the speed and strength of the global recovery. Thirdly, some questions
remain on whether Samoan national accounts appropriately measure the share of tourism (it is
likely that it is underestimated)) which adds to the uncertainty of forecasts based on that data.

    III.   THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

35.     Samoa's development strategy aims to improve the living standards of the Samoan
people and has been formulated on the basis of an extensive consultative process. The
current national plan for achieving economic growth and poverty reduction is the Strategy for the
Development of Samoa 2008­12 (SDS). The SDS was formulated on the basis of an extensive
consultative process involving government agencies, the private sector, civil society
organizations, church leaders and community groups. It reflects a national commitment to
improving the living standards of all Samoans, maintaining and improving their social welfare,
and ensuring their long-term futures by protecting the environment. The SDS is crafted around
seven goals: (1) sustained macroeconomic stability; (2) private sector led economic growth and
employment creation; (3) improved education outcomes; (4) improved health outcomes;
(5) community development; (6) improved governance; and (7) environmental sustainability and
disaster risk reduction.

36.     To underpin economic growth, Samoa is committed to maintaining macroeconomic
stability through fiscal and monetary policy discipline. Exceptional circumstances aside, the
budget deficit is to be kept below 3 percent of GDP. The authorities are committed to preparing
the budget in a multi-year framework, involving the presentation of forward estimates for three
years. A debt management policy is to be formulated and implemented during the current SDS.
Monetary policy pursues the objective of price stability, with underlying inflation to be
restrained to 3­4 percent per annum. Exchange rate policy aims to maintain a competitive real
effective exchange rate and safeguard Samoa's international reserves, with reserves to be
maintained at 4­6 months of imports.




                                               14 
 
37.      The private sector is to lead economic growth and employment creation, and further
reforms will be made to economic infrastructure services. Samoa is committed to improving
the enabling environment for private sector development through legal and regulatory reforms ­
including improving commercial access to land, facilitating the employment of expatriate
workers, reforming company's regulation and streamlining taxation procedures. Access to key
infrastructure services ­ including energy, water and sanitation, telecommunications and
transport ­ is being expanded and the services made more efficient, reliable and cost-effective.
Regulatory frameworks and regulators for economic infrastructure services and service providers
are being strengthened. Adequate provisions are being made for the community service
obligations of infrastructure service providers. The process of corporatizing and privatizing
infrastructure service providers continues. The government is facilitating the development of
financial markets, with a focus on improving access to credit for small and medium enterprises.
It is also supporting research and development in agro-processing and renewable energy, and
providing a foundation for the sustainable exploitation of natural resources. Samoa is pursuing
an outward-oriented trade policy, involving regional and multilateral tariff liberalization, the
implementation of a national export strategy, and the securing of opportunities for temporary
labour movement. The SDS sets out a strategy to further improve the effectiveness of
consultation with the private sector, including formalising an institutional framework for
consultations.

38.     The SDS emphasises the importance of improving educational outcomes. A new
primary curriculum is now being implemented, the quality of teaching and learning materials
improved, and investment in library services enhanced. The government is targeting increased
primary enrolment and completion rates, and improved literacy and numeracy outcomes. Samoa
is seeking to address high teacher turnover, strengthen education management, and improve the
quality of teaching services. In addition, the government has developed a strategy to refocus
post-secondary education and training on industry needs, involving collaboration with industry
users of trainees and quality assurance processes.

39.     Samoa will build on its existing achievements in improving health outcomes for its
people. The focus of the SDS is on reducing infant and child mortality rates, including by
increasing child immunization, controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases, and increasing the
proportion of births attended by a skilled health practitioner. Expanded access to water and
sanitation services is prioritized by government in part because of its health implications. In
addition, Samoa is implementing a strategy to tackle the increased incidence of non-
communicable or `lifestyle' diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, obesity,
mental illness and conditions associated with drug abuse. The government is also tackling the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases.




                                              15 
 
40.     Increasing equality and improving the economic and social wellbeing of Samoans
remains a priority. The SDS emphasises the importance of enhancing village-level governance
for improving the wellbeing of Samoa's people. The involvement of village councils and
churches in community life is to be intensified, with a view to promoting Samoan culture,
strengthening the family unit as the core of village society, and addressing tensions between
customary law and traditional authority structures, on the one hand, and modern law and the
court system, on the other. Poverty alleviation efforts are to be strengthened by government
support for village-level microfinance, agricultural development and access to infrastructure
services. Women and youth will be the priority groups for these efforts, particular with respect
to access to credit and the provision of technical advice and entrepreneurial training.

41.     Improving the effectiveness of government is to be the priority of public sector
management reforms for 2008­2012. These include legislative reform, improved policy
development and coordination, enhanced governance mechanisms, capacity building, and
improved human resource management. Public financial management will continue to be
strengthened, particularly with respect to the medium-term fiscal framework which will better
align the SDS, sector and corporate plans, and the annual budget. With respect to state-owned
enterprises, the government remains committed to a policy of owning only those enterprises that
have significant strategic, security or social importance. Other enterprises currently under state
ownership are candidates for privatization, with the government committed to establishing the
necessary regulatory frameworks and competition authority to ensure the quality and cost-
effectiveness of these services.

42.     Environmental sustainability and disaster risk reduction remains critical to long-
term human development in Samoa. The government recognises that sustainable economic
growth in Samoa depends on protection of the environmental services on which the economy is
based. Particular emphasis will be given, during the current SDS, to climate change adaptation ­
including disaster management. Coastal management and adaptation programmes for vulnerable
villages and other coastal locations will be intensified, to improve resilience to the adverse
impacts of climate change. Special attention will be given to the expansion of renewable energy
sources and promotion of energy-efficient building design. Environmental sustainability will be
integrated into all government policies, programs and projects. Samoa is also targeting the
containment of forest degradation and unsustainable marine resource exploitation, protection of
biodiversity, and improvements in waste management.

43.    The monitoring and evaluation process for the SDS is to be comprehensive and
timely. S pecific targets and indicators are attached to each goal in the SDS, to improve the
measurability of progress towards these goals and to increase the accountability of the
responsible agencies for their SDS-governed work activities. A central authority ­ the Economic
Policy and Planning Division of the Ministry of Finance ­ is responsible for six-monthly


                                               16 
 
assessments of implementation, including identifying reasons for breakdowns in delivery and
recommending appropriate responses. Annual reports reviewing government progress on the
SDS will be prepared, linking each goal with specific targets, indictors and achievements by the
relevant government authorities.

44.     Bank operations in Samoa support and complement the goals of the SDS. This Bank
operation will support policy and institutional measures that will help Samoa sustain its reform
momentum and recover more quickly from the exogenous shocks it has suffered in recent years.
Elements of this operation focus on public financial management and state-owned enterprise
reform, in support of the SDS goal of improving the effectiveness of government. The Bank
operation also covers the waiving of primary school fees, cushioning the impact of multiple
economic crises on the vulnerable, which supports the SDS goals of alleviating poverty and
improving educational outcomes. In addition, the operation includes assisting the recovery of
Samoa's tourism sector, supporting the SDS goal of private sector-led economic growth and
employment creation. At the same time, the early recovery program included in the Bank
operation will help restore economic activity in the wake of the tsunami and support the SDS
goal of enhancing environmental sustainability and disaster risk reduction. The targets and
indicators developed by the Samoan Government to monitor the implementation of the strategies
set out in the SDS and evaluate the achievement of the goals of the SDS are shown in Annex 6.

            IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

45.     The proposed DPC with Samoa is entirely consistent with the Bank's overall
strategy for Samoa and the Pacific Islands more broadly. A Pacific Regional Engagement
Framework (REF) prepared in May 2005 is based around the twin pillars of: (i) strengthening
government capabilities to deliver services, and (ii) improving the incentives for private sector
led growth and employment. The REF highlights the susceptibility of the Pacific island
countries to natural disasters, and the important role for the Bank in disaster risk reduction as
well as responding to assist with reconstruction following such disasters.

46.     The Bank Group is currently in the early stages of preparing a new strategy for the
Pacific region. The starting point for the new strategy is recognition of the systemic
vulnerability and volatility of the small and remote Pacific island countries. Key themes for
structuring Bank Group engagement are: (i) generating new opportunities for Pacific islanders
from greater global and regional integration; and (ii) building resilience to shocks. Supporting
this, the Bank Group is significantly scaling up the advisory and financial services it is able to
provide to the Pacific Islands.




                                               17 
 
COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

47.    The Bank is fully committed to the "Cairns Compact" outlined by Forum Island
Leaders9 in October 2009 which highlights the importance of closer collaboration between
Pacific Island countries and partners to make better use of all resources ­ whether
domestic or external ­ available for development in the Pacific region. The post tsunami
response in Samoa and the development of this operation has been a strong example of the
implementation of those principles in action.

48.     The proposed DPC has been developed in close consultation with the Government of
Samoa, and is aligned with the Government's own policy matrix. During 2009, the Bank
was engaged in discussions with the GoS and with other development partners in the region to
monitor the impact of the economic crisis on Samoa. In November 2009, the Bank participated
in a joint dialogue led by the GoS and including other development partners, on policy actions to
be associated with budget support, including actions to respond to the tsunami as well as
continuing efforts to push ahead with structural reform. These policy actions are contained in the
GoS' own policy matrix, which the GoS put forward as a basis for the joint dialogue and to
provide an ongoing coordinating framework among development partners (this matrix is
included in Annex 2, as an attachment to the Letter of Development Policy).

49.    Key development partners have been fully engaged in the discussion of the policy
actions for the proposed operation. The ADB is proceeding with a two tranche budget support
operation, which is expected to be presented to the ADB Board around April 2010. The policy
actions for the ADB's first tranche are fully concordant with those included in this operation.
Key bilateral donors, including Australia and New Zealand, have announced significant direct
budget support to help emergency recovery efforts in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami,
and are aligning their future dialogue with the GoS around the GoS' policy matrix. The IMF
Board also agreed to the Fund providing emergency liquidity to Samoa in December 2009.
While the nature of the Fund's exogenous shocks facility means that such finance carries limited
policy dialogue, the Fund has been closely involved in discussions about the structure of this
operation.

50.    The funds being provided by key development partners to the GoS to assist with its
economic recovery are summarised in Table 3. This assistance comprises both one-tranche
operations and multi-year funding arrangements.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

51.    The proposed operation will support policy and institutional measures that will help
Samoa sustain its reform momentum and recover more quickly from the series of shocks it
has suffered in recent years. Consideration of this operation began in mid-2009, in the wake of
the global food and fuel crisis and the global economic crisis. The operation was then adjusted,
to account for the devastating tsunami that hit Samoa in September 2009. This operation is
being complemented by a package of other support from the Bank, both for tsunami-related
reconstruction needs and for medium-term development priorities in the areas of disaster risk
reduction, health, telecommunications and agriculture. The significant budget support being
offered reflects the strong record of the GoS in achieving economic policy reforms and managing
public sector resources, while the complementary activities allow the Bank to draw on its
extensive experience in these sectors to support Samoa's medium-term development priorities.

52.     Since 1999, the Bank has supported a number of activities to strengthen Samoa's disaster
risk management capacity. These activities have been initiated with the Ministry of Natural
Resources and the Environment, under the Bank's Infrastructure Asset Management Program
(IAMP). Topographic maps of hazard areas were developed identifying risks to Samoa from
storm surges and tsunamis. An asset and information management system was established for all
primary roads and public coastal infrastructure. Coastal Infrastructure Management plans were
developed in consultation with local communities that identified specific infrastructure projects
that would reduce the vulnerability of communities to natural disasters. Environmental Impact
Assessment regulations have been modernised, and a new Land Transport Authority Act and new
Disaster Management Act have been brought into effect. Improvements in drainage and
relocation of critical infrastructure to more secure areas were identified as important actions to be
                                                 19 
 
undertaken and some of these investments are currently under implementation in the tsunami
affected areas.

53.     The benefits of IAMP became evident during the response of the country to the tsunami
of September 2009. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment coordinated effectively
the immediate relief and response activities, while the Land Transport Authority was successful
in activating road maintenance contracts with private sector contractors to quickly open access to
the tsunami affected areas and restore transportation assets so that aid could be provided to
affected communities. The overall assessment of the Government's early response to the
tsunami has been positive and both of the above institutions have received support from IAMP.
Nevertheless, extended physical damages to the coastal roads network and the need of upgrading
secondary roads to allow for adequate transport services to displaced population have created
additional significant unexpected costs for the transport sector. The Bank will support the GoS
to partially meet some of those costs through additional financing to be provided through IAMP.

54.     The Bank is assisting the GoS through an Emergency Response Credit (US$ 9.0 million
of IDA financing and AU$ 2.0 million of grant financing from the Pacific Region Infrastructure
Facility). The Tsunami Emergency Recovery project will help finance the costs associated with
the rehabilitation and reconstruction in relocated communities for recovery from the tsunami.
Many affected people have chosen to relocate inland from the shore and are currently in need of
assistance to rebuild their homes and rehabilitate their communities. The Tsunami Emergency
Recovery project support will help respond to the situation by aligning with the GoS's
reconstruction plan. The project will focus primarily on the transport sector and on
strengthening the communities' risk management capacities.

55.    The Bank has been assisting the Samoan Government on health sector reform since
2000. Samoa is broadly on track to meet health MDGs. The health status of Samoa's population
has improved significantly over the past two decade, largely through the provision of basic
health services. Infant mortality has declined from 25 per 1,000 live births in 1988 to 17 per
1,000 live births in 2003. Over the same period, average life expectancy has reached 70 years
for males and 74 years for women. Interventions by the Bank have focused primarily on
working with the government to address lifestyle diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, and to
ensure a more sustainable financing platform for the health system. The current Health Sector
Management Program Support Project (HSMP) is part of a coordinated sector wide approach by
the Bank with the Australian and New Zealand governments, with all donors anticipated to
provide a total of US$10 million over 5 years to support the government's Health Sector Plan
2009-13. The Program is designed to be flexible so that it can adapt to evolving sector and
country priorities. The proposed additional financing for the HSMP is designed to fill a critical
gap in the medium-term health sector financing plan as a result of the reallocation of existing
funds to meet post-tsunami needs.

56.    In the telecoms sector, a technical assistance of US$4.5m IDA is designed to assist the
government in regulatory reform to allow new market operators and to privatize SamoaTel.
Regulatory reform has proceeded, and the introduction of new private operators has helped to
very significantly increase access to mobile telephone services and the internet. Nevertheless,
the privatization of SamoaTel has also been considerably delayed (although this is now
scheduled for late 2010). When it takes place, the privatization of SamoaTel is expected to free
up capital for the GoS, allowing it to utilise its funds more efficiently. IFC investments of
almost US$20 million in Samoa over the past 2 years have supported total investments by
Digicel ­ the new telecoms market entrant ­ of over US$80 million. Combined regulatory
reform and increased competition has increased the number of telephone subscribers from
12,000 in 2002 to 152,800 in 2009 ­ or from 6 percent to 83 percent of the population.

57.     The Bank is assisting the Samoan agriculture sector through both technical assistance
and lending programs. Samoa has achieved major economic transformation over the past 15 
years, with real GDP per capita increases of over 3 percent per year on average, faster than that
seen elsewhere in the Pacific. However the performance of the agriculture sector has been lack
lustre, attributable to the sector's vulnerability to natural disasters, high cost of production and
under-investment by the public and the private sectors in agriculture over the past decade. The
World Bank, in response to GoS' request, is currently providing technical assistance as well as
planning the Samoa Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Project aimed at improving the
competitiveness of Samoan farmers by strengthening value chains for selected agricultural
products for which Samoa has a strong comparative advantage. The program would be
supported through a specific investment credit, with total IDA contribution estimated at US$8
million. The program is expected to involve four components, to be implementation over a
period of six years. The Samoa Agriculture Sector Strategy (TA) aims to support GoS' efforts in
developing a coordinated program to enhance the competitiveness of local produce for which
Samoa has a comparative advantage. Both projects would contribute to the preparation and
implementation of the GoS' Agriculture Sector Plan, and is closely aligned to the overarching
Global Food Crisis Response Program ("GFRP") Framework of the Bank.


LESSONS LEARNED

58.   The proposed operation reflects key lessons from Bank experience during the
previous Regional Assistance Strategy (RAS) in the Pacific (2006-2009):

       The Bank and other development partners have increasingly acknowledged the extent of
       vulnerability faced by Pacific Island Countries (PICs) to external shocks, and the capacity
       constraints that PICs face in responding to those shocks.


                                                21 
 
       From the Bank's experience with Samoa, it is clear that the GoS is a committed reformer,
       and has achieved substantial progress in recent years on improving governance and
       enhancing macroeconomic management. The GoS is on-track to achieve many of the
       MDGs. Previous projects implemented by the Bank in Samoa have demonstrated that the
       GoS is an able manager of development assistance and a reliable implementing partner.

       This DPC builds on the Bank's experience in the Pacific Region, on the importance of
       linking immediate policy actions with medium-to-long term growth strategies. The
       selected areas of policy action are those which have a demonstrable link with Samoa's
       future growth trajectory.

       Experience of implementing DPCs throughout the Bank has shown the importance of
       effective coordination among donors. This DPC was prepared in close collaboration with
       key donors and multi-lateral development agencies active in Samoa.

       Another set of lessons relevant to the proposed operation was drawn from the
       Independent Evaluation Group's (IEG) recent review of World Bank Group response to
       crises. The IEG noted that speed and quality of Bank response are crucial during and
       after crises, along with a critical need to customize policy advice to the country context ­
       lessons that provide a key rationale for preparing the proposed operation on a stand-alone
       basis, with a narrow focus on the pre-eminent issues now confronting policymakers in
       Samoa.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

59.     A number of analytical studies have provided the basis for government policy
direction and aided the design of the proposed operation. The World Bank has actively
collaborated with the GoS and other development partners on many of these analytical exercises
and this active engagement is expected to continue beyond the disbursement of the proposed
credit.

Poverty Analysis

60.     The UN conducted a "Poverty Analysis" on the 2008 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey (HIES). The report found that, excluding essential services to consider only food
requirements, the level of food poverty in Samoa decreased between 2002 and 2008, from 10.6 
percent to 4.9 percent of the population, with declines also experienced in some ­ but not all ­
rural areas. Over the same period, the proportion of the population with expenditure less than the
basic needs (including essential services) poverty line rose from 22.9 percent to 26.9 percent.
This overall increase in basic needs poverty was driven by rising levels of poverty in rural areas,
which offset poverty reductions in Apia and the surrounding region of North-West Upolu. The
lack of cash-earning opportunities for people living in rural areas was the major reason for this
                                                22 
 
rise in poverty. Between the HIES in 2002 and 2008, transport, electricity and communications
infrastructure and services were extended into an increasing proportion of rural settlements.
These newly-available essential services added to household expenditure requirements, while
cash-income earning opportunities did not increase proportionately. It was also noted that the
2008 HIES was held in a time of crisis, and the results are reflective of the global situation,
which is causing hardship and poverty to deepen in Samoa.

Migration Analysis

61.     The Bank has been leading the analysis, advocacy and implementation of labour mobility
schemes in the region. Currently, remittances from immediate and extended family members
comprise the main social protection mechanism for Samoans. Hence understanding its flows,
uses and costs has been an important undertaking. Advocacy for greater labour mobility for
unskilled populations began with a Bank report called "At Home and Away" in 2006. It has
been followed with robust engagement with stakeholders in the region and culminated in many
countries in the region, including Samoa, gaining access to the NZ labour market for its unskilled
population. The Bank has also followed with trade facilitation advice and assistance through a
regional IDF aimed at developing national capacity to manage the outflow of labour. In addition
the Bank is also working with central banks, commercial banks and money transfer operators in
Samoa to help reduce the cost of sending remittances by improving the regulatory environment
in order to facilitate the introduction of new innovative products. Some early success in reducing
this cost was very timely in the context of the tsunami when remittances to Samoa increased in
response to adversity at home. Given the continued importance of remittance as a source of
income to Samoa's society, enhancing labour mobility will likely enhance economic activities
and assist in protecting the vulnerable.

Public Bodies Reform Analysis

62.     With the passage of the Public Bodies Accountability Act and the SOE Policy, the
Government of Samoa established the principles by which it would place its SOEs on a
commercial footing, and divest non-strategic SOEs. In June of 2008, ADB published a report
titled "Consolidating Reform for Faster Economic Growth". The report assessed that the new
framework provides a sound basis for the restructuring of SOEs, the strengthening of their
corporate governance practices, and the creation of a privatization pipeline so that non-strategic
SOEs can be transferred to the private sector. Implementation of the new SOE framework has
been proven difficult for a number of reasons. SOE divestiture takes time even in the most
buoyant markets. In Samoa, where the domestic market remains small, it can be more
challenging still. While the smaller, more profitable SOEs should find ready buyers, others will
require some pre-privatization restructuring and/or carving out of viable business lines for sale.
The ADB recommends that the GoS should first carefully assess the divestiture prospects of each
SOE in the Government's portfolio, in order to prepare a more comprehensive SOE reform

                                               23 
 
strategy going forward. This backdrop has helped position the privatization-driven reform
efforts in the telecom sector which are included in this operation.

Public Financial Management Assessment

63.     Public Financial Management Reform in Samoa has been an ongoing, incremental
process. The government of Samoa initiated a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) assessment and in October 2006 the Public Financial Management Performance Report
was completed. Samoa ranks well in terms of its overall public financial management
performance when compared with other Pacific developing member countries. The PEFA gave
seven A scores and eight B or B+ scores to Samoa and identified many areas where Samoa
performed well. The key concerns identified in the PEFA assessment was the late finalization of
public accounts and the non disclosure of much development spending done outside the Treasury
fund in the notes to the public accounts. These concerns were fed into the government's Public
Financial Management Reform Plan (PFMRP), which has now successfully addressed these key
concerns and formed a part of the policy matrix for this operation.

Procurement Review

64.      An "Operational Procurement Review Report" was published by the World Bank in
2006. The report concluded that the level of procurement risk is Samoa is average, with the
main concern being the limited number of Government officials who have experience in
managing procurement. As a result of the review and an Action Plan was developed and agreed
with the GoS. Consistent with the Action Plan and in response to a request from the GoS for
assistance in reforming the procurement areas, the World Bank provided an IDF grant to support
procurement reforms and capacity building efforts. These efforts provide a suitable policy and
institutional setting for this operation.

Tsunami Damage and Loss Assessment

65.     Post the September 29 tsunami, the World Bank led a joint donor "Post Disaster Damage
and Loss Assessment (DaLA)" to estimate the impact of the tsunami on Samoa. The assessment
identified damages of US$85 million and losses of US$39 million. It is estimated that around 65
percent of the damages and losses will be borne by the private sector with the remainder borne
by the public sector. The tsunami disaster has affected the different economic sectors in different
ways (see Table 4), in particular:
     Transport sector was the most affected in terms of destruction of physical assets,
        especially the coastal roads running through the south and southeast part of the Upolu
        Island. Total damages to the transport sector estimated at US$29 million or 35 percent of




                                                24 
 
              total damages. The LTA10 has already completed works of around US$1 million on
              urgent clean-up and recovery, activating its on-going road maintenance contracts. The
              report commented that such measures were a rapid and effective response to the disaster,
              which restored access of affected roads to workable status so that rescue and
              humanitarian activities could be carried out. LTA's response has likely kept the economic
              losses due to roads substantially low. In response to the disaster, LTA has also proposed a
              detailed upgrade and reconstruction plan on existing roads.

              Tourism is identified as one of the most important economic sectors in Samoa with
              expanding momentum. Before the tsunami, the tourism sector contributed some
              14 percent of GDP with more than 130,000 non-residents arrivals annually. Tourism is
              also the largest commercial earner of foreign exchange and estimated to employ 10
              percent of the population. The tsunami is estimated to have damaged a quarter of total
              available accommodation, mostly low-end fales. Moreover, loss of revenue from the
              tourism sector, due to loss of confidence by tourists, is expected to be significant,
              accounting for US$22 million or 56 percent of total losses. A series of policies have been
              proposed to facilitate the recovery and reconstruction of the sector.

              Agriculture, while not the most affected economic sector, plays an important role in the
              economy of Samoa; close to 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas and the
              agriculture sector employs two-thirds of the labour force. The report identified total
              damage and losses of US$14 million, to be borne fully by the private sector. The report
              highlighted that the livelihoods of those living in the regions affected by the tsunami were
              heavily dependent on semi-subsistence agriculture and fisheries, therefore the loss in
              productive sectors could threaten food security and cash income.


66.     Going beyond the immediate impact, the recovery and reconstruction cost over the next 5 
years is estimated at US$167 million. Approximately two thirds of this cost is required to re-
establish ­ that is, build-back housing and facilities ­ with the remaining approximately one third
of the cost incurred in relocating villages to new inland sites. The expenditure required from the
public sector over the next five years is estimated at around US$94 million with more than half
required in transport. The report highlighted that the current post-tsunami relocation pattern of
communities is considerably more dispersed than traditional villages in Samoa; this could result
in more capital investment requirements for the provision of services and consequently higher
recurrent expenses on infrastructure networks. The DaLA assisted the Government of Samoa in
formulating its recovery plan post tsunami. Both the Government's rapid tsunami response and
financial support for reconstruction form part of the policy matrix for this operation.
                                                            
10
    Land Transport Authority (LTA) was established in 2008 to ensure a coordinated planning and regulation of
land transport. The LTA's responsibilities include road maintenance. Planning and regulation of other transport
modes is undertaken by Ministry of Work, Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI).

                               V.       THE PROPOSED OPERATION

67.    The proposed operation is a single tranche Credit of SDR 13.2 million. The
operation will support policy and institutional measures that will help Samoa sustain its reform
momentum and recover more quickly from the shocks it has suffered in recent years. In the
wake of these exogenous shocks, the GoS has worked with the donor community to identify
funding for the fiscal gaps it has been confronting. Consideration of this operation began in mid-
2009, in the context of the impacts on Samoa of the global food and fuel crisis and the global
economic crisis. The operation was then adjusted, to account for the devastating tsunami that hit
Samoa in September 2009. Resources from the proposed operation will provide the GoS with
the needed fiscal space to respond to the economic impacts of the global recession and the recent
tsunami, while maintaining traction on key medium-term economic reforms. This operation is
being complemented by a package of other support from the Bank, both for tsunami-related
reconstruction needs and for medium-term development priorities in the areas of disaster risk
reduction, health, telecommunications and agriculture.

68.    In support of the GoS' program for tackling the impacts of these crises, the proposed
operation supports actions related to: (i) economic recovery from the impacts of the global
economic crisis and the tsunami; (ii) protecting the vulnerable; (iii) public financial management
reform; and (iv) public enterprise reform to strengthen infrastructure service delivery. The

                                                   26 
 
actions related to near term economic recovery are designed to support the development of a
costed and prioritised program, which will ensure that affected areas are rehabilitated in a timely
manner, essential services are maintained, and adversely hit businesses recover. While
responding to immediate tsunami-related priorities (supported by (i) and (ii)) the government has
remained on-track with its medium-term reform agenda (supported by (iii) and (iv)) articulated
in the SDS and related government policy documents. These reforms, supported under the
proposed operation, could well have been set back with the government's attention diverted to
managing immediate crisis impacts. The reforms will aid Samoa's recovery from the adverse
impacts of the global economic crisis and the tsunami. In addition they will ensure that by
strengthening fiscal management the government adheres to sound practices at a time when
expenditures need to be ramped up to support the recovery and protect the vulnerable.

69.    The specific actions supported under these four areas are described in the following
paragraphs. All actions are "prior actions" in that they have been completed (Table 5).


                                   Table 5: Summary of Prior Actions
 


Economic Recovery from the Impacts of the Global Economic Crisis and the Tsunami
   1. The Recipient's Legislative Assembly approved a supplementary budget to finance the costed
      and prioritized expenditures of the ERP pursuant to the terms of the Recipient's Appropriation
      Act No. (1) 2009/2010 dated January 19, 2010.
    2. The Recipient has made available to tourist operators affected by the Tsunami a credit line to
        be operated by its Development Bank as set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding
        entered into by the Central Bank of Samoa and the Development Bank of Samoa on December
        18, 2009.
Protecting the Vulnerable
   3. The Recipient has waived primary school fees in public, mission and special needs schools,
        effective February 2010, pursuant to the terms of its Cabinet Directive FK (09) 47 dated
        December 23, 2009.
Public Financial Management Reform
    4. The Recipient has finalized all the pending audits of its public accounts and has submitted the
       accounts for the financial years 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 to its Audit Office on
       December 15, 2009.
   5. The Recipient has taken steps satisfactory to the Association to make operational the financial
        autonomy of the Land Transport Authority.
Public Enterprise Reform to Strengthen Infrastructure Service Delivery
    6. The Recipient has issued Cabinet Directive FK (09) 18 dated May 20, 2009 with instructions
       to proceed with the legal steps required to grant administrative autonomy to the Office of the
       Regulator on matters related to employment of staff.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC
CRISIS AND THE TSUNAMI

Prior Action 1: The Recipient has approved a supplementary budget to finance the costed and
prioritized expenditures of the early recovery program.

70.     The tsunami of 29 September 2009 left a reconstruction bill likely to exceed 30 percent
of Samoa's GDP, with the cost to be borne by the GoS being some 22 percent of GDP. This
includes the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation, population resettlement and maintaining access
to social services. To begin the reconstruction process the GoS has developed an early recovery
program (ERP). This early recovery program has been based on the assessment report of the
impact of the tsunami, prepared by a team of donor partners led by the World Bank, in
conjunction with the Samoan authorities, and in consultation with the private sector and the
affected communities.

71.     In order to secure resources to fund the ERP, through the proper authorizing channels, the
GoS prepared a supplementary budget for the full cost of the early recovery program ­ some 73
million tala (US$ 29 million). This supplementary budget was endorsed by Cabinet in December
2009 and passed by Parliament in January 2010. This budget allocation provides for the first
stage of the post-tsunami recovery, which covers high priority reconstruction efforts that will be
carried out in the first six months of the post-tsunami recovery period. Subsequent budgets will
need to allocate funds for the secondary stages of these reconstruction efforts and for lower
priority recovery activities which were not included in the early recovery program. This latter
stage of the post-tsunami recovery is expected to take approximately two years, depending on the
absorptive capacity for spending of the relevant implementing agencies in each sector (including
their administrative, procurement and financial management capacities).

72.     The ERP is focused on the crucial aspects of the reconstruction process. These include
maintaining access to essential services, restoring infrastructure services, rebuilding agricultural
and fisheries livelihoods,11 and rehabilitating the environment while increasing its resilience to
future natural disasters. (Details of each of these elements of the ERP are provided in Annex 7.)




                                                            
11
    The livelihood benefits provided by the recovery actions under this agricultural and fisheries program will be
secured via complementary medium and long term agricultural development activities in Samoa, which are also
being supported by the Bank. In addition to technical assistance, which is being rolled out in FY2009/10, the Bank is
providing Samoa with a credit of nearly US$8 million to strengthen the supply side of agriculture, as well as to
improve the GoS' provision of market-oriented infrastructure. Combined, these projects are closely aligned with the
Bank's overarching Global Food Crisis Response Plan (GFRP).

                                                               28 
 
Prior Action 2: The Recipient has made available to tourist operators affected by the Tsunami a credit
line to be operated by its Development Bank.

73.     As the largest commercial activity in Samoa, the recovery of tourism is critical to the
rebuilding of livelihoods and the restoration of economic growth in Samoa.12 There are several
elements of the GoS' plans to assist commercial recovery and restore the cash incomes of people
employed in tourism and tourist-related businesses. The first element is a marketing campaign to
promote the resumption, accessibility and advantages of tourism in Samoa. The Supplementary
Budget for 2009/2010 allocated ½ million tala for this aspect of the tourism sector recovery
strategy.

74.     The second element is the launch of a new Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) lending facility
or credit line for the Development Bank of Samoa (DBS). The credit line is targeted at the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of key tourism resorts as well as beach fales that were destroyed
and/or adversely affected by the tsunami. The CBS loan to the DBS is for the amount of 5
million tala, on a term of five years, at an interest rate of 3 percent per annum, and with a
principal and interest grace period of twelve months. The DBS, which is reputed to have good
local knowledge for screening loans, will on-lend these funds to the tourism operators that were
affected by the tsunami at an interest rate of 8 percent per annum and, on a case by case basis,
with grace periods of up to twelve months for principal and interest repayments. The facility
became available through the DBS in January 2010. By providing this credit line through the
DBS, the CBS will be able to ensure that funds are channelled to the tourist operators that need
them, in a timely manner. This mechanism has become necessary, because commercial banks in
Samoa have proven themselves unwilling to provide loans even to viable tourist operators, due to
a high level of risk aversion within those commercial banks. In recent years, the CBS's concerted
efforts at easing monetary conditions have not been effective in encouraging lending by these
commercial banks. Instead, they have remained highly risk averse as a result of their fear of non-
performing loans related to their lending during the boom years. The risk of a rise in the non-
performing loans of the DBS from this credit line is mitigated by its aforementioned local
knowledge, underpinning its capacity to screen loans, the time-bound nature of the credit line,
and its application to tourist operators who were already established prior to the tsunami. The
IMF has also viewed favourably the need for such a scheme in order to ensure the rapid recovery
of Samoa's vital tourism sector.

75.     This CBS-DBS credit line will be complemented by two facilities being provided to
tourism operators in Samoa, with support from NZAID. The private sector support facility will
assist small-scale tourism operators and general commercial operators in tourist areas affected by

                                                            
12
       Tourism receipts comprise 20 percent of Samoa's GDP.

                                                               29 
 
the tsunami (beach fale, budget accommodation, and non-accommodation tourist support
services), through the provision of small grants enabling them to rebuild their businesses.
Recipients will need to incorporate essential risk reduction and mitigation aspects of improved
construction methods and materials that are compliant with the national building code, PUMA
environmental safeguards, and Samoa Accommodation Standards. Thereby, their vulnerability to
damage from natural disasters will be reduced in future. This action thus provides an opportunity
to ensure that established standards, which were often only partially met in the past, are indeed
adhered to. The second facility, the concessional finance scheme, will provide an interest-rate
cushion to the five large tourist accommodation operators in the area affected by the tsunami, via
commercial banks.

PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE

Prior Action 3: The Recipient has waived primary school fees in public, mission and special
needs schools.

76.     The GoS, through its Education Strategic Policies and Plan 2006-2015 (ESPP), had
committed to the Millennium Development Goal of achieving universal primary education by
2015. Given the hardship imposed on most households in Samoa due to the global commodity
price shocks and then the global economic crisis, the GoS had started to consider a waiver of
school fees to cushion vulnerable households.13 After the tsunami, this consideration took on
added urgency and the GoS launched the Samoa School Fees Grant Scheme (SFGS) in 2010.
Prior to the launch of the SFGS, Samoa was alone among Pacific island countries in charging
fees for primary school education.

77.     The SFGS will be of particular importance to children who are not enrolled in primary
school (approximately 550  children), and to primary school children whose families are facing
difficulties in paying fees. A waiver of school fees that applies to all primary schools (public
schools, mission schools and special needs schools) except for private schools,14 has the best
potential to reach all the vulnerable children. Prior to the launch of the SFGS in 2010, a thorough
awareness program targeted at parents has been conducted.

78.     Beyond excluding private schools, no further targeting mechanism is envisaged. Since a
targeting framework does not already exist in Samoa, as there are no social protection schemes
other than pensions for those over 65 years of age, it was deemed too costly to develop a
targeting framework, both in terms of its direct costs as well as administration and the resulting



                                                            
13
   School fees comprise approximately five percent of household expenditures of the lowest quintile. Source:
HIES.
14
   Four percent of schools in Samoa are private schools.

                                                               30 
 
delays it would impose on the launching of the SFGS. Furthermore, the small size of the country
and the cultural context makes exclusion of certain households much more difficult.15

79.     To ensure the success of the SFGS, support for the schools through training on financial
control and accounting will be available from technical advisers hired by Samoa's Ministry of
Education. The SFGS has been launched in 2010, with donors having agreed to fund the SFGS in
the first two years of its operation.16 The GoS has committed to a mechanism whereby it will
gradually take over responsibility for funding the SFGS. Under this mechanism, the GoS will
fund 30 percent of the cost of the SFGS in year three, 50 percent of the cost in year four, and 70
percent of the cost in year five. By the sixth year of the operation of the SFGS, the GoS will be
solely responsible for its funding.

80.     This design has the potential to provide relief for parents to ensure that all children in
Samoa will be in schools thereby helping achieve universal primary education by 2015.17
Furthermore, the SFGS will result in overall improvements in completion rates, which in turn
will translate in the longer term to broader social and economic benefits. The base line to gauge
the success of the SFGS will be the 2006 data for enrolment (GER and NER), dropout rates,
repetition and transition rates.

PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REFORM

Prior Action 4: The Recipient has finalized all the pending audits of its public accounts and
has submitted the accounts for the financial years 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 to its
Audit Office.

81.     The PFMRP was established in November 2008 following an assessment of the GoS'
PFM systems. The first stage of the PFMRP covering the period 2008-2010 is focused on
strengthening systems to achieve fiscal discipline. Particular areas identified for strengthening
were the accounting, reconciliation and timeliness of annual financial statements; the timely
preparation and submission of public accounts; and regular reconciliation of bank accounts and
improved cash flow management. The PFMRP builds on previous capacity strengthening
                                                            
15
     The design of the SFGS should ensure that additional resources are provided to schools in poorer, rural areas,
and that these additional resources will be more than sufficient to accommodate the increased enrolments expected
in those schools. Historically, schools in poorer, rural areas have charged fees below the national average (for
example, only 50 tala per annum). Under the SFGS, all schools will receive 100 tala per student per annum, thus the
net result will be an increase in resources for schools in poorer, rural areas. These are also the schools expected to
receive the higher enrolments under the SFGS, hence they will be well prepared to meet the additional demands
placed on them.
16
     Australia has committed AUD$2 million and New Zealand will contribute NZ$1 million.
17
     The SFGS ­ drawing on the Tongan experience with administrative capacity constraints in implementing a
similar program ­ relies on a team of advisers to manage and develop the SFGS in the first three years. The
preparation of the Operational Handbook, which explains the purpose, processes and procedures of the SFGS, its
financial administration, the roles of the stakeholders, and the appropriate use of funds, also drew on the Tonga
experience with a similar program.

                                                               31 
 
initiatives including findings from the World Bank "Strengthened Approach to Public Financial
Management Reform".

82.    One of the clearly identified action items for the first stage of the PFMRP was to remove
the backlog of work on reconciliation of public accounts for the 2006/2007 financial year and to
introduce mechanisms to prevent any future backlogs. The target completion date for this action
was October 2009, with a key performance indicator being the number of months taken from the
end of the financial year for submission of public accounts to the Audit Office. By December
2009, public accounts were submitted for financial years 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009,
thereby achieving this target in a reasonably timely manner despite facing a series of exogenous
shocks. Additionally, existing systems, structures and manuals have been reviewed and new
mechanisms are being setup in order to prevent any future backlogs.

83.     Capacity building efforts in this area have included updating and documenting processes,
changing mindsets for adopting and working with a new system, improving the skills of
managers, reviewing and correcting figures to improve the accuracy of the public accounts data.
As part of the implementation of the PFMRP, a cash management committee has been
established in order to develop effective cashflow monitoring and management. Since August
2009, the committee has been meeting on a weekly basis to monitor the cashflow situation and
there has been an improvement in development of weekly cashflow spreadsheets and bank
reconciliation.

Prior Action 5: The Recipient has taken steps satisfactory to the Association to make
operational the financial autonomy of the Land Transport Authority.

84.     As part of the ongoing reforms of the Ministry of Works Transport and Infrastructure
(MWTI), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) was established in June 2008. The Bank has
supported these reforms under the Infrastructure Asset Management Program (IAMP). Following
the success of the first phase of this project, the IMAP is now in its second phase. The flexibility
provided to the LTA through granting of operational and financial independence should enable it
to better manage its resources to improve service delivery in the medium term, as well as right
now when it has had additional demands placed on it due to the tsunami. The government has,
however, ensured that this greater flexibility is balanced by appropriate accountability through
regular reporting.

85.     LTA was conceived as a lean, business-like and customer-focused organization financed
from a combination of its own resources and funds from GoS budget allocation. LTA was set up
to take over the transport licensing and regulatory functions of the Transport Control Board and
the road asset management functions of the MWTI. This has achieved the goal of separating the



                                                32 
 
transport sector planning and policy functions which are retained by the government, from the
program maintenance management and service delivery aspects which are handled by LTA.

86.     The first 12 months of LTA's existence were a transition period during which it was still
functionally under the umbrella of the MWTI. All operations including procurement and staff
followed the MWTI's systems and processes. During this transition period, an assessment was
made to confirm the financial management capability of the LTA through regular monitoring of
costs through quarterly reports. In December 2008, Cabinet issued a directive in respect of the
steps required to make the independence of the LTA fully operational, and to bring this transition
period to a close. The Cabinet directive concerned the transfer of staff, assets and records
previously under the control of the MWTI to the LTA, and also dealt with budgetary matters
pertaining to the financial independence of the LTA.

87.      Starting July 2009 the LTA was made independent, managing its own staff, assets and
records, and controlling its own budget. Thus, in the FY2009/10 budget, the LTA no longer
came under the MWTI. Indeed, the swift response to the tsunami was facilitated by this financial
independence which allowed the LTA to spend its own resources right away. The funding model
is that fees and charges relating to vehicle registration, driver licensing and fines are earmarked
for LTA and paid into a national road account. Fuel excise continues to be paid into general
revenue and funds are allocated to LTA as part of the budget process. However, a high degree of
accountability is ensured through the requirement that LTA submit quarterly and annual reports
consistent with the Public Bodies Act and the Public finance Management Act in Samoa. The
first quarterly report July-September 2009 has been submitted, and was judged to be satisfactory
by the SOE monitoring unit of the Ministry of Finance.


PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM TO STRENGTHEN INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE
DELIVERY

Prior Action 6: The Recipient has issued instructions to proceed with the legal steps required
to grant administrative autonomy to the Office of the Regulator on matters related to
employment of staff.

88.    Being a small remote island economy, lowering the cost of connectivity to economic
hubs in the region is critical both for the longer-term development of Samoa, as well as its
recovery from the recent crises. The 2005 Telecommunications Act, later amended in 2008, laid
the groundwork for liberalized telecommunications and postal services sectors in Samoa.
Consequent to the Telecommunications Act, the Office of the Regulator (OR) was established, a
second GSM licence was awarded, and SamoaTel was split into two entities ­ SamoaPost and
SamoaTel ­ with a view to preparing for the privatization of the telecommunications entity.


                                                33 
 
89.     Since its establishment in July 2006, the OR has, among other things, set up
interconnection rates, conducted spectrum management, issued licences (international gateway,
private network and cable), developed a universal access policy, and managed ASH cable
landing. Additionally, the OR is currently preparing a new cost-based model for interconnection
rates. However, its capacity to carry out its functions effectively has been severely constrained
by the absence of the technical and legal personnel required ­ particularly in respect of the
interconnection regime and related litigation. To address this constraint, the GoS has taken the
vital decision to issue instructions to proceed with the legal steps required to grant administrative
independence to the OR in the management of its human resources. These instructions were
provided by a Cabinet directive in May 2009. Once this administrative independence is granted,
all employees up to and including Principal level officers will be brought under the authority of
the OR (with the exception of contract employees who will remain under the supervision of the
Public Service Commission). Independence in the hiring and training of competent staff will go a
long way to enabling the OR to obtain and retain the right people to carry out its responsibilities,
so improving the overall capability and effectiveness of the OR.

90.     By strengthening the capacity of the OR to carry out its functions effectively, the GoS
will improve the regulatory environment and the level of certainty for private sector investment
in telecommunications services, paving the way for the successful privatization of SamoaTel.
Towards this end, transaction advisors have been engaged to review strategic options for the
privatization of SamoaTel and provide support to the Government throughout the transaction
process, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2010. These significant steps
will contribute to Samoa's end-goal of a liberalized telecommunications sector, in which
universal access is sustainable and high-quality telecommunications services are supplied to
Samoan businesses and people at affordable prices.

                            Box 1: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

    Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
    There is a strong country ownership of the program design given that it is mainly based on the SDS, which
    was prepared through a highly participatory and consultative process involving government agencies, the
    private sector, civil society organizations, church leaders and community groups. The SDS reflects a
    national commitment to improving the living standards of all Samoans, maintaining and improving their
    social welfare, and ensuring their long-term futures by protecting the environment. The strength of
    Government ownership of the proposed program is indicated by the successful completion of all prior
    actions to date. Extensive analytical work has informed policy formulation by the Government of Samoa.

    Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
    accountability framework
    The Government of Samoa and its key development partners have reached agreement on the reform themes
    that will attach to budget support. The process of formulating these reform themes has been closely
    coordinated among the Government and its development partners, with a joint initial appraisal mission
    conducted by the World Bank, ADB and key bilateral donors including Australia, New Zealand and the
    EC. These institutions and donors intend their dialogue and cooperation to be ongoing. The expected results
    of the program supported by the proposed Credit are detailed in the policy matrix.


                                                        34 
 
    Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
    circumstances
    The timing, modality and the scope of the proposed operation is customized to Samoa's current country
    circumstances. The design of the policy matrix has been backed by analytical work, and has been
    developed in consultation with the Government. Most of the prior actions represent discrete steps in
    ongoing government reform initiatives that are prioritized in the SDS. Donor coordination on budget
    support is expected to reduce the transaction costs for Samoa.

    Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
    The prior actions that have been chosen are focused on measures that are critical to achieving the objectives
    of the program and are central to the Government's reform agenda. The chosen policy measures were
    identified jointly with the Government and in close consultation with other development partners.

    Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
    financial support
    The Bank has cooperated closely with the IMF, ADB and key bilateral donors including Australia, New
    Zealand and the EC, in providing support the Government's reform program. Going forward, the Bank will
    continue to coordinate its activities with these institutions and donors, to support program implementation
    and to carefully monitor its progress and results on an ongoing basis.

                                VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

91.     The proposed operation will help to restore livelihoods in areas affected by the
global economic crisis and the tsunami, mitigating the rise in poverty. The ERP supported by
the proposed operation will provide essential services, rebuild infrastructure, and help re-house
the affected population. These measures are essential to protect the human development of the
people affected by the tsunami and to provide a foundation for their continued engagement in
economic activity. The ERP will also reequip households previously engaged in agriculture and
fishing with essential assets for these activities, provide extension services to them, and
rehabilitate the surrounding land and marine environments. This element of the ERP will enable
these households to rebuild the sources of food security and income generation they enjoyed
prior to the tsunami. The SFGS supported by the proposed operation will provide critical basic
needs expenditure relief to households in the affected areas, by removing the burden of school
fees from them. Protecting the human development of children in these already-poor areas of
Samoa will underpin the potential of these households to get out of poverty in long-term. Finally,
the credit-line facility will underpin the reconstruction and rehabilitation of beach fales and key
tourism resorts damaged by the tsunami, so spurring the rapid redevelopment of the tourism
industry that provides vital income-earning opportunities to the people in these areas. The
continued public financial management reforms will not only strengthen fiscal discipline, but
also set the stage for improving the quality of public services.

92.    The population affected by the tsunami were among the poorest in Samoa. The
tsunami-affected coastal regions of Upolu comprised approximately one-quarter the `rest of
Upolu' sub-regional category in the 2008 HIES ­ which already had the second highest rate of

                                                         35 
 
household poverty in Samoa prior to the tsunami. Moreover, the tsunami disproportionately
affected the poorer regions of the `rest of Upolu', with households in the affected areas around
15 percent more likely to have been living in poverty than those in un-affected areas. Although
no measurement of poverty levels in these areas has been undertaken subsequent to the tsunami,
it cannot but be the case that poverty levels have risen considerably.

93.     Exacerbating the impacts of the global economic crisis, the tsunami undercut vital
livelihood strategies. Households in the areas affected by the tsunami had a greater reliance on
home-produced food for both food security and cash income generation than anywhere else in
Samoa ­ a reliance that was even higher among the poorest households. Thus, these households
were particularly vulnerable to the devastation of the agriculture and fisheries sector caused by
the tsunami. Some 28 percent of working-age people in the tsunami-affected areas were engaged
in agricultural and fishing activities, whether for domestic consumption or sale. Among the
remaining working-age people employed outside the home, the predominant activity was work in
tourism-related ventures associated with beach fales and other resorts on the southern coast. This
sector was also devastated by the tsunami, with one-quarter of its accommodation capacity
completely destroyed. The loss of tourism activity has compounded the damage to income-
earning opportunities from agriculture and fisheries, through the loss of a key market outlet for
produce.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

94.    The policies supported by the proposed operation would not have a negative effect
on Samoa's environment, natural resources or forests. The reforms supported under the
operation aim primarily at recovering from the tsunami, strengthening public financial
management, protecting the vulnerable at the national level, and spurring private sector growth,
and do not bear directly on environmental risks.   In fact, the post-tsunami recovery program is
expected to have some positive impact on the environment. For example, buttressing the
operational and financial independence of the LTA with an allocation of funding from the
supplementary budget would help ensure that environmental due diligence is adhered to even in
times of crisis. Better maintained roads may also make environmentally fragile areas more
accessible and less susceptible to degradation, while also allowing for faster environmental
cleanups after disasters. All works carried out by LTA contracts are subject to environmental
review and approval from the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment.

95.    The environmental sector recovery strategy in the post-tsunami recovery program
comprises three components. The first is an initial environmental assessment aimed at
providing a basis for ongoing monitoring of the affected areas (both terrestrial and reef/marine).
The second is a marine cleanup and debris removal program, which will remove debris from
beaches, low-lying areas and around settlements, as well as assessing and removing hazardous
waste. The third component will be coastal protection and ecosystem restoration activities. These

                                               36 
 
will include the cleaning and protection of coastal water sources, the replanting of coastal areas
for conservation purposes, and the creation of mangrove zones and conducting of coastal
protection works for affected areas and other vulnerable areas, to reduce vulnerability to rapid
onset events.


IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION, AND CONTINUED
ENGAGEMENT

96.    The existing institutional structure for budget coordination in Samoa will be used to
implement and monitor the policy areas supported by the proposed Credit. The Ministry of
Finance will provide overall guidance for the budget support programme, and will assume
overall responsibility for coordinating the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the
proposed operation. The Ministry of Finance will also be ultimately responsible for reporting
progress and coordinating actions among other concerned government agencies.

97.     Specific indicators of the completion of prior actions under the proposed operation
are contained in Annex 1. It also sets out the indicators that Bank staff will monitor on an
ongoing basis, to gauge the performance of the GoS on follow-up actions relating to the policy
areas covered by the proposed operation.

98.     The Bank will make use of the detailed monitoring and evaluation system that the
GoS has already established for its SDS. The monitoring and evaluation matrix for the SDS
consists of a complete set of monitoring indicators and targets for each goal of the SDS,
identifies the data that can be used to measure progress towards their attainment, and allocates
responsibility for each area to a specific government agency. The associated system for
monitoring and evaluating progress towards the SDS goals comprises six-monthly internal
reviews and annual reviews ­ which are made public. To date, these six-monthly and annual
reviews have been completed in a timely manner.

99.    Through its broader future engagement with Samoa, the World Bank Group will
help to sustain the policy linkages between the proposed program and medium-term
development objectives in Samoa. This engagement will encompass infrastructure asset
management, health sector support, telecommunications sector development, agricultural sector
competitiveness, ease of doing business reforms and PFM. In addition, the Bank will continue to
coordinate its engagement strategy with the other key donors and international development
agencies that are active in Samoa.

       The early recovery program supported by the proposed operation in Samoa is
       designed, in part, to improve the disaster risk management capacity of the GoS and
       strengthen the resilience of Samoa's infrastructure to natural disasters. The

                                               37 
 
       medium-term benefits of the restoration and resilience-enhancement of infrastructure
       services can be augmented by strong capacity to manage infrastructure assets. The
       Bank's Infrastructure Asset Management Program (IAMP) is geared towards this end,
       with its focus on developing and sustaining effective asset management practices in
       Samoa and ensuring that Samoa's planning processes adequately consider the
       environmental impact of proposed developments. A further key element of the IAMP
       concerns the legislative and administrative framework within which the Land Transport
       Authority (LTA) operates. The financial independence of the LTA supported by the
       proposed operation will be complemented by the continued engagement of the Bank with
       the LTA under the IAMP.

       The early recovery program supported by the proposed operation in Samoa is also
       designed to sustain access to essential services ­ including health services ­ during
       the recovery period. The medium-term benefits of this sustained access to health
       services during the current crisis will be enhanced by the Bank's Health Sector
       Management Program (HSMP). Under the HSMP the Bank, in conjunction with AusAID
       and NZAID, will support the implementation of the GoS' five-year health sector plan and
       help strengthen its capacity to respond to evolving health challenges faced by its people.

       The granting of administrative independence to the Office of the Regulator,
       supported by the proposed operation, lays the foundation for providing regulatory
       efficacy and certainty to operators in the telecommunications sector in Samoa. To
       fully realise this potential, the Bank will continue to provide policy advice when
       requested and work with the Office of the Regulator to build its capacity to function
       effectively, under the Bank's assistance to the GoS for telecommunications regulatory
       reform.

       Through the early recovery program, the proposed operation supports the GoS'
       efforts to restore the livelihoods of people who depend on agricultural and fisheries
       activities. To link this livelihood restoration to a long-run positive growth trajectory for
       the agricultural sector, the Bank will continue to support the GoS to develop a sector
       policy that fosters competitive agricultural activities that respond to market signals in a
       timely manner. A loan package from the Bank, aimed at strengthening value chains for
       selected agricultural products in which Samoa has a comparative advantage, is under
       discussion.

       The World Bank Group, through the International Finance Corporation (IFC), will
       continue to monitor, evaluate and support Samoa's efforts to improve its investment
       climate and the ease of doing business. Samoa's new companies legislation is just one
       part of the reform efforts it is engaged in, to facilitate private sector development ­ with

                                               38 
 
       the performance measure in the SDS being improved scores under IFC's `Doing
       Business' indicators. In the past joint WB-IFC advisors have been placed in the field to
       work with the government and private sector on implementing business environment
       reforms. Similar technical assistance may be deployed again, if needed.

       The Bank will also engage in policy dialogue on debt management and PFM issues
       in Samoa. The Bank has recently conducted a DeMPA in Samoa and will follow up with
       recommendations that link into the broader PFM reform program that is underway in
       Samoa. The upcoming PEFA also provides an opportunity for deepening the policy
       dialogue on PFM issues.

       In addition to its own operations, the Bank will continue to engage with Samoa
       through the operations of other donors and international agencies with whom the
       Bank closely coordinates its activities. In this respect, NZAID will play a significant
       role in monitoring the operation and impact of the School Fees Grant Scheme (SFGS)
       supported under the proposed operation, and assisting wider education sector reforms in
       Samoa. AusAID will play a key role in monitoring improvements in public financial
       management and supporting ongoing reform efforts. And the ADB will offer significant
       support to the GoS' continued efforts to strengthen medium-term fiscal management,
       sector planning, and its alignment with the national development strategy.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

100. The fiduciary review draws on various analytical country inputs including the
Operational Procurement Review Report published by the World Bank and the EU-
commissioned PEFA in 2006. The 2010 PEFA which is currently being completed was not
available at the time of this assessment.

101. Samoa ranks well in terms of its overall public financial management performance
when compared with other Pacific developing member countries. The 2006 PEFA identified
many areas where Samoa performed well, including: (i) the budgeting system tends to be
realistic in terms of aggregate projections and outcomes, the budget documents capture virtually
all revenues and expenditures, and the quality of economic reporting is high; (ii) the budget
process is policy-based and actively engages all relevant stakeholders; (iii) oversight of the
budget and of fiscal risk is effective; and (iv) the budget is implemented in an orderly and
predictable manner, and there are significant controls placed on the release of public funds.
However, the PEFA also identified key areas of concern including the "late finalization of public
accounts and the non-disclosure of much development spending done outside the Treasury
Fund".



                                               39 
 
102. Significant progress has been made in PFM reform to date, including: a) clearance
of the backlog of the Public Accounts; b) agreement to include donor funding into the FY
2010/11 budget, and c) new procurement guidelines, which have been published and are
currently being piloted in some ministries. A number of international experts have been
employed in Samoa to assist in this reform. Future indicators of the success of the PFM reforms
could include the continuation of timely tabling in Parliament of the Public Accounts and the
complete roll out of the new procurement guidelines. The PEFA had also identified the areas of
lower performance such as cash management, bank reconciliation and financial reporting, which
the Government has been addressing under its PFMRP.

103. Samoa has demonstrated strong past performance in managing donor funding and
repayment of loans. The country rated 56 out of 180 countries in the 2009 Transparency
International Corruption Perception Index. This was the highest rating of the Pacific Island
nations. Samoa also has a sound PFM legal basis through the Constitution and the Public Finance
Management Act 2001. The Government has committed to complete the implementation of
major PFM reforms, including the computerization and standardization within ministries of the
accounting and reporting system, increasing competition in the telecommunications sector and
reduction in the backlog of reconciliation of public accounts and the introduction of mechanisms
to prevent any future backlogs. However Samoa is a small isolated nation and its economy
remains vulnerable. Recently it is has been impacted by the food crisis, global economic crises
and most recently the tsunami.

104. Based on a review of the documentation available and the Government's
commitment to PFM reform as outlined above the PFM environment risk is rated
Moderate.

105. In terms of the foreign exchange environment, there is no current IMF Safeguards
Assessment on Samoa's Central Bank due to the time since Samoa has accessed IMF
Funds. However the Central Bank of Samoa had committed to undergo a Safeguards
Assessment, and external auditors have been authorised to hold discussions with IMF staff as
part of the IMF's SDR 5.8 million financial assistance under its Rapid-Access Component of the
Exogenous Shocks Facility. The Central Bank of Samoa publishes its annual report together with
the audited accounts and the report of the Independent Auditors on those accounts. The financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
The 2008/09 annual report has been published and the audited financial accounts were
unqualified.

106. The Central Bank of Samoa has an established Revaluation Reserve Account, which
provides an additional buffer for any foreign exchange losses and maintains foreign reserves
composed of a basket of currencies reducing the sensitivity to exchange rate risk as movements


                                              40 
 
form these currencies generally offset each other. While there is no indication from the IMF of
substantial issues within the foreign exchange environment, without a Safeguards Assessment
there is insufficient information available at this time to draw any substantiated conclusions on
the foreign exchange risk.

DISBURSEMENT, AUDITING AND MITIGATING MEASURES

107. The proposed credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy credits. The untied finances will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once
the credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the credit will be
deposited by IDA, at the request of the Borrower, into an account dedicated by the Borrower and
acceptable to the Bank at the Central Bank of Samoa. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the
deposit of the credit funds into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower's
budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank.

108. In addition to the credit funds being deposited into a dedicated account an audit will
be required on the dedicated account. These mitigation measures are deemed necessary due to
the absence of an IMF Safeguards Assessment. The mitigation measures proposed are to ensure
that the DPC funds disbursed by the Bank are deposited into the dedicated account and then an
amount equivalent to the DPC is credited to an account of the government available to finance
budgeted expenditures. The audit of the dedicated account should cover the following: (i) the
accuracy of the summary of the transactions of the dedicated account, including accuracy of
exchange rate conversions; (ii) that the dedicated account was only used for the purposes of the
operation and that no other amounts were deposited into this account; and (iii) that payments
from the dedicated account were in a timely manner (normally within 30 days of disbursement)
transferred to an account available to finance budgeted expenditure. The audit of the dedicated
account would be required to be received by IDA within six months of the DPC having been
disbursed to the Government of Samoa.


RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

109.   The main risks and their associated risk mitigations measures are the following:

       Delayed fiscal consolidation. The fiscal cost of dealing with the impact of the global
       economic crisis is very large, and has been exacerbated by the recent tsunami. The deficit
       for FY2009/10 is projected to be some 10 percent of GDP. The risk is that the needed
       fiscal consolidation, i.e. return to the government's deficit target of 3 percent of GDP,
       may be delayed. The concessional resources provided through this operation will be a
       welcome cushion in the government's strained fiscal situation. The government's

                                               41 
 
       continued commitment to making progress on its medium-term expenditure framework
       (MTEF) and public financial management (PFM) reforms should help mitigate this risk.
       The recent IMF Article IV consultations and the joint debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
       have also provided analytical inputs to inform the government's fiscal consolidation
       efforts.

       A weaker than anticipated global recovery. A deeper or longer downturn than anticipated
       in the current global context represents a risk, contingent on developments in partner
       country economies such as Australia, New Zealand and the US who are key to the flow
       of tourists as well as remittances into Samoa. One mitigation strategy is to ensure the
       rapid recovery of Samoa's critical tourism sector, which has been supported by the
       proposed operation. A further mitigation strategy is to continue the implementation of
       reforms that encourage private sector development, including through better
       infrastructure and more efficient telecommunications. The GoS has shown commitment
       to making progress in these areas some of which are also supported under the current
       operation.

       Capacity constraints of the Government. Public sector capacity constraints are typical in a
       small, remote island economy such as Samoa. The global economic crisis has stretched
       the GoS' capacity for reform efforts and placed greater demands on service delivery, a
       situation exacerbated by the recent tsunami. The risk is mitigated through the co-
       ordinated approach taken by the Bank and other donors to support the government-led
       recovery framework. This will provide both technical and financial assistance to the
       government while at the same time minimizing transaction costs of engagement.

                     Samoa ­ Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                          March 9, 2010

    1.      Samoa has suffered severe social and economic shocks. The September 2009
    Tsunami undercut prospects for a quick recovery from the global recession and saddled
    Samoa with substantial rebuilding costs. The impact on tourism, which accounts for 65
    perfcent of all export earnings, could be severe. As a result, GDP is expected to contract by
    about 3 percent in 2010 and the current acount deficit is set to widen significantly (Table 1).
    The outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty, given the scale of the damage.

    2.     The authorities' immediate disaster response has been swift. The government's
    economic recovery framework for four years through 2012/13 has a fiscal cost of about
    US$100 million (18 percent of GDP). To cover the first quarter of this framework, the
    government adopted a supplementary budget for FY2009/10 in December 2009 which is fully
    funded by grant and concessional loans.

    3.       The government is committed to minimize the overall fiscal burden and capacity
    risks arising from its rehabilitation program. Beyond 2009/10, existing spending plans
    should be reviewed, in consultation with key donors, to re-direct to the extent possible funds
    to infrastructure rehabilitation. This would reduce the remaining financial gap (about 6½
    percent of GDP) in the outeryears and mitigate likely administrative capacity constraints.

    4.        A debt sustainability analysis suggests that even with large deficits envisaged in
    2009/10-2011/12, the debt outlook remains favorable. To ensure fiscal sustainability, the
    government is committed to closing any remaining fiscal financing gap through external
    grants and concessional borrowing. Moreover, the authorities intend to reduce the fiscal
    deficit to less than 3 percent of GDP over the medium term. This would stabilize the net
    present value of public debt below 40 percent of GDP, providing room to absorb future
    shocks. However, with fiscal financing gaps possible over the medium term, additional
    expenditure restraints may be needed, if concessional resources are not forthcoming.

    5.       The authorities are committed to maintain the tala exchange-rate basket peg.
    The peg has provided a credible anchor during the recent global financial turmoil and helped
    inflation subside quickly after the food and commodity price hikes in 2008. Over a longer
    horizon, the tala does not appear to be out of line with economic fundamentals.

    6.      On structural policies, further SOE reform, land reform, and deepening the
    financial system will be key to enabling a vibrant private sector.

    7.       On December 7, 2009, the IMF disbursed SDR 5.8 million (50 percent of quota)
    under the Rapid Access Component of the Fund's Exogenous Shocks Facility in
    response to the tsunami. The 2010 Article IV consultations discussions were held March 2-
    6, 2010.

                ANNEX 7:        GOS EARLY RECOVERY PROGRAM

Included in the Early Recovery Program are the following elements:

1      Maintaining Access to Essential Services
The GoS is working to provide reticulated water to all of the affected population, support
the rebuilding of houses through site clearance and preparation, provide medical
treatment to those affected by the tsunami and restore public health services in affected
areas, and establish temporary schooling to accommodate the affected children while
relocating and reconstructing damaged educational facilities.

2      Restoring Infrastructure Services
The GoS is committed to connecting all reconstructed houses and commercial ventures to
electricity, restoring transport infrastructure ­ including roads, bridges and the protective
sea wall ­ and extending it to resettled communities, and repairing and relocating all
damaged public communications infrastructure.

3       Rebuilding Agricultural and Fisheries Livelihoods
Under this element of the ERP, the GoS will reequip farmers and fishermen with
essential assets for their economic activities ­ including through the provision of items
such as seeds, seedlings, tools, small livestock, and fishing equipment, and provide
extension services ­ including horticulture services, veterinary services and fisheries
services. As well as rebuilding the food security of the people in the areas affected by the
tsunami, this element of the ERP will help to avoid setting back the GoS' broader
agricultural policy objective of reviving agricultural competitiveness.

4      Rehabilitating the Environment and Increasing Resilience to Natural Disasters
In addition to completing solid waste removal, the GoS intends to undertake a
comprehensive environmental survey to assess environmental hazards and recovery
requirements, as well as to provide a basis for significantly improving Samoa's disaster
risk management capacities.
