Recovery\n            Support Credit Project for Samoa were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: the program demonstrated the potential for\n            increased use of budget support modalities in Samoa. The\n            program was successful in achieving important development\n            objectives, despite low monitoring effort and limited Bank\n            engagement in ongoing policy dialogue around program\n            implementation. Close coordination and engagement with other\n            donors in the identification of policy priorities is a\n            useful approach in sectors where the Bank has limited\n            knowledge and engagement. In the Pacific Island Countries,\n            the Bank does not have sufficient presence to maintain\n            in-depth knowledge of all sectors across all countries.\n            Development policy operations can be quickly mobilized and\n            achieve good results in the context of strong reform\n            momentum. With the Government's strong ownership of a\n            broad on-going reform agenda the Bank was able to identify\n            substantive and realistic policy actions to support through\n            the program within short timeframes. Project-level\n            engagement can assist in identifying key priorities to be\n            supported through policy operations. Prior project\n            engagement provided a vital foundation for design,\n            implementation, and monitoring of the program. Coordinated\n            management of international aid flows, in the context of\n            prudent fiscal policy, can provide vital support in\n            mitigating impacts of external shocks in small Pacific\n            states. Without the international support provided to Samoa\n            in responding to the global economic crisis and the tsunami,\n            the impacts of both would almost certainly have been more\n            extensive and longer lasting. Improved knowledge and data is\n            required to track the impact of reforms on the extent and\n            distribution of poverty in Samoa. There is a high degree of\n            confidence among the Government of Samoa and donors that the\n            program and broader policy response to the global economic\n            crisis and tsunami has positive impacts on the poor."}, "docdt": "2011-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
