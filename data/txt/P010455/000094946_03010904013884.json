is highly satisfactory.\n            Overall performance of both the world Bank and the borrower\n            is satisfactory. This project was the only Bank-funded\n            blindness control project in the world, apart from the River\n            Blindness Control Project in Africa. At the time of\n            preparation, therefore, the Project could not draw from\n            lessons from previous Bank experience. However, the Danida\n            experience of implementing similar pilot projects in India\n            provided valuable guidance, and many successful Danida\n            initiatives were incorporated into project design, as has\n            been pointed out earlier. The 8-year experience of\n            implementing the project yields lessons that would be useful\n            for other health sector projects in India. These lessons\n            include: developing guidelines that were effectively\n            implemented to involve nongovernmental organizations and the\n            private service in service delivery, particularly in the\n            peripheral areas, expanded the reach of the program in\n            previously underserved areas and proved cost-effective. The\n            development and utilization of monitoring tools such as the\n            Rapid Assessment Survey and the National Survey can help in\n            streamlining the program, identifying problem areas and\n            organizing an effective response. This project has been\n            leveraged to build the financial and management capacity of\n            the states and improve service delivery. This report also\n            makes the case for designing a context-specific package of\n            services for remote areas. The main stakeholders should be\n            involved in project design and beneficiary assessments\n            designed that address issues of gender disparity, low\n            literacy, poverty, and lack of motivation, and cultural and\n            social variabilities--which all can adversely affect\n            utilization of services. Operational lessons note the\n            disparity between project and non-project states that was\n            made more obvious by with additional funding and technical\n            assistance, and encourages the government to intervene to\n            balance this difference. The administrative, infrastructure,\n            and technical inputs of the project considerably\n            strengthened the capacity of the National Program for the\n            Control of Blindness (NPCB) to manage other emerging causes\n            of blindness such as refractive error, childhood blindness,\n            and glaucoma."}, "docdt": "2002-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
