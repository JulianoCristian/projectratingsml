                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Restructuring is now planned for March-April 2012. Reasons for this restructuring are summarized as follows: in light of the slow economic growth of Pakistan and corresponding
                         change of focus within NTCIP, resulting in the absence of political momentum around the NTCIP and almost negligible actual investment against the planned investment in NTCIP,
                         there is now a realization in the government to narrow the focus of the program based on the reassessed priorities (these being, PSDP rationalization for NTCIP Sectors, PR, NHA,
                         and PIA Reform, Ports Master Plan, Trucking Industry Reform, PACCS and Customs Reform, and National Transport Policy) leading to a revision of the Project Development
                         Objective and its results measurement framework.
