                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve performance of trade and transport logistics by facilitating: (a) the implementation of the National Trade Corridor
                         Improvement Program (NTCIP); and (b) the simplification and modernization of Pakistan' s international trade procedures and practices.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the final status of the project which is now going to be closed on the original closing date of December 31, 2013. The cancellation of part of the unused IDA funds
                         (about US$19 million) from the project is in progress now. This action will enable the Government of Pakistan (GoP) to reserve these funds for other (to-be-determined) IDA program
                         in Pakistan to be approved by the World Bank Board no later than June 30, 2014.

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                          Report No: ISR12975



                         There was no measurable achievement as to the Project outcome indicators. Because part (a) of the Project Development Objective (PDO) depended on the implementation of the
                         major infrastructure delivery program called the national trade corridor improvement program (NTCIP) that aimed to reduce the cost of trade and transport logistics and thus to
                         reduce to cost of doing business. But the NTCIP was not implemented by the GoP that took over power in 2009, hence substantially defeated the purpose of part (a), as no indicators
                         were there to be measured. For part (b) of the PDO, the simplification and modernization of Pakistan's international trade procedures and practices, some progress was achieved.

                         This the reason for the unsatisfactory rating of the PDO. On the implementation, the project lacked commitment at the higher political level and therefore, slow mobilization of staff at
                         the management units, lacked efficiency and lack of adequate and timely budget allocations for the respective components resulting in slow recruitment of consultants, slow
                         payments through-out most of the implementation period, hence the unsatisfactory rating. However, relating to the Intermediate Outcome Indicators, some sectoral studies on reforms
                         were completed such as- for Transport Sector: (i) a railways revitalization strategy was prepared for implementation; (ii) the trucking policy was updated in 2012; (iii) evaluation of
                         compliance with ICAO standards and recommended practices; and for the Trade Facilitation: (i) national trade facilitation strategy revised by UNCTAD; (ii) a comprehensive study on
                         gauging preparedness of Pakistan to achieve compliance with the future WTO TF Agreement was also conducted under the project; and (iii) transit operations and procedures- cargo
                         tracking; (iv) capacity building of freight forwarder's training; (v) study on disposal of abandoned cargo; and (v1) organized the Regional Trade facilitation conference in collaboration
                         with UNESCAP to promote trade facilitation in the region.
