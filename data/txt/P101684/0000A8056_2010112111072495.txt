                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation progress on Component-A (National Trade Corridor Management Unit under Planning Commission) is rated as moderately satisfactory. There has been a lack of
                         clarity over the role of the NTCMU, which has affected their ability to undertake the coordinating role so crucial in a program such as this. This primarily resulted from the fact that the
                         NTCMU was operating on adhoc basis without a full time permanent Project Director since inception. Concrete steps have been taken by Planning Commission to set the project on
                         the right track, starting with the appointment in June of a full time Project Director for the management unit. Implementation progress on Component-B (Trade and Transport
