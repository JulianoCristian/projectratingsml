                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation progress of the project is moderately satisfactory; as the implementation agencies have not yet completed the follow-up actions agreed during the June 2102
                         mid-term, and this has reduced the pace of project activities. As a result project disbursements have slowed down; the project only disbursed 3 percent in the period July-November,
                         2012. While it was expected that disbursements would temporarily dip during this period of restructuring, but, not to this extent. Delays in the following areas have had a critical
                         impact on progress: (a) absence of a project director for the Planning Commission's component focusing on transport policy and planning; (b) delays caused by the Ports and

                         the Planning Commission; and (c) delay in processing of the modifications to the PC-I. Having said that, some, but not enough, critical actions have been completed which could
                         improve the implementation progress in the coming two quarters. The Ministry of Commerce has revised, renegotiated, and signed its Consultancy Services Agreement with

                         Commission's section and further processing for approval from the competent authority. USD 9.4 million (38 percent) of the project financing is now committed. Of these USD 4.5
                         million (18 percent) have been disbursed. Another USD 6.7 million (27 percent) is under procurement. It is to be noted that once the restructuring of this project has been approved by
                         the World Bank's Board, the disbursement estimates will also be revised.
