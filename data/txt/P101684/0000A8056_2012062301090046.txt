                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government of Pakistan (GOP), through the Project financing, continues providing technical assistance towards the the development of a vision and policy for the various parts
                         of Pakistan's Transport Sector, including for facilitating trade transport. Since the last ISR, the GOP, through the project, has financed: (a) preparation of a Pakistan Railways Sector
                         Revitalization Strategy, including consultations with key stakeholders and labor unions of the Pakistan Railways; and (b) an update of the trucking sector policy. The Railways
                         Revitalization Strategy has been submitted by the Ministry of Railways to the Pakistan Railways Board for its review and clearance. The trucking policy update has also been

                         presented to a Committee of the Planning Commission for review. The Trucking Policy Implementation Study and the Railways Financial and Information Management System are
                         both under procurement. The Ports Master Planning Study for Pakistan is underway. The Planning Commission and the Ministry of Commerce have both written to the Economic
                         Affairs Division (EAD) to request the Bank to restructure the Project's Results Framework and its Project Development in light of the inability of the GOP to undertake the planned
                         complementary investments in the transport sector; which this technical assistance project was supporting. Details on the reasons for restructuring were provided in the last ISR, and

                         are reproduced as follows for easy reference. "In light of the slow economic growth of Pakistan and corresponding change of focus within NTCIP, resulting in the absence of political
                         momentum around the NTCIP and almost negligible actual investment against the planned investment in NTCIP, there is now a realization in the government to narrow the focus of
                         the program based on the reassessed priorities (these being, PSDP rationalization for NTCIP Sectors, PR, NHA, and PIA Reform, Ports Master Plan, Trucking Industry Reform,
                         PACCS and Customs Reform, and National Transport Policy) leading to a revision of the Project Development Objective and its results measurement framework." The restructuring
                         will provide for a more realistic target of providing technical assistance to support better planning and policy making in the transport sector with a view to primarily facilitating internal
                         and external trade in Pakistan. The Mid Term Review of the Project will be undertaken with the GOP between June 18 and 21, 2012; resulting in an agreement on the restructuring
                         paper and a date for submitting the same for the Bank's Board's approval. The restructuring will also include a reassessment and agreement on the required time extension.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank has decided to upgrade the likelihood of achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO) rating from unsatisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory as (a) the GOP
                         and the IAs are now committed to the restructuring before the end of June 2012 and (b) the circumstances surrounding the progressive unrealism of the PDO, as determined by the
                         Results Framework, were not within the control of the IAs.
