1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Context
1.      Pakistan’s economic growth accelerated during 2003-2007 due to services and
industrial sectors but faced both external and internal shocks starting in 2008, resulting in
a deteriorating macroeconomic environment. The Government of Pakistan (GoP) has
made efficient efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability and to ensure the economy is
put back on a path of sustainable growth. The government’s objective is to achieve
middle-income country status by 2030 with GDP of around US$ 700 billion and per
capita income of around US$ 4,000. The GoP aims to achieve this goal by:
(a) strengthening export competitiveness and reducing costs through supply chains; (b)
increasing factor productivity; (c) diversifying the agricultural and manufacturing sectors;
(d) expanding the high-tech and commercial sectors; and (e) developing Pakistan as a hub
of sub-regional connectivity.

2.      As a result, removing infrastructure bottlenecks was identified as a priority in the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 2006-2009) for Pakistan at the time of
conceptualization of the Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (TTFP II). It
was prioritized to support Pakistan’s rapid economic growth and in recognition of the
necessary role transport and trade logistics efficiencies play in supporting economic
stabilization, sustained growth and international competitiveness. The Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) also referred to Pakistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP-II),
which encompassed removing infrastructure bottlenecks through public-private
partnerships.

3.      TTFP II was one of several projects of a package supported by the World Bank to
help facilitate the government’s National Trade Corridor Improvement Program (NTCIP),
which was introduced in 2005 to improve national transport logistics, infrastructure and
services. The program was the outcome of prior analytical and advisory work of the Bank,
including in the Pakistan Transport Competitiveness Report (2006), which showed that
the inadequate performance of the country’s transport system was costing the economy 4
to 6 percent of GDP per annum. The NTCIP package included targeted investment
lending planned to support key reforms and to respond to the needs for improvement of
infrastructure and its operation. As a medium term transport master plan for the country,
the NTCIP provided a framework for donor engagement and was supported by the donor
community (including ADB and JICA). The Second Trade and Transport Facilitation
Project would help provide the analytical underpinnings necessary to implement the
reform agenda and facilitate the preparation of investments under NTCIP.

4.      TTFP II was a continuation and expansion of the 2001 Trade and Transport
Facilitation Project (TTFP I), which was completed in June 2006 and supported the


                                             1
reduction of average logistics costs from 11% of the national trade account in 1996 to
about 6% in 2006. The first Trade and Transport Facilitation Project was credited for
establishing trade facilitation as a core component of Pakistan’s international trade policy,
in the Ministry of Commerce’s Trade Policy of 2005-06 and 2006-07. It helped establish
the National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committee (NTTFC) both legally and
operationally, through the consultancy support of UNCTAD. NTTFC remains a public-
private institution with a mandate to foster dialogue and serve as an advisory body to the
government on trade and transport facilitation issues. During the project implementation
period, it became a valuable link between WTO negotiations and trade facilitation in
Pakistan; and the project successfully supported the development of medium term trade
and transport facilitation practices and procedures, including information flows,
documentation and related legislation. At project end, the need was identified to expand
these gains into more mature policy and institutional measures, and for NTTFC to
position itself as the focal point on trade facilitation in Pakistan while strengthening
linkages with the government’s NTCIP. A follow-up operation was set up in the form of
the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP), as the project’s implementing agency
for post-completion activities. At the same time, the Second Trade and Transport
Facilitation Project was designed to carry out the above identified objectives: to further
modernize traditional trade and transport facilitation practices and procedures in Pakistan.

Sector Issues

5.      Despite sustained economic growth from 2003 to 2007, improvements in the
transport sector were far from satisfactory. Transport sector issues encompassed within
road transport, railways, highways, civil aviation, trade facilitation, and logistic services
included the following: poor quality and unreliability of road transport services, resulting
in high road transport costs; loss of competiveness of railway to road due to long delays
and low speed; insufficient funding for the maintenance of highway networks and road
user complaints; cumbersome customs procedures remaining an obstacle to trade; civil
aviation still not fully developed despite levels of economic growth; ports in Pakistan
continuing to perform poorly and at high costs; logistic services unable to provide
value-added services.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.     The developmental objective of the project is to improve performance of trade
and transport logistics by facilitating: (a) the implementation of the National Trade
Corridor Improvement Program (NTCIP); and (b) the simplification and modernization
of Pakistan’s international trade procedures and practices.

7.     Key performance indicators in the PAD were:
       (a) Reduction in overall time of imported and exported goods
       (b) Reduction in overall cost of imported and exported goods




                                             2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

8.      PDO and Key Indicators were not revised during the project implementation
period. As referred further in the ICR, revision was discussed during the MTR and an
agreement was reached for level 1 restructuring, though it subsequently did not conclude.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries:

9.       This project was designed to support priority reforms to reduce delays, improve
quality, and reduce costs of transport. The main benefits of the project were expected to
be partly modernized, streamlined and simplified commercial trade and transport
facilitation practices and procedures. Initial beneficiaries of improved logistics systems
would be Pakistan's industry and commerce which would have better opportunities to
reduce their own costs of doing business, enhancing their competitive position on the
international markets. This would in turn and, under competitive pressures, reduce costs
to Pakistani consumers. Achieving all of the above was expected to create, in the longer
term, a powerful force that would foster more transparent and accountable institutions,
resulting in accelerated economic growth and faster poverty reduction.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.       The project has two components:

         National Trade Corridor (NTC)
         Trade and Transport Facilitation (TTF)

11.    National Trade Corridor (NTC) Component, USD 19 million: This component
supports the development and implementation of NTCIP, and comprises two sub-
components:

 i. Technical Advisory Services (USD 16.44 million): This sub-component includes
    studies and technical assistance to underpin key reforms in support of NTCIP and
    help assess and design prospective investments which are part of NTCIP. This
    Technical Assistance (TA) supported activities in ports, railways, road freight
    services, air transport, cool chains, transport logistics, energy logistics, and maritime
    services; and, also other activities under NTCIP such as program monitoring and
    evaluation, social and environmental concerns mitigation, and developing public-
    private partnerships.
ii. Project Coordination and NTC Component Management (USD 2.56 million): This
    sub-component supported the project implementation unit, the National Trade
    Corridor Management Unit (NTCMU), and included: coordination, supervision,
    monitoring and approval of the activities included in the Technical Advisory Services
    sub-component; consolidation of progress and reporting on activities of each sub-
    sector; quality control of procurement and financial management.




                                             3
  12.     Trade and Transport Facilitation (TTF) Component, USD 6 million: This
  component builds on the results achieved by the first Trade and Transport Facilitation
  Project (TTFP I), extending efforts to streamline and integrate trade data exchange and
  official controls, sustaining the public/private sector collaborative institutional framework
  and strengthening the domestic logistics industry. TTF has two subcomponents:
 i. Technical Advisory Services (USD 4.71 million): This sub-component included the
      Pakistan in the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations on Trade Facilitation
      as part of Pakistan's trade policy with a realistic program and results to be achieved
      within following activities: reassess and update the national trade facilitation strategy
      and assist the framework of NTCIP; strengthen cooperation mechanisms for
      international trade facilitation, and cooperation between public and private sectors at
      regional, national and local levels; analyze the trade documents and efficiency of
      trade procedures and of new facilitation instruments for trade, transport and transit
      with particular reference to negotiations under the umbrella of the WTO; analyze
      transit operations; undertake feasibility studies for investments in inland clearance
      facilities; evaluate performance of key sectors against benchmarks in the international
      trade transaction chain to measure improvements over time; provide capacity building
      to the private sector and selected public sector institutions; conduct small pilot project
      of transit tracking system, and provide ad hoc advisory services to NTCIP in trade
      facilitation-related areas.
ii. TTF Component Management (USD 1.29 million): This sub-component, which
      financed the Trade and Transport Facilitation Unit (TTFU) in the Ministry of
      Commerce (MoCe), included overseeing, monitoring, and evaluating the
      implementation of activities in the Technical Advisory Services sub-component.
 13.     The Planning Commission (PC) of Pakistan was assigned as the implementing
 agency for the NTC component; while the Ministry of Commerce (MoCe), with
 UNCTAD’s consultancy support, was responsible for implementing the TTF component.
 PC and MoCe were responsible for the overall implementation and coordination with
 other sector ministries/agencies in the Government and private sector.
 1.6 Revised Components

 14.       The project components were not revised.

 1.7 Other significant changes:
 15.    Change in Government. The project was designed in FY 2006/07 during a period
 of high GDP growth. By the time of the approval (May 12, 2009) and effectiveness
 (August 24, 2009) of the project, there had already been a major change in government.
 The economic revival of 2002/03-2005/06—which was the primary driver of the NTCIP
 and thus of TTFP II—was old news and there were serious concerns about Pakistan’s
 macroeconomic performance and growing fiscal constraints. The Government’s
 investment in development initiatives decreased.1

   Illustrating how public sector development spending evolved during that period: real Public Sector Development Program (PSDP)
 grew by 32 percent (on an average) annually in the period 2004-07, and contracted by 6 percent in the following period 2008-12 –
 with almost 16 percent annual contraction in the first two years of this period.




                                                                 4
16.     Change in Government’s Priority. With no real ownership at the top political level,
project implementation accountability suffered and project management degraded. For
almost two years, GoP did not indicate any clear strategy on how to take the NTCIP and
TTFP II forward despite efforts by the World Bank team, along with those of other major
donors (such as ADB who were also financing NTCIP activities). It was not until the
approval of the new economic growth framework in May 20112 that some discussions on
the future of the NTCIP resumed in earnest. The World Bank task team subsequently
initiated discussions with GoP on re-alignment of TTFP II with the new growth
framework in the form of project restructuring.

17.     Proposal for Project Restructuring. Two restructuring proposals were put forward
at different time periods: May 2012 and August 2013. The first discussions on project
restructuring started late 2010/early 2011 but stalled due to continual turnover in the
Planning Commission leadership. Upon two official requests from the Government (May
2012 and August 2013), the Bank team prepared two restructuring level 1 packages. As
explained further below, the process for the first restructuring in May 2012 was
withdrawn in December 2012 due to the inadequate and unrealistic scope including
disbursement projections. The second attempt for restructuring was also held back in
2013 due to non responsiveness of the government.

18.     Cancellation of Funds. The restructuring process was abandoned in December
2013 when a level 2 restructuring was concluded due to the project team’s inability to
complete the internal clearance requirements for a level 1 restructuring (legal, quality,
controller, RVP, etc) within the time left to the original project closing date. This
includes the absence of key financial submissions particularly for the NTC component
(outstanding IFRs and expenditures reporting). As a result, the credit amount to be
cancelled as part of the restructuring process could not be determined. Therefore, the
Bank proceeded with level 2 restructuring (ref. restructuring paper dated December 19,
2013) to cancel part of unused IDA funds from this Credit (XDR 12.5 million, i.e. USD
19.2 million equivalent) - to allow the EAD to reallocate the funds to another Pakistan
program.

19.     UNCTAD Contract: The UN agency’s Trade Division provided technical
assistance to the MoCe under the Trade and Transport Facilitation component. As part of
the discussions on project restructuring and re-prioritization of activities, an amendment
to the original contract (signed in 2008) was signed on November 14, 2012. The revised
work plan reflected a focus on regional and internal trade (from the international trade
focus with faraway markets that defined the initial project scope). The contract period
was extended up to June 30, 2015, while the project completion date remained December
30, 2013.



2
  The PC-1 revised growth framework (also referred to as the NFEG – New Framework for Economic Growth) was approved by the
Cabinet in May 2011. PC-1 stands for “Planning Commission Performa 1” of the GoP. While this is an internal GoP process, it has a
direct bearing on project implementation, as fund withdrawals should be within the budgetary allocations of the PC-1.




                                                                5
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1.    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
20.     Project Preparation. The project design incorporated a number of lessons learned
from the earlier Bank project: (i) public and private sector cooperation would be
leveraged for the success of trade facilitation initiatives through the NTTFC, providing
both a forum for dialogue and strategic leadership for the project’s trade facilitation
activities; (ii) independent project management units were instituted (NTCMU, TTFU)
and embedded in their respective IAs, to ensure effective cooperation across
stakeholders; and (iii) effective cooperation across line ministries would be ensured
through the establishment of the NTCMU, as the implementation arm of the Planning
Commission (PC), with a mandate to coordinate, facilitate, and monitor activities across
different sectors and line ministries.

21.      Additionally, the readiness filter was complied with at project appraisal, (i)
institutional arrangements were in place for both the NTCMU and TTFU, i.e. respective
Project Directors appointed, other key staffs recruited, and implementation manuals
adopted; and (ii) advance procurement conditions were met, i.e. contract with UNCTAD
was awarded in January 2008 under component B, and three RFP (of two required) were
issued before negotiations for consultants’ services under component A.

22.      Design. Several issues were identified with regards to the project design: (i) there
was a clear disconnect between the project outcomes and project outputs to measure the
impact within the timeline of this TA, i.e. result of the policy reforms supported by TTPF
II could only be effectively measured beyond the timeline of the project. In other words,
the project was only a vehicle for the policy and institutional reform agenda, not an end
in itself. The TA may, as a result, not have been the appropriate lending instrument; (ii)
the M&E framework was designed to measure outcomes of the NTCIP, not of this project.
This was evidenced by the fact that, (a) achievement of the key outcome indicators would
result from NTCIP policy reforms, which TTFP II was to support (listed in Annex 3 of
the PAD), and (b) achievement of intermediate indicator 1 required implementation of
NTCIP reforms. This led to the choice of global indicators as key outcome indicators
(based on the “Doing Business” surveys), and the weak linkage between project
outcomes and outputs was not conducive to a strong M&E framework for a TA of this
small scope. A better choice of DO and associated outcome indicators could have been
made at appraisal stage: a shortcoming that was recognized but not adequately addressed
until the mid-term review, which was scheduled one and a half year prior to the project
closing date.

23.     Participatory Processes. The project was prepared in a participatory manner with
the involvement of key stakeholders including government ministries, designated
government implementation agencies, local and district government units, development
partners, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and representatives from the private
sector. However, simultaneous events described above substantially changed the project
implementation environment.



                                             6
24.     Adequacy of Client Commitment at Entry. As part of the project design, the
establishment of the high-level project oversight mechanism, i.e. regular Cabinet
oversight meetings led by the Prime Minister, reflected the political support which was
foreseen for the project. The NTCIP was, in effect, launched by the Prime Minister in
2005. The program was mentioned in the Party manifesto ahead of coming to power in
2008, which appeared to confirm sustained high level political support despite changes in
government (including up to Board approval in August 2009). The new government held
the first NTCIP task force meeting after coming to power on November 20, 2008.
Depreciation of political commitment began to occur with the change in government, as
reported in the following sections on assessment of project implementation.3

25.     Assessment of Risks. A number of risks were identified in the Project Appraisal
Document, i.e. government commitment and capacity. However, the Bank
underestimated some of these risks, including inappropriate risk ratings,4 and no adequate
mitigation measures were adopted. One of the shortcomings is the absence of an M&E
framework for NTCIP, which should have been identified in the risk mitigation matrix
and should have been part of the Covenants or a condition of effectiveness, in order to
ensure its effective implementation.5 Additionally, the PAD acknowledges country risks
that are beyond the control of the project (incl. security, political, and macro-economic
risks), against which only project adjustments were foreseen on the basis of close
monitoring. The Bank mentioned in the PAD that the sustainability of the project is
closely related to the successful implementation of NTCIP. In other words, the failure of
NTCIP implementation would cause the failure of the TA.

26.    Quality at Entry. No quality at entry assessment of the project was carried out by
the Quality Assurance Group.

2.2 Implementation
27.    Implementation Arrangement for the NTC Component. A NTC Management Unit
(NTCMU) was set up within the Planning Commission to act as the Secretariat of the
NTCIP Task Force6 to coordinate the NTCIP initiative. The NTCMU was responsible for
the overall management of the project and specifically the management of the NTC
component in coordination with the sector ministries/agencies. The NTCMU was
responsible for overseeing the project and consolidating information on implementation



3
    This includes Cabinet oversight meetings not being held after the change in government.

4
    Government commitment and capacity should have been high instead of moderate, in view of the country context.

5
  A non-lending technical assistance was provided to set up a pilot monitoring, evaluation and decision support framework for NTCIP,
but was not adopted.

6
  A Task Force was set up under the chairmanship of the Deputy Chairman Planning Commission to provide overall policy guidance
on NTCIP. The Task Force included the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance, among other government Ministries and
Agencies, as well as development partners (incl. WB) and representatives from the private sector.



                                                                   7
of both NTC and TTF components and to report to the Government and the World Bank
on implementation progress.

28.    Implementation Arrangement for TTF Component. The TTF Unit (TTFU) was
created by the Ministry of Commerce to be responsible for the implementation of the
TTF component. The TTFU was to submit progress reports on the implementation of the
TTF component to the MoCe and the NTCMU for review.7

29.     Institutional and governance challenges: The implementation of the project
components was deemed generally unsatisfactory in terms of achievement of key
outcomes and objectives. The implementation of this project was challenged by a lack of
commitment at the higher political level (including negligible investment in NTCIP), lack
of project leadership at the level of the Planning Commission, and lack of strong
ownership at the ministry and agency level. This led to slow mobilization of staff at the
management units, as well as inefficient, inadequate and untimely budget allocations for
the respective components, including resulting in slow recruitment of consultants, and
slow payments throughout most of the implementation period. While the NTC
component (i.e. Component A) consistently provided unsatisfactory performance in the
achievement of the development objectives, progress of the Trade and Transport
Facilitation component (i.e. Component B) was nuanced with some achievements in
planned activities. 8 These main factors, which appear to have affected the
implementation of the project, are further explained below:

30.     Lack of government ownership and leadership. Although the NTCIP Task Force
meetings continued to reflect the interest of the line ministries in the program at project
effectiveness, the implementation of the NTCIP had already slowed down considerably
since 2008. Project documents report that interest and ownership of the line ministries
began to wane particularly after the 13th NTCIP Task Force meeting held in December
2009 – as evidenced by the 15 months gap before the next convening. 9 Due to the
deteriorating macroeconomic situation and ongoing energy crisis, NTCIP was no longer a
key focus but investments continued and reforms were initiated under NCTIP until
2010. 10 Two developments subsequently affected the commitment of the PC in the
delivery of the NTCIP program: (i) the lack of continuity in the top management of the
Planning Commission and appointment of a new Deputy Chairman in 2010 whose
interest in the program was weak; 11 and (ii) the introduction of the New Growth


7
  Continuing from the previous TTFP-I, the NTTFC, a Standing Committee of MoCe, was re-constituted by the GoP. NTTFC
consisted of representatives from various ministries, public and private institutions/organizations and from development partners with
observer status. It was chaired by the Secretary/Additional Secretary Commerce. The project was meant be set up to build the capacity
of NTTFC to lead the public/private dialogue on trade facilitation and to progressively develop the skills to deliver advisory services
to the logistics sector.
8
  For a detailed list of achieved outputs by component, refer to Annex 2.
9
  The 14th NTCIP Task Force meeting was held on April 8, 2011 (source: ISR Sequence 5, created 16 May 2011).
10
    As reported in ISR Sequence 4 (created 21 September 2010), earlier, with support from the Cabinet, the Planning Commission had
been successfully managing and coordinating the implementation of the NTCIP. The pace slowed down considerably since 2008,
when leadership of the program lost pace (due to the reasons explained above).
11
    ISR Sequence 4 (created 21 September 2010) reported that, since 2008 and up to the period under reporting, four different Deputy
Chairmen had assumed office.



                                                                  8
Framework of 2011, which contested the validity of the previous reliance on public
investment as the main driver for growth and shifted towards a focus on private sector-led
investments; 12 this affected investment and political commitment to the NTCIP.

31.      Weak Project Leadership and Decision Making. The lack of government
ownership and leadership was further reflected in the NTCMU’s (i) weak implementation
and coordination capacity. In particular, coordination between line ministries (NTC
component) and TTFU was not successfully achieved, despite incorporation of this
“lesson learned” from the first Bank project through the establishment of the NTCMU
itself; and (ii) poor decision making, a significant shortcoming given the NTCMU’s lead
project coordination role. For several years after appraisalinception, the NTCMU
operated on an ad hoc basis without a full-time Project Director,13 which provided no
clear direction and guidance to the operational team or to the TTFP II project as a whole.
Although the situation improved after the appointment, the Project Director was not able
to exercise complete independence in managing day to day operations, which further
affected project implementation.14 Similarly, under the TTF component, lack of decision-
making and coordination affected the implementation of many TA recommendations
proposed by the NTTFC through the support of UNCTAD. There were held up in
ministries and government organizations because of procedural requirements. For
instance, the revised National Trade Facilitation Strategy prepared by UNCTAD during
the first half of 2012 was still not approved for circulation by project completion.

32.     Ineffective supervision. The high turnover of World Bank task team leaders, i.e. 4
TTLs during implementation, was not conducive to resolving the bottlenecks during
project implementation. This resulted in indecisive action on the part of the Bank team
when it came to restructuring the project early on during the implementation process,
when strong indications showed lack of government commitment to the NTCIP program,
which was abandoned. Lack of risk taking undermined the Bank task team’s efforts in the
context of the government’s lack of commitment both to the program and to the
restructuring process of this project. Additionally, the relationship between the IAs and
the Bank team appeared stronger with TTLs based in the country during the first years of
project implementation (up to mid-2012), when modest project gains were achieved. It
appears that the project may have suffered from a lack of coordination between the Bank
and the Client in the latter years when the TTL was based in Washington, DC.

33.    Weak technical and fiduciary capacity of implementing agencies. Under the NTC
component, the Government’s (i) technical capacity to act as advisory services, prepare
good terms of reference, review the studies and implement recommendations; and (ii)
procurement capacity to select and mobilize consultants, appeared to be weak early on in
the project. As of the supervision mission of February 8 to 28, 2011 only two
consultancies had been awarded by NTCMU (i.e. the Pakistan Railways Consultancy on
FIS/FMS, and the Civil Aviation Authority consultancy on ICAO Safety and Regulatory

oversight gap analysis). The process for the selection of other consultancies had been
stalled since November 2010: the three large studies identified during appraisal were
stuck at negotiation stage (i.e. Pakistan Ports Master Plan, Trucking Policy
Implementation Strategy, and Inland Water Transport Feasibility study). Out of these
three, only the Ports Master Plan Study was subsequently awarded as of July 2011.
Therefore, weak procurement capacity remained an issue throughout the entire project
implementation period, despite procurement training being delivered to the PMUs and
line Ministries in April 2008, March 2009 and October 2010. In addition, the approval for
procurement-related matters required clearances at various levels, which further delayed
project implementation.

34.     Stalled restructuring process. Discussions on project restructuring began from
late 2010/early 2011,15 and an agreement on the need for its undertaking in the form of
level 1 restructuring was subsequently reached in early 2012. The Bank received the
formal request in May 2012 and a Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission was fielded in June
2012. Almost 3 years after the project effectiveness date, i.e. at 65% of time passed, only
15.5% of the financing had been disbursed. The restructuring package was processed but
subsequently withdrawn as it appeared too unrealistic, including continuing to support the
NTC project component despite the abandonment of the NTCIP program by the
government. The government submitted a new request to restructure the project on
August 12, 2013, including closing all activities under the NTC component while
extending the completion of the activities under the TTF component to June 30, 2015.
However, the restructuring stalled from lack of key financial submissions (outstanding
IFRs and expenditures reporting) to conclude the restructuring.16 In the absence of these
submissions and given there was not enough time remaining to process the level 1
restructuring for the Board’s consideration before December 31, 2013, the level 2
restructuring was proposed to cancel the amount of USD 19.2 million (of a total USD
25.7 million) and to reserve it for another IDA program in Pakistan.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35.    M&E Design. The overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) function was the
responsibility of the NTCMU. The project included performance monitoring indicators to
monitor progress and the extent of achievement of the PDO during implementation. The



15
   ISR Sequence 5 (created 16 May 2011) indicates that one of the main objectives of the implementation support mission of
February 8 to 28, 2011 was to come to agreement with the Planning Commission on possible restructuring of the project. However,
these discussions remained inconclusive, mainly due to the Deputy Chairman first wanting to hold the NTCIP Task Force meeting
before agreeing on how the project could be realigned to support the Government. In the following supervision mission, discussions
evolved around a tentative plan to undertake restructuring in February 2012, with a final board presentation in April 2012 (Ref. ISR
Seq.6, created 14 November 2011) – subsequently delayed to June 2012 when a restructuring package was approved and later
withdrawn.
16
   A World Bank letter dated October 23, 2013 to Secretary, Economic Affairs Division requested (i) the Interim Financial Reports
(IFRs) from the National Trade Corridor Management Unit (NTCMU) and from the Ministry of Commerce, i.e. IFRs for the quarter
ended September 30, 2013 from both NTCMU and MoCe; (ii) confirmation that outstanding payments to consultants conducting the
studies had been made and any final administrative costs had been included. The letter clarified that, “without the availability of the
above mentioned financial information, we are unable to finalize the amounts for cancellation from this project for reallocation to
other projects.” It also requested (i) the latest balances in respective Designated Accounts of NTCMU and the Ministry of Commerce;
and (ii) that adjustment for the ineligible expenditures raised in the audit be resolved.



                                                                  10
design made provision that NTCMU would be supported by line ministries and TTFU in
reporting on project progress on a quarterly and yearly basis. However, the results
framework was not adequate for assessing the achievement of the PDO of this TA
project; rather, it was clearly appropriately designed to assess the PDO of the NTCIP.17
The PDO outcomes were too ambitious, unrealistic and unachievable. As a result, the
reporting on the results indicators was also not adequate to assess the PDO.

36.    M&E Implementation. The reporting was done in the Aide-Memoire and ISR
twice a year. Frequency of reporting was annual for the PDO outcome and intermediate
outcome indicators; and at project completion for two intermediate outcome indicators
(measuring “better understanding of international trade regulations and procedures” and
“compliance with trade regulations”). The data was collected by the NTCMU with the
collaboration of the World Bank (through the “Doing Business” reports) for project
outcome and intermediate outcome indicators, except for two intermediate indicators to
be monitored by the TTFU (i.e. the two indicators mentioned above). However, the
baseline was not collected for these two indicators during the preparation and until the
closing of the project, which affected the end outcome. Tracking PDOs relied heavily on
the mid-term evaluation report and supervision missions. The project monitored various
outputs related to studies, including through supervision mission reviews of the World
Bank, project studies, and annual and quarterly reports produced by NTCMU (and
UNCTAD). However, the data was not systematically collected from the annual Doing
Business reports to update the M&E framework.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard Compliance

37.    OP4.01 was applied for screening and categorizing the project. No safeguard
issues and impact were expected to arise, and they did not, as a result of project
implementation.

Fiduciary Compliance
38.     Financial Management. Financial Management is rated Unsatisfactory. The
Country Financial Accountability Assessment carried out in 2003 concluded that budget
execution, accounting, financial reporting and internal controls need strengthening at the
country level. However, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment of
the Federal Government for June 2012 showed that the Government of Pakistan (GoP)
has a continuing agenda of PFM reform. Current programs are focused on areas of
weaknesses in PFM administration including lack of internal audit and timely legislative
scrutiny, among others, that have been identified by the GoP and Development Partners.
Major efforts are well underway to enhance the effectiveness of financial management
systems in place.


17
   The PDO of both projects are very similar; the PDOs of NTCIP are: “to reduce the cost of trade and transport logistics and bring
services quality to international standards in order to reduce the cost of doing business in Pakistan, and ultimately enhance export
competitiveness and accelerate industrialization.” (Ref. PAD, TTFP II para. 17)




                                                                 11
39.     Existing financial management arrangements in the two implementing agencies of
this project were used. Lack of adequate staffing and delayed financial reporting was an
issue, especially in NTCMU, during the project implementation. Internal audit also
remained an issue during implementation.

40.    The two implementing agencies remained mostly compliant with the financial
covenants submitting acceptable interim quarterly financial reports and annual audited
financial statements albeit with delays. However, with lay-offs of all project staff
including staff responsible for the financial management, acceptable IUFRs for the two
quarters ended September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2013 have not yet been submitted
by NTCMU; whereas the Ministry of Commerce (MOCe) submitted IUFRs for the
quarter ended December 31, 2013 during the ICR mission. Furthermore, acceptable
audited financial statements for FY 2012/2013 have not been provided by both
implementing agencies. The Bank has issued letters to the Economic Affairs Division
(EAD) on March 3, 2013 and May 7, 2013 indicating remedial action for fiduciary non-
compliance by both the implementing agencies. Auditors’ performance generally
remained satisfactory. Ineligible expenditure amounting to PKR 325,040 and PKR
595,893 were reported by the auditors in their reports on financial statements of NTCMU
and MOCe respectively for FY 2011/2012.18 The Government was asked to refund the
amount; this has not yet been done.

41.    Bank FM staff remained in constant touch with the two implementing agencies
and provided support to strengthen weak areas.

42.    Procurement Performance. Procurement is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
The project procurement included mostly selection of consulting firms, individual
consultants and some goods for the two PMUs. NTCMU and TTFU had separate
accounts and separate procurement arrangements. Procurement outlays of the two PMUs
were mostly limited to goods and individuals, while TTFU had one major consultancy
contract with UNCTAD. All the other consulting services were sector focused and the
relevant departments/entities/ministries had the ownership of initiating the selection
process, evaluation and award. NTCMU had the role of coordination and were
responsible for keeping liaison with the various participating ministries.

43.     Throughout implementation, the project had procurement and contract
management issues. Under the NTCMU component, only one consultancy assignment
awarded by Civil Aviation Authority was selected and implemented in alignment with the
timelines and TORs. Whereas contracts for trucking policy, inland waterways, and the
feasibility for railway link could not be awarded and remained at various stages of
selection process. The railway FMIS, and ports master plan, were awarded after
substantial delays and had major issues during implementation.


18
   Ineligible expenditures of 1) PKR 325,040 for project allowance and honorarium paid to project staff not related to the project,
under component A (NTCMU); 2) PKR 595,893 for payment made as 15% increment in the existing fixed salary of the project
employees, under component B (MoCe).




                                                                 12
44.     Under the TTFU component, the UNCTAD assignment commenced relatively
well, despite initial implementation delays due to the delayed start of the project. In 2009
and 2010, the deliverables were also adjusted with mutual agreement. There were delays
in payment of UNCTAD, and the government since the first tranche never paid the
payments due to UNCTAD, which had a detrimental effect on the progress of the
contract. Later on there was a hiatus due to some technical gaps in understanding of the
deliverables.

45.     Overall the capacity of NTCMU to play a proactive and effective role in
coordination among the various ministries was rather ineffective. The ownership of the
ministries for their relevant components was also vacillating. The administrative
arrangement of routing all the selection processes and payments through Planning caused
delays in implementation. The agreed procurement arrangements, however, were simpler
and provided operational authority to the sectoral entities.

Not applicable.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Moderate
46.     The PDO remained highly relevant to the current national priorities and Bank
strategy (CAS 2010-12 pillar 3, CPS 2010-14), which focuses on improving
infrastructure to support growth and in particular, to reduce transport costs and transit
times to improve transport logistics and trade facilitation. The PDO at appraisal was thus
relevant and continued to be during project implementation. In addition, the most recent
CPS (2010-14) reaffirmed its commitment to this project. However, as discussed above,
the government did not demonstrate sustained ownership to TTFP II, despite its relevance
to the CPS.

47.    The project design was moderately relevant. Itwas undermined by the fact that (i)
the project design to achieve the PDO was inappropriate in view of both the project
timeline and indicators. It was designed to measure achievement of outcomes under the
NTCIP, while the TA project was only a vehicle to support the policy and reform agenda
of NTCIP; (ii) the government failed to demonstrate its commitment to the CPS.

48.     Given that the relevance for PDO is High while the design is Moderate, the
overall rating for the PDO is Moderate.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives.

Rating: Unsatisfactory
49.      The PDO was to improve performance of trade and transport logistics by
facilitating (i) the implementation of NTCIP, (ii) the simplification and modernization of


                                            13
Pakistan’s international trade procedures and practices. The achievement of the PDO was
to be measured by the key outcome indicators of the project: (i) reduction in the overall
cost of exporting/importing goods, and (ii) reduction in time of exporting/importing
goods. It was also to be measured by the intermediate outcome indicators: (i)
implementation of the NTCIP reforms, (ii) implementation of National Trade Facilitation
Strategy, (iii) better understanding of trade regulations and , and (iv) level of compliance
with trade regulation. As reflected in the updated results framework in section F, none of
the key and intermediate indicators were achieved. This is due to the fact that, (i) the
NTCIP was discontinued soon after project effectiveness (as explained above); (ii)
implementation of project activities was consistently delayed or cancelled, resulting in
many of the output targets not being achieved (especially with regards to the NTC
component); (iii) recommendations of studies not being translated into policy/reforms as
envisaged in the results framework (Annex 2). For instance, while the trucking policy
was updated, the follow-up study planned to develop an implementation strategy was not
initiated; the National Trade Facilitation Strategy revised by UNCTAD was not approved
by GoP by project end; it appears that the trade documents aligned with UNLK were not
adopted by GoP by project end; among other examples listed in Annex 2.

50.     Additionally, measuring the achievement of project outcomes was difficult
because of the disconnect between the indicators and project outputs, i.e. global
indicators were selected as key outcome indicators, and high level indicators selected for
several intermediate outcome indicators. Given that the project was only a vehicle for the
policy and institutional reform agenda and not an end in itself, project outputs (mainly
studies) were not directly related to the outcomes measured by the indicators. Two
indicators were also not measurable by the end of the project cycle, whereby baseline
data was not collected and survey at project end not conducted for indicators 3 and 4
(measuring “better understanding of international trade regulation and procedures” and
“compliance with trade regulations”).

51.     Given that none of the targets were achieved, the rating for the achievement of the
Project Development Objective is Unsatisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Unsatisfactory.
52.    In view of the nature of the project, no calculation of the economic rate of return
was attempted.

53.     The efficiency in the use of project funds against actual outputs could also not be
assessed due to unavailability of disaggregated expenditures data, i.e. the Project team
did not have records of disaggregated actual costs against estimated costs per project
activity. However, project efficiency was seen to be lacking in the following areas: (i)
project outputs did not contribute to the achievement of the PDO, as explained above. In
particular, the studies completed under the project were not effectively utilized in policy
reform initiatives through implementation of the recommendations outlined in the studies.
For instance, the Railways Revitalization Strategy, which was pending approval by the



                                            14
Cabinet as of June 2013 (when last reported), remains unutilized by the Government19;
(ii) several ongoing studies were not completed. This includes the Ports Master Plan
Study (contracted for the amount of US$ 3.4m) – under NTC component, 20 and the
Custom House Agents Industry Review – under TTF component. 21 It could not be
confirmed what costs were incurred for the activities not completed.

54.    After four years of project implementation, one could argue whether the funds
were spent efficiently given that no single achievement of the expected outcomes was
achieved. For this reason, the project efficiency is rated Unsatisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory
55.     The PDO and its indicators were articulated in a way which appears to be too
optimistic and ambitious to achieve within the project life, aside of the fact that the PDO
and indicators were not measurable. Overall outcome is rated Unsatisfactory, based on
the rating of the three dimensions assessed for the relevance of the PDO and design (rated
Moderate), project efficacy (rated Unsatisfactory) and efficiency (rated Unsatisfactory).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
Not applicable.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Not applicable.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
56.     One of the most important requirements for sustainable trade and transport reform
is satisfactory policy reform with adequate institutional arrangements for its
implementation. As discussed above, neither of these conditions were met: (i) the policy
reform actions planned under the NTCIP and listed in the policy matrix of the TTFP II
PAD have not been completed; (ii) the NTC Management Unit (NTCMU), which was set
up to strengthen, monitor and facilitate the coordination and cooperation between
different sectors and ministries, remained a weak institution through the implementation

     Aide Memoire, Implementation Completion Follow-up Mission, March 28-April 3, 2014, para. 12

20 The consultants of the Ports Master Plan Study stopped working in June 2012, due to IA withholding the progress payment citing
poor quality of the output by the Consultants. Upon submission of satisfactory justification, the Bank cleared the payment to the
Consultants. However, as of the supervision mission of Jan-Feb 2013, the issue had been discussed and resolved, though the payment
had not yet been made, and peer reviewers had not yet been recruited to evaluate the deliverables. The situation remained unchanged
as of the supervision mission of June 2013; the payment had still not been made to the Consultants as of April 2014. It is unclear
whether the balance work activities resumed, though it is assumed not given that the final product was not submitted to the World
Bank project team. The Bank project team indicated that this activity suffered from a lack of proper management by the IA and by the
Management Unit under the PC. Ref. Aide Memoire supervision mission of January 29-February 8, 2013, para. 6 and Aide Memoire
supervision mission of June 17-24, 2013.

period. Staffing and capacity was reported as a major weakness of the institution by the
Project team. On the other hand, the Trade and Transport Facilitation Unit (TTFU) was
set up by the Ministry of Commerce (MoCe) to assist NTTFC to better promote
collaboration between the public and private sector. The institution also lacked capacity,
coordination and direction from the senior level within MoCe and its performance was
held back by a lack of adequate funding for the consultancies that it was to award.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
57.     Given the lack of government ownership and the weak capacity, it is doubted that
outstanding activities would be undertaken at the government’s own cost and, as
mentioned, development outcomes were not achieved. The intervention itself was in a
risk-prone, highly sensitive, and at times politically charged area.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
58.     The quality at entry was Unsatisfactory. The Bank responded promptly to GoP’s
request for technical assistance to support the NTCIP program which had existed for four
years with strong government leadership (reflected in Component A). The project was
also a continuation and expansion of the 2001 TTFP I, which aimed to modernize
Pakistan’s trade and transport facilitation practices and procedures (reflected in
Component B). Strengths of the project design at entry included, (i) readiness filters were
appropriately met; (ii) a number of lessons learned were incorporated from the previous
project. However, as mentioned in other sections, several deficiencies were noted: the
Bank underestimated the risk of (i) government commitment to leverage the success of
the project; (ii) government capacity to carry out such a complex program; (iii) technical
capacity of the NTCMU to manage the project (quality of studies, technical advisory
services and implementability of recommendations); (iv) synergy between the two IAs
with different priorities and reform agendas. Moreover, additional shortcomings included,
(i) inappropriate risk mitigation measures identified; (ii) inadequate M&E framework
designed, i.e. outcome indicators were not designed to measure the TA; (iii) monitoring,
evaluation and decision support framework for NTCIP not successfully set up; and (iv)
the inability to assess project impact by project completion, against the timeline of
NTCIP.




                                            16
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
59.     The quality of supervision is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory on the following:
(i) inadequate supervision; (ii) poor responsiveness to project implementation challenges,
including slow follow-up on issues; (iii) poor quality of reporting, including lack of
comprehensive overview of project progress - detailed below.

60.     Inadequate supervision. The frequency of supervision missions (two a year) was
adequate and the appointment of local-based TTLs enabled closer coordination than
when it was HQ-based. The field-based supervision supported project achievements in
the period before MTR (up to mid-2012), when modest project gains were achieved.
However, it appears that, despite recognized efforts to engage with the government, the
Bank failed to effectively address the implementation challenges continued to hinder
project performance throughout the implementation period. The Bank team failed to
consistently include technical experts among its own project staff to effectively assist and
advise the work undertaken by the Borrower and its consultants, who lacked technical
capacity.22 The project team was not able to bridge the lack of coordination between the
IAs and to engage effectively with government counterparts in order to act timely to re-
design a project with realistic development objectives and indicators. This was in part due
to the high turnover rate of officials in the Planning Commission, and the difficulty of
having to engage with the Planning Commission rather than the concerned ministries. It
also appears that the high turnover of World Bank task team leaders, 4 TTLs during
implementation, may have challenged the Bank’s ability to provide strong engagement on
these issues.

61.    Poor Risk taking and decision making. It appears that the timing and duration of
discussions on project restructuring was both late and drawn out, against the need for
timely action in the context of a project supporting policy reform initiatives (which span
over long periods of time). Long delays were incurred both in finalizing the restructuring
packages at two different times during implementation, as well as delays incurred before
taking action after the first attempt stalled. It is understood that internal Bank processes
and procedures may have created additional challenges to effective action, given the need
for government responsiveness in order to process project restructuring, or project
cancellation (as well as managing institutional relationships in the face of these
challenges).

62.    Poor reporting. Close monitoring to assess performance across multiple agencies
required considerable staff time. Except at mid-term review, Bank reporting failed to
document and assesses the progress of project objectives comprehensively, i.e. the



22
   Refer to risk mitigation measures listed in the PAD p.18, specifically that the World Bank and other development partners would
participate in technical reviews and provide advice using their international experience and knowledge of best practices. This was to
mitigate for the acknowledged weakness of NTCMU and TTFU who did not have the capacity to manage the technical aspects of the
project (quality of studies and technical advisory services, and implementability of recommendations).




                                                                 17
progress of respective activities and project outcomes was sporadically documented. In
particular, after MTR, reporting efforts appeared to focus on the status of discussions
regarding project re-design. The lack of comprehensive reporting was a challenge to the
assessment of project implementation by the ICR team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

63.    The shortcomings identified above in the Bank’s performance at both the design
and implementation stages justify rating of the Bank’s overall performance as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower’s Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

64.      The GoP demonstrated a satisfactory level of commitment and ownership during
project preparation. Readiness filters were complied with and the new government held
its first NTCIP task force meeting soon after coming to power in 2008, before project
appraisal.

65.     However, after project appraisal, for almost two years, GoP did not indicate any
clear strategy on how to take the NTCIP and TTFP II forward, until the adoption of the
New Growth Framework by the government in 2011 - where private sector-led growth
replaced an earlier focus on public sector spending and a “brick and mortar” approach to
growth. During implementation the government failed to ensure the required enabling
environment was provided, including (i) supportive institutional arrangements to work
across government agencies (as required for a program on trade facilitation); (ii)
adequate budget allocations through the Planning Commission’s Public Sector
Development Program (PSDP) to the second project component, which were consistently
inadequate to execute the program. The latter prevented the recruitment of experts to
carry out the studies, slowing implementation progress. Hence, while the lack of
ownership of the GoP and lack of staffing and capacity (as described in the sections
above) slowed implementation progress of the NTC component, the performance issues
of the TTF component were related, at least in part, to insufficient budget provisions.

66.    Overall performance of the Borrower is thus rated Unsatisfactory, as further
developed in the section below on respective performance of the IAs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating for NTC: Unsatisfactory
67.     The NTC Management Unit (NTCMU), set up within the Planning Commission,
was responsible for the overall management of the project across both components, and
specifically the management of the NTC component in coordination with the sector
ministries/agencies. The NTCMU was also mandated to report to the Government and the
World Bank on implementation progress, consolidating information on implementation



                                          18
of both the NTC and TTF components. Through the NTCMU, the implementing agency
did not manage and coordinate the project effectively and its performance was
undermined by the following factors: (i) the lack of project leadership during the first
year of implementation (i.e. delayed appointment of full-time Project Director to June
2010) and lack of independence for day-to-day project management tasks, once
appointed;23 (ii) inadequate staffing and capacity through the project implementation
period.24; (iii) weak technical and fiduciary capacity, which had a considerable impact
on project delivery; it was identified as one of the main reasons for slow disbursement of
the project (alongside inadequate funding of PSDP for TTFU) by the Aide Memoire of
the implementation review mission of January 29 to February 8, 2013. The latter resulted
in significant delays and, at times, stalled procurements, i.e. no progress reported between
November 2010 and the supervision mission of February 2011, with only two
consultancies awarded one and a half years after project effectiveness. Only 3 of the total
14 regrouped studies planned were completed at project closing (Refer to Annex 2).

68.    Confirming its loss of relevance after the change in government, the component’s
linkage to the NTCIP led the government itself to request cancellation of this project
component in its official request to the World Bank on August 12, 2013.

69.     The reasons above and consistent lack of achievement and commitment to deliver
this project component justifies a performance rating of Unsatisfactory.

Rating for TTF: Moderately Unsatisfactory
70.     The TTF Unit (TTFU) created in the Ministry of Commerce (MoCe) was
responsible for the implementation of the TTF component. This component was a
continuation of UNCTAD’s technical assistance to MoCe, which began under TTFP I,
and justified sole source procurement of UNCTAD as the “implementing partner” of the
TTFU/MoCe. In particular, the UN Agency managed the process of recruitment of
international consultants, supported MoCe in the recruitment of national consultants, and
performed quality control of deliverables.

71.     The TTFU’s performance in managing the TTF component of the project was
mixed: (i) performance under the TTF component was satisfactory up to mid-term review
(MTR), when the TTF management rating was first downgraded from Satisfactory to
Moderately Satisfactory (ref. ISR Seq. 7, June 2012). As of MTR, approx. 40% of
planned activities were completed and the TTF component remained the only driving
force of the project albeit implementation delays;25 (ii) as of MTR, the performance
continued to deteriorate, particularly in the last 12 months of project implementation –
resulting in a final TTF management rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory (ref. ISR Seq.
10, January 2014). As of project closing, only 12 of the 33 activities (as per the revised

work plan of UNCTAD) had been completed.26 One additional study was completed and
submitted to the World Bank in April 2014. It appears that the following factors may
have undermined the performance of the IA and implementing partner (UNCTAD): (i)
inadequate budget allocations provided by the Planning Commission to the TTFU
throughout the implementation period. This undermined the IA’s ability to recruit
national consultants to conduct the studies; (ii) the revised work plan for UNCTAD
(formalized in the amendment to the contract agreement signed in Nov. 2012), did not
obtain clearance of the Planning and Development Division through adoption of the
revised PC-1, which never occurred; (iii) the extension of the project closing date to June
30, 2015 through project restructuring (to which the revised work plan of UNCTAD was
aligned) did not materialize through project restructuring.

72.     While the reasons above made it difficult to manage the project in an efficient and
effective manner, release of payments from World Bank funds continued up to
September 2013 – making it difficult to justify the weak performance reported in the last
12 months of implementation. This led to delayed clearance of a release of payment, due
in September 2013 as per the CSA First Amendment, only cleared at project completion.
Weak performance reporting of the IA and UNCTAD further undermined the
performance under the TTF component, including non-compliance to the provision under
CSA Annex IV for a Terminal Report to be produced by UNCTAD at project end.

73.    In summary, although the MoCe remained strongly committed to the TTF
component at first, subsequent delays in the completion of agreed activities, lack of
follow-up actions and weak progress reporting weakened project performance under this
component as from 2012 to project end; it justifies a performance rating of Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

74.    For the above cited reasons, the overall rating of the Borrower’s performance is
Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
75.     Lesson 1: Developing Realistic Project Outcomes and Objectives. This project
has highlighted the importance of developing a PDO and project indicators that are
achievable and measurable within the timeline of the project. While the project may be
contributing to higher level goals, these should not be used as key indicators which will
not be measurable at project end. More granular project indicators are advisable where
higher level objectives are sought.

76.   Lesson 2: Importance of Government ownership/commitment. If the
government’s will is lost, it is important to take risk and make prompt decision in either


26
    Source: ISR Sequence 10, Archived in January 2014. This relates to the progress of activities as of the end of Sept. 2013. No
further progress reported as of Jan. 2014.



                                                                  20
restructuring or canceling the project. It is acknowledged that mitigation of political risks
is difficult to incorporate in the project design. However, project teams should not
assume government’s sustained commitment and should remain pro-active in managing it
on an ongoing basis through the life of the project; this highlights the importance of
building strong institutional relationships, which in-country TTL capacity has shown to
help sustain. As mentioned above, cancellation of the project should be considered where
government engagement is absent.

77.     Lesson 3: Importance of Timing in Project Restructuring/cancelling. To
accommodate emerging issues in a changing environment, a formal restructuring of
projects under implementation is an effective mechanism for portfolio management.
However, the timing is crucial. In retrospect, the prolonged discussions on project
restructuring in the case of TTFP II presented a lesson learned in that regard. Especially
in the context of engagement in policy reforms, if the government’s commitment is
lacking it is advisable to immediately refer to project cancellation or restructuring with
continued implementation only of those components of the project where the IAs are
engaged. Empowering TTLs to raise issues earlier and for greater risk taking where
needed, will require further study into World Bank instruments and processes, and how
they can be adapted to help TTLs make these difficult decisions at the right time. In
particular, the reluctance of the World Bank to cancel a project unilaterally can lead to
unsatisfactory implementation records such as reflected in this project. In cases where
government commitment is either absent or insufficient to lead successful project
implementation, TTLs should be given means to take effective action early.

78.     Lesson 4: Strengthening the Institutional Implementation Arrangements. The
choice in implementing agencies should be closely correlated to the outcomes sought by
the project. For instance, in the context of TTFP II the Planning Commission was
mandated with oversight of the project, while the project team was seeking to engage
directly with specific ministries. Project effectiveness would likely be enhanced it the
project teams were in a position to engage directly with the relevant ministries. It would
likely also have expedited discussions on project restructuring in the case of TTFP II.

79.     Additionally, it is important to keep the implementation structure simple. In the
case of this project, the involvement of too many players led to cumbersome
administrative processes. For instance, the Planning Commission (PC) was supposed to
coordinate the NTC component and the line ministries take the lead in procuring the
studies in consultation with the PC. This caused significant project implementation delays.
The process of approval of studies under the Planning Commission required the review of
several institutional players incl. the Secretary Planning and the Deputy Chairman. The
approval process in itself required up to 1.5 to 2 years to conclude in some cases.

80.    Lesson 5: Importance of Retaining Key Project Staff Until Closing of the
Accounting Books. As learned in this project, key financial management staff should be
engaged up to the final closure of the project books, in order to avoid delays in
submitting annual audited financial statements.




                                             21
81.    Lesson 6: Importance of having TTL in the country. It is important to assign a
continuous local TTL or co-TTL to supervise the project given the context of the political
and economic challenges to ensure stronger coordination, trust and relationship with
Borrower.

82.    Lesson 7: Importance of choosing the right lending instrument for policy and
reforms. The challenges met in designing this TA project with a short timeline and
ambitious project outcomes demonstrates the importance of considering different lending
instruments.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

83.     The Borrower’s ICR reported in concordance with the ICR Bank team that the
project suffered from, (i) inherent flaws in the project design; (ii) lack of political
ownership from the outset, mentioning in particular that Task Force meetings decreased
in number and were held further apart until finally no longer being held altogether
through the project implementation period; (iii) lack of collaboration between the two IAs,
which hardly interacted; (iv) insufficient amount of time to complete an ambitious
number of activities; (v) recommendations of the studies which were not implemented.
The latter reflects the Bank ICR team’s assessment that the timeline of the project was
not well adapted to the project development objectives and also concurs with the Bank’s
findings in mentioning that “the project was helpless in achieving the broad based agenda
of reforms” in the absence of NTCIP.

84.     The report also identifies several shortcomings of the Bank project team’s
performance in supporting the IAs, which should advise future Bank operations: (i)
insufficient efforts on the part of the Bank team to improve the design of the project
(including after the initial government request for restructuring); and (ii) although
training was provided, it was felt that additional training would have been beneficial
during the course of the implementation due to unfamiliarity of the IA with World Bank
procedures (procurement and financial management). The report also claimed that the
project “suffered due to a clash of personalities between the government and World Bank
staff”.

85.    It must be noted that the MoCe, as IA of the TTF component, does not appear to
have contributed to this report.

Subject:        SECOND TRADE & TRANSPORT FACILITATION PROJECT -
                CREDIT NUMBER 4577-PK
                IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT:
The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve the performance of trade and
transport logistics by facilitating: (a) the implementation of the National Trade Corridor
Improvement Program (NTCIP); and (b) the simplification and modernization of
Pakistan’s international trade practices and procedures.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
The Government of Pakistan set up a National Trade Corridor Task Force (NTC Task
Force) on 18-8-2005 headed by Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission with Federal
Secretaries of the Divisions of Revenue, Communications, Railways, Ports & Shipping,
Defence, Petroleum, MINFA and Industries as its members.
Nine sub-committees for implementation of the NTCIP were constituted (Annex-I).
A core group comprising Planning Commission, World Bank, ADB and JICA was also
formed. These development partners endorsed the NTC initiative and agreed to provide
financing as Development Policy Loans to the tune of $6 billion for the resulting projects.

Task Force Meetings
Seven meetings on NTCIP initiatives were held by the then Prime Minister dated 18-8-
2005, 20-9-2005, 12-12-2005, 28-1-2006, 25-3-2006, 19-7-2006 and 1-3-2007; while
fourteen meetings of NTC Task Force were held under the chairmanship of Deputy
Chairman, Planning Commission.

The original (umbrella) project costing Rs. 1500 million ($ 25 million), which is 100%
IDA financed, was approved by the ECNEC in its meeting held on 30th November 2006.
Modified PC-I with same cost ($ 25 million) was approved by the CDWP on 7th April,
2011 with completion date of 31st December, 2013.


The Project comprised of two components:
a. National Trade Corridor (NTC-Transport Sector) component. It included
Technical Advisory Services designed in support of the National Trade Corridor
Improvement Program (NTCIP) and to help underpin the designed prospective sector
investments which were part of NTCIP; as well as it included the Project Coordination
and Management sub-components.



                                            33
b. Trade and Transport Facilitation (TTF) component. The component built on the
results achieved by TTFP-I, thus extending efforts to streamline and integrate trade data
exchange and official controls, sustaining public/private sector collaborative institutional
frameworks and strengthening the domestic logistics industry. It also included Technical
Advisory Services and Project Management sub-components.

The Planning Commission (PC) of Pakistan was assigned as the implementing agency for
the NTC component; while the Ministry of Commerce (MoCe), with UNCTAD’s
consultancy support, was responsible to implement the TTF component.

CLOSURE OF PROJECT
The sectoral studies under the Transport Sector reforms component consistently lacked
progress. Disbursements under the Project remained slow and at a very low level. Since
June 30, 2013, six months ahead of the official closing date of the Project, the total
disbursement of USD 4.9 million (about 19%) had been stagnant with a balance of USD
20.71 million. As of December 16, 2013, disbursement figures still had not changed.
The Project from the outset suffered from lack of political ownership and changing
governments and priorities. As a result the Task Force meetings decreased in numbers
and were held further apart and ultimately stopped. This was assessed and evaluated at
the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the project undertaken in June of 2012 and in two
subsequent implementation support missions.

Level 1 Restructuring: Responding to the Bank’s proposal for a level 1 restructuring, on
August 12, 2013, the Government confirmed its approval to close all the activities under
the Transport Component while extending the completion of the activities under the
Trade Facilitation component up to June 30, 2015. Thus the project restructuring got
underway involving modification of the Project Development Objective. However, the
process was abandoned due to shortage of time left before the actual project closing date
of December 31, 2013. Hence the proposed extension (in restructuring) to the closing
date could no longer be possible. However, at the Government’s request to avoid losing
the unutilized amount, a level 2 restructuring was undertaken by the Bank to cancel part
of the unutilized amount and reserve it for a “to-be-determined IDA project in Pakistan”
to be approved by the World Bank Board.

Level 2 Restructuring: A cancellation of XDR 12.5 million (USD 19.2 million
equivalent) of the total XDR 16.8 million (USD 25.7 million equivalent) in the IDA
credit for the Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project was requested by the
Government. This partial cancellation will allow the EAD to reallocate the funds to other
Pakistan program under IDA.

GOVERNMENT’s (BORROWER) PERFORMANCE
Besides the lack of political will in the previous government to implement the NTCIP the
project suffered numerous administrative delays in completing its activities. These can be


                                           40
 attributed to inherent flaws in the design of project, delays in getting necessary approvals,
 unfamiliarity with World Bank procedures, lengthy procurement procedures, low
 disbursements, lack of training of staff etc.
 Since the start of project (2008) till its closure about seven Project Directors were
 appointed on full-time and sometimes on additional charge. None of the staff were
 provided any kind of training to help them carryout project activities swiftly.

 Inherent Flaw in Project Design
 The Project was being implemented by two Government Ministries (Planning
 Commission and Ministry of Commerce). The two components had little in common and
 hardly interacted besides being located in the same office space. Both management units
 were responsible for hiring consultants to carryout studies and for management functions.
 The NTCMU was also to serve as the secretariat of NTC Task Force. In the absence of
 NTCIP the project was helpless in achieving the broad based agenda of reforms.
 There were a number of activities identified for each component and not enough time
 provided to complete all of them.
 The decision making regarding the studies rested with the line ministries and Steering
 Committees (Ports & Shipping, Railways, Industries, Defence etc.) which attributed to
 delays in decision making and sometimes deadlock (e.g. Ports Master Plan Steering
 Committee).

PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
 There were delays in getting the project approved by the World Bank. There was a
 turnover of Task Team Leaders (TTLs) on the World Bank side and during the
 implementation period the project witnessed four different TTLs. No attempt was made
 to improve the design of the project even when restructuring the project was requested
 the first time. World Bank did not provide adequate training to the government
 counterpart staff. The project also suffered due to a clash of personalities between the
 government                and               World               Bank               staff.
