7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the performance of trade and transport logistics
by facilitating: (a) the implementation of the NTCIP; and (b) the simplification and modernization of
Pakistan’s international trade practices and procedures.
7b. Revised Project Development Objectives/Outcomes


A. Summary of Proposed Changes
A cancellation of XDR 12.5 million (USD 19.2 million equivalent) of the total XDR 16.8 million (USD 25.7
million equivalent) in the IDA credit for the Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project is requested by
the Government of Pakistan (GoP). The proposed cancellation responds to a formal request dated December
19, 2013, to cancel IDA Credit of XDR 12.5 million ahead of the project closing date as of December 31,
2013. This partial cancellation will allow the EAD to reallocate the funds to other Pakistan program under
IDA 16.

B. Project Status
1. Implementation progress and achievement of PDOs of the project has been rated as Moderately
   Unsatisfactory or Unsatisfactory through most of the lifecycle of the Project. As reflected in the Aide-
   Memoire of the Mission undertaken June 17-14, 2013, of the two components, all the sectoral studies
   under the Transport Sector reforms component consistently lacked progress, while the Trade Facilitation
   reforms component made steady progress. The overall progress of the project, including for the Trade
   and Transport Facilitation Component also deteriorated in the last one year. Disbursements under the
   Project remained slow and at a very low level. Since June 30, 2013, six months ahead of the official
   closing date of the Project, the total disbursement of USD 4.9 million (about 19%) has been stagnant
   with a balance of USD 20.71 million. As of December 16, 2013, disbursement figures have not changed.
   Overall and as of 16 December 2013, the Project has gained USD 0.9 million due to exchange rate
   fluctuations between XDR and USD.

2. The Project from the outset suffered from lack of political ownership and changing governments and
   priorities. This was assessed and evaluated at the mid-term review of the project undertaken in June of
   2012 and in two subsequent implementation support missions. Responding to the Bank’s proposal for a
   level 1 restructuring, on August 12, 2013, the Government of Pakistan confirmed its approval to close all
   the activities under the Transport Component while extending the completion of the activities under the
   Trade Facilitation component up to June 30, 2015. Thus the project restructuring got underway involving
   modification of the Project Development Objective. However, the restructuring stalled from lack of
   inputs from the Government - specifically, timely submission of the Interim Financial Reports (IFRs)
   and confirmation of the up-to-date expenditures, especially for the transport sector component. This
   prevented determination of the credit amount to be cancelled as part of the restructuring process. Despite

                                                  ii
   repeated attempts from the World Bank team in the last six months, the required complete information
   has not been provided to this date. As a result, the process has now been abandoned due to shortage of
   time left before the closing date of December 31, 2013. Hence the proposed extension to the closing date
   could no longer be possible. However, at the Government’s request to avoid losing the unutilized
   amount, a level 2 restructuring is being undertaken to cancel part of the unutilized amount and reserve it
   for a to-be-determined IDA project in Pakistan to be approved by the World Bank Board no later than
   June 30, 2014.

C. Proposed Changes
The Government of Pakistan requests a cancellation of XDR 12.5 million (USD 19.2 million) of the total
XDR 16.8 million (USD 25.7 million) in the IDA Credit for the Project.

 PAKISTAN: SECOND TRADE & TRANSPORT FACILITATION PROJECT (P101684)
                       (Credit Number 4577-PK)

                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A.       SUMMARY

     The TTFP II Credit for SDR 16.8 million (USD 25.7 million equivalent) was approved
     by the Bank’s Board on May 12, 2009, and the legal agreement declared effective on
     August 24, 2009 (Contract Agreement CN.4577-PK); the Project has a closing date of
     December 31, 2013. The Project development objective (PDO) was “to improve the
     performance of trade and transport logistics by facilitating: (a) the implementation of
     the NTCIP; and (b) the simplification and modernization of Pakistan’s international
     trade practices and procedures.” The project has had history of unsatisfactory
     performance in the achievement of the development objectives. It could only disburse
     about 19% even after elapsing 90% of the time by June 13, 2013. The NTCIP
     (transport sector) component was substantially responsible for the unsatisfactory
     performance of the project.
     After being unsuccessful in processing level 1 restructuring to modify the PDO and to
     grant extension to the trade facilitation component, a level 2 restructuring is now being
     aimed to cancel part of the unused IDA funds from this Credit. This action will enable
     the Government of Pakistan (GoP) to reserve these funds for other (to-be-determined)
     IDA program in Pakistan, to be approved by the World Bank Board no later than June
     30, 2014. The GoP has, therefore, expressly requested cancellation of the amount of
     XDR 12.5 million (USD 19.2 million) as of its letter dated 19 December 2013.

B.       PROJECT STATUS

3. The Project is comprised of two components:
   a. National Trade Corridor (NTC-Transport Sector) component. It includes
      Technical Advisory Services designed in support of the National Trade Corridor
      Improvement Program (NTCIP) and to help underpin the designed prospective
      sector investments which are part of NTCIP; as well as it includes the Project
      Coordination and Management sub-components.
   b. Trade and Transport Facilitation (TTF) component. The component builds on
      the results achieved by TTFP-I, thus extending efforts to streamline and integrate
      trade data exchange and official controls, sustaining public/private sector
      collaborative institutional frameworks and strengthening the domestic logistics
      industry. It also includes Technical Advisory Services and Project Management
      sub-components.

4. The Planning Commission (PC) of Pakistan was assigned as the implementing agency
   for the NTC component; while the Ministry of Commerce (MoCe), with UNCTAD’s
   consultancy support, was responsible to implement the TTF component.

5. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission (fielded in June 2012) assessed and evaluated
   the progress and agreed with the Government on an action plan including

                                               1
    restructuring the project by curtailing the scope under the NTC component while
    extending the TTF component up to June 30, 2015. Hence the MoC extended
    UNCTAD’s service contract (up to June 30, 2015) in November 2012. However, in
    the 6 months following the MTR, the progress further deteriorated. Subsequently, the
    Bank fielded two supervision support missions (in Jan-Feb 2013 and June 2013)
    which confirmed that the line Ministries under the PC for the NTC component lacked
    ownership. This was reflected, for instance, by the absence of a Project Director for
    months together resulting in the lack of coordination with line Ministries and lack of
    progress for the sectoral studies. Therefore, the closing of all the activities under the
    NTC component and extension of the TTF component that showed commitment was
    recommended up to June 30, 2015. However, the lack of political ownership and
    support clearly indicated that the Project was no longer in line with the priorities of
    the new Government.

6. Whilst the MoCe has remained more strongly committed to the TTF component, its
   progress has also faltered in the recent months. The delays in the completion of the
   agreed activities, lack of follow-up actions and weak progress reporting were the
   obvious reasons. Only one of twelve targeted studies as per the agreed work plan was
   completed in the last 12 months while other scheduled activities1 have been delayed
   by a further 6 to 12 months as in the latest revised work schedule submitted by MoCe
   on November 26, 2013 (as compared to the Work Plan included in the First
   Amendment to the UNCTAD’s Consultancy Services Agreement (CSA), signed by
   the MoC on November 14, 2012).

7. The restructuring process began after the Bank received the GoP letter of August 12,
   2013, in which it approved the proposed restructuring plan that involved closing of all
   the activities under the NTC component henceforth and continuing with the TTF
   component up to June 30, 2015. Thus, the draft Restructuring Paper (RP) was
   prepared but it lacked key information on the financial management (submission of
   the interim financial reports, cost and expenditure details, settlement of past due
   payments to the consultants and compliance of the previous audit paras., required
   from NTCMU/PC) to ascertain the final project costs incurred (for the NTC
   component) and thus to assign the amount to be cancelled from the IDA Credit.
   However, in the interest of time, the incomplete RP was still circulated for the Bank’s
   internal clearance in September/October, 2013, while the missing information was
   awaited from the two agencies of the GoP. The Bank requested the GoP-
   NTCMU/Planning Commission (PC) and the Ministry of Commerce, through its
   letters of October 23 and November 1st, 2013 to the Economic Affairs Division, to
   provide the needed information to enable finalizing of the Restructuring Package.
   However, to this date, complete information has not been provided to the Bank
   (including non receipt of IFR for July-Sep 2013 for the Transport component from
   the PC, verification of the final costs, verification of payments to the Consultants,
   especially to Hamberg Port Consultants). Coupled with lack of commitment to
   implement the project, as of now there is not enough time remaining to process the

1
 Reporting requirements by UNCTAD are defined under Appendix IV of the Consulting Services
Agreement (CSA) between MoCe and UNCTAD.
                                                2
     level 1 restructuring for the Board’s consideration before December 31, 2013. Hence
     the level 2 restructuring is proposed through this RP.

8. In view of the above considerations, at the request of the GoP, this restructuring paper
   (RP) proposes to cancel the amount of XDR 12.5 million (USD 19.2 million) as of
   the closing date of December 31, 2013 and to reserve it for other (to-be-determined)
   IDA program in Pakistan to be approved by the World Bank Board no later than June
   30, 2014.
