                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Due to the continuous unsatisfactory progress of the Project towards achievement of its development objectives, the Bank will be working with the Government to restructure the
                         project to better align it to the changed macro economic realities, and to better support the Government in its effort to undertake key policy reforms to improve the performance of the
                         trade and transport logistic sector in Pakistan.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
