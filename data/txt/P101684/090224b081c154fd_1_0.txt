                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation progress of the project is moderately unsatisfactory; as the implementation agencies have not yet completed the follow-up actions agreed during the June
                         2102 mid-term, hence the pace of project activities substantially reduced, specificallyfor the transport reforms component. As a result project disbursements also slowed down; the
                         project only disbursed 3 percent since after July, 2012. Delays in the following areas have had a critical impact on progress: (a) absence of a project director for the Planning
                         Commission's component focusing on transport policy and planning; (b) delays caused by the Ports and Shipping Ministry in releasing the progress payments to the Consultants

                         preparing the Pakistan Ports Master Plan despite resolution of issues in January 2013 hindering the release of payments by the Planning Commission; and (c) delay in processing of
                         the modifications to the PC-I. However, some actions for the Trade facilitation component by the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) were completed: MoC revised, renegotiated, and
                         signed its Consultancy Services Agreement with UNCTAD; the value of the overall services being provided by UNCTAD is now USD 3.042 million; MoC modified and discussed its
                         section of the Umbrella PC-I for this project and submitted to the Planning Commission last December for consolidating with the Planning Commission's section and further

                         disbursed. The Mission last February, suggested options: (i) restructuring of the project with cancellation of the slow moving sectoral studies (under the transport component); or (ii)
