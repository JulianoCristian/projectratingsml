II) for Pakistan were\n            as follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: this project\n            has highlighted the importance of developing a project\n            development objective, or PDO and project indicators that\n            are achievable and measurable within the timeline of the\n            project. While the project may be contributing to higher\n            level goals, these should not be used as key indicators\n            which will not be measurable at project end. To accommodate\n            emerging issues in a changing environment, a formal\n            restructuring of projects under implementation is an\n            effective mechanism for portfolio management. However, the\n            timing is crucial. The choice in implementing agencies\n            should be closely correlated to the outcomes sought by the\n            project. For instance, in the context of TTFP II the\n            Planning Commission was mandated with oversight of the\n            project, while the project team was seeking to engage\n            directly with specific ministries. As learned in this\n            project, key financial management staff should be engaged up\n            to the final closure of the project books, in order to avoid\n            delays in submitting annual audited financial statements."}, "docdt": "2014-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
