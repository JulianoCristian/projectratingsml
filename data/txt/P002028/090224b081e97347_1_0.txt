such lien, shall make express provision to that effect; provided,

by, or in the territory of, the Borrower on goods or services,
or on the importation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof;
to that end, if the amount of any such taxes levied on or in
respect of any item to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
decreases or increases, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower,
increase or decrease the disbursement percentage then applicable
to such item as required to be consistent with the aforementioned
policy of the Bank.

the disbursement percentages set forth in the table in paragraph 1
above, if the Bank has reasonably estimated that the amount of


﻿- 14 -
the Loan then allocated to any Category or Sub-category will be
insufficient to finance the agreed percentage of all expenditures
in that Category or Sub-category, the Bank may, by notice to the
Borrower: (i) reallocate to such Category or Sub-category, to the
extent required to meet the estimated shortfall, proceeds of the
Loan which are then allocated to another Category or Sub-category
and which in the opinion of the Bank are not needed to meet other
expenditures; and (ii) if such reallocation cannot fully meet the
estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement percentage then
applicable to such expenditures in order that further withdrawals
under such Category or Sub-category may continue until all
expenditures thereunder shall have been made.
5.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the
procurement of any item in any Category is inconsistent with
the procedures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no
expenditures for such item shall be financed out of the proceeds
of the Loan and the Bank may, without in any way restricting
or limiting any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under
the Loan Agreement, by notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount
of the Loan as, in the Bank's reasonable opinion, represents
the amount of such expenditures which would otherwise have been
eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan.
