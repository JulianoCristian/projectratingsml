PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
NIGERIA: LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1091-UNI)
PREFACE
1.        This is a project completion report (PCR) on the Livestock Develop-
ment Project. The loan for the project was approved by the Board of Direc-
tors in December 1974, in an amount of US$21.0 million, and was closed in
July 1983, two years after the original closing date.
2.        The report consists of a PCR prepared by the Livestock Project Unit
(LPU) submitted through the Federal Government of Nigeria, and an Overview
prepared by the Western Africa Regional Office.
3.        A Bank mission visited Nigeria in September 1983.  Discussions were
held with Project Management, Government officials, and with representatives
of institutions participating in the project. Field visits were also under-
taken and farmers interviewed.   The information obtained and observations
made during the mission are reflected in the Bank's Overview.
4.        Western Africa Regional Office finds the LPU/PCR to be a thorough
review of the project and is generally in accord with its major findings and
conclusions.   The Region has carried out the economic reevaluation of the
project which is included in the Overview.
5.        The Western Africa Regional Office gratefully acknowledges the val-
uable assistance provided by the Government and project staff, as well as
other officials involved in the project.  Their assistance greatly contrib-
uted to this report.
6.       Largely because the PCR and Overview give adequate insights into
project implementation experience, the project was, after lengthy discussion,
not selected for audit by OED. The report was sent to the Borrower for com-
ments on September 17, 1984; however, none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NIGERIA: LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1091-UNI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        The Livestock Development Project was the Bank Group's first invol-
vement in the livestock sector in Nigeria. It was identified in August 1969,
prepared in January 1972, appraised in July 1972, approved by the Bank's
Board in December 1974, and became effective in July 1976.   The project
closed in July 1983, two years after the original closing date.
Objectives
2.        The primary project objective was to improve beef cattle produc-
tion by nomadic and semi-nomadic graziers, small, near subsistence level
farmers, large commercial farmers and the public sector.   In addition, the
project provided for the introduction of improved research, training and mar-
keting support services, and the importation of trypano-tolerant breeding
stock.
3.        Described in the SAR as a large-scale pilot project, the project
essentially adopted two strategies for livestock develoment.   The first was
large-scale development proposals based on imported technologies.  This was
largely unsuccessful, except for the importation of N'Dama cattle breeding
stock into trypanosomiasis-infected areas.   The second strategy relied on
improving existing small-scale production systems integrated into agriculture
and can be considered successful.
Implementation
4.        There were substantial delays between appraisal and effectiveness.
The delay between appraisal and approval was caused largely by extensive
internal Bank reviews of the project proposals.   Effectiveness was then
delayed by eighteen months pending completion of legal formalitie;.
5.        During a mid-term review in 1978 it was agreed that the marketing,
training and research components should be eliminated, as n' progress had
been made and there appeared to be little prospect of them taking off.  By
December 1979, three and a half years after effectiveness, and after minimal
progress, both the Bank and the Federal Government were considering cancel-
ling the loan. However, as a last effort to save the project, a new manage-
ment firm was contracted, and it succeeded in getting the project started.
By that time costs had escalated con<:iderably.   In addition, inflation was
much higher than SAR estimates.   Totai costs up to the end of the project
period amounted to US$59.5 million compared with the SAR estimate of USS42.0
million, a cost overrun of about 42%.

Results
6.        Overall, the project was a failure given the negative economic rate
of return (ERR).   Incremental meat production was 22% of appraisal esti-
mates. The largest components financially--the large-scale livestock devel-
opment activities, particularly ranching for fattening and breeding, and
grazing reserve management--produced losses throughout the project period.
Compared with other livestock projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, this experience
was not unusual. The Nigerian Agricultural and Cooperative Bank was expected
to handle the credit component but, as lending procedures were never agreed
to, the LPU had to fill the gap.
7.        The ERR of the investments was estimated at appraisal at  11%.
Overall, the ERR is negative, but the main successful component, smallholder
fattening scheme, produced a high rate of 35%. The introduction of imported
N'Dama cattle breeding stock into trypanosomiasis-infected areas is also con-
sidered successful. Additional non-quantifiable benefits, such as the estab-
lishment of a livestock production-oriented institution, stimulation of the
private sector in production, marketing and credit, and the development of
techniques and legal measures to promote the settling of pastoralists, will
accrue to future projects, such as the proposed Livestock II Project.
Sustainability
8.        Despite the fact that the project overall was a failure, there were
successful  components.   These were based on the improvement of existing
small-scale livestock production systems.   Most importantly, a successful
approach to livestock development was determined which produced all the quan-
tifiable benefits generated by the project. This approach would be the prin-
cipal strategy for livestock development adopted in the second livestock
project. Coupled with this was the development of an institutional framewock
which made available technical and veterinary assistance, credit, and
research findings to the livestock producer. Despite the fact that the suc-
cessful components (particularly the smallholder fattening scheme) were orig-
inally designed as a minor part of the project, the considerable demand for
the services among farmers has encouraged the Federal Government to expand
the project nationally.  The Bank also feels a considerably modified follow-
on project proposed by the Federal Government is justified, and has appraised
and negotiated such a project.
Findings and Lessons
9.        The following principal lessons have emerged:
-  development models must be small scale, as are most production systems
in Nigeria, and based on small technological improvements to existing
production systems;
- the private sector should be utilized fully in production, marketing
and credit;
- livestock development should he integrated institutionally with agri-
culture;



-v -
- institutional arrangements and responsibilities should be agreed
during appraisal; and
- provision for adequate monitoring and evaluation, research and
training is essential.
10.       These lessons have formed the basis for the preparation and apprai-
sal of the Second Livestock Development Project which has been negotiated and
which is expected to be submitted to the Board for approval shortly.

NIGERIA
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1091-UNI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview of the Livestock Project Unit Project Completion Report (LPU/PCR)
1.       The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Livestock Project
Unit, which was responsible for project implementation.  The report is
thorough and appropriately critical.  Except for some information contained in
Bank files, the report covers all relevant information concerning the
project. Gaps in the analysis, which have been filled by reference to
documents unavailable to the Nigerians, are indicated in this Overview, as are
instances where the judgement of the Bank differs from that in the LPU/PCR.
In addition, as the LPU/PCR does not include an economic re-evaluation of the
project, the Region has completed one, which is included in this Overview.
2.       With about 10 million beef cattle, 30 million sheep and goats, 135
million poultry, and approximately 100 million inhabitants, Nigeria has by far
the largest livestock population and market for animal products in Western
Africa. Ercept for a highly commercialized and modern poultry industry
serring the main urban centers, and improved disease control, the subsector
has remained essentially unchanged during the last century. Through a series
of disconnected efforts, Government sought to stimulate the industry given its
slow growth rate (less than 2% per annum) and general inefficiencies.
Government efforts have, however, been channeled into direct production
schemes which have not taken off or which have been generally ineffective.
3.       Against this background, the Bank assisted in the financing (US$21.0
million) of the first Livestock Development Project. This was a production
oriented, large-scale pilot project, with the principal objective of
determining which animal production strategies would be most successful in the
Nigerian context. It was the Bank's first involvement in the livestock sector
in Nigeria.
4.       The project was identified in August 1969, prepared in January 1972,
appraised in July 1972, approved in December 1974. and became effective in
July 1976. The delay between apraisal and approval was due mainly to
extensive reviews cf the project proposals in the Bank. Subsequently,
effectiveness took a year and a half due to delays in completing legal
formalities. The project was designed to improve methods of beef cattle
production by nomadic and semi-nomadic graziers, small, near subsistence
farmers, large commercial farms and the public sector. This would be
implemented through grazing r:serve management, smallholder fattening, and
breeding and fattening ranching. It also provided for the improvement of
research, training and marketing support services for farmers and graziers,
and for the importation of trypanotolerant breeding stock.  It was intenaed
that the project would be carried out by a new Livestock Project Unit (LPU),
which would coordinate all technical, credit, veterinary, marketing and
infrastructural development efforts. By 1978, two years after project



- viii -
effectiveness, the marketing, research and training components had still not
taken off and they were eliminated from the project.
5.       Three and a half years after effectiveness, after minimal progress,
both the Bank and FGN were considering cancelling the loan. As a last effort
to save the project, a new management firm was contracted and it succeeded in
getting the project off the ground. By that time, costs had escalated
considerably due to the long delays in starting implementation, and to
inflation being much higher than SAR estimates. Other factors, such as the
management contract, and additional credit funds made available for the
smallholder fattening scheme (SHFS), also influenced cost overruns, which, at
project completion exceeded SAR estimates by 42%.
6.       Described in the SAR as a large-scale pilot project, the project
essentially adopted two strategies for livestock development. The first was
large-scale development proposals based on imported technologies. Except for
the importation of N'Dama cattle breeding stock into trypanosomiasis-infested
areas, that was unsuccessful. The second relied on improving existing small-
scale production systems integrated into agriculture and is considered
successful.
7.       Overall, the project was a failure given a negative economic rate of
return. Incremental meat production was 225% of appraisal estimates. The
largest components financially--the large-scale livestock development
activities particularly ranching for fattening and breeding, and grazing
reserve management--produced losses throughout the project pe'riod. Reviewing
other livestock projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, this experience was not
unusual. I/ The Nigerian Agricultural and Cooperative Bank was expected to
handle the credit :omponent but as lending procedures were never agreed to,
the Livestock Project Unit had to fill the gap.
8.       What was unusual about the project compared to most livestock
projects in Sub-Saharan Africa was that there were successful components.
These were based on the improvement of existing small-scale livestock
production systems. Most importantly, a successful approach to livestock
development was determined which produced all the quantifiable benefits
generated by the project. This approach would be the principal strategy for
livestock development adopted in the proposed Second Livestock Development
Project (Livestock II). Coupled with this, was the development of an
institutional framework which made available technical and veterinary
assistance, credit and research to the livestock producer. Despite the fact
that the successful components (particularly the smallholder fattening scheme)
were originally designed as a minor part of the project, the considerable
demand for the services among farmers has encouraged Government to expand the
project nationally.  The Bank also feels a considerably modified follow-on
project proposed by the Federal Government is justified.

9.       The razching components - both fattening and breeding, were
unsuccessful. This was due to poor management, political interference from
State Governments, and-unrealistic production coefficients and cattle
purchasing requirements proposed in the SAR. While the production
coefficients were modified twice, based on recommendations from Bank
consultants who regularly supervised the project, they proved to be too
optimistic. Due to the continued poor performance of the northern ranches,
the Bank finally recommended in 1982 that project management discontinue
support, and remaining funds for these ranches were reallocated to the more
successful smallholder fattening scheme. Support was continued for the
southern ranches, in part because performance was better and improved for
periods of time, and to safeguard the imported N'Dama cattle which were hel-
on these ranches. An expatriate ranch management advisor was sited on the
ranches to assist directly.  Due to the many problems encountered (LPU/PCR
paras 103-112 and 195-201) performance was not satifactory.  It is proposed
under Livestock II that a large number of the N'Dama cattle be sold off to
existing mixed farmers who have experience with the N'Dama breed. The Bank
disagrees with the LPU/PCR which proposes additional efforts be made to revive
the state ranches covered by the project. The 1981 Nigerian prepared
livestock subsector review recommended the Government withdraw from and avo_d
additional investments in direct production schemes. The Bank contributed to
this study and has informed Government that it supports most of the study's
recommendations including the one mentioned above.
10.      The development of private ranches was held up by the Nigerian
Agricultural and Cooperative Bamk (NACB)mainly because the credit
requirements had not been agreed prior to project effectiveness. NACB has
approved only ten out of a projected 50 loans for private ranches, and they
appear to be no more successful than the public ranches. Part of the proble-
was the SAR requirement that the loans should be for livestock investments
only--most applicants wanted to utilize funds for agricultural activities as
well.  This is a logical request, both technically (integration of livestock
activities into agriculture) and financially (improve the farm operation's
cash flow). The proposed Livestock II includes a smaller scale mixed farmi:.g
model requiring less sophisticated management. It would be promoted through
existing mixed farmers.
11.      Grazing reserve management, whereby grazing regulations were imposed
on pastoralists who had historically made uninhibited use of a free resource
(range lands), was equally unsuccessfull/. Ironically, on at least one
grazing reserve, the ecology, (which the project attempted to preserve) was
degraded further than it was before the project started. On other reserves
there was a change in the development approach which lead to a promising
development model (para 1.15).
12.      The smallholder fattening scheme (SHFS) was successful once it got
off the ground. Demand for credit exceeded supply and LPU sought additior--
funds: some River Basin Development Authorities and three ADP's assisted.

More importantly, the commercial banks became involved and to date have lent
over US $1.0 million in SHFS loans. This is an important step in getting
livestock production into the hands of the private sector and not dependent on
the fluctuating availability of Government funds. The success of this
component owes in large measure to the development approach adopted. This
approach has been the most important lesson learat from this project and would
form the basis for all the development models in the proposed Livestock II.
-    it built on an existing development model, making simple
technological improvements. Through credit, it made the development
of the model accessible to the small farmer (butchers and traders
with higher capital availability had practiced this before);
-    with the exception of some veterinary drugs, all inputs are locally
produced and do not compete with other sectors of the economy. Thus
the model is independent of the changing government policy on levels
of imports allowed (the poultry industry is particularly susceptible
to this);
-    three benefits accrued to the participating farmer:
(a)  additioual income from the sale of animals increased farm income
approximately one third;
(b) integration and mutual benefit to his agricultural production
system as well as the livestock system. He utilized his crop
residues (which, if left in the field would have provided only
marginal additional fertility), and the manure to fertilize his
fields or to sell (see footnote 3, economic analysis of SHFS);
(c) on gaining experience with cattle, some farmers wished to
acquire more for breeding and/or as work animals.
The Livestock II project proposes to expand this component, but taking into
account the upper limits on the availability of cattle for fattening.  A ram
fattening model was developed by the project and this would also be expanded.
13.      A smallholder dairy development model for the grazing reserves was
developed by the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) in
collaboration with LPU. Replication of the model began in the last project
year- It ,s now being successfully adopted by pastoralists without ILCA/LPU
promotion and further work is being conducted by ILCA/LPU to refine the model
for inclusion in Livestock II V/. Importation of N'Dama cattle breeding stock
successfully introduced a trypano-tolerant gene pool into the southwest of the
country where the most common breed of cattle in Nigeria (Zebu) cannot
survive. Due to much higher rainfall than the north and consequent greater
pasture growth in the area, there is considerable potential for the breed (see
para 1.08 for future proposals).
14. To date, agriculture and livestock have been handled through separate
project streams by the Bank and the Federal and State Governments.  The Bank

the L-ivestock II project preparation reports.

should take the lead in integrating the two sub-sectors, as this artii'cial
separation is clearly a disservice to the farmer who is interested in
introducing livestock into his production system. Large livestock components
should not be included in future ADP's but provision should be made for a
small group of livestock staff to coordinate with LPU and assist in
implementing LPUT development models in ADP project areas. Given minimal
additional training by LPU, the agricultural extension staff could identify
and assist technically the same farmers they normally service.
15. Institutional arrangements were insufficiently worked out during
preparation and appraisal. The SAR, without prior agreement, required NACB to
change its operating procedures and guarantee requirements.  In addition, it
was agreed during negotiations that the procedures, terms and conditions of
NACB sub-lending should be submitted to the Bank for approval after project
effectiveness. As procedures were never agreed to, this caused problems right
through the seven project years and delayed considerably the implementation of
several project components.
16. Arrangements with the marketing agency were also not worked out prior to
project effectiveness. The marketing agency never expressed interest in the
project, and after various unsuccessful attempts by the Bank and LPU to work
out suitable operating procedures, the component was dropped.
17. LPU, on the other hand, has helped fill a great need by providing a
practical, production-oriented approach to livestock development. It has been
able to channel its own technical resources and those from other institutions
(credit, research, training, extension, and veterinary) to the benefit of the
private producer. During the project period, there was a conscious effort at
training indigenous staff particularly at middle and upper management
levels. Many of the positions held by expatriates have now been taken over by
Nigerians. Thus, the costs of expatriate management is expected to be
significantly reduced under Livestock II. While LPU still needs strengthening
in certain areas, it has established a sound institutional base, well
supported by Government. Recently, and during a period when other Bank
projects suffered severe funding shortages, the Federal Government provided
the project with additional funds (equal to the Bank Loan) to increase its
lending program (particularly smallholder fattening) and to expand nationally.
Economic Reevaluation
18.      Overall, the project has a negative rate of reLurn but the most
successful component (SHFS) produced a high rate of return (35f).  However,
the project served a most useful function as a large scale pilot project by
identifying, through the successful components, an appropriate livestock
development strategy for Nigeria.
19. As described previously(para 1.06), other than the importation of N'Dama
cattle, the components which relied on imported technology, failed. These
included state breeding and fattening ranches, private ranches and grazing
reserve management.
20. Considerable benefits did accrue to the components wrhich relied on
improving existing production systems.  The SHFS produced an incremental 615



- xii -
tons of meat during the project period. A large proportion of funds for the
scheme was made available in the last project year, thus incremental
production is expected to increase during the post-project years (about 400
tons in PY8 alone, surpassing SAR estimates). Under conservative assumptions
(see footnotes to Table 1) the SHFS component produced an ERR of 35%. In
addition, successful technology has been developed by ILCA, assisted
financially by LPU, for a settled pastoralist dairy model, substituting the
grazing reserve management.
21. Additional benefits are non-quantifiable and/or will accrue to future
projects (proposed Livestock II):
(a) the development of an institution which is primarily production
oriented, which did not exist prior to the project. The focus of the
institution is now towards improving existing production systems and
it has involved the assistance of research, credit veterinary and
training institutions to the benefit of the livestock producer.
Support from both State and Federal Governments for the institution
and the approach is excellent;
(b) stimulation of the private sector. Given the performance of direct
production schemes, Government policy has shifted towards promoting
the private sector. The proposed Livestock II would embody this
strategy: all production and marketing, and part of input supply and
credit would be covered by the private sector. Equally important,
this also signifies a reduction in Government's recurrent
expenditures;
Cc) introduction of trypano-tolerant breeding stock into the southern
part of the country where only selected breeds of cattle can
prosper. The Livestock II would continue, on a large scale, the
distribution of these cattle to existing mixed farmers;
Cd) development of techniques and legal measures to. promote the settling
of pastoralists. This will assist in avoiding the existing
heightening tensions between agriculturists and pastoralists.
22. Prices. Derivation of an economic price for beef presents a number of
difficulties. The series available for international trade in beef
necessarily refer to a 'modern' sector product--e.g. frozen, boneless imports
into the US. This is very far from being comparable with the co=odity
produced and traded in rural Western Africa. Prices for the fresh commodity
turn out to be significantly higher.
23. Beyond the questions of an apparent preference for fresh meat, there are
further problems in relating the value of local beef output to typical
international price series.  The analysis of an animal in terms off sides or
quarters will miss a considerable proportion of the products that have
consumption value under 'Western African conditions. Products which butchers
-n many other countries would clasify as tinedible offal' are eaten in Western
Africa, including the hide. It should also be recalled that the limited
geographical coverage and irregular effectiveness of electricity supply mean
that refrigerated imported products are a feasible substitute for local meat
for only a small proportion of the population. This situation will take many



- xiii -
years to change.
24. Cattle herds move freely internationally, and a large number of cattle are
trecking in from areas as far away as the Sudan. For this reason and those
described above, the market rate is perceived as an adequate representation of
its true economic value and is utilized as border prices. Adjustments by the
standard conversion factor for local transport costs are made to arrive at the
farugate price (see notes to ERR table).

Bank Performance
25.      Although described 'n the SAR as a large scale pilot project, it was
probably unwarranted to have embarked on the development of unproven
technology on such a large scale. This is particularly true for the ranching
components. In hindsight, given the continued poor performances of the state
ranches, particularly in the north, and the Bank's unsuccessful experience
with similar livestock projects in Sub Saharan Africa (para 1.06) the Bank
should have cancelled disbursements for the northern ranches at an earlier
stage. Additionally, the appraisal mission paid insufficient detail to
institutional arrangements. This problem plagued the project throughout the
seven years of implementation.
26. Bank supervisions were generally satisfactory. Efforts were made to right
the many technical, institutional and managerial obstacles encountered during
project implementation, but certain additional disciplines would have been
beneficial during supervision. For instance, it would have been useful to
have had a credit specialist visit the project periodically, particularly at
the beginning, to establish operating procedures with NACB, and later, once
the SHFS got off the ground.  Similarly, if a financial analyst had
participated in more supervision missions the problems of poor accounts and
maintaining adequate credit records wculd probably have been avoided. It
would also have been preferable for a sociologist to have visited the project.
27       The Bank does not agree with the LPU/PCR statement (para 243) that
"supervision should have been once a year as the project deals with large
ruminants which have a long gestation period". While this latter part of the
statement is true, much supDervision attention was devoted to institutional
problems and the SHFS which involves six or less month cycles.  In addition,
there was need for a follow-up on technical recommendations. These sort of
problems need to be followed up every six months.
Integration of Livestock with the Agricultural Development Projects
28.      The successful components and models of Livestock I demonstrate that
there is an important and necessary place for livestock in agricultural
systems. Yet most Bank financed ADPs in Nigeria have no, or very small
livestock components.  It is recommended that future ADPs have a minimum
number of livestock staff to liaise with LPU and assist in promoting LPU's
proven models in the ADP project areas. This does not suggest that each ADP
should include new livestock components--but rather a livestock officer with a
small number of staff to coordinate .with LPU and the AD? extension staff. As
most of the models are implemented by farmers, usually to the direct benefit
of his agricultural production systems (oxen for plowing, manure for
fertilizer, crop residues as feed), the agricultural extension staff could,
given minimal additional training by LPU, identify and technically assist the
same farmers they normally liaise with.
Lessons Learned
29.      The PCR and the preparation of the proposed Second Livestock
Development Project have proceeded concurrently. This has been particularly
useful in the design of the follow-on project.  Five principal lessons have
emerged:



- xvi-
(a) livestock development must be small scale, as are most production
systems in Nigeria, and based on small technological improvements to
existing production systems. Local inputs (particularly feed) should
be utilized to the greatest extent possible. The private sector
should be utilized fully in production, marketing and credit;
(b) livestock should be integrated into the agricultural production
system, and the Bank should take the lead in integrating livestock
institutionally into agriculture, through the Bank's Agricultural
Development Projects;
(c)  more work needs to be done before appraisal to review the models
economically and sociologically;
(d) Institutional arrangements and responsibilities should be worked out
during project preparation and agreed at appraisal; and
(e)  LPU should be strengthened sociologically and through a monitoring
and evaluation u_it. An analysis of training needs should be done
and a training component included in the second project. In
addition, much more on-going research is necessary through
association with such institutions as ILCA and the National Animal
Production Research Institute.



NIGERIA
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1091-UNI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I    BACKGROUND
1.           During the late 1960s it was apparent that with larger
earnings from the oil and other industries, the proportionate contribution
to the GNP of the livestock sub sector was declining. At the same time
there was a continuing population increase.
2.           An offer of assistance, made by IBRD to the Federal 'Government
of Nigeria, in the identification and preparation of a livestock project,
led to Mr D N Sutherland a Bank staff member visiting Nigeria in 1969 and
preparing a preliminary project identification report which focussed
attention on the possibility of projects being found in the beef
development sector of the livestock industry.
3.           With agreement of the FGN, the Bank, in 1970, commissioned the
CDC London to review the livestock industry and the proposals for cattle
development and assess their feasibility. CDC presented their review in
1971 identifying certain elements which they felt could be recommended for
Bank funding.
4.           The preparation report for the Livestock Development Project,
the first of its kind in Nigeria, was submitted in January 1972 and
appraised in July/August of the same year.  Extensive examination of the
Project by the Bank delayed approval until December 1974 at whida time all
the legal formalities were completed.
5.           Under the approved loan 1091-UNI, $us2l million (50% of
Project Cost) was made available by IBRD to improve methods of beef cattle
production by traditional and commercial livestock producers. The project
was designed to cover Bauchi, Borno, Gongola, (originally North-Eastern
State), Kaduna, (originally North-Central State) Oyo, Ondo and Ogun
(originally Western State).
6.           The development of livestock productioa, obviously of primary
importance, was required to make available to the Nigerian populace
sufficient animal protein. Suitable grazing land and livestock were
available which could be improved under short and long term development
strategies.



7.           The national herd comprised approximately 10 million cattle
and 40 million sheep and goats, most of which were in the hands of less
commercially orientated traditional livestock graziers. The majority of
these were found in the Northern States of Nigeria, due to the distribution
of the tsetse-fly.
8.           The mr.ln factors affecting local livestock  production  were
insufficient water points especially in the dry season, drastic seasonal
fluctuation of available forage and inadequate health services making it
difficult to maintain a steady increase in production.
9.           There was a need for less sophisticated but effective methods
of beef cattle production including fattening as well as development and
management of commercial ranches.



II PROJECT FORMULATION AND APPRAISAL
A.  ORIGIN
10.         At the instance of the Federal Government of Nigeria, a
technical mission selected by the IBRD visited Nigeria with a view to
Identifying a project that would be suitable for Improving livestock
production with particular emphasis on beef cattle. A Project was prepared
in January 1972 and appraised in July/August 1972 with cost estimates
updated as of early 1974.
11.         The major factors limitlng cattle production that were
considered were:-
(i)   nutrition i.e. quantity and quality of feed on a year
round basis;
(i)   water availability;
(ii)   animal health services;
(iv)   land tenure (especially the use of Grazing Reserves).
12.         The project was prepared based on the following strategy to:-
(i)  help farmers take up beef production using modern and
relatively intensive techniques;
(ii)   open up new grazing areas through tsetse-fly eradication
and
(11i)  provide incentives for nomadic graziers to settle an" co
enter the market economy.
13.         The preparation mission between January 10th and April 17th,
1972 estimated the IBRD loan component of the project at $us7.68 million.
The total project cost being $us12.8 mllion.
It was proposed that livestock development would cover:-
(i)  80 ranches made up of groups of Fulani cattle owners;
(ii) 25 individual owned growing-on/fattening ranches;
(iII)   20  Western  States  producers  (individual a and
cooperatives);
(iv)   6 ranches (4 existing and 2 new ones) owned and operated
by a National Livestock Developsent Cospany to be
formed;
(v)  3 ranches (2 existing, 1 new site) to be owned and
operated by a subsidiary company to be formed by the



-4-
Western Nigeria Development Corporation named the
Western Livestock Company.
The land area required for the proposed project would total
about 324,000 ha (800,000 acres).
B.  PROJECT PREPARATION & APPRAISAL
14.         In July/August 1972 a Project was appraised totalling $us42.0
million suitable for an IBRD loan of $us2l.0 million of which $us13.O
million would be on-lent by the Federal Government to MACB which in turn
would lend to the ultimate borrowers.
15.         The overall management and co-ordination responsibilites of
the project were vested in the Livestock Project Unit (LPU) (to be
established under the project) headed by a Project Manager administratively
responsible to the Director, Federal Livestock Department (FLD) in the
Federal Ministry of Agriculture. Its principal objectives are summarized
as follows:-
(i) the provision of credit and technical services to
parastatal ranches at Gombole (Borno Livestock Company)
Darazo (Bauchi State Livestock Company), and the five
ranches of the Western Livestock Company within Oyo, Ondo
and Ogun states;
(ii) the provision of credit and technical services to NLPC
ranches at Mokwa and Manchok;
(iii) the provision of 1,500 smallholder and 50 long term
development credits throughout the former Western, North
Central and North Eastern States;
(iv)  the establishment of 414,400 ha (1,600 sq. miles) of
grazing reserves, and improving the existing 121,500 ha
(300,000 acres) Kukar Jangarai Reserve in Kaduna State;
(v)   the establishment of applied research and pasture
production units and of a training centre, and the
provision of 16 man-years of overseas training;
(vi) establishing a pool of heavy equipment for project land
development, road and dam construction activities; and
(vii) employing consultants to evaluate the project on a regular
basis, to conduct appropriate studies, and to prepare a
further stage of the national beef cattle progra-e.
The Project was planned for completion over an eight year
period.

17.        The difference in cost between the preparation report and the
appraisal report was as a result of the cost updated to early 1974 and
the increased scope of operation especially under the on-ranch investment
and Technical Services.
C.   LOAN NEGOTIATIONS & APPROVAL
18.        During the loan negotiations, key issues raised by the Bank
were:-
(i)   procedures,terms and conditions of NACB sub-lending would
be satisfactory to IBRD, and NACB would submit for IBRD
approval, no later than five months after loan
effectiveness, proforma sub-loan agreements for the state
ranching companies, private ranches and msallholders and
(ii)   key staff positions in LPU would be filled by persons with
experience and qualifications acceptable to IBRD and the
borrower.
19.        Conditions of loan effectiveness would include:-



- 6 -
(1)  the execution and delivery on the part of the Borrower of
a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement with lACB;
(ii) the establishment of LPU and NLPC, BLC, BSLC and ULC and
(iii) the appointment of the Project Manager and two Deputy
Project Managers of LPU.
and       (iv)   that IBRD had received satisfactory assurances on the part
of Kaduna, Borno, Gongola, Bauchi and the Western States
with respect to the carrying out of the projects including
the secondment of staff.
20.       Conditions of disbursement of the funds earmarked for the
Western State ranches and the Borno, Gongola, Bauchi and Kaduna States
grazing reserves would be that:-
(a)   satisfactory arrangements had been made-for the
procurement of suitable cattle for the Western State
breeding ranches and
(b)   Borno, Gongola, Bauchi and Kaduna States had acquired
areas as grazing reserves satisfactory to IBRD.
D.  TARGET & GOALS
21.       The target beneficiaries,  being the traditional livestock
producers and commercial ranching operations, were producing at very low
rates; calving rates were low (402-50Z) and mortality high (1OZ-20Z for
calves and 4Z-1OZ for adults) and growth-to-slaughter maturity slow (4-5
years). The project target was aimed at reversing these co-efficients of
production to achieve better results.
22.         The Project was to provide ranch development plans and other
necessary technical assistance, infrastructural development through its
Heavy Equipment Unit and credit through NACB, to the commerclal and
parastatal ranches. Additionally, an Wdama importation programme to the
parastatal ranches in the Western States was to provide stock which were
trypano-tolerant and showed a resistance to cutaneous streptothricosis.
23.          The development of 7 State owned ranches would demonstrate to
the private sector improved methods of cattle production and thls, combined
with the sale of the multiplied livestock, credit facilities, staff trained
in livestock development and extension, and the project Reavy Equlpment
Unit was to stimulate the private sectors.
24.         By continuation of the tsetse fly eradication in the North of



the country an inc ease in the area of useable grazing land was to be
effected assisting in the productivity of the traditional nomadic graziprs
herds. At the same time this group of producers were to be encouraged Lo
settle and thus improve their production methods by the establishment and
development of grazing reserves, the provision of credit to them via NACB
and technical assistance from LPU.
25.          An incremental production of meat was to be produced by the
provision of credit to 1,500 small holder farmers enabling them with
technical assistance and inputs procured through the project, to purchase
feeder cattle and fatten them before sale to slaughter. This would
demonstrate crop/stock integration and increase small farm incomes.
26.          These measures were designed to improve the availability of
meat to a rising population and increase the livestock sub sectors
contribution to the GNP.
E.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION
27.        The project which was designated to promote improved methods of
beef cattle production in Nigeria consisted of the following:

III PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.  EFFECTIVENESS & START-UP
34.          Conditions of effectiveness stipulated in the loan agreement
between IBRD and Federal Government of Nigeria were as follows:
(a)   Due authorization of -atification by all necessary
corporate and governmental action of the execution and
delivery of (i) the Project agreement on behalf of the
NACB and (ii) the subsidiary loan agreement on behalf of
the Federal Republic of Nigeria and NACB limited.
(b)   Appointment of tte Project Manager and two Deputy
Project Managers of the LPU.
(c)   Reception of   assurances satisfactory to the Sank, with
respect to the carrying out of the project, from the
North Central, North Eastern and Western States of
Nigeria.
(d)   Establishment of the Livestock Project Unit and the
ranching companies viz: seven breeding ranches and two
fattening ranches.
35.          Loan and Project agreement were made on the 20th March 1975
with the subsidiary agreement on 23rd April 1976. The Project became
effective in July 1976, the delay being caused by completion of legal
formalities.
36.          Start up was slow with the first two years, rather than one as
scheduled at appraisal, limited tc LPU staffing, headqua:ters
establishment, procurement of heavy equipment and other inputs and the
preparation of detailed plans for grazing reserves and private and state
ranches. Lending procedures for the SHFS were agreed between LPU and NACL
Little physical development took place.
37.          At October 1977, N3.5 million had been disbursed under the LPU
component, of this FMF had provided N1.7 million primarily for local staff
salaries. IBRD had disbursed directly NO.3 million for expatriate staff
costs and Nl.5 million for the procurement of 4 scrapers, 4 caterpillar
D7's, 4 D6's, 3 graders, 3 low loaders, 1 wheeled loader, 8 wheeled
tractor, implements for these, a caravan, 15 lorries and 16 vehicles.
38.          In November 1976, a Bank Supervision Mission reported to
Government its dissatisfaction with Project Management proposing, amongst
other remedies decentralisation.  In April 1977 the Director FLD deplored
the lack of progress to the Mission and required that improvement occur



- 10 -
within 6 months. It was agreed to phase out the expatriate Project Manager
over a nine month period and engage management support consultants.
39.          In July 1977, the Permanent Secretary FHARD, in a formal
letter to the Bank expressed concern over the cost effectiveness of the
project, questioned the advisability of retaining the nine expatriates
employed by the Project, and requested the Bank to review present and
future operations of the Project with a view to improving its performance.
B.   REVISION & REORGANIZATION
40.        The review took place during the latter part of 1977 and in
their report of May 1978 the mission found that the majority of the
original components remained viable, except for the elimination of the NLPC
fattening ranches, a scaling down of research activities and a reduction in
the number of grazing reserves.
41.        Whilst poor management was found to be a major factor in project
performance , other contributory problems were:
(a)   The  division of the original 3 states to form 7 new ones
in 1976;
(b) Poor availability of FMF funds for the project. LPU funds
were abitrarily cut by FMF budget division early in the
1977/78 fiscal year leaving LPU without funds in September
1977.
(c)   Lack of funds, enthusiasm and organisation at NACB who
expected pre-finanA.ing by FMF of all NACB obligations to
the project prior to disbursement to the project
beneficiaries. This was contrary to the loan, project and
subsidiary agreement.
(d)  NACB's stringent loan security requirements.
(e)   The necessity to revise costs of the project appraisal due
to inflation whilst the Permanent Secretary FNARD required
that the project be implemented largely within the
original cost estimates.
(f)   NLMA's delay in agreeing the inventory valuation and in
the transfer of the assets to NLPC and its domination of
NLPC who demonstrated little interest in receiving
assistance from the project.
42.        The following summarizes the Review Mission's recommendations:-



- 11 -
(i)   The production components of the project (State ranches
private farmers, suallholder fatteners and grazing
reserves) should remain unchanged beyond a reduction in
number of grazing reserves (from 17 to 6). Nevertheless,
the mission recognized that further modification to sub-
component numbers may be necessary, depending upon the
response given to each;
(ii)   The NLPC fattening ranches of Mokwa and Manchok should be
removed from the project;
(iii)   The research component should be limited to modest fields
trials at State level;
(iv)   Training was recognized as an important component but more
effective and less costly application was recommended
through maintenance of the overseas training programme and
adjustment of in-country training to an in-service
programme conducted at State level;
(v)   The Heavy Equipment Unit should be split into 3 units each
under the control of a Ranch Technical Officer;
(vi)   Provision of funds for consultancy services should be
retained with some modest reduction;
(vii)   As a matter of urgency, funds should be provided by FMF
for continued operation of LPU. Thereafter, an improved
budgeting system should be instituted by LPU, and EFN
should ensure that funds, as required under the project
agreement, are provided;
(viii)   A meeting should be called under FMP chairmanship to
resolve misunderstandings in the relationship between NACB
and the project and to ensure that NACB willingly accepts
and can fulfil its role to the project. This will involve
the provision of N1.5 million by FMF to NACB for immediate
funding requirements;
(ix)   The Livestock Project Unit should be reorganized so that
greater autonomy is permitted to Ranch Technical Officers
located in the States;
(x)   A much improved reporting system should be immediately
introduced at all levels;
(xi)   Before the departure of the Project Manager in mid-1978,
either a Nigerian, supported by a visiting agent
consultancy service should be appointed, or an expatriate
replacement recruited;
(xii)   A Financial Controller should be engaged; two expatriate
positions (Animal Production Specialist and Pasture
Research Specialist) should be abolished. Expatriates
should be retained for all five Ranch Technical Officer



- 12 -
posts;
(xiii)   Project activities at State Level should be delegated and
strengthened by providing the financial, physical and
personnel resources to permit these units to operate;
(xiv)   As a matter fundamental to the success of the project,
NACB's financial contribution and positive support for the
project should be determined; provision should be made for
its immediate obligations; approval should be obtained for
its remaining cash requirements for inclusion in post
1977/78 Federal budget; loan processing procedures and
NACB's collateral requirements for private farmers should
be resolved;
(xv)   Continued support should be given to Western Livestock
Company;
(xvi)   The Livestock Project Management Committee should be
disbanded. A sub-committee within FLD should be formed to
deal with major financial, personnel and policy issues of
the project.
43.        Government accepted these recommendations, with the exception of
(ii) and (v).  The Permanent Secretary's letter of 30th March 1978
confirmed Government's intent: on to ensure adequate funding for LPU to
maintain the Project intact, a total of N1.6 million being approved for
1978/79.
44.        There was however, a need to recruit replacements for the
expatriates who had either resigned or whose contracts expired, the last
one being the Project Manager whose contract terminated in November 1978.
Government and Bank agreed that a consultant firm with international
experience in management and development of livestock projects be retained
to provide the necessary expertise to implement the nroject. Government
nominated a consulting firm, the principle of which had led the team when
the project had been initially Identified and prepared in January 1972.
With Bank's non-objection, Government negotiated and signed an agreement
with the consulting firm in December 1978 to provide the necessary tech-
nical support staff and back-up consultancy services to the Project.

45.        Changes in project costs to meet the revised programme were as
shown in table 1 below.

___  ____         _____-       -_
+ 874.0             + 874.0
46.       The removal of the NLPC component did not occur until November
1982.  The effect of this was that the project did not have the influence,
previously expected, over prices and offtake of SHFS cattle. Whilst this
was a constant concern to the project, prices obtained by the small holders
appear to have been adequate.
47.        Reduction of the training component led to a lack of
understanding by some RTOs of the reasons for data reporting and a
resultant insufficiency of this information. Also a low standard in some,
of basic animal husbandry and ranch management. Courses in these latter
subjects, had they been available, would have benefited both State ranch
managers and private ranchers.
48.        A further revision took place in August 1981 when Sokoto and
Plateau States were included within the scope of the project with Bank
approval. In 1982, there was agreement with the Bank that the project
would expand to a further four states making a total of 13, but in the
event Federal Government decided that the project should be extended to all
19 states.



- 14 -
49.        It is hard to agree with the Banks comments (December 15th 1982)
that the quality of supervision had decreased as a result of the unapproved
expansion. The remaining six South Eastern States were not included until
staff was recruited to service them. Managew.Rnt costs, however, certainly
rose as a result.
C.   IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
50.        A  comparison  between  appraised  and  actual  physical
implementation is shown in Annex VIII : Table 1.
51.        At revision (1978) the research and training functions were
reduced and the grazing reserve development cut from 17 units to 6.
52.        As NACB were initIally unable to release credit funds Until 1979
the project finally got under way at this date rather than the effective
date of July 1976. As a result of this the project completion date,
originally scheduled for July 1st 1981 was extended to July 1st 1983.
53.        As Government did not accept the elimination of the fattening
ranch component from the project this was continued, without success, until
November 1st 1982. At this time the funds for NLPC were re-allocated along
with uncommitted WLC funds to cover the increased amounts under the small-
holder fattening scheme.
54.        The original and revised aJ!  ttzinns and final disbursement are
set out in table 2 below.
55.        Difficulty was experienced, in the procurement available of
sufficient N'dama cows which would be suitable for breeding, within the
time available. Whilst 6,500 head were to be purchased at appraisal, it was
only with difficulty that the 4,991 head which were imported were obtained,
within the time scale of the Project. (Annex III, iatile 3).
56.        The main factor causing delay was the non-disbursement of funds
by NACB. This not only delayed project implementation but increased costs.
Sporadic disbursement, especially to private ranches and parastatals was a
contributory factor along with ranch management in the poor compliance with
the schedule.
57.        Extreme rigidity with regard to loan security (requirement of
statutory certificates of occupancy) and non-standardisation of other loan
application requirements adversely affected implementation of the schedule.



- 15 -
58.        Action was taken as promptly as possible, the problems were seen
at revision and action taken.  Unfortunately, such action had to be
initiated by LPU unilaterally and since NACB was not part of LPU such
action was only partially effective.
59.        In retrospect, the original time schedule was probably rather
optimistic given the slow response of tile lending agencies and NLPC. It is
difficult however, to see how the schedule could have been restructured.

D. REPORTING
External
61.        Reporting during the first two years was generally inadequate.
Due to lack of manpower and relevant expertise consultancy services were
utilised and in 1979 a report format agreeable to the Bank was set up and
regular quarterly reporting was commenced. LPU reported on behalf of the
borrowers to the Bank, FLD and NACB. Information supplied served as an aid
to the Bank and its personnel on supervision missions.
Internal
62.        In order to provide the necessary information for the report,
monthly and quarterly returns were submitted by zonal offices which in turn
required information from the state offices. Because of the need to
complete accurate returns, zonal staff were alerted to incipient problems
and had available for use comparative figures (quarter to quarter) for
management purposes. Monthly financial returns and a system of imprest
accounts led to firm financial control facilitating the annual external
audit procedures.
63.        Procurement of computers in late  1982 assisted with the orderly
presentation of the large amount of detail inherent in a complex project
and its credit programme.  Such detailed reporting took up much time and
the burden fell most heavily on the planning section at headquarters.
Earlier use of computers could have eased this burden considerably and also
produced more accurate reporting. A further problem was that in some cases
inaccurate information was supplied due to lack of definition and also to
lack of care and understanding.
E.   PROCUREMENT
64.        The initial plant and machinery for the HEU was procuree in
1978, by the first management team under ICB procedures. No provision
however, had been made at appraisal for suitable fuel/lubrication vehicles
to support the field units and though service/maintenance facilities were
included in the investment costs they were not physically in place when the
second management team arrived.   Aquisition of these items locally
contributed to the increased project costs.
65.        Subsequent  offshore  procurement,  of  audio  visual
training/extension equipment, high tensile steel fencing materials, mobile
cattle weighing scales, specialist molasses pumping units and microcomputer



- is -
systems were made on a competitive price basis taking into consideration
the specialised nature of the items relative to the project and the
suppliers ability to provide back up service and support facilities in the
country.
66.        Inputs for the expanded programme were mainly additional plant
and machinery for the HEU, water well drilling equipment and vehicles.
These items were procured on a competitive price basis due to the need for
standardisation and compatability with the existing operation and the
specific requirements of the Project. Since the expanded programme was
funded with FGN funds, the availability of foreign exchange had also to be
considered.
67.        The procurement of the N'dama cattle was carried out by FLD on
behalf of Government and there was initial difficulty in conforming to Bank
guidelines whereby only 75% of the total expenditure of importation would
be met from loan funds. However, it was agreed by the Bank that it would
meet 100% of the foreign exchange costs of this procurement provided that
chie overall total disbursement of the WLC component did not exceed 75% of
its total expenditures.
68.        Capital items locally procured, were road vehicles, tractors and
implements for the zones and HEU. The initial slow supply of these and
essential spares and replacements was due to LPU's poor credit standing, an
inheritance from the original management team's inability to effect prompt
payment against goods supplied. The situation was reversed from 1979
onwards, LPU now being regarded as creditworthy by local supply agencies.
69.        Feed procurement was carried out by LPU in respect of the SHlS.
Substantial procurements were made in 1982 in anticipation of additional
loan funds being made available and an expansion of the SHFS with its
attendant requirement for extra feed.  In the event these funds were
delayed and the expected expansion did not take place on schedule.
F. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION & CENTRAL SERVICES (Annex VII)
70.        Although these costs are in respect of the original project
areas (7 states) there have been substantial cost overruns in this
component; appraised N5.424 million actual N19.78 million. The major
reasons for these are as follows:-
(i)   The initial two year delay in implementation of the
Project. By 30th June, 1978, 90.3% (N4.720 million) of
the appraisal estimate for LPU had been expended but the
Project had not established a co-ordinated field programme
nor obtained any credit funding from NACB. Implementation
only effectively started during 1979 when the management
consultants were appointed.



- 19 -
(ii)    It was also considered essential that LPU should have Its
own staff housing sinee there was none available through
FLD or the State Ministries. 10 staff houses and one
block of flats were constructed to assist the staff
housing requirements. There was no allowance for this in
the appraisal report. Similarly, there was no allowance
for the necessary house furnishings. The block of flats
was rented to the Nigerian Air Force by the then Director
FLD and the rent received is reflected as income in the
LPU accounts.
(iii)   On the decentralisation of the Project into the various
states, as recommended by the Supervision Mission of 1976,
the construction of zonal offices was considered essential
to the establishment of the Project in the various areas.
In all States, Ministry accommodation could only be
obtained on a temporary basis. These costs were not
included in the original appraisal nor considered by the
Review Mission.
(iv)   Staff salaries, wages and other charges are considered to
have been grossly under-estimated at appraisal in relation
to the numbers of staff necessary to implement the
Project. LPU also had to provide the necessary staffing
to carry out credit supervision as no credit staff were
forthcoming from NACB. The reduction in these costs
during the last two years, as estimated by the appraisal
mission, did not take place due to the initial two year
delay in implementation and the consequent extension of
the period.
Cv)   Heavy Equipment Unit costs represent  the excess of the
unit's operating costs over the value of work done. Prior
to 1979, no proper charge rates had been established for
the HEU equipment. Subsequently, hourly rates per machine
type were established based on the annual budgeted direct
and overhead costs (excluding capital costs) and the
budgeted utilisation in operating hours. These rates were
updated on an annual basis in the light of actual costs
and actual machine hours achieved. In the event due to
cost increases and/or under achievement of operating hours
there was a reduced  recovery of lEU costs. Charges for
work done were made to the various components and credited
to REU income.
HEU costs also include the general service work carried
out on Project vehicles as well as adhoc transportation of
tractors, field equipment, feed, and seed as and when
necessary to support the Project field operations. The
costs of these services were never included in the
appraisal report.
HEU equipment rates charged are currently about 70% of the
rates charged by commercial companies, e.g. D7 Crawler -
LPU rate N73.00 per hour - Commercial rate N105.00 per



- 20 -
hour. This difference is considered reasonable since LPU
rates do not include depreciation or profit. Cost of a
dam constructed on WLC Imeko ranch by LPU was N17,518, a
quotation to WLC by a River Basin Development Authority
for construction of a dam in the same area of the ranch
was N61,050.
(vi)   Management Consultant costs are in respect of the supply
of the management support contract of 33 man-years
completed on 23 July 1982 and the extension of that
contract for a further 30 man-years ending by July 1984.
Payments for these contracts have been made from the
Project loan 1091-UNI for the first contract and 2029-UNI
ATAP loan for the extended contract. Other consultant
costs are in respect of both local and foreign consultants
for the inception and the preparation reports for the
Second Project and the retention of a local
licenced Surveyor.
(vii)   Research & Training infrastructural and equipment costs
are largely in respect of the Project audio-visual
programmes for practical training of both farmers and
extension workers.   These were not included in the
appraisal report.
(viii)   A survey unit was created within LPU in 1979 in order to
facilitate procurement of legal land title (Certificate of
Occupancy) to satisfy NACB lending requirements. Although
this was recommended in the Review Mission's report no
reallocation of funding was made. The recurrent costs to
date total N155,000 approximately for this unit.

H.   Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers & Borrower
Consultants
72.        Up until the end of 1978, no consultancy services had been
utilised with the exception of recruitment. Backup consultancy time
suDDlied in addition to the management contract by the agreed
consultancy firm           was as shown in table 4 below.  This support
consultancy led to the formulation of credit control systems,  the
introduction of quarterly reporting in compliance with Bank requirements, a
monitoring and evaluation system, the organisation of marketing techniques
for smallholder fattening cattle, audio visual project training and public
relations methods and increased project activity and performance.

74.        Thirty one and a half man-months further consultancy time was
supplied at the instigation of the Project to conduct investigations and
prepare further stages of the National beef cattle programme. This is
shown in Table 5 below and resulted in the presentation of the Second
Livestock Preparation Report.

76.       An expert was engaged by FLD as Veterinary Consultant in July
1980 for the Ndama importations and to recor-uend an animal health programme
for Bauchi and Borno ranches.
77.        Resources Inventory and Management Surveys were engaged in 1983
to carry out a survey of livestock and land use on the Mambilla Plateau,
Wawa Zange grazing reserve and the tsetse infested areas of Gongola State.
This preliminary report was received in October 1983 with the final report
due in June 1984.
Contractors And Suppliers
78.        From the beginning of 1979 to project completion, management of
the project was effected by a management contract. The contractor supplied
the agreed personnel and performance would seem to have been satisfactory.
Certainly in comparision to the first management team recruited directly by
IBRD there was an improvement in project performance.



- 24 -
79.       The audio visual training/information/public relations films
produced by Cinetec were well presented and produced the necessary impact.
Custom built audio/visual extension equipment designed and supplied by the
same company has given very satisfactory results. Agricultural Systems
Australia Pty Limited supplied good quality fencing materials and cattle
weigh scales to meet Project requirements delivered in Kaduna. Both
companies supplied continuing back up services.
80.        During the period between the first and second management teams,
contracts to the value of approximately three quarters cr a million naira
were awarded within grazing reserves.  This expenditure was outside the
project plan.  A percentage of contract work was poorly carried out and
accepted by LPU owing to lack of relevant expertise. Some of this was due
to slackness, some to lack of knowledge of the particular discipline being
certified, expecially in a field situation, and some to acceptance that
better quality was :jnlikely to be available.
81.        In order to overcome this situation a number of specialist
supervisors/foremen in each discipline would need to be employed and they
thiemselves adequately supervised.
82.        Certain items such as seed were locally purchased despite the
high price and the possibility of being substandard in terms of purity and
potential germination. Importation would have been against Government and
Project policy and extremely slow (with a resultant loss in viability).
Cattle feed was, after stimulation by the smallholder cattle fattening,
driven up in price and poultry and pig feed were subjected to massive
increases in price and sporadic drops in quality as maize become more or
less available according to the vagaries of supply.
83.        N'dama cattle were not as easily obtained as the appraisal
report had assumed. Some 4,333 were imported up to June 1983 with a
further 658 head awaiting importation.  LPU,  FLD and WLC staff in
conjunction with a consultant veterinarian engaged by FLD, selected stock
and carried out the importation keeping cattle losses to a minimum and
ensuriag suitable stock. Quarantine at Fashola ensured that the danger of
transmission of disease was minimised (see Annex III, Table 3).
Borrower
84.        Control exercised by the borrower over the project was fair.
They expressed concern to the bank over Project performance within eight
months of effectiveness (early 1977) and continued to do so until it was
felt that a reasonable level of competence was achieved. They did not
however, nor did the Bank, insist on proper reporting procedures nor on
sufficient financial control during the first two years.



85.        Funds provided by the borrowers were exhausted by Project
Management in September 1977, leaving LPU without finance contrary to
article III section 3.01 (a) of the loan agreement. Adequate funding was
however continued after the Review Mission report of 1978.
86.        The Borrower further failed to conform with article III section
3.09 of the loan agreement within 6 months of the effective date to
provide the Bank with full details of land building and equipment at Mokwa
which was to be transferred to LPU and also failed to make NACB conform
with its committments as stipulated in article III section 3.01(b) of the
Loan Agreement.
87.        It is difficult  to Judge whether or not the Bank was
sufficiently strict in its requirement of reporting and accounting on time
from the Borrower since all correspondence on the subject may not be
available. However, to judge from what is to hand the Bank acted in too
lenient a manner during the initial period of the Project.

XV AGRICULTURAL DIPACT
88.        The overall impact of the project on national meat production
has achieved 22Z of the incremental production estimated at appraisal,
whilst its contribution to the availability of improved breeding stock has
been negligeable. Appraised estimates were over optmistic but performance
fell below that which could have been expected from the traditional
pastoralist. The project has achieved little in the introduction of
technological change in the State and private ranches but its success with
smallholders has helped to move the emphasis in livestock development
policy to this sector. Table 6 below shows appraised and actual incremen-
tal output. Poor reporting has however lowered its value considerably.
89.        State and private ranch performance was poor and showed little
agricultural impact. It should however be pointed out that the success of
these components are necessary to ensure the production of feeder cattle
for an expanded programme. Grazing reserves are difficult to evaluate
without quantifiable results however, the enthusiasm shown by the
organisation of Fulani cattlemen would indicate that the component had some
impact.
90.        The practicability of importation of N'dama cattle,  with
acceptable levels of mortality has been established. Acclimatisation
periods have been defined and a trypanosomiasis prophylaxis programme
developed. Poor technical coefficients after quarantine have however,
reduced the short term impact of the trypanotolerant genetic pool though
this could be reversed by improved results over the longer period.
91.        Total production from the SHFS reached 552 of appraised
production and 682 of appraised loan volume. The sub-project was delayed
through slow disbursement of funds and escalating costs. Targets could
have been exceeded had more funds been available. Liason with commercial
banks, RBDAs and ADPs in order to overcome this problem led to the
inclusion of funds not anticipated at appraisal. Use ^f agro-industrial
by-products and improved rations led to increased weight gains enabling
more than one fattening cycle annually, and the success of the SHFS has led
to small ruminant packages being developed in conjunction with ILCA.
92.        Through its contacts with RBDAs, ADPs and Co-operatives, LPU has
stimulated interest as a means of increasing family farm incomes and
commercial funding institutions have been encouraged to venture into
hitherto little used avenues of credit. State Ministry staff involvement
with LPU has been uneven but where they have participated in the working of
the SHFS they have been given a sense of purpose otherwise absent.
Contacts between LPU and ILCA have been extremely fruitful in the
establishment of smallholder development packages.

the small herd as at the end of June 1983. Only performance data from 1981
onwards may be considered to be reliable.

Looking back on the appraisal projection the antic.,pated
stocking rates are far too optimistic and would have severely overstocked
the ranch had they been achiewed.
95.       Technical Problems & Constraints
(i)    The 1977 Plan was unrealistic particularly with regard
to technical co-effiecients.
(ii)    The area of the ranch is too small be viable.
(iii)    The State did not approve the 1980 Revised Plan (This
plan envisaged 3000AU belonging to the ranch but kept in
the adjoining grazing reserve).
(iv)    CBPP was brought in by purchased cattle in 1980 putting
the ranch in quarantine; the veterinary department did
not take adequate steps to identify infected cattle so
the disease spread through most of the herd.
Consequently cattle were sold at salvage prices and stock
movement was restricted.
(v)    The level of ranch management was low.
(vi)    Little maintenance of infrastructure was done so
tractors, trailers and machinery broke down and were not



- 29 -
repaired, improved pasture reverted to bush.
(vii)    Credit was allowed for cattle sold and debtors were not
taken to court.
(viii)    Following adverse reports NACB stopped disbursements in
1981 which contributed to cash flow problems.
96.        Remedial Steps Taken
(i)    Quarterly budgeting and monitoring system introduced.
(ii)    More land was identified.
(iii)    Ranch Plan revised in 1980 and regularly reviewed but not
implemented.
(iv)    LPU assisted with a tractor.
(v)    LPU recommended cattle management criteria.
97.        Technical Assessment:  Due to its small size, lack of Board
expertise, and inadequate Ranch Management it was unlfkely that this ranch
could have succeeded. Although technical performances bad Improved by June
1983, the improvement was insufficient.
2.0 Borno Livestock CompnY (BLC) (see Annex II)
98. The overall operating performance of Gombole Ranch (appraisal Bornu
Ranch) compares unfavourably with both the appraised and early revised
(1979/80) herd projections. Overall, objectives have not been achieved and
are not likely to be under the present management structure.
99.       Table  8 below reflects the appraised estimated performance and
the existing situation at the end of June 1983. Only performance data from
1981 onwards may be considered to be reliable.

100.      Technical Problems & Constraints
(i)    Inadequate ranch management to start with which
deteriorated to the extent that by June 1983 It consisted
of one diplomate and one livestock assistant on the ranch
being visited by the General Manager (resident an hours
drive away in Maiduguri) about once a month.
(ii)   Lack of infrastructural maintenance.
(iii)    Cattle theft.
(iv)    Due to cash flow probleus N100,000 borrowed from a
Commercial Bank for purchase if fattening steers was used
to cover recurrent expenditure.
101.      Remedial Steps Taken
(i)    A good working relationship was established between LPU.
the General Manager and Ranch Staff but little
improvement was achieved.
(ii)    A quarterly budgeting and monitoring system  was
introduced by LPU; and there were regular revisions of
the ranch development plan.
102.      Technical Assessment: Gombole ranch has a definite potential
for further development as infrastucture is in place and there is access to
9,000 ha additional grazing as well as the 15,100 ha ranch. The following
points would need to be carefully considered:
(i)   Regular maintenance and renovation of the existlng
infrastructure;
(ii)    A qualified and experienced ranch manager must be
recruited at the outset and be closely assisted by LPU,
or direct LPU management utillsed.
(iii)    The proposed fattening component must be given greater
impetus if future cash flow crises are to be averted.
(iv)    Additional development will he required to realise the
potential of Gombole ranch.
3.0 Western Livestock Company (WLC) (see Annex III)
103.      The overall operating performance compares unfavourably with
both the appraised and early revised (1979/80) herd projections. Overall,
the prime objective of an increased calving percent.ige was not achieved and
the present calf mortality is far from satisfactory.  This situation can
only improve following improvements in ranch management and nutrition.

the existing situation at the end oZ June 1983.

(nB:  only 2 ranches were on-going pre-development; appraised (PY 7)
assumed 5 ranches; PY 7 is year ending June 30th 1983).
105.       As at 30th June 1983, the 4 ranches carried 6575 head.  A
further 664 head were at Fashola Quarantine Ground and an estimated 650
head were awaiting shipment in Gambia.  Total - 7889 head 18.7Z of
appraised target of 42084 (44592 less 2508 steers bought for fattening).
106.       These figures may well be inaccurate. A recount done at 13th
December 1983 showed a total head of 6529 with 650 head at Fashola, a total
herd of 7179. This represents 17Z of appraised.
107.       Performance data before 1981 is so unreliable as to be useless.
That of 1981 is thought to be reasonable and that of 1982 and 1983 to be an
improvement over that of 1981. Because of this no estimate can safely be
made of births deaths and sales during the project period. The poor
performance can be judged from the following:-

108.       Table 11.      WLC - Key Performance Indicators

b)         But all performances had deteriorated  by 30th June 1983 viz:-
Upper Ogun   Ogboro   Akunnu   Oka-Ako  All Ranches
Calving Z                15         42        22       52           29

Overall Mortality Z      12          14        8       17            12
109.       It is apparent that the appraised technical co-efficients were
much too optimistic, given the available management.  In retrospect,  the
appraised feeder steer purchases, commencing in PY 1 at 3000 for all
ranches and running to a maximum in PY 5 of 12369 would have been
impossible to attain since these quantities were never locally available.
110.       Technical Problems & Constraints
{i)    None of the Read Office or Ranch Management saaff have
been trained in commercial ranching.
(ii)    The extra care needed by imported Ndama for up to 2 years
from their arrival was not appreciated initially.
(iii)    Generally, maintenance of infrastructure is poor.
(iv)    Pasture maintenance is minimal.
111.       Remedial Steps Taken
(i)    Financial management improvements were made with the
introduction of a revised accounting system, a quarterly
budgeting and monitoring system and the revision of
consolidated and individual ranch development plans on a
regular basis.
(ii)    Technical support advice was adopted for the importation
of Ndama cattle from The Gambia; detailed rancb work
programme/standing orders were drawn up; a herd recording
system was introduced; a ranch staff review to cut back
on overstaffing was proposed; and LPU also introduced a



- 33 -
system of regular ranch visits by the technical advisory
staff.
112.      Technical Assessment
(i)    Particular heed should be given to basic cattle
management and to:-
(a)  Maintenance of fencing and the introduction of
effective grazing management;
(b)  Regular  maintenance  of  water  supplies  and
reticulation, existing plant and machinery, stock
handling facilities and buildings;
(ii)   The small areas under crops both for grains and fodder,
should be increased in order to:-
(a)  Reduce regrowth of shrubs and bushes to a minimum.
(b)  Provide as much dry weather feed from residues and
silage as possible.
(c)  Improve cash flow from the sale of grain and/or the
reduction in purchased feeds.
iiI)    It would be beneficial to establish forage legume fodder
banks and the use of leguminous shrubs such as Leucaena
and Glyricidia should be investigated for dry season
supplementation.
(iv)    A training and demonstration unit would greatly assist
the efficient running of WLC ranches. Pashola holding
ground could be used as such a unit under the direct
control of LPU's representative on WLC's Management
Committee.
4.0 N'dama Imports (see Annex IlJ, Table 3)
113.      The appraisal report did not cover this separately so no
comparison can be done. Although the importations were the responslbility
of WLC and they were invoiced by NACB for the FOB cost Banjul, LPU did
nearly all the physical work and all the management at Fashola Quarantine
Ground. All costs (N340 per head) after loading at Banjul were borne by
FLD/LPU.
114.       The importations can be said to have been successful, achieving
within the 7 year project period an importation of 4,333 head with a
further 658 head awaiting shipment at Banjul. This is equal to 77% of the
appraised 6,500 head. Deaths were high in the first two shipments at 11.7Z



- 34 -
however, once problems had been identified and remedied, subsequent
shipments averaged only 2.22 mortality bringing the average down to 5.24Z.
A further 1.29Z forced sales because of accidents and sickness, and 0.18Z
other losses gave a total of 6.712 losses from all causes between Banjul
and delivery to WLC ranches (See Table 12 for details).

116.       Problems & Constraints
(i)   Delays in the arrival of the cattle ship at Banjul and in
Problems & Constraints
(i)    Delays in the arrival of the cattle ship at Banjul and In
loading.
(ii)   Insufficient reserve feed stocks at Banjul to meet such
delays.
(iii)  Obtaining sufficiently experienced and conscientious road
transport drivers.
(iv)   Poor selection of cattle in The Gambia.
117.       Remedial Steps Taken
(i)   Reserve feed stocks were ordered at Banjul
(ii)   LPU & WLC staff visited The Gambia to check the selection
of cattle and to ensure sufficient feed was on hand.
118.       Technical Assessments
(i)    Losses can be kept very low provided experienced
personnel supervise all stages of the operation from
loading of Bar.jul to delivery on ranch and every effort
is made to reduce stress.
119.       Special nutritional care for some months after arrival at the
WLC ranches proved necessary, particularly during dry weather.  It took
upto 2 years before the cattle became fully acclimatised.
4.0   National L.vestock Production Company (NLPC)
120.       No technical performance since this component was dropped.
B.   PRIVATE RANCHES  (see Annex IV)
121.       The legal right to land-use enables the livestock farmer to
initiate development and management practices which result in greater
productivity while preserving the land as a resource. It was with this in
mind that some 50 private ranch developments were appraised (later reduced
to a target of 25) to be assisted by long term credit and technical support
by the Project.



- 36 -
122.       To date, of 37 ranch plans submitted to NACB only 10 have been
given credit approval, and only 9 of these have received any disbursements.
None have completed their disbursement programme and all started-up quite
late in the Project.
123.       Performance has been poor, none of the ranches has achieved the
planned objectives, end the majority have failed to appreciate the
development concepts and management practices that must be adopted. Only
one or two have shown any real desire to develop the ranches and improve
the cattle.
124.       Problems & Constraints
(i)    The ranchers were generally not active livestock
owners/producers but rather selected from the
entrepreneurs in business, trading, or civil service as
these were able co meet NACB's lending criteria.
(ii)    Due to the reduction of the training component,  no
training was given to the beneficiaries, and there was a
lack of practical training for the supervising RTOs.
(iii)    There was no on-ranch management expertise to cope with
the financial and technical demands of the planned
ranches.
(iv)   Visits were made by the STO on a once a month basis.
Farmer/owners were often absent and thise resulted in a
lack of technical advice, although where advice did reach
the farmer, it was often not followed. Follow up and
supervision were insufficient because the Project was
unable to recruit a specialist RTO.
(v)    Delayed approvals and disbursements by NACB due to their
lending criteria (Certificate of Occupancy, Tax Clearance
Certificate, mortgage assets/guarantors).
(vi)    The early planning was unrealistic, suggesting practices
such as the pooling of tractor use and joint ownership of
resources which under the existing conditions were
unlikely to be successful.
(vii)    Most of the on-going ranches are too small in size to be
viable as extensive ranching operations.
125.       Remedial Steps Taken
(i)    The LPU established a Survey Section to assist in
obtaining the necessary Statutory Certificate of
Occupancy.
(ii)    Replanning of individual ranches and closer liason with



- 37 -
NACB departments involved in approval and disbursement of
loans.
(iii)    Initiation of regular visits to the ranches by LPU staff
to advise and monitor development on those ranches with
available funds.
126.       Technical Assessment:   There is little justification for
continuing the development of private ranches in the present format however
assistance should continue as far as possible to ensure committed
development is completed.
C. SMALLHOLDER FATTENING SCHEME (SHFS) (see Annex V)
127.       The operating performance of the Smallholder Fattening Scheme
had been very successful, exceeding the appraised estimates on technical
and financial bases. In spite of a slow start-up, this component has been
readily accepted and implemented by the traditional sector beneficiaries
(see Annex V, Table 8).
128.       Cattle fattening was an established though inefficient practice
in the north of Nigeria whereby traditional butchers and traders took
advantage of the seasonal market price fluctuations. Al_hough having a
useful role in regulating meat supplies they contributed very little to
incremental meat production. Based on this, it was appraised that credit
and technical support would be provided through the Project for 1,500 loans
to fatten an estimated 7,500 head and provide an estimated 640 tonnes live-
weight gain from project year seven onwards.
129.       The SHFS Revolving Credit Fund was established in 1979, based on
a N1,660 loan for 6 months. Cattle, supplementary feeds and veterinary
inputs were provided in kind to reduce the risk of misappropriation, to the
value of the loan plus the beneficiary's contribution.   Interest was
charged at 5% per annum. Initially some 5 head were fattened per loan, but
this was reduced to 4 or 3, until the loan volume was increased to N2,000
in January 1983. Interest is currently 7% per annum.
130.       During the five year period to the end of June 1983, a total of
3,609 loans had been dispersed (445 (12.3%) through commercial banks) of
which 716 (19.8Z) were renewals. Funds in default represents 537 loan
equivalents (14.7% of all loans disbursed) giving a loan recovery rate of
85.3% of total loans disbursed to the end of June 1983.
131.       An estimated 14,227 head of cattle and 2,102 sheep have been
fattened through the scheme with negligible losses. This represents an
incremental production of 906 tonnes cdw saleable meat 21 tonnes mutton and
is approximately equivalent to an additional 7,500 slaughter cattle at an



- 38 -
average of 125kg cdw each.
132.       Average liveweight of cattle at purchase was 272kg in Northern
Nigeria and 211kg in the South.  Average daily liveweight gains were 0.62kg
and 0.34kg per head (over approximately 160 days) respectively (see Annex
V: Tables 9). For the most part, cattle fattening was contained within a
120 days period and an estimated 0.64kg gain per head per day has been
assumed overall. in fact, over shorter periods, gains of up to 1.00kg per
day have been achieved in the north.   Mortality (125 head) was less than
1% and of this 68 deaths were due to rinderpest in PY 7. Sheep mortality
is estimated at 5Z.
133.       Most cattle have been purchased and sold through traditional
cattle markets where prices are based on subjective "by eye" assessment by
the cattle trader. There are no auctions nor price guarantee systems in
operation at this time.
134.       The fattening of rams  for the Salah festivals (festival
fattening) was introduced in the Northern States as a loan package. The
number of rams per loan varied from 14 to 20. Liveweight at purchase war
between 20kg and 70kg, and daily liveweight gain varied from 0.122kg to
0.175kg per head. 130 such loans were disbursed fattening an approximately
total of 2,102 rams, giving an estimated incremental production of
approximately 21,388kg carcase weight. Potential profit in the model
(Annex V Table 8) is higher than i'r the cattle model due to the premium
prices paid at Salah which occurn only once a year. Expansion of the
scheme is thus restricted but the possibilities of fattening for other
festival periods are being explored.
135.       Problems & Constraints:  There were considerable delays at the
outset caused by:
(i)    Difficulties were encountered by NACB in est.ib11shing the
RCF account, and in providing adequate fun-a until the
early 1983;
(ii)    There were no established lending or accounting
procedures or guidelines for technical and credit staff
to follow resulting in the poor selection and inadequate
supervi:. on of beneficiaries;
(iii)    NACB did not provide the recommended credit supervision
personnel;
(iv)    In the initial stages no account was taken of the cattle
price cycle with the result that fattened animals were
of feced for sale at the time of lowest price. In order
to counteract this the animals were kept on and sold at a
later period, but the cyclic effect of cattle prices
restricted the fattening to one period per year;



- 39 -
(v)    Difficulties arose with purchase prices and storeage of
feedstuffs;
(vi)    State extension services and cooperatives were slow at
first in involving their staff in the programme.
136.      The overall result was that the LPU had to provide Its own staff
for credit supervision and extension in addition to their technical support
role and to inject a considerable amount of cash into the RCF to 'bridge-
finance' the scheme. As a result of this the rate of defaulters rose
rapidly.
137.      Remedial Steps Taken
(i)    Lending criteria and procedures were agreed with MACB;
(ii)    A simple accounting system was established by LPU;
(iii)    Training efforts were provided by LPU for all personnel
involved in the scheme, supported by audio-visual aids;
(iv)    Commercial Banks were introduced to the schese with some
success;
{v)    Mobile weigh-scales were acquired for monitoring of the
scheme;
(vi)    Participating on-lending institutions such as Cooperative
Societies, RBDAs, and ADPs were encouraged to join the
scheme;
(vii)    In order to overcome the effect of cyclic cattle prices
upon the frequency of fattening, linkages were forged
with the NLPC and butchers cooperatives with a view to
establishing parallel marketing outlets for sale cattle;
(viii)    Alternative feedatuffs including wheat bran,  dried
brewers grains, cotton seed cake, groundnut cake pellets,
and molasses were assessed and rations recommended and
used based upon both prices and local availability (Annex
V Table 10);
(ix)    Trials were conducted to determine the optimum timing of
each fattening period.
138.      Technical Assessment:  The SEFS has conclusively demonstrated
that cattle can be successfully fattened on crop residue/grazing
supplemented with agro-industrial by-products. Traditional producers have
readily adopted the technology and the deman;' for renewals of loans is a
reflection of their satisfaction with the profitability of the scheme. The
follnwing points should be considered for further expansion/improvement of
the SHFS:



- 40 -
(i)    Investigation of alternative feedatuffs and periodic
assessments of least-cost rations fo' each fattening
region;
(ii)    The fattening period should be reduced in order to keep
the incremental production costs down and to stimulate
more loan cycles per year;
(iii)    More attention should be given to selection of suitable
cattle with detail paid to the type and condition at
purchase;
(iv)    The linkage with NLPC should be strenghtened for the
necessary parallel marketing scheme to become a reality
but other avenues, such as butchers groups and
cooperative marketing channels should be explored in
order  to  avoid  a  single  major  market  outlet.
Possibilities of direct contract marketing at a premium
price to reflect the better meat/bone ratio and killing
out percentage, should also be investigated.  In order to
be able to guarantee these supplies however, it would be
necessary to have a greater pool of fattened cattle upon
which to draw;
(v)   An intensified training and extension effort  is required
to ensure proper supervision and further drop in the
default rate.
D. GRAZING RESERVE DEVELOPMENT
139.      The original 16 grazing reserves plus Kukar  Jangarai scheduled
for development at appraisal were cut to (6 including Kukar Jangarai) at
revision. These were already recognised but not gazetted under the grazing
reserve law of 1965. Infrastructural development, put in during the
project period has followed reasonably closely to the appraisal except
where replanning has been necessary. Staff housing and stores erected
outside planned development during the interim management period are a
further exception to this. Gazetting at June 1983 had still not taken
place.
140.      Infrastructural development has in the main been in the areas of
maintenance of resident reserve management and the balance in the provision
and maintenance of water and some limited areas of strip sown forage for
the graziers. Water provision has been good but the improvement of pasture
started late and due to poor seed bed preparation, seed of low viability
and immediate grazing by local graziers has not been successful. The more
recent establishment of fodder banks, initiated by ILCA are proving much
more successful.



- 41 -
141.       Problems & Constraints:   Some of the major problems which
contributed to this less than satisfactory development are:-
(i)    With none of the reserves gazetted as grazing areas and
without the means to provide formal land title, State
Governments had limited powers to enforce control of the
numbers or activities of pastoralists and their cattle;
(ii)    The grazier groups were not initially consulted nor kept
regularly informed of the proposed developments. Neither
were they aware of the responsibilities they needed to
assume to maintain and conserve the resources of the
grazing reserve nor the reasons for so doing.
(Mi)    Progress was extremely slow to start with.  Staff were
seconded only slowly to the grazing reserves even after
completion of housing, water and power supplies. In some
cases the calibre of staff willing to reside within the
reserve was affected by rural living considerations, and
as a result of the lack of facilities was difficult;
(iv)    In some caseb .5.ere was an estrangement of the graziers
and the reserve management staff which jeopardised any
c.-ance of the livestock owners cooperating with further
development.
142.       Remedial Steps Taken:  Over the last few years of the project,
several developments have been noted which helped alleviate some of the
above problems.
Mi)    The introduction of small forage legume "fodder banks"
which were fenced off and managed by individuals in the
reserves to supplement their productive breeding cows
into the dry season;
(ii)    The  establishment  of seed  multiplication  plots
successfully provided a basis for a more concerted effort
in pasture improvement;
(iii)    The encouragement of extension staff to increase their
contact with the graziers, to spend more effort assessing
the need and wishes of the users and involve them more
actively in the development of what are essentially their
reserves;
(iv)    Recognising the need for formal land use rights for the
graziers so as to enable grazing cooperative groups to
obtain a long term leaseholding within the reserve.  At
last a mechanism for security of land tenure had been
effected (viz. amendment of the Grazing Reserve Law by
Bauchi State Government);
(v)    The provision of livestock service centres, at which the



- 42 -
graziers had access to essential veterinary services,
animal feed supplies, and where ttiyay could be introduced
to the advantages of developmeni credit through the
Smallholder Livestock Credit ProgrL-.le. Rere they could
see for themselves the merit of fod.-ir banks and get the
technical support to establish their nuwn
143.      Further  sociological investigation is requir,.1 to assist in the
settlement and aquisttion of either traditional or le.-il land title and
extension efforts must be intensified to increase the i. volvement of the
prospective settlers within the grazing areas. This will ead to a greater
understanding and awareness of their need to control st. Aking rates and
improve resource conservation to the long term benefit if the graziers
themselves.

VI  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
144.      Total Project Cost, Including committed expenditures, to the
30th of June 1983 (PY 7) stands at N36.44 mn compared to N27.64 mn
appraised. This represents an over-run of 32Z of appraised estimate as
detailed in table 13 below.
145.      Allowing for variations on foreign exchange rates from year to
year, the total cost over the period is equivalent to $US 59.70 mn (at MI -
$US 1.64 overall) compared to $US 42.01 mn appraised (at Ni - $US 1.52).
This represents a 42% over-run of appraisal as detailed in Table 14 below.

The following financial rates of return are estimated from herd
projections baned on existing (PY 7) technical performance. All capital
costs (including committed funds) have be?n included at PY 7 and no further
infrastructure and equipment costs are considered thereafter.

Financial Convenants
150.      The financial convenants contained in the Project agreement were
appropriate and adequate.  NACB did maintain records consistent with
accounting practices. Its accounts were audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. However, it was probably unreasonable to expect
them to be furnished to the Bank not later than four months after the end
of each accounting year.  The NACB accounts have not been generally
available until 10 to 12 months after the accounting year end. This has
been due to the various changes of the Board of NACB and the delays in
reappointing directors to enable the necessary Annual General Meeting to be
held rather than any delay in the preparation of the accounts themselves.

VII  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE & DEVELOPMENT
A. LIVESTOCK PROJECT UNIT
151.      Livestock Project Unit was established as the implementing
agency for the Livestock Development Project within the Federal Livestock
Department of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture.
152.      During the initial two years (1976-78) the management of LPU
failed to establish operational linkages with the various Institutions
(MACB, NLPC and State Ministries). This appeared to be mainly due to a
lack of understanding of the LPUs role and its relatIonship with these
Institutions. The centralised structure on which LPU then operated,
whereby the technical experts were mainly based in, and operated from,
Kaduna, did little to establish positive relations with the various State
Ministries.
153.      After the employment of the Management Consultants in January
1979, staff were posted to the various states and with day-to-day contact
through the CVOs, CLOs and Permanent Secretaries succeeded in establishing
sound linkages with the various State Ministries. A clearer understanding
of the Project objectives was established and a positive relationship has
been successfully built up with the NACB. LPU has also established
effective linkages with other Federal and State Institutions vital for the
successful implementation of the Project (RIDAs, Co-ops, ADPs).
154.      Training with the use of audio visual aids and workshops was
carried out for LPU staff and more limited zonal training for State
extension officers. Farmer involvement was increased with the use of audio
visual aids at village level to demonstrate both the technical and
financial aspects of the various production models. A considerable cost
overrun due to greater than expected inflation and late Implementation has
been experienced and this was contributory to the reduction of the project
practical training component. Some overseas training of selected LPU staff
has been carried out.
155.       Monitoring and evaluation  activities were stepped up with the
aid of computers and the recruitment of the necessary trained staff. A
technical co-ordination section has been established to assist in obtaining
and disseminating technical standards to the various LPU operations at
State level.
156.      LPU in conjunction with FLD assisted WLC in the successful
importation of 4,991 head of N'dama cattle.

157.       Infrastructural developments on State and private ranches and
grazing reserves have been satisfactorily carried out by the HEU. Where
problems were encountered in obtaining Certificates of Occupancy for credit
application a survey unit was formed in order to facilitate their
availability.
158.       A Heavy Equipment Unit was established and for the first 2 years
operated from Kaduna under the HES. This was subsequently de-centralised
with separate units in Kaduna, Borno and Ibadan under the control of the
HES and the respective STOs. This arrangement was not successful and under
the new management team control reverted to the HES at Kaduna. One unit
remained at Ibadan controlled by the Heavy Equipment Co-ordinated who is
responsible to the HES for the implementation of the work programme agreed
between WLC and the STO Ibadan.
159.       At the same time correct recording and job allocation systems
were introduced, hourly and mileage charge rates for the various items of
equipment were established and these were updated on an annual basis from
1979 onwards. Job completion certification and invoicing procedures were
established. The HEIE also carried out general service work on project
vehicles, ad hoc transportation of tractors and field equipment, feed and
seed.
160.       In 1981, a pasture development unit of 4 wheeled tractors and a
D6 crawler was formed to ensure the improved performance of pasture
establishment on WLC ranches and with this and the foregoing improvements
HEU was able to carry out the necessary infrastructural developments on
State and private ranches and grazing reserves.
161.       The Small Holder Fattening Scheme within the project has
increased meat production and small farm incomes and by virtue of the
commercial banks involvement with this small holder livestock credit
component, their development in the field has been stimulated. LPU has, by
close liason with RBDAs and ADPs also stimulated the interest of these
bodies in livestock components.
162.       Livestock Project Unit has made consistant efforts to recruit
suitably qualified staff and has been successful in identifying and
promoting senior Nigerian staff whereby they are now responsible for the
implementation of the Project at State Level. At Headquarters Nigerian
staff head the Credit, Accounts and Survey Unit and manage the sub-sections
of monitoring, planning, mechanical supervision and heavy equipment
workshops.
163.       Livestock Project Unit has therefore established itself as an
institution in the livestock development field with the in-house capability
to provide the necessary technical services, credit supervision and
infrastructural development assistance to the livestock producers.

B.   NIGERIAN AGRICULTURAL & COOPERATIVE BANK.
164.       NACB as the Federal controlled Agricultural Credit Bank was the
logical vehicle to designate for the credit funding of State and private
ranches and smallholder loans.
165.       At appraisal it would appear that no problems were forseen.
Assurances were obtained from NACB that Project agreement with IBRD and a
subsidiary agreement with FGN would be signed and credit provided.  NACB
would take final decisions on each loan guided by technical advice from LPU
and would further provide an adequate number of loan officers and clerical
staff attached to the SHFS and LPU who would be responsible for determining
the credit worthiness of potential parLicipants in the private ranching
scheme.
166.       Project agreement and the Subsidiary agreement stated that part
of the loan provided for under the Loan agreement would be "relent
forthwith" to NACB and this was taken by NACB to mean that they would be
primed with funds from FMF before they made disbursements. Clause 9(a) of
the Subsidiary agreement provides for NACB to request funds whenever they
have an insufficiency to carry out Project lending requirements. This
caused a hiatus with loan funds and the major reason for the confusion was
the change in NACB higher management which took place in the long interval
between project approval and effectivity.
167.       Since no funds were disbursed by or to NACB until these
administrative problems were unraveled the Project suffered during the
first two years, a however first tranche in three instalments of NO.5
million was disbursed during 1979 and 1980 and a second trauch of N1.5
million applied for in 1981 was disbursed in 1983.
168.       The conditions of loan for private ranchers stipulated by NACB
were difficult to fulfil and much time was spent by the prospective
beneficiaries on the aquisition of documentation.  This led to late
disbursements and subsequent changes to a hiatus in disbursements.  At the
same time it is true that some applications were made to NACB through LPU
without the necessary documentation and that private ranchers in many cases
felt little urgency for the procurement and presentation of the required
documentation.
169.       Despite all the problems,by regular liason  and the use of
consultancy services, especially in early 1979 when little activity was
apparent at NACB, considerable achievements have been made. Funds have
been disbursed to private ranchers, the SHFS lending criteria and
documentation have evolved and the scheme works. There is now a firm base
of practical experience upon which to build future projects. This base is

that which appears to have been assumed to have been present at project
appraisal.
C. COMMERCIAL BANKS
170.       LPU initiated the involvement of commercial banks in the funding
of the SHFS due to the failure of NACB to provide credit funding on
schedule. The Commercial banks were also willing to play an increasing
role in the LPUs prrgramme under the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme.
171.       The Commercial banks however, are presently showing concern at
delays in receiving their claims from the Central Bank under the scheme.
The extent of involvement of commercial banks in the SHFS is Illustrated by
the table 15 below:-
Table 15.    Year        Total Loans      Amount       Cumulative
Disbursed      (Naira)      Defaulters
PY 3             57          94,620           0
PY 4            112         185,920           2
PY 5             79         131,140          46

PY 7            126         235,680           0
445         765,220
172.       Future possibilities for further funding, as the banks develop
more expertise and hence confidence in evaluating livestock loan
opportunities, would appear to be good. One problem which has been
noticeable is the apparent divergence of loan security requirements both
between banks and, in the same bank, from area to area. Such differences
increase the difficulties for an entity such as LPU to arrange loan funds
and standardization, at least within a bank, would be of considerable
asistance.
D. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (ADPs)
173.       The ADPs proved to be an organised channel for disbursing loans
to smallholder livestock farmers who utilised crop residues readily
available in the projects.  The ADPs also made available extension staff,
for technical supervision in conjunction with LPU, of projects in their



_ 51 -
areas.  Funds for pilot smallholder schemes were made available as
follows:-
Table 16

Funtua            25            41,500*               79/80
Gombe             50            83,000*              80/81
*Loan Value X1,660.
174.       No further disbursements were made to ADPs due to lack of funds
released from NACB. Attempts by LPU to fund livestock loans through
commercial banks at Kano ADP were only partially successful. First Bank
required an LPU guarantee before disbursing and when this was not
forthcoming refused to disburse funds even though sister branches of the
same bank were disbursing loans without such guarantees. Bank of the North
financed 15 farmers.
175.       When funds did become available from NACB, the previously linked
ADPs had been handed back to State supervision and the banks required
suitable guarantees from State. Other potential ADP loan areas were close
to the end of their term. Loans were given on an individual farmer basis
to farmers within the Funtua and Gombe ADP areas.
E.  RIVER BASIN DEVELCIKENT AUTHORITIES (RBDAs)
176.       LPU had initiated linkages with RBDAs as a result of the
interest of the latter in credit funding of livestock projects in its area
of jurisdiction. In the link with Sokoto-Rima RBDA, LPU provided funds
through the SHFS credit fund and gave technical support for the
implementation of the scheme in the RBDA area.
177.       In more recent relationships with RBDAs, using RBDA funds, LPU
provided credit package formats and, jointly with RBDA staff, technical
assistances. Some training was also given. Joint LPU/RBDA cr.iit cards
were issued in the Upper Benue area and, should a parallel institution be
considered desirable, there is every likelihoood that RBDA livestock credit
packages could become self-sustaining.

F. STATE MINISTRIES
178.       Use of the often under utilised State Ministry livestock
extension and veterinary staff by LPU for technical supervision was logical
given that LPU did not have sufficient staff at grass roots level co enable
it to supervise the large numbers of loans attained.  A further advantage
of State Ministry staff was that in many cases they were familiar with the
farmers in their region thus assisting in the selection as well as the
supervision. The opinions and experience of Chief Livestock Officers were
in many cases extremely helpful.
179.       Level of staff provided by the Ministries varied from State to
State, in some cases graduate staff was provided and in others more
practical orientated personnel.  LPU assisted with public transportation
expenses on a monthly basis. Total contribution, depending upon area was a
maximum of N30 per month in areas where considerable travel was involved,
and a minimum of NIO in areas where farmers were more closely situated.
Approxima-e LPU contribution in this area amounted to N34,561 for 1,448 man
months over the period 1979-83.
180.       Without the good will and co-operation of State CVOs it would
have been virtually impossible to effect the SHFS. Drug acquisition and
administration was carried out with the close co-operation of the State
veterinary departments.
181.       Some States were unable to provide sufficient staff for the SHFS
and some had difficulty in the provision of funds and staff on schedule for
the grazing reserves.  This last was exacerbated by the unwillingness of
some State Ministry staff to serve in an area they regarded as isolated
from both social and promotional opportunities. Other States however,
willing co-operated and by so doing made a considerable contribution to the
success of the SHFS.
182.       Where rapport was good between CLO, STO and CVO few problems
arose in the provision of staff even though in many cases State Governments



- 53 -
were some months in arrears with salaries.  It would appear that many of
the staff 'lent' to LPU were happy to be occupied and involved in what most
felt to be a successful enterprise. It is noteworthy that those assisting
in grazing schemes were less enamoured.
183.       Further training of State Livestock extension staff to
supplement the small amount of training offered by zonal offices would have
been useful. However, the SHFS has been seen to operate successfully and
State Ministries and LPU staff have made the necessary liason to give
future small holder credit schemes a platform from which to operate.  In
this case, the assumption made at appraisal has been justified.
G.   BAUCHI STATE LIVESTOCK COMPANY (BSLC)
184.       Darazo ranch was one of the two ranches originally proposed by
the Preparation Mission as a breeding ranch in the former North Eastern
State. Whilst too small t3 be a viable unit on its own in a relatively low
rainfall area, it may have been possible to run as a breeding ranch in
conjuntion with Gombole ranch which in 1977 was split off from it when the
State was divided. In retrospect it is felt that when this occurred Darazo
ranch should have been dropped from the project. Darazo ranch became
Bauchi State Livestock Company.
185.       A three year plan, produced in 1977 was approved in 1979 and
after three disbursements (1979, 1980, 1981) amounting to N91,319 further
disbursements were arrested following adverse performance reports from
IBRD, LPU and NACB.
186.       Problems at Darazo arose from poor administration by a State
selected Board of Directors drawing salaries greater than the ranch could
afford. Appointees had no knowledge of ranching, met infrequently greatly
delaying decisions and allowed credit sales to take place with no legal
action taken against debtors.  The Board also changed key personnel often
and, whilst agreeing with LPU recommendations failed to cause them to be
implemented.
187.       State failed to provide the necessary cash equity on a regular
basis to cover working capital costs. This resulted in an inability to
adhere to the plans, maintain infrastructure already put in by LPU and
indeed even to pay LPU for infrastructural work carried out. There was a
disastrous outbreak of CBPP from gifted cattle because off-ranch quarantine
procedures were not observed. Salary payments were late and these problems
coupled with Civil Service hours and attitudes and poor management due to
lack of ranching experience resulted in a complete breakdown.
188.       LPU attempted to assist by revising plans using an increased
acreage from the nearby grazing reserve scheme, stopping credit sales,



- 54 -
Improving manaaement and by the loan of machinery for maintenance of
fireguards and other infrastructural developments. Unfortunately, LPU had
no executive authority, the attempted use of the grazing reserve was not
implemented and management remained poor.
189.       More practical training is required in respect of specific
technical ranching requirements and more investigation required into staff
motivation in all the State ranches.
H.    BORNO LIVESTOCK COMPANY (BLC)
190.       Gombole ranch at the formation of the new states bacame BLC.  It
was the logical choice by the Preparation Mission being close to Maiduguri,
one of the major cattle marketing centres of Nigeria and having 15.100ha
with access to a further 9,OOOha in a Forest Reserve. It was designated as
a breeding ranch at preparation but, in a later proposal by LPU was more
logically amended to a breeding enterprise plus on ranch steer fattening
with a 4 cycle flying herd for onward sale to SHFS fatteners. The ranch
had previously been a Veterinary Station.
191.       As with other State owned ranches, there were major problems
with administration and management. The State appointed Board of Directors
with high emoluments were awarding contracts on a preferential basis. Such
contracts were of course overpriced and poorly completed. There was little
management or ranching expertise, key staff were moved, Head Office had a
staff of nine persons and the ranch was overstaffed as welL
192.       Such heavy staffing and expenees led to financial problems.
Staff salaries were late leading to Indiscipline, management staff were
depleted (in 1983 one diplomate and one ranch manager remained,) and a
N100,000 loan from a commercial bank earmarked for cattle purchase was used
to meet recurrent costs. Poor records and thefts of cattle were all part
of the picture, and when NACB withheld disbursement of funds cattle were
sold to pay labour and other operating expenses.
193.       LPU had, through the STO, good relations with the General
Manager and by close liason with an assistant ranch manager who was
enthusiastic, managed to get some work done. NACB were persuaded to
continue with disbursements. In 1982, the Chairman of the Board was forced
to resign and a State enquiry initiated but by that time the damage had
been done.
194.       It would appear that without an effective management structure
in the first instance there is little prospect of any of the State owned
ranches developing to become successful enterprises. Conversely, however,
with good management there is no reason why Borno and WLC should not



- 55 -
become, as was hoped at appraisal, resevoirs of breeding cows and store
cattle for fattening for their respective zones.
I.    WESTERN LIVESTOCK COMPANY (WLC)
195.       Western Livestock Company was one of the State operated
livestock companies identified as a vehicle for cattle multiplication. It
was a logical choice, operating at the time two ranches with some
infrastructure and cattle in place and owning a further three undeveloped
ranches. If the reporting at the time of project identification was of the
same calibre as during the project, this may be one reason for the
technical co-efficients used at appraisal.
196.       At appraisal WLC was under the control of the former Western
State but with the splitting of this State into Oyo, Ogun and Ondo it
became necessary to form a holding company, Odua Investments Company
Limited, which would control administratively WLC. Odua Investments
guaranteed the loan to WLC and agreed as per the development plan that
their equity cash contribution would total N1,437,000 over the three year
development period. In the event only N300,000 was made available to VLC
in this respect. They did however, assists WLC with monthly subventions to
meet operating costs.  Had WLC as an independent entity been responsible
for equity contributions it would have been harder to evade its
comittments.
197.       The Board of Directors was changed frequently, and board
meetings were sporadic. Read office expenditure and staffing was very high
constituting a non productive burden upon the company. The Board did not
confine itself to policy but interfered with day-to-day management.
198.       The sicing of the Head Office some 100km from the nearest ranch
is not conducive to frequent visits.  The General Manager,  whilst
enthusiastic, visited the ranches infrequently. The Livestock Manager,
though visiting frequently appeared to have little authority over senior
ranch staff.   The employees were civil servants whose civil service hours
and attitudes did not assist in the operation of the ranch. Cattle which
are close herded cannot obtain sufficient nutrition within an eight hour
day.
199.       Within this situation LPU advice and recommendations even if
accepted were seldom implemented. Relations between LPU and Senior WLC
management were poor up until 1981 at which time, with the advent of a new
STO they improved. It would thus appear that some of the problem was of a
communications nature. Even with this improvement reporting on technical
and financial matters was poor.
200.       Overstaffing and underemployment was a natural corollary to lax



- 56 -
management systems and to compound the problem none of the Management staff
were tratned in practical ranching operations. LPU provided planned
physical developments, a resident Senior Ranch Technical Advisor and
assisted WLC in the importation of ap..roximately 5,000 N'dama cattle.  FLD
assisted WLC with costs of transport, quarantine and health services for
the imported animals and provided the services of a consultant veterinarian
during this period.
201.       The poor technical performance reported in the appropriate
section of this report devolves in the main from poor company structure
administration and management.  There is no doubt that the major mistake
was to allow LPU an advisory role only with no executive authority and that
various IBRD supervisory missions have been too indulgent with regard to
the obvious failings ot WLC management.
J.   NATIONAL LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION COMPANY (NLPC)
202.       The NLPC at the commencement of Project implementation was a
subsidiary company of the Nigeria Livestock & Meat Authority (NLMA)
controlling the operations of Mokwa and Manchok ranches and abattoir. The
Review Mission report of May 1978 recommended the removal of the NLPC
ranches from the Project. This recommendation was made mainly because
NLPC, as a subsidiary company of NLMA was totally reliant on them for
funding and there was a lack of adequate management in the Company. It was
also made in an effort to maintain Project expenditures in line with the
original estimates.
203.       Subsequently, Government and Bank agreed to finance a study of
NLMA, from the loan funds. The study was to make specific recommendations
for the restructuring of the of the NLMA and its activities. This study,
carried out by   the consultant firm                         in early 1979
recommended the creation of a holding company as a central source of
funding and policy formulation, with a series of subsidiary companies
responsible for the operations of the various production units. The
holding company was to be called the National Livestock Production Company
and it was to reLain the operational control of Mokwa and Manchok. This
report presented in April 1979 was accepted by Government and has been
partially implemented.  A General Manager was appointed in July 1979 but a
Board of Directors was not formed until mid 1980.
204-       A development plan was prepared by LPU in conjunction with NLPC
for the re-development of Mokwa and Manchok. This was presented to the
NACB in August 1979 and after much delay was approved by NACB in May 1980.
This approval was subject to NLPC obtaining a Federal Government Guarantee
for the loan amount. Due to the substantial delay in obtaining this
guarantee and the lack of interest and enthusiasm demonstrated by both NMLA
and NLPC becuase the control of the development funds would devolve upon
LPU it was decided in June 1982 that this sum be reallocated to the SHPS.



- 57 -
This reallocation was finally effected in December 1982.
205.       In the interim period, however, NLPC obtained the necessary
guarantee and a loan of N4.979 mn, based on the LPU development plan, was
finalised and a first disbursement issued by NACB in September 1982.
K.   INTERNATIONAL LIVESTOCK CENTRE FOR AFRICA &
NATIONAL ANIMAL PRODUCTION RESEARCH INSTITUTE
206.       With the reallocation of the research and development component
from the early proposals, LPU had to enlist the support of ILCA and NAPRI
for project-related technical research assistance.
207.       NAPRI has been very much to the fore in matters of pasture
production, conservation and erosion control within grazing reserves. They
have also assisted the project in the fields of cattle nutrition and
supplementation.
208.       Applied research, particularly aimed at the traditional grazier-
producer, has provided a basis for development strategies within the
overall grazing reserves programme.  ILCA has worked closely with LPU in
this respect, aligning research and monitoring and evaluating interventions
with a view to narrowing the present information gaps.
209.       Both institutions demonstrated wholehearted support and
cooperation, coupled with constructive research based criticism, for the
LPU programmes. Equally, they are to be recommended for the invaluable
active participation given to LPU sponsored workshops, seminars and
training programmes.
210.       It is proposed that these established linkages be further
encouraged recognised in the second phase livestock programme.
L. TRAINING
211.       It was envisaged at appraisal that a project training centre
would Le established at Mokwa with an outstation at Fashola.  The centre
was to provide, beginning PY 2, 2 year courses with an the emphasis on the
practical aspects of grassland and animal production, animal health, farm
management and production economics.  Courses for private ranchers, State
Ministry employees and LPU staff, would produce trainees competent to
manage commercial cattle operations, both private and public, and to
operate as livestock extension agents. Short courses would be provided for
farmers and herdsmen. The project was also to provide 16 man years of



- 58 -
overseas training for selected graduates in suitable countries. Subsequent
reallocations of project funds exhausted the finances available for the
overseas training component.
212.       No schedule of implementation was made at appraisal.  Two short
training sessions were carried out at the completed training out-station of
Pashola before the review of this component. At that time since no
progress had been made at Mokwa due to the problems with NLMA and due to
increased project costs the review mission recommended retaining the
overseas training programme and cutting out the formal Mokwa/Fashola
programme. In-service and field day training at State level were to be
used in its place.
213.       At project completion the overseas training element despite lack
of funds had been implemented to the extent of 2 LPU employees being sent
to UK universities to obtain their M. Ses, one in animal production and the
other in tropical agricultural develooment, and a further 2 LPU personnel
had been to Australia on a short course covering tropical pasture seed
production techniques. The Senior Credit Specialist or LPU attended a
short course on agricultural credit and the Deputy Project Manager a course
on project planning and implementation. Both were In Washington and were
of 6 weeks and 8 weeks duration respectively. Total overseas training time
was Z 1/2 years. Funding was arranged from local sources.
214.       In service training for LPU staff was mainly limited to
SHFS/Credit Supervision/Monitoring. A British Council "train the trainers"
course of 4 weeks duration took place in 1982 and a joint LPU/ILCA training
session on fodder bank establishment was carried out also in 1982. Apart
from this no training on animal husbandry, grassland, and ranch management
was undertaken due to constraints imposed by insufficiencies of time and
the necessary specialist skills. Six five day induction/credit supervision
courses were completed. A total of 525 man days of training were given to
105 persons. Short training courses at State level for State employees
assisting in the SHFS were given at zonal and sub-zonal office level, and
use of the films and audio-visual equipment at village level assisted
beneficiaries to understand the workings of the SHFS.
215.       The reduction of the training component adversely affected the
performance of the Project. There was a strong need for the training
component envisaged at appraisal which would have provided a training
centre where practical training in day to day ranch management and the more
specific ranching technical skills could be taught.



- 59 -
ViII SPECIAL ISSUES
Substitution & Diversion
216.       There is no evidence among smallholders Private and State
ranches that there was substitution of funds. There were no cases where
the Intended physical developments were not made when the loans were
disbursed. There is little doubt thac most loans made to private farmers
enabled them to use their own funds for entirely different purposes.
Weather & Other Risks
217.       During the project period the rainfall in Borno State fell from
711mm in 1979 to 262mm in 1983.  This cannot but help have had an effect
upon the project and though figures for the rest of Northern Nigeria are
not reported a similar reduction in precipitation is assumed to have
occurred. Grazing was obviously affected, more especially length of
grazing season. However, since performance did not reach the level
envisaged at appraisal in the ranching sector this did not have a major
affect upon Project. Weather had only minor effects on Smallholders (other
than the normal seasonal variation in prices).
218.       The outbreak of rinderpest during 1983 had severe effects on the
cattle industry as the disease had spread widely before counter measures
were taken. There was insufficient vaccine storage storage facilities and
mobility was poor. Some SHFS cattle died despite vaccination and virtually
all markets were closed for some 6 months.
219.       Bauchi SLC was severely infected with CBPP brought in by
gifted cattle which highlights the risk of buying in cattle without
sufficient quarantine measures being taken.
Research & Technical Availabilities
220.       The Appraisal Report envisaged a research programme would be
initiated at Mokwa. Subsequent to the 1978 review mission this was dropped
and although much research was carried out by various institutions this was
nearly all of an academic nature and of limited value to the project. The
exception is ILCA with whom LPU worked closely but their funds are
circumscribed and despite some financial help from LPU/FLD the results from
their work were only becoming useful towards the end of the project.



- 60 -
Supporting Services
Veterinary
221.       Most States have enough professional and subordinate staff to
provide adequate support. However, due to shortage of funds, they have
very few drugs and very limited transport. This has led to livestock
owners attempting, without full knowledge of the effects, to treat their
own livestock.
222.       LPU instituted a system whereby sub zonal offices kept a stock
of drugs, anthelmintics, acaracides etc. for use by veterinary department
staff on SHFS cattle.  This proved effective.  The private ranchers were,
unfortunately, left to fend for themselves and received little help on
veterinary matters from LPU as no funding was approved within the project
for this irvolvement and LPU were already heavily committed both
financially end from a manpower point of view.
223.       A Senior Veterinary Officer within LPU to co-ordinate the
procurement of drugs and to liase with State Veterinary Officers is
considered desirable.
Replication
224.       Whilst the SHFS component of the FLDP has been proven and costs
and returns show profitability and marketing systems appear to be adequate,
at least with ruminants, the initiation of a large number of small scale
loans will require further investigation of marketing channels, and more
particularly on-lending agencies.
225.       LPU staff with the assistance of State Ministry staff have, up
to the present, managed to supervise the loans disbursed albeit at times
rather scantily. In order to replicate the SHFS on-lending agencies should
be identified and definite criteria for NArBs acceptance of them
established. Technical packages developed by LPU/ILCA on cattle fattening
and sheep festival fattening are available. Further packages on goat
fattening and breeding, pastoralist milk production and pig breeding and
fattening are under investigation.
226.       It could be that the original Mokwa/Manchok component would be a
means of guaranteeing market prices and handling, especially with the
addition of a Government floor price. Investigation would be required. In
order to provide the increased number of bulls for fattening inherent in
replication of the small holder cattle fattening component, considerable
attention should br paid to the stimulation of the National breeding herd.
It is considered that in order to supply the increased bull numbers settled
Fulani pastoralists on Grazing Reserves, private ranches and State ranches



- 61 -
all have a role to play.
227.       Cattle numbers in a replicated SHFS must be tailored to the
amount of feed stuffs available within Nigeria taking account of existing
useage. The problems of procurement, distribution and storage could
perhaps be overcome by supplier credit or by the function being assumed by
on-lending agencies such as RBDAs and ADPs.
Settlement
228.       Settlement is taking place over the Northern areas of the
country and within the scope of the Project some settlement has occurred
within the grazing reserves. At Kachia, up until approximately 1977
settlement of nomadic herdsmen was in most cases alongside the main road
outside the grazing reserve but this has now changed to settlement within.
There is a natural desire amongst settlers to congregate close to markets
which is leading to confrontation with local people and will, if allowed to
continue, lead to degradation of the pasture in that area. Work is going
on to convince settlers that the onus of the care, maintenance and
development of the area should be upon themselves. Fodder banks are now
more acceptable to them.
229.       In 1981,  Bauchi State drew up legislation to facilitate
settlement at Wawa-Zange grazing reserve, LPU demarcated and surveyed 16
blocks of 250ha and FLD built a dip and labour lines. LPU made two
attempts to drill boreholes without success. Further efforts are being
made. The area is not settled due to a lack of water. This highlights the
necessity in future similar exercises of adequate land resource
investigations and the Kachia confrontations show the need for adequate
socio-economic research before such areas are demarcated.

X   BANK PERFORKNC
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
233.       In terms of FGN livestock development strategy of the early
1970s, the Bank was justified in supporting State and private ranch
development as a means of introducing a higher level of technology, as a
vehicle for the introduction of cattle suitable for an otherwise little
utilised area and in order to increase the national breeding herd.
Justification can also be shown for the stimulation and development of
grazing reserves in an effort to reduce conflicts between nomadic graziers
and sedentary farmers.
234.       In terms of the success achieved there was obvious justification
for the SHFS. The project has assisted in the insitutional development of
the organisations involved with the FLDP and has established another
essential link between FLD and State Ministries. With the growti of NAPRI
it would appear that the reseach and pasture seed production component
envisaged in the Project at appraisal would have been duplicated.
B. PROJECT CONTENT & SCHEDULING
235.       The inclusion of the training component was necessary. Its
downgrading during the 1978 revision may have adversely affected the
project. Establishment and development of over 2,000 square miles of
grazing reserves was overly ambitious though this was also reduced in 1978
to 1,000 square miles. A smaller area better developed would have been an
improvement.
236.       It is felt that a monitoring and evaluation unit within LPU
would be advantageous in order to monitor the progress of Project
components.
C. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION & OPERATING OUTCOMES
Preparation Requirements
237.       Too much time elapsed between appraisal and effectivity. The
elapsed time was responsible for some of the confusion with regard to the
Loan and Subsidiary agreements with NACB since senior staff had largely
been changed. The long time between appraisal and effectivity should have
further alerted the Bank to the level of management and organisation extant
in NACB.  Costs were rising steeply due to the lost time.
238.       Pre-effectivity requirements stated at appraisal were not



- 63 -
enforced nor did the Bank exercise its prerogative under the term of the
loan agreement. Land for grazing reserves was to be acquired and declared
before loan disbursement could take place. If it was not reallsed that
gazetting was the only legal manner of grazing reserve declaration it would
point to a lack of preparation pre-appraisaL
239.       Whilst assurances were given that Mokwa would be transferred to
LPU within six months of loan effectiveness, the non-transfer dragged on
for two years before the review mlssion made its recommendations.
Similarly NACB failed to produce pro-forma sub loan agreements on time.
Records and reporting were poor and the pressures applied by the Bank
ineffectual.
240.       Appraisal design was not detailed enough and contained  many
inaccuracies. N88,000 shown in cost summary at PY 2 as an incremental cost
for fattening cattle is reported in the model as occurring in PY 1. The
three cattle stipulated in the model for fattening by 1,500 loanees is
reported as a total of 7,500 head.
D. BORROWERS IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY
241.       Although set backs occurred within the initial two years of the
Project these were overcome and implementation was undertaken with some
success.  Development of the pacticipating institutions occurred and
operating techniques became smoother.
OPERATING FORECASTS
242.       These were extremely optimistic though apparently based on those
reported in the CDC review. It is hard to reconcile the wide variation
between appraised and actual technical co-efficients.   Insufficient
preparation scheduled the purchase of nearly 34,000 feeder steers in PY 5
had all gone according to plan. Not only is it unlikely that sufficient
stock would have been available at the beginning of the wet season but the
logistics of their purchase and distribution would have been formidable.
F. BANK SUPERVISION
243.       The Bank visits of October 1979 and May 1980 were not
satisfactory from a technical viewpoint. Since 1979 Supervision Mission
based on six monthly intervals covering all aspects of the project has been
instituted by the Bank. In a project concerned mainly with large ruminants
little change is accomplished within this period and since a Bank Mission
requires the participation of Project staff it may well be that excAssive
visiting is counter productive. An annual supervision would be considered



- 64 -
adequate with the added proviso that a visit could be arranged within the
year should Project Management regard it necessary.
244.       The Mission's scope was adequate but as previously stated an
earlier appreciation of the problems with NACB during the first two years
and more Bank involvement in this aspect, as well as the grazing reserve
legislation and the poor technical assistance rendered to WLC, would have
assisted Project performance.  The presence of a sociologist on the team
could have assisted the project and also that of a financial analyst/credit
specialist for aspects of the small holder credit programmes.
G. WORKING RELATIONSHIPS
245.       There was fair rapport between the Bank and borrower.  Had the
relationship been closer, initial problems which occurred could have been
avoided. '-hilst the Banks reporting requirements were fair and useful
earlier and deeper discussions between the Bank and borrower over the
format required would have led to more timely and detailed iniformation
becoming available to all parties.
R. IMPLICATION OF PROJECT OUTCOMES
246.       The SHFS can be regarded as a success and this element could
certainly be replicated in the country with the previously menitioned
provisions that feed and cattle availability would need to be ensured. If
any one area must be singled out as the Banks most significant
contribution, it would be the recognition of this component at project
identification.  Alternatively the failure of the ranching aspects of the
Project may in the long run be of more importance seen against the succes
of the SHFS since it highlights the future problem of feeder cattle,
already in relatively short supply, being required in ever greater numbers.
247.       Failure of the ranching components cannot be dismissed as poor
management.  Much more in-depth evaluation needs to be carried out on this
aspect. The socio-economic and technical attitudes of potential cattle
managers, whether they manage cattle farms or ranches is disturbing. Until
good practical management is available within the country, little can be
done to impr', e the breeding cattle situation.

XI  CONCLUSIO
248.       It is clear that the project was successful in the field of
suallholder cattle fattening and especially so in the inclusion of
commercial banks into the loan financing. The grazing reserves can be
regarded as a partial success albeit with some extremely worrying factors
which require both technical and soci-economic investigation. The research
function was reduced at review and the substitution linkages with ILCA and
NAPRI worked well.
249.       It has been shown that the State ranching component, for reasons
of poor administration and ranch management, was not totally successful but
it is felt that this is not a justification for the abandonment of this
component, rather that much more in-depth research and evaluation should be
carried out if Nigerias national breeding herd is to be maintained and the
production of feeder steers for fattening encouraged.
250.       One of the major areas for concern in t%ts field is that of
ranch management. Whilst expatriate mar,agement can be imposed upon a
ranching set up as a short term solution, problems occur in the recruitment
of suitably dedicated counterparts for practical traini..;. Suitable
qualifications are not a problem, but attitudes to practical rural
employment are, and since this affects equally the future of grazing
reserves it is felt that much greater efforts should be made through
socio-logical investigation to understand and deal with this problem.
251.       The poor administration in the ranching component by local
Boards can be easily rectified given FGNs willingness to do so. Reporting
to FLD could be directly carrted out by a Ceneral Ranches Manager.  Should
management be given to an entity such as LPU it should be carefully
established that the ranch sector is not part of the Civil Service.
Alternatively state ranches could be managed under contract.
252.       With regard to the private rancheb, some improvement became
apparent latterly but their reduced performance has highlighted a number of
important conclusions. More care must be exercised in the selection of
future beneficiaries and a committment from owner farmers to either utilise
professional management or involve themselves personally in it, given that
they have the necessary experience and background.
253.       It has also become apparent that private rancher is a misnomer
and would be better modified to livestock farmer since under the present
economic conditions in Nigeria agricultural elements are required in the
farm plan as well as small stock in order to help support the farm until
the cattle breeding component contributes to the cash flow. Encouragement
of emergent commercial farmers would be an alternative to the contribution
by State ranches to the national breeding herd or could also be regarded as
a parallel system.



- 66 -
254.       As previously stated appraisal goals appeared optimistic as did
the technical co-efficients given the available management expertise that
the project was committed to use. No prospects were easily abandoned,
rather certain components which could usefully have been more rigidly
controlled (State ranching technical assistance) were tolerated.
255.       The links formed between ILCA, NAPRI and LPU should continue to
be encouraged. Any further projects should include a training centre as
envisaged at appraisal for the teaching of day to day ranch management and
the more specific technical ranching skills. This training should be
extended to Project, State and commercial sector staff at all levels from
herdsmen to Ranch Manager.
