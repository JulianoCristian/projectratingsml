{"cdata!": "The proposed project would constitute\n            the initial five years of a long-term development program to\n            improve the well-being of the rural populations of Mwanza\n            and Shinyanga regions. It will supplement and complement\n            ongoing investment in these two regions, using the recently\n            constituted villages as the basic unit of investment.\n            Specifically, the project would include agricultural\n            investments in proven agriculture technical packages,\n            research, village verification trials, extension, livestock\n            and forestry; financing for land-use planning; a village\n            self-help program; road improvement investments; a water\n            supply component; and funds for project coordination and\n            monitoring/evaluation. The most significant risk facing the\n            project is whether the projected implementation schedule can\n            be maintained. Efforts have been taken to provide the\n            support needed to execute the project according to schedule\n            and modest assumptions have been made with regard to\n            implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
