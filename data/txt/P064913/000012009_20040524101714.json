First, it is important that the Borrower's\n            national capacity to prevent, mitigate, and respond to\n            natural disasters, be institutionalized and strengthened, so\n            that local (and national) programs be managed on a permanent\n            basis; Second, at appraisal, the Project focused on\n            technical assistance, but did not include financing for\n            structural or non-structural aspects beyond the preparation\n            of engineering designs, and feasibility studies for civil\n            works needed for disaster mitigation. As a consequence of\n            Hurricane Mitch, normal rains cause regular flooding, and\n            landslides, therefore financing for construction, and basic\n            infrastructure subprojects should be considered at this\n            point of Project implementation. Third, it is necessary to\n            improve Project management and coordination, and\n            institutionalize project development objectives. The Project\n            is seen as a means to promote cross-sectoral collaboration,\n            to capitalize upon thematic synergies, and, above all, to\n            sustain the development objectives of the Project. In\n            particular, the new Office of Disaster Management, will\n            develop and institutionalize a National System for\n            Attention, Prevention and Mitigation of Natural Disasters\n            which would be responsible for coordinating national, and\n            local efforts in disaster response and risk management.\n            Moreover, an extension of the closing date is required to\n            ensure completion of Project implementation, and demonstrate\n            continued support to its development objectives, given\n            Project activities would not be finished by the current\n            closing date, due to a slow implementation during the\n            beginning of the project. The Credit Amendment include:\n            modifications to required improvements of the national\n            capacity of the Borrower, to reduce its vulnerability to\n            natural disasters at the municipal level; modifications\n            regarding drought management, instead of studies on fluvial\n            geomorphology; capacity building for improved drought\n            information management, required software, and design and\n            implementation of a capacity building plan for drought\n            responsiveness; and, support for the creation of a national\n            system for disaster risk management, prevention, and\n            responsiveness. Modifications to the Credit Agreement are in\n            compliance with the Articles of Agreement, and, it is\n            recommended to approve the Amendment in accordance with the\n            terms set therein."}, "docdt": "2004-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
