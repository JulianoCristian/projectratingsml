7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes

The objective of the Project is to improve the capacity to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters at the mun icipal
level.
i) To develop capacity in national agencies to gather, analyze and disseminate information, and to provide technical
assistance so that they can assist local governments in disaster management; and

ii) To promote disaster vulnerability reduction in highly vulnerable municipalities. This would include: disaster
preparedness, risk analysis and vulnerability mapping, preparation of preventive land use plans, identification of
mitigation measures leading to development of feasibility studies, design of priority mitigation works, and small
mitigation works.

The difference between the original development objectives and the development objective, as stated in the
amendment, is that with the small mitigation works the project is taking a complete approach to reduce the
vulnerability at local level, from the analysis, studies, and design to the small works .

              HONDURAS - NATURAL DISASTER MITIGATION
                              P064913
                           IDA 3361-1-HN

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.    The closing date for Honduras, Natural Disaster Mitigation Additional Financing,
IDA 3361-1-HN, (P064913) will be extended from September 30,2010 until December
30,2010.

2.       Overall, the implementation progress of the Additional Financing IDA 3361-1- .
HN has been satisfactory. As of July 27, 2010 about 79 percent (US$7.2 million) of the
total amount of the Additional Financing (US$9.0 million at time of approval and
currently US$8.7 million due to changes in the SDR rate against the dollar) have been
disbursed. Total commitments (including amounts already disbursed) are US$8.2 million
(94 percent of funds available). The activities remaining to be completed will primarily
be carried out by existing staff and will not require signature of new contracts. The few
remaining new contracts are for goods (small size and to be procured using shopping) and
for one or two individual consultants and will be contracted by end September, which is
realistic.

3.      We believe that the proposed extension is merited as an exceptional case under
OP 13.20 as the "pause" in relations with Honduras, which began at the end of June 2009
as a result of the unexpected change in political leadership. This situation was only
resolved seven-months later with the elections held at the end of January 2010. The
political change and resulting "pause" meant that the project suspended all activities. The
amount of time requested for the extension is equal to the amount of time lost due to the
suspension of activities under the "pause." This proposed extension will enable Honduras
to complete the following activities (a) completion of small works to reduce disaster
vulnerability at the local level; (b) institutionalization of local disaster risk management
capacity, and (c) completion of procurement of small goods and works packages for
enhancing emergency response capacities for local and national government agencies.

4.      The Credit supporting the Honduras Natural Disaster Mitigation Project was
approved on May 30, 2000, and became effective on February 2, 2001 . Following
restructuring in 2004 the Credit's original closing date, April 15, 2005 was extended by
two years, to April 2, 2007. An extension to September 30, 2007 was agreed at the
Concept stage for the Additional Financing to ensure continuity until the Additional
Financing was approved. The Additional Financing was approved on June 21, 2007 and
provided for a three-year extension to September 30,2010.
