Natural Disaster\n            Mitigation Project for Honduras were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; the Bank's performance was satisfactory; and\n            the Borrower's performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: crises provide opportunities to\n            promote change, even if the environment for coordination and\n            implementation is challenging. Investing in disaster risk\n            management pays off in the long term, especially if coupled\n            with flexibility and responsiveness to country needs and\n            conditions. Small scale Disaster Risk Management (DRM)\n            interventions across multiple localities can have a\n            substantial country-level impact provided these are\n            developed within a strategic framework and adequately\n            balanced with capacity building at the central level. DRM\n            capacity strengthening at local and community levels\n            contributes to ownership and sustainability of results.\n            Development of monitoring and evaluation systems and sound\n            economic analysis for DRM projects is critical not only to\n            measure results but also to draw well-grounded lessons."}, "docdt": "2011-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
