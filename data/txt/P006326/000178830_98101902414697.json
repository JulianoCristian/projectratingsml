families operating farms of up to 50 ha. This will entail:\n            (i) improving land tenure security and redistributing public\n            or purchased land to those currently having insufficient\n            land; (ii) improving the outreach, relevance, and\n            effectiveness of research and extension with a view to\n            further developing and disseminating with a view to further\n            developing and disseminating drought-resistant agricultural\n            production techniques; and (iii) expanding and upgrading\n            social services and physical infrastructure in the area.\n            Project activities will be focused on areas with\n            concentrations of small farmers and reasonable production\n            potential. About 26,000 small farmers out of the total\n            45,000 to be broadly affected by project activities are\n            expected to adopt the full range of technical\n            recommendations and will be the major source of the\n            project's incremental production."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
