The major factors affecting the project were: a) lack\n            of available experience on how to handle mine clearing\n            activities; b) the lack of competitive market conditions for\n            demining services; and c) conflicting approaches toward mine\n            clearing. Six key lessons were learned. The Bank can have a\n            comparative advantage in stand-alone demining projects. This\n            comparative advantage lies more in institution building and\n            developing a commercial demining capacity than on carrying\n            out mine-clearing training or mine awareness programs, for\n            which others have more experience. Projects should integrate\n            more coordination and adequate division of tasks among\n            institutions, especially the United Nations. It is crucial\n            to focus, in the immediate post-conflict period, on\n            information collection and mapping as a prerequisite to well\n            planned priority mine clearing. Commercial approaches to\n            demining have proved to be much more productive that any\n            other method used for this purpose. Clear technical\n            specifications and close monitoring and supervision\n            arrangements are key to a proper implementation of\n            mine-clearing supervision programs."}, "docdt": "1999-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
