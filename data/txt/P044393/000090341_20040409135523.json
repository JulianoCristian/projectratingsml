The relevance rating would have been\n            higher had it not been for ERP's fourth humanitarian\n            objective, which was only modestly relevant to BiH's\n            reconstruction. Emergency Landmines Clearance Project: the\n            project objectives were modestly relevant to BiH's\n            post-conflict recovery program. Both efficacy and efficiency\n            in achieving the objectives were negligible; project\n            objectives were not met, yet substantial costs were\n            incurred. Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration\n            Project: for a country in an emergency post-conflict\n            situation the project objectives were modestly relevant;\n            they emphasized longer-term goals too much, even though they\n            neglected demobilization itself. Efficacy in achieving the\n            relevant objectives was modest, through the effective\n            support the project gave to reintegrating demobilized\n            combatants, albeit on a small scale and fewer than targeted.\n            Local Initiatives Project: All three project objectives were\n            highly relevant to the post-conflict development needs and\n            policies pursued in BiH, already more than a year out of the\n            war when this project began. Efficacy in achieving these\n            objectives was high, being exceeded in the case of the\n            setting up the MC0 framework in particular. Republika Srpska\n            Reconstruction Assistance Project: For the most part, the\n            objectives of this project were substantially relevant to\n            Entity and Bank recovery policies."}, "docdt": "2004-03-19T00:00:00Z"}
