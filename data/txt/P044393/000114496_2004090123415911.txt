the term "local expenditures" means any expenditures that are not foreign

facilities, services, office space, and other resources of the agencies within the

Letter Agreement by the Association; (ii) on account of payments for any taxes levied 
by or in the territory of the Recipient; (iii) on account of expenditures in the

shall be canceled; and (b) if, in the Association’s opinion, an amount of the Grant 
allocated to any of the items in the table in paragraph 4.2 above will be insufficient

sign withdrawal applications shall be provided with the first application bearing his 
Page  4

supporting evidence must be sufficient in form and substance to satisfy the 
Association that the Recipient is entitled to withdraw such amount from the Grant 
Account and that such amount is to be used in the carrying out of the Activities.  The 
Association shall pay the amounts withdrawn by the Recipient from the Grant Account 
only to or on the order of the Recipient.

Recipient, shall purchase with the currency of the Grant withdrawn from the Grant 
Account such currencies as shall be required to pay for expenditures to be financed 
out of the proceeds of the Grant.  Whenever it shall be necessary, for the purposes of 
this Letter Agreement, to determine the value of one currency in terms of another, 
such value shall be as reasonably determined by the Association.
4.7.
To facilitate the carrying out of the Activities, the Recipient may open and 
maintain in United States dollar two special deposit accounts (the Special Accounts A 
and B) in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association,

Association’s representatives to examine such records; and (iv) ensure that such 
records and accounts are included in the annual audit referred to in subparagraph (b)
