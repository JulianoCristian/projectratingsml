The key lessons learned during\n            preparation include: 1) Where the Borrower is reluctant to\n            undertake policy reform in certain key areas, it is\n            appropriate for the Bank to seek some actions prior to\n            appraisal. 2) In accordance with current Bank practice, this\n            project should have been appraised only when fully prepared\n            in terms of technical studies, engineering design,\n            procurement procedures and implementation plan. 3) As agreed\n            delegations of authority to the implementing agency for\n            procurement were later unilaterally withdrawn by Government\n            of Tamil Nadu they should have been backed by covenants to\n            ensure they remained in place. The lessons drawn from\n            implementation include: a) The Bank should have provided\n            above-average levels of supervision support to a first-time\n            Borrower in the first few years of implementation. b) The 8\n            years of implementation from effectiveness to closing was\n            possibly responsible for the development of a somewhat\n            relaxed approach to preparation and implementation\n            activities, and a shorter period might have engendered a\n            greater sense of Borrower urgency. c) An implementation plan\n            should have been prepared with performance indicators and\n            regular reporting. d) The considerable institutional and\n            policy strengthening achievements in the areas of\n            conjunctive use of water, groundwater legislation, and cost\n            recovery reflected the attention given to these issues."}, "docdt": "1997-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
