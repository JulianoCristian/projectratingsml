(a)   the term  "foreign expenditures" means expenditures for goods or
services supplied from, the territory, and in the currency, of any country other


﻿13
than the Borrower; provided, however, that if the currency of the Borrower is

extent required to meet the estimated shortfall proceeds of the Loan which are
then allocated to another Category and which in the opinion of the Bank are
not neLded to meet other expenditures, and (ii) except in the case of Categories
(3) and (5), if such reallocation cannot fully meet the estimated shortfall, reduce
the disbursement percentage then applicable to such expenditures in order that
further withdrawals under such Category may continue until all expenditures
thereunder shall have been made.
6.    If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the procurement of any
item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to
in this Agreement, no expenditures for such item shall be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan and the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting
any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement, by

opinion, represents the amount of such expenditures which would otherwise have
