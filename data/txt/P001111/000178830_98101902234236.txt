REPORT AND REC01MMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOil THE ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US$9.0 million
to help finance a sewerage and drainage project in Abidjan.    The loan
would have a term of twenty-five years, including three years of grace, with
interest at 8 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report
No. 296 - IVC "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory Coast",
April 11, 1974 which is based on an economic mission in April of 1973, con-
firmed the country's favorable growth prospects and its creditworthiness0
It concluded also that the Government's development efforts required and
deserved continued external support.   While recent developments in export
and import prices led to substantial quantitative changes in the balance of
payments' estimates from those made in the report, our revised calculations
still support these conclusions.   Annex I contains basic country data0
3.        Throughout the 1960's the Ivory Coast's economic growth was rapid.
GDP grew at an annual rate of 7.5 percent in real terms and in 1972 per
capita income reached US$340. Although this growth rate could not be fully
sustained in the early 1970's because of deteriorating terms of trade and
adverse weather conditions, growth in 1971-73 still averaged 6.5 percent a
year, in real terms. Factors contributing to rapid growth were the Government's
liberal and pragmatic economic policies which have made the country attractive
to foreign investors, the availability of ample land and timber resources,
the existence of a large pool of labor including immigrants from sahelian
countries and, during the late sixties, rising commodity export prices. Recog-
nizing the country's vulnerability in its dependence on three export commodities
(cocoa, coffee and wood constitute 80 percent of total exports while exports
are some 32 percent of GDP), the Government began after 1965 to diversify
agriculture by introducing or expanding oil palm, coconut, pineapple, rice,
rubber, cotton and sugar cultivation--and by placing more emphasis on other
economic sectors such as industry, mining and tourism.    Although the full
benefits of these diversification efforts are still some years off, the
prospects are that the Ivory Coast will gradually become less dependent on
its traditional exports.



- 2 -
4.        The Government's development objectives include, in addition
to broadening the production base, the extension of economic infrastruc-
ture in such fields as transport and power, the improvement of urban
facilities, regional diversification, the development of secondary indus-
trial centers, the development of education and the Ivorianization of the
economy.   These objectives correspond well to the needs and the possibil-
ities of the country. Past and ongoing development has laid a solid found-
ation for further growth. Moreover, Government and private investment
activities indicate that the country's growth possibilities are being
recognized and exploited.
5.        The Governmentts awareness of social problems is reflected in
the current (1971-1975) Plan's emphasis on the income effects of develop-
ment, regional balance and education. Thus, to reduce inequalities,
recent salary raises have been graded down from 26 percent for the lowest
to 5 percent for the higher paid workers.   A number of projects, for
instance, cocoa, rice, oil palm, rubber, sugar and cottcn are designed to
narrow the gap between urban and rural incomes and to reduce regional
income disparities. In the same vein, over the past five years, the
Government has increased producer prices for cocoa by 120 percent, for
coffee by 60 percent and for cotton by 35 percent.
6,        However, the next Plan (1976-80) will need to focus more sharply
still on problems of urbanization, prospects of employment in both rural
and urban areas and income distribution, To assist the Government in these
directions a special Bank employment mission, which included ILO staff,
visited the Ivory Coast, The missionts report "Ivory Coast: Specinl
Report on Employment" (Report No. 279-IVC) was issued in July 1974, after
detailed discussions with the Government. The mission identified the
employnent problem as one of growing imbalances:   while projected demand
for labor appears to be matched by manpower supply (including immigration)
shortages in rural areas and a surplus in urban labor markets will develop
in the absence of corrective action.   The mission also singled out a number
of issues for further study, including the costs and benefits of creating
a better econormic and social infrastnécture in secondary centers combined
with a certair degree of industrialization and suggested changes in
educational and training systems,
7,        Our forecasts show theat after the recent changes in the co modity
price structure successful implementation of the Govermment's development
prograrm will more than in ti past depend on the availebility of foreign
funds.  Current Bank commodity price forecasts point to a gradual deteriora-
tion of the Ivor- Coast's terms of trade for the remainder of the 19701s,
Until recently, most Ivorian export products have been in strong demand,
'However, revised growth forecasts for 'W^lestern Europe, the Ivory- Coast's
main export market, suggest that the decline ir. economic activity may be
deeper and longer lasting then anticip2ted earlier0    In 1974, already,
timber exTcrts have dropped markedly 5s a direct consequence of a slump in
the European construction industry.  Yet, the import Dill will continue to
rise rapidly because of high inflation rates in supplier countries, especially



- 3 -
for food, fertilizers and oil.    The net oil import bill is expected to
go up fror. US$15 million in 1972 to US$70 million in 1974 and us$80 million
in 1975 or from 3 percent of 1972 commodity imports to 7 percent in 1975.
The Government has taken vigorous action to limit the impact of higher
imports on the country's balance of payments. For instance retail prices
of petroleum products, electricity, rice, sugar and other consumer products
have been increased sharply, while the producer price for rice has been
doubled to encourage local production. In early 1975, the country's first
sugar mill will start operating. Its production will replace 60,000 tons
of sugar imports and cover some 80 percent of present sugar consumption.
Plans for an extension are in an advanced stage of preparation. These and
similar efforts in other lines of production will penait a reduction in the
share of food imports from its present level of about 20 percent of total
commodity imports.
8.        Despite all this, the trade surplus is expected to dwindle and it
will no longer compensate for the deficit in non-factor services, as it did
in the past. Consequently, and in contrast to the 1965-1970 period when the
Ivory Coast enjoyed a resource surplus of US$ 35 million per year on average,
a resource gap of US$ 80-100 million per year in the second half of the 1970's
appearsinevitable. This is equivalent to about 2.5 percent of projected GDP
ot about 5.5 percent of projected exports and non-factorservices in 1975. As
in the past, with interest payments, transfers of profits and workers'remittan-
ces abroad, the factor services account will continue to be in deficit as well.
Therefore, to maintain balance of payments equiLibrium there will have to be
a substantial compensatory inflow of capital from abroad. Net reserves at
mid-1974 stood at about US$ 80 million, which is equivalent to 5 weeks of imports.
9.        Based on past experience and assuming an adequate inflow of
capital, Ivory Coast's economy may be expected to adjust to changing world
economic conditions0  Early in 1974, the Gove-nment established a task
force to advise on short term adjustments; the need for structural changes
is being given particular attention in the preparation of the new Five-
Year Plan.   Good growth prospects in several sectors should facilitate
the adoption of corrective measures. For example, Ivory Coast has substan-
tial potential to increase electricity generation from hydro-sources. Sites
in addition to the three now in operation were already being studied before
the "oil crisis" and the program for hydro-electric development will be
speeded up. According to the Governmentts program, an estimated 85 percent of
Ivorian demand for electricity would be met from hydro-electric plants by the
early eighties against 40 percent at present. The possibility of increased
domestic energy production at reasonable cost may accelerate the implementation
of the Government's policy to process raw materials locally rather than
exporting them in unprocessed formas is generally still the case.
10.       Structural changes will take time and the continuation of a size-
able investment effort. In recent years gross investment averaged about
21 percent of GDQ, and the proportion of the public sector in total



investments increased from an average of 50 percent in 1965-70 to 60 per-
cent in 1970-73. Public investments for 1975 are estimated at about
US$ 470 million. This amount would double in current prices between 1975
and 1980, assuming that the investment rate is maintained and that GDP
will grow by 6 percent per year in real. terms.
11,       Domestic public savings in the future are likely to cover a
smaller part of capital outlays than they did in the past, even assuaing
continued good fiscal performance.    1-lith budget revenues alread-- ?xceeding
20 percent of GDP, future Covernment resources cannot reasonably be
expected to increase much faster than the economy as a whole.    The Govern-
ment has been quite successful in generating budgetery savings but with
rapidly increasing social expenditures, for instence for housing and educa-
tion, these savings will be under heavy pressure. To some extent savings
from public enterprises will provide some relief to the budgetary constraint.
Also, higher world prices for agricultural exports will boost revenues of
the Stabilisation Fund. However, as indicated before, the Government's
producer price policy is to pass more of these benefits to farmers, and as
a result this source of public savings is unlikely to expand. Furthermore,
debt service charges will increase rapidly. As a consequence, public
savings after debt service, which in the past financed 40-50 percent of
public investments, will on everage represent no more than 25-30 percent
of public investments in the next five years.    Thus at lea.st 70 percent
of public investments will have to be financed from other sources,
12,       The chances that additional domestic private funds could be
raised to finance public investments remain low for two main reasons.
First, traditionally part of the profits made by foreign investors has
been transferred abroad and this will continue in the future. Second,
non-Ivorian labor--it is estimated that between 15 and 20 percent of the
Ivory Coast population is non-Ivorian--transferred about US$100 million to
their home countries as workers' remittances in 1973, Direct controls to
limit private trensfers are not permitted within the Franc zone of which
the Ivory Coast is the most important member in Africa; such controls
would probably be coumter-productive by deterring foreign privPte capital,
and they would represent a serious blow to the Ivory Coest's much poorer
neighbors, especially Upper Volta which receives 50 percent of irnigr2nt
workers' remittances.    But those transfers, of course, mean E substantial
drain of domestic savings for the Ivory Coa--st. To encourage keeping funds
in the country the Government has proposed to the Central Bank of the
.est Afr-can Monetary Union to raise the base interest rate from 5,5 to
7,5 percent.  However, othe2' members of the Union have opposed this move
as they fear an adverse effect on their investments. Steps by the Govern-
ment to raise interest rates, establish a local stock market and place
more emphasis on Ivorianization of the economy are not likely to alter these
flows substantially in the medium term. Government issued bonds with a
tax free return of 7-9 percent have had only limited success so far.



- 5 -
13.       Absorptive capacity in terms of projects to be financed in
the public sector is substential. The inflow of foreign capital into
the public sector in 1973 was US$235 million; in 1975 it may need to be
as high as US$ 330 million.  Assuming that 50-60 percent of future foreign
capital requirements will continue to be provided by international organiza-
tions and foreign governments and the rest by more expensive sources like
suppliers credit and private banks, the debt service ratio would rise from
its rather low level of 6.6 percent in 1973 to around 15 percent in the
early 1980s. We consider this level to be manageable. If the capital
required cannot be obtained on appropriate terms, the investment program
would have to be cut back and overall growth would drop below 6 percent.
The projected average contribution of net public savings to the financing
of public investments, will in many cases be less than the local cost
c omponent of projects.   Therefore foreign donors should be willing to
finance not only the foreign cost component of projects but also some local
costs in those projects where the foreign exchange component is low.
14.       . basic economic mission scheduled for 1975 will evaluate the
countryts long-term prospects in the context of the draft 1976-1980
development plan, and will undertake a thorough reexamination of our pro-
jections, the underlying assumptions and especially the consequences for
Ivory Coast's external borrowing and debt service. However, there is
little reason to believe that there will be much if any reduction in the
higher level of capital requirements now foreseen. The terms of borrowing
therefore become a more important consideration. If,for instance, the
supplementary needs of future capital were to be met on terms offered in
the Eurodollar market--to which the Ivory Coast has access--the debt
service could substantiflly surpass the level of 15 percent projected for
the 1980's.   To keep the debt service within manageable limits  and to
enable the Government to implement its development policy, it is desirable
that foreign capital be made available on as concessionary terms as possible,
including long repayment and grace periods. However, in view of the still
low debt service ratio, the good future growth potential of the economy and
the expected increase in export earnings, the Ivory Coast remains credit-
worthy for substantial additional borrowing from the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
15.       Since 1968, the Bank's lending to the Ivory Coast has expanded
rapidly and now includes fourteen loans totalling US$142 . million and
an IDA credit of US$7.5 million. Four of these fifteen operations were
for roads; six were to the member companies of the SODEPALk Group for the
development of oil palm and coconut plantations and the construction of two
oil mills; the remaining five loans were for education, a rubber planta-
tion, telecommunications and two cocoa plantation projects, the second of



- 6 -
which was approved by the Executive Directors on December 10, 1974. The
IFC also has a small (US$204,00o) participation in the Banque Ivoirienne
de De'veloppement Industriel.  Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank Group operations and notes on the execution of ongoing projects with
particular reference to those which are encountering problems in execu-
tion and giving rise to delays in disbursements.
16,       The agricultural sector remains the principal foreign exchange
earner and domestic employer. It continues to provide close to 90 percent
of exports, to employ a majority of the population, to help stabilize an
increasingly mobile population, and to bring development to remote areas
of the country. Our principal efforts are, therefore, in this sector. A
cotton project should be ready for presentation to the Board at about the same
time as the proposed project and an agricultural development project is under
preparation for FY76. We are participating with the Caisse Centrale de Coope-
ration Econonique (CCCE) in preparing a rice project in the forest zone of the
Ivory Coast. The Government has also requested our assistance in financing
additional oil palm, coconut and rubber development in the Ivory Coast's
South-West.
17.       In order to strengthen the country's major transport axis and link
the agricultural areas to its urban centers and ports, we have placed considerable
emphasis on transportation and have become the principal lender for road
construction and maintenance. The Bank was closely associated, as executing
agency, with the l968 UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory Coast. The Government
requested and the Bank agreed to use funds remaining under the Second Highway
Project as a result of the deletion of the engineering studies of the Katiola-
Ferkessedougou road, to finance an updating of the UNDM Transport Survey and
a general assessment of country-wide feeder road requirements. We expect that
investments in priority projects to be identified under this new survey and
included in the 1976-l960 National Development Plan now under preparation will
continue to be submitted to the Bank for financing in the next few years.
A Fifth Highway Project was appraised last summer and includes a second phase
of the pavement strengthening program (about 200 km), construction of the
Anyama-Agboville road and a section of the Abidjan-Adzqpe road. The Govern-
ment is aiso interested in obtaining our assistance in financing the re-
alignment of a section of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line. Other sections
of the rail line are being financed by EDF and EIB.
1 8.      Urban infrastructure and education are two important social sectors
in which the Bank is involved. This sewerage and drainage project is the
first phase of a ten-year Government program to improve the sanitation
sector of Abidjan. A study of the development of a new quarter of Abidjan
is being financed with Bank funds.    With regard to education the Bank is
closely associated with the Governmentts efforts to modernize its educational
system principally at the secondary and vocational levels. With the assist-
ance of UNESCO, we have appraised a small second project for presentation
to the Executive Directors this fiscal year, which will lay the ground for a
larger third education project.



- 7 -
190       Three small projects in tourism and industrial development
were appraised last fall including a small enterprise project which will
carry forward the special effort inaugurated in Wdestern Africa through
a 1971   Bank study of African private enterprise. Substantial invest-
ments are also foreseen, in later years, for industry and power, areas
in which we have not previously been involved, but in which the Govern-
ment foresees the need for the Bank Group's participation.
20.       Of the total external public debt outstanding at the end of
1973, 30 percent was provided by Governments, 20 percent by international
organizations (of which 60 percent by the Bank Group), 20 percent came
from private banks and through bond issues while 30 percent came in the
form of suppliers' credits.   The capital not supplied by international
organizations came mainly from four countries, France (35 percent),
USA (27 percent), Italy (15 percent) and Germany (8 percent). France and
the European Economic Community remain the principal source of develop-
ment assistance in grant form.   Altogether, grants accounted for 15 per-
cent of the total flow of foreign assistance to the public sector,
21,       Bank Group lending to the Ivory Coast, which has averaged about
US$20 million per yearin theseven years since we began operations in the
Ivory Coast, is expected to increase substantially over the next several
years. The Bank Group's share of the Ivory Coast's external debt is now
approximately 11 percent (including undisbursed) and may increase in the
next 5 year period to about 18 percent.   The Bank Group's share of debt
service is at present 3.4 percent and is expected to go up to about
7 percent by 1980,
PART III - THE SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE SECTOR
Background
22,       The Ivory Coast has a land area of about 324,000 kcm2 and a
population of about 5,6 million. Over the past decade the annual popula-
tion growth has been 3.3 percent for the country as a whole and 11.5 per-
cent for Abidjan. Twenty-five percent of the population of the Ivory
Coast is urban, of which more than half (800,000) live in or around
Abidjan. the capital and principal city. The characteristics of the
Abidjan climate, which are of primary importance to the design and opera-
tion of its sewerage and drainage systems, are sustained heat and high
rainfall, The average annual rainfall is 2,100 mm. No month is without
rain and there are two seasons of particularly intense rains, May-July
and October-November, At these times rainfall intensity can reach as
high as 115 mm/h during 15 minutes. Under these conditions flooding and
erosion are serious problems with which urban drainage must cope. Evapora-
tion is relatively low with a mean of 680 mm per year.



- 8 -
Existing Sewerage and Storm Wdater Drainage Facilities
23.       Abidjants sewerage and storm water drainage systems have been
constructed over the years in a piecemeal manner, and are totally inadequate.
Only about 20 percent of the population is served by the sewerage system;
15 percent has sewerage disposal by septic tank; and the remaining 65 per-
cent dispose their waste water in open unlined channels. As regards
drainage, only the Plateau and Treichville areas have drainage systems,
In some areas, e.g. Treichville, the original storm drainage systems
have been converted to combined sewerage/stone drainage systems.   About
one half of the Abidjan area is lowlying and several densely populated
areas have serious flooding problems in the absence of adequate drainage.
There are no public sewerage treatment stations and consequently waste
water is discharged untreated into the lagoons around which the city is
located.
240       In addition to being inadequate in scope, most facilities
except those recently constructed are in poor condition because of
faulty design, poor maintenance, misuse of facilities, and lack of coordina-
tion between concerned agencies. This situation now poses a serious health
hazard in the Abidjan area and lately there has been a noticeable increase
in the incidence of typhoid and cholera. There is a danger of a general
contamination of ground water resources from infiltration, and the use of
the lagoons as an open sewer has resulted in extensive areas of these in
Central Abidjan becoming heavily polluted with industrial and human waste.
Pollution in parts of the lagoons has already passed their self-purification
capacity.
Institutions
25.       The present unsatisfactory situation has been caused by the
fragmentation of responsibility for the sector, lack of coordination and
planning, and generally inadequate financing. In order to improve the
situation, the Government has centralized, as of October 1974, technical
and financial responsibility for sewerage and drainage services in Abidjan
in Societ6 dtEquipement des Terrains Urbains, (SETU), a public company
initially created in 1971 to provide essential infrastructure for Government
land development schemes.
26.       Under new arrangements SETU has established a separate department to
deal exclusively with all public sewerage and drainage development and operation.
These arrangements which are similar to those existing in other francophone
countries are satisfactory.  They provide for SE7J to manage the assets which are
owned  by the municipalities.  For the first few years at least SETTU will sub-
contract the planning and design of facilities to consultants, construction to
contractors, and operation and day-to-day maintenance of the sysvems to the
water supply company, Societe de Distribution d'Eau .e la CGte dfIEvoire (SODECI).
However, SETU will be fully accountable for the sector, control the preparation
of sector regulations, propose new tariffs, approve all construction permits
for connections to the system as well as for the construction of sewers and
drains by third parties, and generally supervise operations and development.
As is usually the case with a public agency taking on new functions, continued
assistance by Bank supervision missions will be reauired to reduce the risk of
management difficulties.



- 9-
Long-term objectives and planning
27.       Following a UNDP/WHO general study of the sector in 1970/72,
the Government with UNDP financial assistance, commissioned the preparation
of a master plan covering the sewerage and drainage facilities required
for Abidjan over the decade 1975-1985. The objectives of the master plan
are to: (i) provide 75 percent of the population with adequate sewerage
facilities by 1985 and (ii) reduce flood risks and the pollution of lagoons
to acceptable levels. Execution of the master plan is foreseen in three
phases: FYs 75-77, FYs 78-81 and FYs 82-85. The first phase is the project
proposed for Bank financing and is essentially an emergency operation to
provide a number of urgently needed facilities. The second and third phases
would be much larger and would aover more extensive works, including poss-
ibly the construction of a sea outfall0 It is expected that the Government
will ask the Bank to help finance the second phase project.
28.       Although sectoral objectives have been established through 1985,
and the content of the first phase project has been defined in detail, the
precise scope of the two subsequent phases has still to be determined. It
is important to note, however, that the first phase project stands on its
own and does not require implementation of the second and third phases of
the master plan in order that its benefits may be realized. Consequently
there is no danger of investment in the first phase.project being wasted
in part or in whole in the event of either of the subsequent phases not
being implemented or being delayed. During implementation of the first
phase project, the Government will:
(i)     define and design the second phase project and establish
a time-frame for its execution;
(ii)    prepare a long-term tariff policy and financial plan
for the sector for the period post FY 77; and
(iii)   evaluate the effectiveness of the recently established
institutional arrangements for sewerage and drainage
development.
29.       In view of the high cost of the investments to be made under the
two subsequent phases of the master plan, it is essential that they be
planned within the context of a comprehensive program for infrastructure
development in Greater Abidjan. Assurances were obtained (Section 3.03 of
Loan Agreement) that the Government would prepare such a program, including
a financing olan. for the period l978-l985.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The proposed project would be the first phase of a ten-year
program for improving and extending the sewerage and storm water drainage
system to serve the Greater Abidjan area. The project was appraised by
a Bank mission in May 1974 and negotiations were held in IWashington from
December 12-23, 1974 with an Ivorian delegation led by Mr. L. Naka,
Director (Caisse Autonome dtAmortissement), and included Messrs. P. Brun
(Budget Special d'Investissement et d'Equipement), T. Siransy (Director
General of Public Works), W. Kouadio (Ministry of Public Works), S. Coulibaly
(Director General, SETU), G. Bernard (SE-TU) and  Sako (Ivory Coast
Embassy in Washington). A 'oan and nroi't summary is included as Annex TIL,
The Appraisal Report, No. 580a-IVC, dated December 20, 197L, is being
distributed separately.
Description
31.       The proposed project has two components: the improvement and
extension of the sewerage and storm water drainage system in the metro-
politan Abidjan area and water supply studies. The sewerage and drain-
age component of the proposed project comprises (a) the laying of 19.1 kms
of sewers with construction of associated works in central Abidjan and
new urban and industrial development areas; (b) the laying of 3.6 kms of
drains in the Treichville area; (c) a pilot scheme for the construction of
sanitary blocks in low income areas; (cd) the construction of an office
building for SETU; (e) supply of vehicles, service and office equipment;
and (f) provision of staff training, consulting services for detailed
engineering, assistance in project supervision and preparation of the next
phase of the ten-year development program, and additional management staff.
The water supply study component provides for consultants' services for the
preparation of studies for a national water supply investment program; it
is expected that these studies will lead, in about two years, to a Bank-
financed project primarily oriented   to provincial and rural potable
water supplies.
Execution
32.       The sewerage and drainage component of the project will be executed
by the Societe d'Equipement des Terrains Urbains (SETU), the Government-
owned company responsible for the sewerage and drainage system of the
Greater Abidjan area. Final design of the project, feasibility studies
needed for determining the next phase of development and other studies
will be executed by consultants, including the Ivorian Government agency
Bureau Nationald'Etudes Techniques et de Developpement (BNETD). BNhTD
will be concerned particularly with on-the-job training of Ivorian staff
in project analysis and preparation. SETU itself will be responsible for
construction supervision. In order to ensure adequate management and
staff training, SETU has recruited an experienced expatriate engineer
to be responsible for design, tenders and bid evaluation and will recruit
one more expatriate for supervision of construction and operations. The
water supply studies will be carried out by consultants hired by the
Ministry of Plan.



Project costs
33.       The cost of the sewerage and drainage component of the project,
including US$ 2.2 million for local taxes is estimated at US$ 15.0 million
(SETU is excempt from import duties on items related to the project); the
estimated cost of the water supply studies is US$ 1.7 million. Estimated
foreign costs of the whole project ace US$ 9.0 million and represent 54 per-
cent of the total project costs of US$ 16.7 million. Cost estimates are
based on current prices for similar works in Abidjan, with contingencies
added to cover price escalation and unforeseen design and engineering modifications.
Project financing
34.       The proposed Bank loan of US$9.0 million would cover the foreign
exchange costs of the project and would be for twenty-five years, including
a three-year grace period and would be made to the Government. The SETU
sewerage and drainage project would be financed from US$7.8 million provided
by the loan and US$7.2 million from SETU's own resources. The water supply
studies would be financed from US$1.2 million of the loan and US$0.5 million
from Government funds.
Procurement
35.       Contracts for the supply of equipment and for civil works would
be awarded following international coppetitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. In the comparison of bids, local
manufacturers would be accorded a 15 percent preference or the prevailing
rate of customs duty whichever is lower. Local civil works contractors
and manufacturers are experienced and would be expected to compete
successfully for the award of the relatively small contracts that would
be let under the project.
36.       SETU, in agreement with the Bank, is negotiating for the construction
of five project sewers (total cost US$1.1 million) in the Banco area
under extensions to five existing contracts for similar works which were
awarded previously by SETU on the basis of local competitive bidding. These
sewers need to be operative by mid-1975 when development of the areas which
they serve will be completed. This is impossible to achieve if contracts
for the five sewers have to be let through new competitive bidding0
Horeover, assuming a delay were acceptable, it is almost certain that if
the new sewer works were submitted to competitive tender, contractors now
on the site, benefitting from low mobilization costs, would submit the
lowest bid. Therefore, it is recommended that the Bank accept this pro-
curement procedure.

Disbursement and Retroactive Financing
37.        The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of
all direct imports, against 60 percent of civil works and supply of pipes,
and against 70 percent of other local supplies and consultants costs. Some
contracts, mainly consultants' services, office constructions and equipment
and sewerage and drainage construction for the Banco area would be awarded
before the loan is approved. Retroactive financing for these contracts is
recommended in the amount of about US$250,000D.
Finances
38.        In the past, financial planning for the sector has been unsatis-
factory and funds inadequate. The institutional changes recently made are
expected to lead to an improvement in financial planning, management and control.
New charging policies were introduced. Sewerage surcharges on water consumption
( which have been increased) will be used to finance only sewerage services.
A new drainage levy which will be established as a component of property taxes
will be used to finance the drainage services. These sewerage and drainage
charges should provide the sector with adequate funds for operations and
development during the construction period of the project. The tariff system
favors low income sections of the population and can be considered equitable.
Assurances were obtained (Section 4.04 of Project Agreement) that, to ensure
the financial viability of the Abidjan sewerage and drainage sector, SETU
would not undertake capital expenditures for any major expansion which materially
and adversely affects SETU's carrying out of the Project and that the covernment
will regularly review and impose such water surcharges and drainage levies as
are necessary to provide funds from internal resources equivalent to no less
than 50 percent of the annual cost of sewerage and drainage construction in
the years in which the project would be implemented, FY 75 thirough FY 77.
Justification
39.        The proposed project is a logical first step towards achieving
the objectives of the master plan, and its content is common to all alternative
solutions for the future development of the sector. It represents the least-
cost solution for the facilities most urgently needed to (a) prevent a further
deterioration of public health and environment, (b) improve conditions in the
most affected areas of the Lagoon and (c) improve sanitary conditions in Barco
and Treichville, two of Abidjants low income neighborhoods.
