production; livestock, mainly egg production; and tractors\n            and implements.

The Credit\n            also includes provision for financing the agricultural\n            credit study and provides funds for the additional\n            equipment, technical assistance and training needed by the\n            AFC and Ministry of Agriculture to carry out the project."}, "docdt": "1972-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
