Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project's development objectives are to: (a) improve the efficiency of operation and maintenance of the pumping
stations and thereby save public expenditures on O&M; (b) improve the efficiency and reliability of delivery of irrigation
water and evacuation of drainage water to prevent the losses in crop yields resulting from aging stations; and (c)
strengthen further the planning and O&M capability of the MED to enhance the sustainability of the irrigation and
drainage system. The proposed project would be the third phase of the Government of Egypt's (GOE) long-term
rehabilitation program of the major pumping stations located on main canals and drains of the Nile water management
system. The Government, with Bank assistance, has formulated a long-term program for rehabilitation of the irrigation
and drainage pumping stations to reduce the adverse effects on crops of inefficient pumping operations in the irrigation
and drainage system which is served by about 1,066 stations and to reduce the operation and maintenance costs of the
pumping stations.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for Detailed Project Description and Annex 6 for Detailed Procurement
Packages for implementation of project components):

3. Benefits and target population:
(a) Benefits:
The project's main benefits would be derived from:
* Avoiding losses in crop yields and farm incomes due to enhanced reliability of these stations in delivering the needed
volume of irrigation water particularly during critical peak periods and timely evacuation of saline drainage water.
With the project, it is estimated that benefits in terms of preventing yield and production losses at full development
would be valued at about US$69 million annually;
The project's other benefits include:
* reduced energy consumption resulting from improved overall efficiency of pumping stations which would generate
fiscal savings to MED of about US$2.1 million alnually.
* savings in annual maintenance costs following rehabilitation are estimated at US$1.2 million annually for ithe first five
years of operation, and they are reduced to US$0.6 million for the subsequent five years of operation.
(b) Target Population:
* Based on land ownership and sharecropping patterns, the project would benefit mostly smallholders withi an average
size holding of 2 feddans. About 700,000 rural households would benefit from the project.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Six years (1999-2004)
Executing agencies:
*  The project would be implemented by the Mechanical and Electrical Department (MED) of the Ministry of Public
Works and Water Resources (MPWWR), which has had considerable experience in successfully implementing the
World Bank-financed projects Irrigation Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project I (Ln. 2270-EGT) and Pumping
Stations Rehabilitation Project II (Ln. 3198-EGT).
*  MED would be assisted by its established Special Task Team used for implementation of the World Bank financed
Pumping Station I and II projects. The Special T'ask Team has been enhanced with full-time staff to accommodate the
high intensity and volume of work in the rehabilitation program, and this consists of a full-time Project Coordination
Team made up of an experienced engineer and two financial staff (of qualified accountants).
*  To accelerate civil works for pumping stations, MED has engaged local consultants for carrying out designs and
preparation of bidding documents for the civil works and to provide general support under the current Pumping Station
II Project. The project would provide for consultants to assist MED in implementation of its program for rehabilitation
of pumping stations.
*  MED is in the process of restructuring its organi2ational framework to allow for a more flexible and efficient system to
deal with the complex requirements of operating and maintaining over 1,000 pumping stations. Annex 5 gives details
of MED's institutional arrangements and the proposed restructuring.
Project oversight: The responsibility for overall monitoring of project implementation within MED would rest on the
Undersecretary of State at the Central Directorate for Projects. In addition to chairing the Special Task Team, the
Undersecretary would facilitate project implementation and provide policy guidance.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The MED Directorate of Finance and Administration
would be responsible for keeping project accounts on the basis of standards and practices acceptable to the Bank and
having them audited each fiscal year in accordance with Bank guidelines by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
MED would ensure that all audited project accounts are prepared in English and furnished to the Bank within six months of
the end of each financial year, in such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request.
Special Account: The project's special account would be managed by MED and be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank.

Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) would be the responsibility of
MED, which will monitor progress against agreed-upon performance monitoring indicators (Annex 1). Monitoring and
Evaluation would be guided by the Project Implementation Plan (PIP); performance indicators, and the project design
summary (Annex 1). MED would undertake periodic data collection and analyses with the assistance of the MIS. The
MIS unit would consolidate the M&E reports and include them in the semi-annual (January and July each year) progress
reports. The format for the reports would be finalized during the Project Launch Workshop. They would cover the status
of project implementation, any problems which may have arisen and the corrective actions being taken. They would also
provide an updated procurement program, disbursement and commitment tables. In addition to annual progress reports,
M&E would be conducted through: (a) Bank supervision missions and (b) a project mid-term review. MED would prepare
a detailed mid-term report to serve as the basis for a mid-termn review planned for June 2002, and submit to the Bank a final
project evaluation report by August 31, 2004. The project will provide technical assistance for strengthening M&E and the

through diversified agricultural production based on efficient use of
land and water resources. The strategy is to invest in agriculture and
water infrastructure as a principal vehicle for encouraging rural
development and tackling rural poverty. Second, the project supports
the CAS objective of developing human resources through provision
of training and technical assistance to enable the transfer of lasting
skills for the management of pumping stations and for overall
institutional development.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Since the project is the third phase of a long-established program, project alternatives have not been considered.
However, in the selection of individual pumping stations for inclusion in the proposed project, alternatives have been
considered in terms of whether to do new construction, complete rehabilitation or to provide spare parts. The economic
viability of the pumping stations were also assessed amd optimal solutions adopted in each case.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
* Given the relatively slow pace of bid processing, manufacturing of custom built pumping plants and delivery of
equipment together with awarding civil works contracts and implementation experienced in previous projects, an
implementation period of six years have been used.
* In view of lessons learned about the need for flexibility in this type of project, the project has been designed by
financing a time slice of an ongoing program, which has both a firm and an flexible component.
* Given lessons learned from handing over O&M responsibilities to the beneficiaries on smaller pumping stations, which
has given mixed results, the project is supporting the strengthening of field offices (Directorates, Maintenance Centers,
etc.) of the MED, which would assist gradually in moving the Department towards decentralization of some of its
activities. The study envisaged in Section 7(b) above would reassess the situation of the possible scope of this
decentralization.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
* Government's recognition that the continuous efficient operation and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage
pumping stations is vital for the continued operation of the Nile irrigation system. To this end, the project is included as
one of the Government's priority projects in its Five-Year Development Plan (1998-2003).
* MED has demonstrated continuous and active participation in project identification and preparation.
* MED has already initiated preparation of tender documents for the priority pumping stations to be rehabilitated during
the initial first year of implementation.
* MED has agreed to establish an Environmental Unit, an M&E unit and a full time Project Coordination Team.

12. Value-added of Bank support:
The current Bank assistance strategy in Egypt accords high priority to financing projects which focus on poverty
alleviation and on environmental and sustainability issues. The pumping stations play a critically important role in the
operation of a vast irrigation and drainage network in Egypt (estimated at 31,000 km. of canals and 16,700 km of open
drains) on which the agricultural production of the country (and therefore many of the country's rural poor) heavily depend.
First, the Government has requested for Bank support to help maintain rationality and continuity to the financing of its long-
term rehabilitation program. Bank support for the first stage of the program (Pumping Station Rehabilitation I Project, Ln.
2270-EGT, Loan Amount US$41.5 million) has been successfully implemented while the second stage of the program
(Pumping Stations Rehabilitation II Project, Ln. 31 93-EGT, Loan Amount US$3 1.0 million) is currently being implemented
also very successfully with project objectives expected to be fully achieved by loan closure scheduled for May 15,1998.
Second, Bank involvement adds credibility to the program and acts as a catalyst for the mobilization of Donor involvement
in providing support. Moreover, the Bank's continued support will contribute to ensuring efficient and optimal utilization
of the irrigation and drainage pumping stations, which are vital to the continuation of irrigated agriculture in Egypt.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments: (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 9)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4):    l Cost-Benefit Analysis:   [  Cost            [  Other
NPV=US136.26 Million          Effectiveness      ISpecify]
ERR= 30%                      Analysis:
The project has been conservatively justified only on the basis of its agricultural benefits. Benefits in the form of
reduced expenditures on operations and maintenance because of improved pumping station efficiency have been ignored
because the agricultural benefits from the project are adequate to justify the project investments. Moreover, these benefits
are comparatively smaller than the agricultural benefits. Calculations of the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) show it to be in
the order of 30% This was based on the assumption that project benefits stem from preventing yield losses due to more
dependable irrigation water supply and providing adequate drainage to prevent water logging and soil salinization. Based on
engineering assessments, it is assumed that a typical irrigation pumping station loses efficiency by a factor of 0.006 a year.
The average age of irrigation pumping stations under the project is derived and multiplied by this efficiency factor to get the
average decline in efficiency per irrigation pumping station. This conservative empirical assumption for reduction in
efficiency has been further verified by actual flow measurements at about 30 stations with ages varying between twenty to
thirty years where reductions of 20-30% in efficiency has been measured. This average decline in efficiency factor is used to
check the corresponding reduction in yield by crop from the FAO publication, Yield Response to Water (FAO, No. 33,
Rome, 1979). The reduced yield defines the "without project" situation. For drainage, it has been conservatively assumed
that inadequate drainage would reduce crop yields by an average factor of 25%, about a third of which (8%) can be attributed
to drainage pumping stations (This is based on field itrials in Egypt; see publication by the Drainage Research Institute, Land
Drainag in Egpt, Cairo, 1989). Based on these foregoing assumptions, the incremental benefits per annum in terms of
preventing crop losses (agricultural benefits) as a result of complete rehabilitation or new construction (for replacement of or
extension to an existing system) of a pumping station in the three regions of the Delta, Middle Egypt, and Upper Egypt are,
on the average, about US$85 per feddan for irrigation and about US$35 per feddan for drainage. The per feddan benefits of
spare parts provision to the pumping stations (virtually most of the spare parts are for drainage stations) is estimated at
US$10 annually. With a total command area benefiting from the project of about 1.55 million feddans, it is envisaged that,
at full development, the total incremental agricultural benefits annually from the project would be about US$69 million.
Fiscal impact: The Government will provide aboult LE 352.1 million (US$103.86 million equivalent) in counterpart funds
during the entire project, which is on an average annual basis about 0.15% of the 1996 total annual Government investment
budget expenditures and should not pose any fiscal constraint. This counterpart funds provision excludes provisions for
duties and taxes. The counterpart funds provision would finance all of the local costs of the project composed mainly of civil
works, auxiliary equipment, and other equipment procured locally. After the completion of the project investment activities,
the project would generate budgetary savings for MED in the order of US$1.2 million in the first five years after
rehabilitation and US$0.6 million in subsequent five years in terms of reduced operations and maintenance expenditures, and
this would reduce the required budgetary transfers from the Government for O&M.

14. Financial Assessment: Project investments involve bulky public expenditures for rehabilitation of pumping stations
located on major canals and drains and for institution building, both of which have important benefits to individual farmers.
Calculation of individual benefits in terms of preventing crop losses has been carried out on a per feddan basis, comparing
"with" and "without" project crop budgets. With the average size of farm holding per farm family at 2 feddans, the
incremental financial benefits per farm unit from pumping station rehabilitation/new construction are about US$170 annually
for irrigation and about US$70 annually for drainage.
15. Technical Assessment: The project is technically sound. It addresses the fundamental issue of a third slice of the
program for rehabilitation of pumping stations that is essential to increased agricultural productivity and improved rural
incomes in Egypt. The scope and selection of electro-mechanical equipment use the latest innovations in the industry, are
based on high quality specifications of equipment for procurement, and are based on well established pumping station
practices and knowledge gained by the MED over many decades of experience. The anticipated increase in agriculture
productivity resulting from the improved efficiency of pumps and timely availability of irrigation water and the evacuation of
drainage water is reasonable and in line with the present yields achieved by farmers where pumping stations were
rehabilitated, and as witnessed by the alternative reduction of pumped water measured in the case of non-rehabilitated
pumping stations. The proposed institutional arrangements are similar to those used under Pumping Stations I and II projects
(as per section 16 below).
16. Institutional Assessment:
*  The MED, which has been the implementing agency for the World Bank-financed projects I and II with the assistance of
its special Task Team enhanced by the newly-established Project Coordination Team, would be responsible for
implementation of the proposed project. In accordance with its current mandate, the MED would be responsible for
carrying out design, procurement, installation, and operation and maintenance of the pumping stations. The project will
provide logistic support for MED headquarters and field directorates to ensure continued improvements to the O&M of
the system. An Environmental Monitoring Unit and an M&E unit will be established within MED by December 31,
1998. MIS activities will be further expanded in the field and this will become the main tool in monitoring the impact of
project activities. Pilot connection of selected pumping stations with MED Headquarters using telephone and wireless
relay systems will be implemented under the project.
*  Specialized in country and overseas training will be provided to MED management and staff.
*  Technical assistance will focus on improving designs and standards, strengthening the MIS system, M&E activities, and
carrying out studies to consider possible handing over of operation and maintenance of smaller pumping stations to
beneficiaries, possible decentralization of some of MED's activities, provision of options on cost sharing, and support for
the environmental management aspects of the project.
(a) Executing Agencies: The Mechanical and Electrical Department (MED) of the Ministry of Public Works and Water
Resources (MPWWR) is responsible for the design, procurement, installation, operation and maintenance of all irrigation and
drainage pumping facilities. The Department is headed by a First Undersecretary of State and, at its headquarters in Cairo,
has two Central Directorates: Projects, and Administration and Finance. In addition, ten Central Directorates and five
Directorates directly report to the First Undersecretary of State and Head of MED. MED is in the process of further
restructuring which will enable decentralization of its functions; thus enabling a more flexible and efficient operation and
maintenance of the pumping stations. This will also free senior management from routine activities to concentrate on
planning and major strategic issues in the sector (Details of this process of further restructuring are in Annex 5).
(b) Project Management: In order to coordinate the preparation and implementation of projects financed by external
sources, an MED Task Team has been established from the Technical Bureau, The General Directorate for Studies and Civil
Works Designs, the General Directorate for Management Information System (MIS) and the Directorate of Technical
Inspection. The main members of this team have been involved in the preparation and implementation of the World Bank-
financed First and Second Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Projects and thus bring with them the vast experience
accumulated over a period of about fifteen years of this type of project work.

17. Social Assessment:
Poverty is closely linked to agriculture in Egypt. The rural population accounts for about 55% of the total population,
most of whom are involved either directly or indirectly in agriculture. The agricultural system served by this project is
dominated by small scale farmers living in rural communities where incomes are relatively low and poverty is widespread.
The project area comprises some 700,000 farm families, whose average size of farm holding per family is about 2 feddans.
Bank assistance strategy to Egypt accords high priority to environmental and sustainability issues, and poverty alleviation.
The project will ensure that the irrigation and drainage pumping stations serving around 1.55 million feddans will continue to
deliver irrigation water and evacuate drainage water on which agriculture and the livelihood of the rural communities heavily
depend. Rehabilitation of the pumping stations under the project would help to avoid the decline in incomes for the many
farm families in the project area and furthermore reduce the incentives of the rural population to migrate to already over-
populated urban centers.
18. Environmental Assessment:    Environmental Category: H  A       I x I  B   HI C
The project is anticipated to have a positive environmental impact and contribute to improved land and water management
in Egypt. The rehabilitation of the drainage pumping stations would help maintain the water table at low levels which would
prevent waterlogging and soil salinization. The proposed project has been placed in environmental screening category "B"
consistent with the requirements of OD 4.01. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared for the project
by MED, and reviewed at appraisal, to facilitate continued integration of environmental concerns into the operation of
pumping stations in Egypt. The EMP would supporl: (a) establishment of an Environmental Unit in MED and provision of
equipment for it; (b) environmental training for MEED staff at a variety of levels; (c) use of site specific environimental review
procedures for pumping station rehabilitation activitiles; (d) support for continued activities in water quality monitoring; and
(e) measures to apply water quality guidelines at mixing stations for the reuse of drainage effluent. Given the focus of the
proposed project on rehabilitation, the proposed project would not involve any resettlement or result in damage to
archaeological and/or historical sites. The EMP would be included as a fully-funded component of the proposed project and
would be implemented by MED with the support of the Drainage Research Institute (DRI) and the recently established
Environmental and Climatic Research Institute (ECRI).

Other (specify)) _
MED's management and key staff have been closely involved in the identification, preparation and design of the
proposed project and in field visits to individual pumping stations and dialogue with staff on site. Project preparation has not,
however, directly involved the farming population since the project is to rehabilitate existing large pumping stations far from
the final beneficiaries but serving main canals and dlrains of the larger irrigation and drainage system. However, in the case
studies of sample stations recently carried out under KfW  financing, beneficiaries consulted have been supportive of
improvements on the pumping stations.
20. Sustainability:
Project sustainability is closely linked to the efficiency of operation and maintenance of the pumping stations. While
much has been achieved under the first two projects,, further work remains to ensure continuation and expansion of the O&M
capabilities of MED. This project would support the provision of equipment and training for MED's workshops and staff and

the linking up and integration of the MIS system, as well as the continued progressive support for the Directorates of
Technical Inspection, Designs and Specifications, the Technical Bureau, the Civil Engineering Directorate, and the Field and
Workshop Directorates to strengthen the design of pumping stations and their regular operation and maintenance. Financial
sustainability would continue to be assured, to some extent, by at least the present system of land taxes, the proceeds of which
are used to cover part of the irrigation and drainage O&M costs of the pumping stations.

A. Project Description
1.    Project Components: The project wouldfinance four components:
(a)   Rehabilitation of 77 pumping stations, 68 of which are proposed for the World Bank
financing and 9 are proposed for financing by KfW under parallel financing
arrangements. An establishment of five emergency centers equipped with mobile
diesel pumps and mobile electric units and generators is also part of this component.
(b)    Strengthening central workshop and electrical laboratories. This will provide for
provision of O&M equipment to Central Mechanical workshops and electrical
laboratories.
(c)   Institutional support to MED for supply of vehicles, specialized diagnostic and
inspection equipment, strengthening of electrical and mechanical workshops and
laboratories for preventive maintenance, miscellaneous equipment for maintenance
purposes and new constrLction as well as rehabilitation of existing facilities of staff
housing, workshops, stores and field offices. Two new units will be established within
MED, one to coordinate the environmental activities both within MED and with other
agencies and the second for the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities. This
component also involves strengthening of the Management Information System (MIS)
particularly focusing on expanding MIS activities in the field offices, stores and
workshops/laboratories, and the introduction of a telemetry system on a pilot scale.
The proposed equipment under this component is expected to be financed by the
World Bank; and
(d)   Capacity Building for MED (T.A. and Training) for providing consulting services for
M&E activities, specialized studies, public awareness of the role of the pumping
stations and strengthening of the MIS and environmental activities; and staff training
overseas and local in the fields of pumping stations inspection and diagnoses, stores
administration, monitoring of pumping stations operation and maintenance, MIS and
Telemetry linkage to the main system of the Ministry of Public Works andi Water
Resources (MPWWR). The major part of this component is expected to be financed
by KfW mainly through a proposed grant and partly through the KfW loan in addition
to a small portion financed through the World Bank loan, which are the items not
covered by KfW financing.

4.       These 77 pumping stations can also be classified into firm  and flexible programs. The firm
program is composed of 29 pumping stations, 8 for drainage and 21 for irrigation which is
programmed for contract award during the first year of implementation. The remaining pumping
stations are classified as flexible program, which would be firmed up as the program proceeds towards
implementation. Although pumping stations have been identified at this stage, both their priority and
scope of implementation may change. Such a flexibility will enable MED to introduce other pumping
stations in its program as long as the program is agreed in advance both with the World Bank and KfW
and the estimated cost does not exceed the provisions made at appraisal. The following will be the
distribution of pumping stations in the firn and flexible program.

5.     The MED agreed to submit justification of exchange of pumping stations in the flexible
program to both the World Bank and KfW with all technical, physical and economic details for
concurrence before proceeding with design of such pumping stations. Moreover, it was also agreed
that both the World Bank and KfW would be given the opportunity to comment on the rolling program
for inclusion of stations in the flexible program at least six months before advertising tender for such
works.
Strengthening Central Workshops and Laboratories
6.     Existing electrical and mechanical workshop will be strengthened through provisions of
appropriate needed equipment including mobile electrical laboratory equipment and mobile
mechanical workshops. Provision of such equipment would facilitate the effective operation of these
workshops and laboratories. Locally manufactured equipment and vehicles will be procured locally
through Government financing. Loan funds will be used for specialized workshop and laboratories
equipment and heavy duty equipment which is not available locally. All of the requirements are listed
in Table 5.
Iltitwnal &"d toMED
7.      The project would provide support to the MED headquarters (Table 4) through provision of
utility vehicles, four mobile laboratories fully equipped including vehicle, equipment for diagnostic
and inspection purposes and basic equipment for water quality testing and analysis (associated with
environments/controls). The regional field directorates will also be provided with utility vehicles,
motorcycles, microbuses, buses, water tanker trucks mobile and fixed water treatment plants, and such
heavy equipment as mobile cranes of 15 to 25 tons capacity and fork lift trucks to handle the
maintenance work of major pumping stations.
8.     Civil works for the repairs and rehabilitation of existing facilities and for new construction
are listed in Table 5 for each of the four regional offices. The Government will finance the
construction and rehabilitation of these facilities.
9.     The Management Information System (MIS) was established under Pumping Stations
Rehabilitation Project I (Ln.2270-EGT) on a pilot scale and was expanded to cover all of the major
activities of MED under the Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project II (Ln. 3198-EGT). It has
proven to be a good management tool and MED is keen to expand it to various field regional offices,
major pumping stations, stores, workshops and laboratories. MED has installed water level sensors on
almost 90 percent of its pumping stations which are linked to the telemetry system of the Ministry
established under USAID assistance.  MED wishes to extend the sensor system  for energy
consumption, capacity and efficiency of pumps and record on the on and off status of units in about 30
major pumping stations for monitoring purposes on a pilot scale.
10.    MIS activities will be expanded to cover this linkage. MED has agreed to establish a
Monitoring and Evaluation unit which will focus on selective basis to monitor the efficiency of pumps
before project improvements and continue to monitor the efficiency after installation of new electro-
mechanical equipment. The energy consumption will also be monitored. The project will develop
procedure for monitoring the benefits of agriculture production and other benefits in terms of reduced



Egypt - Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project                                19
expenditures on O&M. The procedure developed under the project will try to evaluate project benefits
through appropriate selection of areas and monitoring parameters. The MIS will play a major role in
developing and adopting M&E procedures as well as telemetry linkage. The required quantities of the
computers and telemetry equipment is given in Table 6. The required equipment will be procured
under the project. P.C. computers, scanners, digitizers and installation as well as training is available
in Egypt, so the Government will finance such equipment and services which are available locally.
Capacitv Building for MED
11.    Technical Assistance and Training: Technical assistance and training will focus on  the
following activities which are either new to MED or where expertise is needed to broaden the scope of
knowledge of the MED staff:
(a)    Detailed hydraulic survey and analysis is required for each pumping station during
the design phase. Through such surveys, constraints of existing channel section of
drain or canal to accommodate the design discharge will be determined. Head losses
of structures downstream which may have effect on the design water levels at the
pumping station will be evaluated. Such survey is crucial for determining the
proposed designed water levels upstream and downstream of each pumping station.
The survey would also include determination of service area and design discharge for
each pumping station. Consultants under the technical assistance will provide
support and coordinate these activities with the Irrigation Department and Egyptian
Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP). In addition to the hydraulic survey,
a structural survey will be carried out for the pumping stations which are proposed
only for complete rehabilitation to ensure that the existing building, intake and outlet
civil works are structurally safe. Provision is made for an expatriate hydraulic
engineer and a civil engineer for three months each assisted by two local civil
engineers for a period of six month to complete this activity.
(b)    As the proposed project is expected to be implemented over a period of six years and
practically all the pumping stations electro-mechanical equipment supply and
installation contracts will be awarded during the first three years, MED may require
some specialized support for design, evaluation of bids and inspection as well as
testing during the manufacturing period; provision has therefore been made for short-
term inputs up to a total period of 8 staffmonths of expatriate experts and a similar
input from local experts.
(c)    Establishing a Monitoring and Evaluation unit to monitor the efficiency of pumps,
energy consumption, discharge and develop procedures for monitoring the benefits in
terms of preventing losses in agricultural production resulting from installation of
new electro-mechanical equipment. The developed procedures and parameters will be
used to monitor the agriculture production and other benefits, such as benefits in
terms of reduced expenditures on O&M. The exercise will be initially limited to
about two drainage pumping stations and four irrigation pumping stations. This will

be expanded to additional coverage of six more pumping stations during the third and
fourth year of project implementation. Provision is made for both international and
local experts services and socio-economic surveys to establish base line data for
selected areas (Table 7).
12.    The telemetry system is new to MED and so far it is only for censoring water levels which are
connected to the MPWWR main telemetry system. MED has neither received nor used the information
of such water levels in its design and operation activities. MED intends to focus on the monitoring
aspects of the telemetry system and would like to expand it to cover energy consumption, pumps
efficiency, discharge and possible water quality. These will be monitored for about 30 stations which
would be linked to MED receiving stations either in regional offices or MED headquarters. Such a
program needs to be designed, estimates prepared, equipment procured, tested and data analyzed. For
developing such system, expertise is required which will not only identify equipment but will also train
MED staff for the use and analysis of data received. Provision is made in (Table 7) for such expertise
and the linkage of the telemetry system to both the MIS and M&E activities.
13.    As indicated in the agreed outline for the environmental management plan which is expected
to be prepared by Drainage Research Institute (DRI) and MED by December 15, 1997, DRI will select
six stations with some industrial and domestic waste effluents and for each of these stations source of
pollution will be identified. Monthly samples will be taken at the identified locations which will be
analyzed and monitored by DRI. The Environmental and Climatic Research Institute (ECRI) will also
prepare a mitigation plan and will monitor the implementation of such plan. Provision is made for all
of the environmental aspects to be contracted to DRI and ECRI under the technical assistance
component.
14.    During the past five years, MED has handed over tube wells and smaller booster pumps to
various cooperatives, farmer associations and individual farmers. Most of them are operating these
smaller facilities successfully and MED only provides technical advisory service for repairs and
replacements. However, there are quite a few cases of failure resulting in abandonment of system,
reduction in crop production and in a few cases where losses were great, and where MED has been
forced to take back the operation and maintenance. There is a lesson to learn from such privatization
efforts, it will be therefore useful to carry out a short study to update the inventory of such pumps,
reasons for success and failure and recommendations for future actions. Such a study could go a step
furtier and make some recommendations on the scope and timing of further privatization of medium
sized irrigation pumping stations.
15.    Currently MED operates - mechanical workshops - electrical laboratories for the maintenance
and repairs of pumps, motors and gears and auxiliary equipment. Some strengthening of these
workshops and laboratories is proposed under the project. In other parts of the world, such activities
are carried out by private individuals or companies. It will be desirable to perform a short study to
establish scope and timing of privatization of such workshops and laboratories.
16.    It is a credit to MED that it is able to maintain stations which are 30 to 40 years old with
reasonable efficiency. Under both previous projects, efforts were put in to develop operations and

maintenance procedures and manuals. It will be desirable to review the situation to see how useful
this exercise has been and what more needs to be done to improve the situation, particularly in
motivating each pumping station operator to monitor operation and maintenance and keep the
facilities clean and running efficiently
17.    The O&M of the Irrigation and Drainage system consists of the Aswan dam, many barrages,
main and secondary canals, main and secondary drains and the drainage and irrigation pumping
stations. For such a multi-layered system with multi-use of Nile water, a detailed study was carried
out by consultants under US Financing to look at the possible recovery of O&M. During the past five
years, many workshops were held under the auspices of USAID on the recommendations of such
detailed studies. For socio-economic reasons, none of these recommendations were feasible. For the
same reasons, direct water charge will be difficult to impose, in Egypt. The only practical solution is
the reassessment of land tax which would take into account the O&M cost of all of the
irrigation/drainage facilities mentioned above. This would require a review of studies and
recommendations made in the past, with a fresh look at the possibility of increasing the land tax, as a
basis of reassessment and recommendations for improvement. Provision is made for such study under
the project.

ANNEX 3
Estimated Prcoject Costs and Financing
A.    E:stimated Cost
Project Costs: The total project cost is estimated at LE 861.157 million (US$253.265
million), of which LE 506.704 million (US$149.031 million) or 58.84 percent, is foreign
exchange. Project costs were based on unit rates from recent contracts under the ongoing
pumping stations Rehabilitation Project II (Ln. 3198-EGT), with some adjustments for
variations in unit prices. MED pays custom duties generally ranging between 10 to 40 percent
for imported equipment and material and 80 percent custom duty on vehicles. In addition to
the custom duties, there is a 10 percent sales tax on the unit rate cost of imported items plus
custom duties. It has been a practice iin previous projects, not to include custom duties in the
unit rates, only sales tax considered, so for these reasons, custom duties and sales tax is not
reflected in the unit rates. All costs are based on prices as of December 1997. Physical
contingency factors were based on the degree of preparation and firmness of details available;
these are 5 percent for pumps, motors, auxiliary equipment, civil works related to the
pumping stations, equipment for the emergency centers, and for computers and Telemetry
equipment; 8 percent for housing, workshop and stores buildings, 10 percent for
miscellaneous equipment, vehicles, and workshops laboratory equipment. Because of a
provision of miscellaneous unforeseen, no physical contingency was used for technical
assistance and training.
Cost estimates for each pumping station with quantities, unit rates and base cost in foreign
and local currency are given in Annex 2, Table 1 for 68 stations expected to be financed by
the World Bank. Costs for 9 stations to be financed by the KfW are given in Table 2. Costs
due to expected price increases over the implementations period of six years amount to about
20.5 percent of the base cost plus physical contingencies, assuming the following annual
inflation rates.

B.    Financing Plan
3.    The Government has, in addition tD the World Bank, requested assistance from the Federal
Republic of Germany through KfW., which is expected to provide financing for the project of
about DM 50 million (equivalent of US$29.4 million), DM 3.0 million of which would be a
grant, covering the foreign expenditure related to technical assistance and training. The loan
portion of KfW financing would finance the foreign exchange cost of the electro-mechanical
equipment, including auxiliary equibpment, for 9 pumping stations, and a part of technical
assistance and training of about DM 1.00 million not covered under the Grant. The cofinancing
will be on the basis of parallel financing. Assurances would be obtained at negotiations that
GOE would confirm the cofinancing arrangements for the project by June 30, 1998.
4.    The proposed Bank loan of US$120 million would finance 100 percent of foreign costs for
modernization of 68 pumping stations, five emergency centers equipment and vehicles,
miscellaneous equipment and, computers required under the institutional support component.
The Government will finance all locEIl costs including costs of equipment manufactured and/or
purchased in Egypt as well as civil works and taxes to be paid on the imported equipment. The

48                                                      Egypt - Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project
ANNEX 4
Project Economic Analysis
1.    Irrigation and drainage pumping stations are critical to the survival of Egypt's agricultural
economy. The adequate functioning of irrigation pumping stations is important to ensuring timely
availability of Nile water for farming and for assuring dependable supplies during periods of peak
demand. Equally vital is the adequate functioning of drainage pumping stations to enable the evacuation
of drainage water to prevent excessive water and salinity. Without adequately functioning irrigation and
drainage facilities, agricultural production and consequently exports would fall and food imports would
rise.
P!roiect Benefits
2.     The project would have two main beneficial impacts: (i) it would prevent losses in crop yields by
ensuring adequate supply of irrigation water and prevention of water deficit for crops and provision of
adequate drainage during peak periods (June-August); thus preventing water-logging and soil
salinization; and (ii) it would reduce the unit cost of water pumped by improving the efficiency of the
pumping stations, and create fiscal savings through reduced expenditures on maintenance.
3.     Based on reasonable assumptions and available data, it is envisaged that the project would
benefit a total of about 498,595 feddans through rehabilitation of irrigation pumping stations and
1,049,550 feddans through rehabilitation of drainage pumping stations, resulting in a total of about 1.55
million feddans benefiting under the project. With average size of land holding per farm  family
equivalent to about 2 feddans, more than 700,000 farm families would benefit from the project.
Economic Analysis
Base Assumptions for Analysis
4.     The assumptions used for the evaluation of project benefits are as follows:
(i)    The project has been justified conservatively using only its agricultural benefits and only
half the agricultural benefits per feddan based on the crop budgets. It should be noted
that there are limitations in drawing precise conclusions on the relationship between
water table levels, irrigation deliveries, drainage performance and yields. It is therefore
difficult to come up with any precise calculation of the effects on agricultural production
of the declining performance of pumping stations. This is because crop yields are a
function of several factors (technology, inputs, cultural practices, farm management),
and it is difficult to identify a single causal factor for yield changes, especially under real
field conditions. Nevertheless, it is clearly recognized that, without adequate water,
crops can suffer from water stress which can have consequent reduction in yields.
Hence, the reduced performance of irrigation and drainage pumping stations, particularly
during critical periods, would have an adverse effect on crop yields.
(ii)    Recognizing the limitations on determining agricultural benefits from irrigation and
drainage, it can be reasonably assumed that crop yields are a function of the timely
delivery of irrigation water and also of timely evacuation of drainage water. Timely



Egypt - Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project                                     49
delivery and evacuation are in turn dependent on the reliability of pumping units in the
pumping stations (as measured by the ratio of water delivered to crop water requirements
per period). Pumping stallion reliability is particularly critical during periods of peak
demand for water. Any disruptions or malfunctioning in irrigation and drainage
facilities could have deleterious effects on crop yields and consequently reduce farm
incomes. Based on engineering assessments, it has been assumed in this analyses that a
typical irrigation pumping station loses efficiency by a minimum factor of 0.006 a year.
This efficiency factor is multiplied by the average age of irrigation pumping stations in
the project to get the average decline in efficiency for a typical irrigation pumping
station. This measure of efliciency decline per typical irrigation pumping station is used
to check the corresponding reduction in yield by crop from the FAO publication, Yield
Response to Water (FAO, N4o. 33, Rome, 1979). The residual yield after accounting for
the yield losses defines the "without" project yield. For the case of the drainage
pumping stations, it has been conservatively assumed that inadequate drainage would
reduce crop yields by a factor of 8% (based on field trials in Egypt; see publication by
the Drainage Research Institute, Land Drainage in Egypt, Cairo, 1989).
(iii)   Cropping Patterns and Yields. Crop budgets used in this analyses are kept in project
files. The "without project" case for alternative crop budgets is based on assumptions
for irrigation and drainage in item (ii). A cropping intensity of 200% is assumed for all
three regions. Three altern,ative cropping patterns are assumed for the three different
agro-ecological regions of ihe Delta, Middle and Upper Egypt, reflecting the different
uses of land per crop for each region. For the Nile Valley, differences in cropping
patterns between Middle and Upper Egypt are introduced to show the relative dominance
of cane sugar in Upper Egypt. Cropping patterns are presented on Annex 4, Table 2. As
far as crop yields are concerned, it is assumed that yields in the Delta are different from
those in the Nile Valley (Middle Egypt and Upper Egypt) because of differences in
climate, soil conditions, and cultural practices. The relative lack of significant variance
in yields between Middle and Upper Egypt and the identical conditions prevaiiling in
these areas warrant treating yields in these two regions as the same.
(iv)   Headworks versus Field Level Works. For both irrigation and drainage, it is assumed
that field-level irrigation ancd drainage facilities are in place. For drainage, for example,
it is assumed that farmers have installed their laterals and collectors on their fields.
Therefore, the following analysis only evaluates the effects on agricultural yields of
investments in major pumping stations (headworks) situated on the main canals.
(v)    Price. Projected 1998-2004 economic prices for traded commodities have been
computed in constant 1997 dollars. These are based on World Bank commodity price
forecasts presented in the publication, Commodity Markets and the Developing
Countries, August 1997. Exlport parity prices were computed for cotton, rice and citrus;
and import parity prices were calculated for wheat, maize and sugar cane as well as for
farmn inputs. In the case of cotton, distinction is made between cotton lint and cotton
seed, both of which are exported by Egypt together as a composite commodity. For
cotton lint, Egypt exports tWD varieties, Nile Delta long staple lint seed cotton and Nile
Valley medium staple lint seed cotton, both of which fetch a quality premium in world
markets. These quality premia have been reflected appropriately in the adjustments for
calculation of economic prices. The price forecast for soyabean is used as a proxy for
the economic price of cotton seed, since both are oilseeds. For non-traded commodities

in the analyses, such as berseem and broadbeans, and for non-traded inputs, such as
labor, the prevailing financial prices have been used to reflect economic prices.
(vi)   Project Area. Farm Model. Phasing and Benefit-Buildup. The total area served by the 77
pumping stations is 1.55 million feddans, of which about 1.05 million feddans is served
by the drainage stations and 0.5 million feddans by the irrigation pumping stations. A
one feddan model is assumed for each region taking into account the applicable cropping
pattern by region, and the benefit of irrigation or drainage rehabilitation on yields on that
feddan. A benefit build-up is constructed on this one feddan model, taking into account
the period an individual pumping station enters into the project.
(vii)  Project Costs.  The analysis includes all investment costs, including physical
contingencies, calculated in constant 1997 dollars, but excluding price contingencies.
Taxes and duties levied by government on imports have been excluded from the costs
used in the analysis, because they do not involve real productive use of resources but
only positive transfers to government. Since distortions in the markets for inputs used in
civil works (e.g., cement, steel, labor) have been removed, no adjustments are deemed
necessary for the non-traded aspects of civil works and prevailing financial prices have
been used to represent economic prices.
(viii) Economic Rate of Return. Based on the foregoing assumptions, the preappraisal
calculations carried out reveal that the average incremental benefits per annum (from
avoiding crop losses) due to complete rehabilitation or new construction of pumping
stations in the three regions of Delta, Middle Egypt and Upper Egypt are about US$85
per feddan for irrigation and about US$35 per feddan for drainage. The benefits per
feddan for spare parts provision is estimated at US$10 per annum. A total of 1.55 million
feddans would benefit under the project. At full development; i.e., by the seventh year
of the project, it is envisaged that the total agricultural benefits from the project (based
on crop loss prevention) would be US$69 million annually. Calculations for the
economic rate of return to the project show it to be in the order of 30%, which indicates
project viability. Details of calculations are presented in Annex 4, Table 1.

ANNEX 5
Institutional Arrangements
Introduction
1.    With a staff of about 13,000 civil servants and an annual budget of about US$155 million
equivalent, MED is facing organization issues. The staffing of MED has been stable over the last 10
years and the staff turnover is very low since retirees are replaced by young graduates. It is, however,
important to note that while the staffing structure has been stable the responsibilities entrusted to the
MED has increased several fold during this period. Hence, while the volume of work carried out during
the second five-year plan (1987-1992) was about LE 156 million, this increased to about LE 578 million
during the three-year plan (1992-1997) and is expected to increase by a further five fold to about LE
2826.889 million during the current four five-year plan (1997-2002).
2.    The MED has launched an internal review of its organization and procedures. The exercise has
been assisted by an evaluation of MED's human resources carried out by the Central Organization for
Administration and by an organizational and technical performance audit carried out by international
consultants. As a result of these reviews, MED is in the process of restructuring its organizational
framework to enable further decentralization, to that achieved over the last six years during the
implementation of the second phase of the Rehabilitation Program supported by the current Pump
Stations Rehabilitation Project II which is due to close in May 1998. The main purpose for the
decentralization of the MED's management structure is to allow for a more flexible and efficient system
to deal with the very complex and varied requirements of operating over 1,000 pumping stations all over
Egypt which have varied operation and maintenance requirements. A further main reason for the re-
structuring is to allow senior management of the MED to deal with major planning and strategic issues
while delegating to a competent lower level of technical managers the responsibility of the day-to-day
running of the system.
3.    The proposed restructuring envisages the creation of two Sector Heads (at first undersecretary
level) three Central Directorates (in addition to the current six CDs), fifteen General Directorates under
the Central Directorates (in addition to the 23 existing operational GDs) and one GDs attached to the
Office of the Head of MED (in addition to the existing six GDs and four Directorates).
4.     Restructuring at MED's Front Office:
The following modifications are envisaged:
(i) Creation of a General Directorate For Emergencies: This GD
will be responsible for the rapid movement of mobile pumping units to locations where
flooding may be imminent due to pump failure in the drainage system or where pump
failure may result in interruption of irrigation water supplies at peak periods.
(ii) Upgrading the Directorate of Organization and Management to the level of General
Directorate (GD). This step is in the process of being implemented.



Egypt - Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project                               63
5.    Creation of two post of Sector Heads:
(i) In the existing arrangement, the Head of MED is the Head of the Projects Sector and
oversees the Undersecretary head of the Central Directorate for Investment Projects. It is
this post which is proposed to be upgraded to Sector Head level, thus giving an
intermediate management structure.
(ii) The Operation and Maintenance Sector comes under the direct control of the Head of
MED and is composed of four Central Directorates for Pumping Stations, one for each of
the four regions (East and Central Delta, West Delta, Middle Egypt, and upper Egypt).
The restructuring envisages the creation of the post of Head of Sector to directly oversee
the operation of the four CD in addition to a fifth CD (to be formed as part of the
restructuring) for Middle Delta which will secede from the joint CD for East and Middle
Delta to form it's own independent CD due to the considerable overload experienced
when the two sub-regions are combined.
6.    Establishment of new organizations under the Operation and Maintenance Sector: The following
additional Central and general Directorates will be created in this sector:
(i) Establishment of a Central Directorate for Middle Delta Pumping Stations, as indicated
above.
(ii) Establishment of nine GD under the four existing CD and proposed additional CD (two in
East Delta, three in the newly-formed Middle Delta CD, one in West Delta, one in Middle
Egypt and one in Upper Egypt ). The result of this restructuring will see the formation of
six decentralized field Mechanical and Electrical GDs (in Ismailiya, Zaqaziq, South
Middle Delta, west Nubaria, Middle Egypt Tubewells, Toshki Abu Abu Simbel), in
addition to two GD for Middle D)elta (one electrical and one mechanical workshop) and a
GD for electrical stations in Upper Egypt.
7.    Establishment of new organizations under the Project's Sector. The following additional Central
and General Directorates will be created under the sector:
(i) Central Directorate for Projects and Civil Works. This will see the formation of three new
GDs (South of the Valley Mechanical and Electrical GD, GDs for Civil Works Upper
Egypt and Lower Egypt).
(ii) Central Directorate for Technical Affairs. This will involve formation of three GDs (GI)
Specifications, GD Research-development-and improvement of Performance and the GI)
for Technical Inspection, Calibration and Environmental Unit.
8.    The attached organograms show the proposed restructuring of MED which is to be carried out
during the implementation of the proposed Third Pumping Station Project. MED's program for
restructuring the Department is the result of an evaluation of MED's human resources capabilities which
was carried out by the Central Organization fo)r Administration in addition to a self assessment by the
MED's senior management, necessitated by the considerable increased work load. Mission has
discussed the proposed restructuring with MED and believes that the proposal are practical and sound
and should be supported under the proposed project.

ANNEX 6
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
l.    As the project implementing agency, the MED, has considerable experience in procurement as
shown by a good procurement performance in the first and second World Bank financed Pumping
Stations Rehabilitation Projects, it would be responsible for procurement under the project. All goods to
be financed from the Bank loans proceeds would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits dated January 1995 and revised January and August
1996. Basic understanding has been reached that procurement of goods under the KfW loan will also be
in accordance with the same guidelines (subject to final approval by the German Government). The
procedures to be adopted are set out below and procurement arrangements are summarized in Table A.
A.    Procurement Methods
A.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
(a) Goods (Equipment and Materials)
(i)   ICB procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines would be used for the procurement
of all electro-mechanical equipment for pump stations, workshop and laboratory
equipment, pumps for the emergency centers and heavy duty equipment. These items
(totaling about US$105.0 million, including contingencies) represent more than 85
percent of the total cost of the components financed by the Bank. Where compatibility
of spare parts or other items with installed equipment is required, or where items are
available from a sole source of supply only, contracts would be negotiated directly with
the manufacturer or authorized agent. The aggregate amount of direct contracting for
such spare parts would be up to US$20.0 million equivalent.
(ii)   International Shopping (IS) and Local Shopping (LS) with at least three quotations from
three eligible sources will be used for contracts estimated to cost less than US$1.0
million equivalent each, up to an aggregate amount of US$7.0 million equivalent. Small
items costing less than US$100,000 and miscellaneous equipment and materials for
office, laboratories, workshops, diagnostic which cannot be combined into ICB
packages, may also be awarded on an IS/LS basis.
(iii)   Tendering schedule for various components to be financed by the World Bank are
summarized in Table 1, and for KfW in Table 2 . Procurement arrangements are given in
Table A. As cofinancing arrangements under this project are on a parallel financing
basis, KfW will carry out its own review of bidding documents and bid evaluations for
items it finances. All procurement under the proposed project will be carried out by
MED.
(b)    Civil Works. All civil works under the project would be financed by the MED. NCB
procedures and standardized bidding documents similar to those used for civil works on previous
Bank-financed projects for Pump Stations Rehabilitation will be applied.
(c)    Technical Assistance and Training for MED. These will involve individual consultants
and/or consulting firms, mostly hired to support the MED in designs, preparation of



Egypt - Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project                              71
specification, studies and training. The selection of consultants financed from the World Bank
loan will be according to the World Bank Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of
Consultants dated January 1997. Consultants engaged for technical assistance financed under
the KfW financing would be engaged according to the procedures and guidelines of KfWV. The
major part of the Technical Assistance and Training (US$2.8 million equivalent) will be
financed from the KfW-grant (US$1.71 million equivalent to DM2.9 million), and to a lesser
part from the KfW loan (US$0.487 in) and IBRD loan (US$0.6 m equivalent) to finance items
not covered by the KfW financing. The recruitment of consultants for all assignments will be
coordinated between the World Bank, KfW, and the MED.
(d)    Domestic Preference. Under ICB procedures for the procurement of goods only, a
margin of preference would be granted to bids offering certain goods manufactured in Egypt,
when compared to such goods manuiFactured elsewhere. The nationality of the manufacturer or
supplier is not a condition to such eligibility. Appendix 2 of the guidelines will apply to
domestic preference.
B.    Procurement Details
2.    The World Bank and KfW will only finance electro-mechanical equipment, auxiliary equipment
for the pumping stations and other equipmenrt. For the new pumping stations to replace old stations,
MED first tenders electro-mechanical equipment with a clause on coordination with the civil works
contractor during installation and testing. After the award of an electro-mechanical equipment contract,
the supplier furnishes MED with the basic layout for the proposed equipment. On the basis of this
layout, detailed design and drawings are prepared for the civil works by MED civil works consultants
and a separate tender for civil works is floated, which has a similar clause of coordination with the
electro-mechanical equipment supplier during installation and testing under MED supervision. As these
are two separate contracts, Bank standard contract documents for the supply and installation of Plant and
Equipment (November 1997) will be used for the procurement of electro-mechanical equipment and an
NCB standard document will be used for civil works financed by MED. Both of these documents were
reviewed by the mission and these are in conformity with Bank procedures. Furthermore, MED has
agreed to give a written agreement that the EBank's standard bidding and bid evaluation documenits will
be used consistently. Technical specifications will vary for each contract according to the scope of work.
3.    MED has prepared a detailed program for each tender giving the location of pumping stations,
estimated base cost, dates of advertisement, bid opening, bid evaluation, contract award, opening of the
letter of credit, equipment delivery date, installation and acceptance dates. A detailed tendering and
delivery schedule for 68 pumping stations expected to be financed by the World Bank is given in Annex
6, Table 1 and for those to be financed by the KfW is given in Annex 6, Table 2 together with expected
disbursement profiles for the World Bank i(Table 3) and KfW (Table 4) with required counterpart
funding for World Bank components (Table 5) and KfW component (Table 6). The following time has
been allowed for various steps of tendering and delivery.

Guarantee Period                                                    24 months
4.     In the past, in some cases the bid evaluation period was as long as six months. To avoid
exceeding the bid validity period, MED has agreed to reduce the evaluation period to about 60 days.
Furthermore, it was also agreed that in exceptional cases where there are more than 8 qualified bids and
technical specifications requirements are difficult, MED will inform both the Bank and KfW  of their
expected date of completion of evaluation, giving reasons for delay and requesting bidders to extend the
bid validity period, if necessary. MED also agreed to strengthen the specifications and design unit by
increasing the professional staff with an additional four engineers experienced in design and procurement
for pumping stations.
5.     The following is the summary of number of tenders expected to be tendered in each fiscal year
for both the World Bank and KfW financing giving the range of estimated contract value.

6.     In the past, MED has used a schedule of payment to the suppliers which is not in tune with
current international practices for contracts of this magnitude and supplies which require considerable
investment in manufacturing such specific need pumps and motors. Moreover, such a schedule is neither
beneficial to the supplier nor the MED. The supplier has to borrow money at high interest rates which
one in turn is built into the unit rate resulting in a higher end cost for the MED. MED has agreed to
revise the payment schedule which would also help the disbursement process. The following is the
agreed payment schedule with comparison of currently used schedule:

7.    In order to proceed with tender processing as soon as designs are ready for the contracts of the
first year, MED must start to advertise the first tender by August 1998, which would enable award
contracts as soon as the project loans become effective. Current MPWWR's regulations do not allow
this. However, there is a precedent with the National Drainage project and the Irrigation Improvement
Project which requires the approval of the Minster of Public Works and Water Resources. It was agreed
that MED will seek such approval and inform both the Bank and KfW by January 31, 1998.
8.    Prior Review Thresholds. All World Bank financed contracts above US$1,000,000 for goods
and consulting contracts above US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants will be
subject to prior Bank review. Also, the first three contracts financed by the World Bank and procured
under IS/LS or Direct Contracting procedures would be subject to prior Bank review. All other contracts
financed from the World Bank loan would be subject to selective ex-post review by the Bank. These
limits would result in prior review of about 83 percent of total procurement financed by the Bank loan
(Table B). Review thresholds for items financed by the KfW will be in accordance with KfW's
guidelines and procedures.
C     Disbursements
9.    Disbursement were worked out for every semester from the tendering schedule given in Tables 1
and 2. Detailed disbursement for each contract is shown in Table 3 and 4 on the basis of base cosit plus
physical contingencies for each contract. The price contingencies computed for each semester is added
to the total disbursement at the end.
10.   The proposed Bank loan of US$120 million would be disbursed in 6 years against the categories
of rates shown below. Although MED has no :intention in principle of requesting financing for Technical
Assistance and Training, in view of special need in order to avoid amendment of loan agreement, a
nominal provision has been included. This provisional amount of US$500,000 has been included to
cover items not covered by KfW financing. ALmounts not utilized may, in agreement with the Bank, be
reallocated to other categories. The following is the summary of expected disbursement:
K:_
Annual                    3.80      13.20     32.2      35.3       26.3       9.2

11l. All applications for disbursement would be made by MED against full documentation except for
paymenlts against contracts for: (a) goods of less than US$1,000,000 equivalent; (b) services of
consulting firms not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent; and (c) services of individual consultants and
training costing less than US$50,000, which would be disbursed against statements of expenditures
(SQEs). It is estimated that total procurement under SOEs would be about US$3.0 million. Supporting
documents for SOE claims would be retained at MED headquarters and made available for inspection by
the Bank supervision missions and project auditors. The withdrawal applications for direct disbursement
from the Loan Account would be at the minimum equivalent to 20% of the initial deposit to the Special
Account. Although MED is reluctant to use a Special Account, provision has been made in the Loan
Agreement for an authorized allocation to the Special Account of US$12,000,000 with the first deposit
not exceeding US$3,000,000. MED may request the balance to be deposited to the Special Account
when the total disbursed and committed under the Loan will have reached US$20,000,000.

D.    Budge
12.   In the past, budgetary requirements and their timely allocation has not been a problem in any of
the projects undertaken by MPWWR. However, as the Government is taking full responsibility of
paying for goods, materials, Civil Works and Services, manufactured, supplied or provided using local
currency it is prudent to point out the budgetary requirements for each fiscal year.  Following
requirements does not include custom duties and taxes imposed on imported equipment which can be
about forty percent of imported cost:

E.    AuditAndAccoun
13.   MED, like all Government agencies, are subject to GOE expenditure control and auditing
procedures. The Central Directorate for Administration and Finance of MED would be responsible for
establishing and maintaining separate accounts for the project reflecting, in accordance with appropriate
accounting practices, the operations and expenditure of the project. MED has the staffing and ability to
prepare and maintain project accounts in a foirm acceptable to the Bank. These accounts would be kept
in MED and would be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank.
14.   Agreements have been reached at negotiations that: (a) all project-related contracts and
documents for disbursement made against SOE would be kept for at least one year after the fiscal year in
which the last withdrawals from the loan accounts are made; (b) the account will be audited by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank; (c) the audit would include the examination of all SOEs and
audits of Special Account submitted to the Bank for reimbursement; and (d) audited accounts, together
with the auditor's report, would be furnished to the Bank Group within six months of the end of each
fiscal year.

Egypt - Third Pumping Stations Rehabiliation Project                             89
ANNEX 7
Environmental Management Aspects
A.    Overview
1.    Introduction. The proposed Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project (Project) is
anticipated to have a positive environmental impact and contribute to improved land and water
management in Egypt. The rehabilitation of the drainage pumping stations would help maintain the water
table at low levels and prevent waterlogging and soil salinization. Preparation of the proposed Project has
included field based environmental review by representatives of the Mechanical and Electrical
Department (MED) of the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources (MPWWR); Rouchdy Saleh
Hassan, Environmental Specialists/Project Officer (MNCEG); and Aizad N. Khan, Irrigation and
Drainage Consultant. The proposed Project is the third of a series of World Bank supported investments
for the rehabilitation of pumping stations and builds upon earlier environmental work which included
input from the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA). A review of environmental issues associated with the proposed Project was
prepared by Mr. Hassan to support Project preparation and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
has been prepared to address environmental issues during the implementation process.
2.    Environmental Aspects. The proposed Project has been placed in environmental screening
category "B" consistent with the procedures of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental
Assessment." It has been placed in this screening category due to the limited potential environmental
impacts associated with: (a) construction activities for pumping station rehabilitation; (b) routine
monitoring measures for maintenance of proper water quality, (c) special monitoring to rminimize risks in
selected locations where domestic and industrial wastewaters are discharged into some open drains; and
(d) special support for dissemination and application of guidelines for mixing stations. Given the focus
of the proposed Project on rehabilitation it is not anticipated that the proposed Project would require
involuntary resettlement or result in damage to archaeological and/or historical sites. All project
supported pumping station rehabilitation actions would be subject to a site specific environmental review
by MED, as part of the design process, to minimize potential localized environmental impacts, avoid
involuntary resettlement and prevent damage to archaeological and historical sites. The Project would
include the use of archaeological "chance find procedures" in case buried archaeological materials are
discovered during construction activities.
B.    Environmental Management Plan
3.    Objective. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared for the project by
MED and would facilitate continued integration of environmental concerns into the operation of
pumping and mixing stations in Egypt. The EMP would support: (a) establishment of an Environmental
Unit in MED; (b) environmental training for MED staff at a variety of levels; (c) use of site specific
environmental review procedures for pumping, station rehabilitation activities; (d) support for continued
activities in water quality monitoring; and (e) measures to apply water quality guidelines at mixing
stations for the reuse of drainage effluent. The EMP would be included as a fully funded component of
the proposed Project and would be implemenited by MED with the support of the Drainage Research
Institute (DRI) and the recently established Environmental and Climatic Research Institute (ECRI).



90                                             Egypt - Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project
Detailed discussions concerning the EMP were conducted during the Pre-Appraisal Mission and it would
be finalized during the Appraisal Mission.
4.    Development of the Environmental Unit in MED. The MED  would establish an
Environmental Unit through a Ministerial Decree whose purpose would be to coordinate the
environmental work carried out by DRI, ECRI and/or other Government agencies concerned with
drainage activities. An important function of the MED Environmental Unit would be to create
environmental awareness among MED personnel assigned to headquarters, regional field offices and
pumping stations. The MED Environmental Unit would include a staff of four professionals including a
Unit Chief. It would undertake the following functions: (a) disseminate environmental guidelines for use
in drainage pumping operations; (b) plan and coordinate environmental training, especially for pumping
station operators concerned with the reuse of drainage effluent; (c) coordinate site specific environmental
reviews for activities at new pumping stations and those undergoing rehabilitation; (d) coordinate, in
cooperation with DRI and ECRI, water quality monitoring activities concerning pumping and mixing
stations; and (e) periodically make field visits to pumping and mixing stations which have potential
environmental concerns. The MED Environmental Unit would also prepare consolidated environmental
reports every six months as an element of the Project reporting process (see below).
5.    Environmental Training Program. The MED  Environment Unit would coordinate
implementation of a Project supported environmental training program to be conducted by DRI and
ECRI. The training program would be conducted at three complementary levels:
(a)    Management Staff Training would be provided for MED management staff at the level
of First Under Secretaries, Under Secretaries and Director Generals through one or two
day seminars promoting environmental awareness and focusing on key environmental
issues in system design and operation. These would include review of the impacts of
water quality on the life and quality of electrical and mechanical equipment; application
of monitoring data to management decisions; environmental and health concerns
associated with the expanded reuse of drainage effluents; and special issues related to
industrial and domestic effluents in drainage waters.
(b)   Professional Staff. Training would be provided to professional staff who deal with day-
to-day design, operations, maintenance and monitoring aspects of MED activities. The
workshops would be for a period of one week and repeated four times a year during the
initial two years of the proposed Project and then reduced to two times a year. The
workshops would cover water quality and environmental management, including design
issues, operational concerns, application of guidelines, collection and interpretation of
monitoring data, and the use of environmental mitigation plans.
(c)    Pumping Station Operators. Training would be provided to technical staff, especially
personnel responsible for the operation of pumping stations. The training courses would
be of two days duration and be repeated 6-10 times during the initial two years of the
proposed Project and then reduced to three times a year. The courses would focus on
awareness, implementation of basic guidelines, use of instrumentation at pumping
stations and special procedures in case potential water quality problems are identified.
This program would also provide training to a selected group of users and cooperatives
who operate booster pumps using either mixed flows or drainage effluent.

(d)   Study Tours. In addition, the proposed Project would provide for short-term study tours
to other countries for MED management, design and environmental staff to learn more
about measures adopted by other agencies to address environmental management and
monitoring as an integral elennent of their operational programs.
6.    Site Specific Environmental Review. The MED would design and implement a program for site
specific environmental review of pumping station rehabilitation activities to be supported under the
proposed Project. These reviews would be conducted under the supervision of the MED Environmental
Unit and include the use of a standardizecl forrnat including: (a) review of current environrnental
conditions at the site; (b) assessment of potential environmental impacts associated with rehabilitation
activities, including construction impacts such as dust, noise and disposal of waste materials; (c)
evaluation of potential environmental issues associated with the operation of the rehabilitated pumping
station, including the disposal of waste materials, especially lubricants; (d) review of the potential need
for involuntary resettlement due to rehabilitation activities; and (e) review of any potential impacts to
archaeological and historical sites from rehabilitation activities. Progress in undertaking site specific
environmental reviews would be included in reports prepared by the MED Environmental Unit. These
reports would also identify any special issues which arise and outline mitigation measures to address
these concerns.
7.    Water Quality Monitoring Programn. The EMP would support a Water Quality Monitoring
Program to assist MED in assuring that t4ie pumping stations are designed and operated in an
environmentally sound manner. The program wvould include the following:
(a)    Program Management. The UW'ater Quality Monitoring Program would be supervised by
a Steering Committee Chaired by the First Under Secretary of MED and including the
Directors of DRI and ECRI. The MED Environment Unit would serve as the Secretariat
for the Steering Committee. ;[t would meet twice a year to discuss the status of the
monitoring program, trends observed by the program and measures which need lto be
taken to address potential environmental issues. The MED would work directly with
public and private sector parties to implement the recommendations of the Steering
Committee, especially when mitigation measures are required to protect water quality.
ECRI would monitor the implementation of mitigation measures and keep the Steering
Committee informed of progress in addressing these issues. The minutes of the Steering
Committee would be included as an element of Project environmental reports which are
to be prepared each six months.
(b)    Monitoring Strategy. The proposed Project would support a series of water quality
monitoring activities to comp]lement the on-going program of DRI that includes 110
observation points evaluated on a regular basis. Priority has been given to four sites in
the Nile Delta which require special monitoring due to risks associated with industrial
and domestic effluents; demonstration monitoring activities at two mixing stations; and
development of a monitoring program for Middle and Upper Egypt. The EMP would
support costs associated with special monitoring programs at six stations by contract
through DRI as in the previous phases of the project. ECRI would be requested to
prepare environmental mitigation plans for corrective actions at these sites on the basis
of monitoring data and field studies. The estimated cost of monitoring, preparation and
supervision of implementation of the environmental mitigation plan, and provision of
basic equipment for both DRI and ECRI are included under the proposed Project.

(c)    Continuation of Current Special Monitoring. The proposed Project would provide
support for continued monitoring at: (i) Max Drainage Pumping Station and (ii) Tabiya
Drainage Pumping Station which was begun during an earlier phase of the Pumping
Stations Rehabilitation investment program. These stations are in the North Nile Delta
and are affected by domestic and industrial discharges to open drains. The need to
include further special monitoring for these two stations is due to the good baseline data
established under the earlier project and to enable MED, EEAA and other Egyptian
authorities to evaluate the effects of the February 1998 deadline for industries to begin
treatment of their wastes prior to discharge into open drains. Under the proposed Project
an environmental mitigation plan for these sites would be prepared. ECRI would
supervise the plan to support MED in having actions taken to reduce sources of
pollution.
(d)   Additional Pumping Stations for Special Monitoring. The proposed Project would also
support special monitoring activities at: (i) Bell Bass Drainage Pumping Station and (ii)
Halg El Gamal Drainage Pumping Station. They are located in the East Nile Delta and
West Nile Delta respectively and are affected by domestic and industrial discharges to
open drains. On the basis of two years of monitoring data and field investigations
concerning the sources, the ECRI would prepare and supervise implementation of an
environmental mitigation plan to support MED in having actions taken to reduce these
sources of pollution.
(e)   Monitoring at Selected Mixing Stations. Although the proposed Project will not fund
rehabilitation of any mixing stations, in order to support implementation of the
forthcoming guidelines for mixing of irrigation water and drainage effluents, a
demonstration monitoring program would be conducted with Project support at: (i)
Mahasma Mixing Station; and (ii) Upper Serw Mixing Station. Both these stations are in
the East Nile Delta and would serve as model locations for the monitoring of key
parameters. These stations are part of the 110 locations now being monitored by DRI and
where analysis of samples shows deterioration of water quality. On the basis of two
years of monitoring data and field investigations concerning the sources, the ECRI
would prepare and supervise implementation of an environmental mitigation plan to
support MED in having actions taken to reduce these sources of pollution.
(f)    Monitoring Program for Middle and Upper Egypt. The proposed Project would support
development of a monitoring program for stations in Middle and Upper Egypt after
completion by DRI of a reconnaissance survey tentatively planned to be completed by
the end of June 1998. It is anticipated that the proposed program for this activity would
be reviewed by the Steering Committee and then submitted to the Bank by the end of
October 1998.
8.    Implementation of Guidelines for Reuse of Drainage Effluent. The growing need in Egypt to
more effectively use limited water resources through mixing drainage effluents with irrigation water
requires careful planning, field supervision and monitoring. Current Egyptian procedures for mixing
follow: (a) the FAO guidelines on tolerance limits for various crops to salinity; and (b) the WHO
guidelines for various heavy metals and chemical composition of such water and its effect on crops
produced for human consumption. The DRI, with support from the African Development Bank, is
currently preparing comprehensive guidelines for mixing irrigation and drainage water under the specific
conditions in Egypt. The proposed Project would support the application of these guidelines through the



Egypt - Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project                           93
work of the MED Environmental Unit, disseminate them through environmental training courses and
support the pilot monitoring of their use at two locations.
9.    Reporting. The MED would prepare, as an element of its Project reporting requirements, a
series of environmental reports that outline progress in implementation of the EMP. These reports would
be prepared by the MED Environment Unit and provide a means for rapid review of the progress made in
development of the unit as well as addressing specific environmental objectives.
10.   Project Supervision. The Supervision Plan for the proposed Project would includle the
participation of World Bank environmenital staff in selected missions to review progress in
implementation of the EMP. It is anticipatecl that support for these activities would draw upon MNA
environmental specialists from headquarters and the resident mission. The environmental performance of
the proposed Project would be included as a standard element of supervision reports, including the Mid-
Term Review and the Implementation Completion Report.
11.   EMP Implementation Schedule and Budget. The draft EMP will be discussed during the
Appraisal Mission for the proposed Project and the implementation schedule and budget for this
component will be finalized. The draft implementation schedule would allow EMP activities to be
undertaken in a fully integrated manner with other key activities to be supported by the proposed Project.
Preliminary cost estimates have been prepared for the EMP which include contracts for monitoring
services from DRI and ECRI. When finalized, the implementation schedule and budget would be added
as attachments to this annex.

Major Projed Components: (presents description of project components)
The proposed Project would support the third phase of the national investment program  for rehabilitation of
irrigation and drainage pumping stations in the Nile Valley and Delta. The Project would be implemented by the
Mechanical and Electrical Department (MED) of the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources
(MPWWR). Activities would be supported in four complementary areas:
(a) Investments would include: (i) reconstruction of 32 existing pumping stations; (ii) complete rehabilitation of
36 pumping stations; (iii) provision of spare parts for 9 pumping stations; and (iv) provision of equipment for
five emergency centers;
(b) Strengthening of mechanical workshops and electrical laboratories by provision of equipment for operation
and maintenance and provision of vehicles to support field activities;
(c) Institutional support for MED including: (i) development of an integrated Management Information System'
(MIS) for MED: (ii) establishment of an Environmental Management Unit in MED; (iii) implementation of an
Environmental Management Plan including a Water Quality Monitoring Program; and (iv) logistic support to
field services in the form of buildings, equipment and vehicles; and
(d) Capacity building including provision of technical assistance and training for MED.
Major Environnmental Issues: (describes major environmental issues identified or suspected in project)
The proposed Project has been placed in environmental screening category "B" consistent with the procedures of
World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment." It has been placed in this screening
category due to the fact that the project has either limited or no major adverse environmental impacts and
involves: (a) activities for pumping station reconstruction and rehabilitation; (b) routine monitoring measures for
maintenance of proper water quality; (c) special monitoring to minimize! risks in selected locations where
domestic and industrial wastewaters are discharged into some open drains; and (d) special support for
dissemination and application of guidelines for mixing stations.
Other Environmnental Issues: (describes environmental issues of lesser scope associated with project)
Given the focus on rehabilitation, the proposed Project would not require involuntary resettlement or result in
damage to archaeological and/or historical sites. All project-supported pumping station reconstruction and
rehabilitation actions would occur at existing sites and would be subject to a site specific environmental review
by MED as part of the design process, to minimize potential localized environmental impacts, avoid involuntary
resettlement and prevent damage to archaeological and historical sites. The Project would include the use of
archaeological "chance find procedures" in case buried archaeological materials are discovered during
reconstruction activities.

ProposedActions: (describes actions proposed to midigate environmental issues described in project)
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared for the project by MED and would facilitate
continued integration of environmental concerns into the operation of pumping and mixing stations in Egypt. The
EMP would support: (a) establishment of an Environmental Unit in MED; (b) environmental training for MED
staff at various levels; (c) use of site-specific environmental review procedures for pumping station
reconstruction and rehabilitation activities; (d) support for continued activities in water quality monitoring; and
(e) measures to apply water quality guidelines at mixing stations for the reuse of drainage effluent. The Water
Quality Monitoring Program would build upon activities funded under earlier phases of the project and include:
(i) establishment of a Steering Committee; (ii) continuation of current special monitoring activities in the North
Nile Delta and their extension to sites in the East End West Nile Delta; (iii) demonstration monitoring at selected
mixing stations in the East Nile Delta; and (f) preparation of a Monitoring Program for Middle and Upper
Egypt. The EMP would be included as a fully funded component of the proposed Project and would be
implemented by MED with the support of the Drainage Research Institute (DRI) and the recently established
Environmental and Climate Research Institute (ECRI). MED has completed the EMP and it includes an
implementation schedule and budget.
Justfication/Rationalefor Environmental Category: (reasons for environrental category selected & explanation of any changes from initial
classification)
The proposed Project would support activities which have a positive environmental effects. Potential adverse
impacts are restricted in their scope and can be effectively addressed through the use of an Environmental
Management Plan.
Status of Category A Environmental Assessmnent: (presents EA start-up date, EA first draft, and current status)
N/A
Remarks: (gives status of any other environmnental studies, lists local groups and local NGOs consulted, tells whether borrower has given permission to release
EA, etc.)
It should be noted that the proposed Project builds upon the environmental activities of the first and second
phases of the investment program, which were developed with support from the United States Environmental
Protection Agency.
