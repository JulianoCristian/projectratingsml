Its principal\n            objectives included the provision of quick disbursing\n            assistance for Tanzania's investment program and to\n            encourage the government to implement certain policy changes\n            of a longer term nature. The main conclusion of the audit\n            report is that the program loan achieved its immediate\n            objective of providing additional resources to Tanzania at a\n            time when the deterioration in its terms of trade, and the\n            drought, had subjected the economy to considerable pressure.\n            It thus contributed to the maintenance of investment and\n            growth by providing foreign exchange for essential imports\n            of capital equipment, intermediate goods and raw materials.\n            The program loan also enabled the Government to mobilize\n            other program assistance from bilateral sources. Its major\n            effect was thus in adding to the total of available\n            resource; it did not have any effect on the specific\n            composition of imports, nor was it intended to. The\n            arrangements regarding counterpart funds were implemented\n            but, since they were relatively small by comparison to the\n            development expenditure for which they were used, they had\n            no practical effect on the distribution of such expenditure.\n            The loan was made in support of agreed policies designed to\n            overcome Tanzania's balance of payments problem in the\n            medium term, particularly by directing public investment\n            towards the directly productive sectors of the economy, and\n            by taking measures to encourage agricultural production.\n            These objectives and measures were expressed in somewhat\n            general terms and hence the degree to which they have been\n            implemented and the progress which has been made towards the\n            achievement of their announced objectives are not subject to\n            precise assessment. The full results of the policies agreed\n            upon in connection with the program loan will only become\n            apparent in the longer run, and much will depend on the\n            extent and consistency with which they can be carried\n            through over the next few years."}, "docdt": "1976-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
