3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background
Poland committed to phase-out Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), with the signing oi the
Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol (MP) and their subsequent London, Copenhagen and
Montreal amendments. Poland qualified as an "Article 2" or "non-Article 5" developed country
under the MP. As such, Poland is not eligible for financial assistance from the Multilateral Fund
for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, but is eligible for Global Environment Facility
(GEF) financing. A Country Program (CP) for ODS Phaseout was prepared with the support of
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and Polish National Fund for Environmental Protection and
Water Management. Poland's annual ODS consumption among relevant user sectors as
documented in the CP: refrigeration: 47.7 percent (913.6 ODP tons); aerosols: 32.4 percent (621
ODP tons); foams: 10.8 percent (207 ODP tons); solvent: 1.9 percent (35.5 ODP tons); other: 7.2
percent (138 ODP tons); total: 100 percent (1,916 ODP tons). To help implement a program to
phase out the ODS consumption identified in the Country Program the Government of Poland
requested financial assistance in the form of grants from the GEF. The Bank, as an implementing
agency for GEF, assisted in the preparation and implementation of the ODS phase-out project
which comprised a number of sub-projects.
The key milestones of the project are presented below:

The main project objective was to assist Poland to effectively meet its obligations with respect to
phasing out ODS consumption under the Montreal Protocol, as amended and adjusted. The
design of the project and implementation arrangements took into account the grantee's capacity to
effectively execute the project. Technical Assistance was provided to ensure that the objectives of
the project were met. Also, sustainability of the investments was a significant factor in project
design considerations.

Objective
The objective of the project was to assist Poland in carrying out a Country Program to phase out
ODS consumption and enable existing users to shift to more ozone friendly technologies. In so
doing Poland would be helping to maintain the Earth's ozone shield that protects its inhabitants
from UVB sun radiation. This objective was to have been met by: (a) supporting priority
sub-projects identified in the Country Program for technology conversion to non-CFC materials;
(b) supporting the establishment of a nationwide network for CFC recovery, reclamation, and
recycling (3R) operations; and (c) improving the capacity of the Ministry of Environment to
manage and oversee the phaseout of ODS in Poland through institutional strengthening. If fully
implemented, the project would contribute to the direct phaseout of 914 tons/annum of ODP
consumption. Additional of 140 tons/annum of ODP through the 3R scheme and 150 tons/annum
of ODP through the conversion of a refrigerator compressor factory to non-ODS technology
would be indirectly phased out.
Currently, there is no consumption of CFC in the country, making Poland fully compliant with its
obligation regarding this substance, under the Montreal Protocol.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original project objective was not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The appraised project consisted of: (i) technology conversion and investment component (six
sub-projects in the refrigeration, foam and aerosol sectors); (ii) a recovery, reclamation and
recycling (3 R) component (one sub-project); and, (iii) an institutional strengthening and training
component (two sub-projects).
Technology Conversion and Investment Component
3  POLAR (Wroclaw) - Conversion from CFC-1 1/12 to cyclopentane/134a at the company's
refrigerator factory and establishment of CFC-12 recycle network. The sub-project consisted
of three parts: i) substitution of CFC-12 refrigerant with HFC-134a in two domestic
refrigerators production lines; ii) substitution of CFC- 11 foaming agent with cyclopentane in
the production of cabinets and doors for domestic refrigeration equipment; and iii)
development of a CFC-12 freon recycling network within POLAR's 190 service shops.
Implementation was expected to result in the elimination of annual consumption of 50 tons of
CFC-12 and 150 tons of CFC-1 1.
*  ZAMEX (Zagan) - Conversion from CFC-l 1 to cyclopentane foaming line for household
freezers in the production of rigid polyurethane foam freezer insulation aiming at replacing the
replacement of injection machines for suitable ones for use of cyclopentane. Implementation
was expected to eliminate annual consumption of 75 tons of CFC-1 1. CFC-12 refrigeration
had been phased out before.
-3 -



*  Inzynieria (Warsaw) - Elimination of CFC- I foaming agent in the production of rigid
polyurethane pipe insulation in the production of a range of molded rigid polyurethane foam
items, including insulated pipe liners through the conversion of CFC- 11 to water/CO2
technology by installing a new high pressure foam blowing machine and modifying molds.
The sub-project was expected to phase out 19 tons/annum of CFC-l 1, based on the 1995
consumption level. Until the completion of a technology change, the firm would continue
foaming with CFC-l 1, stockpiled prior to Poland's ODS phaseout deadline.
*  Metalplast (Oborniki) - Phaseout of CFC- 11 blowing agent in the production of thermal
insulation sandwich panels on two continuous laminator links and replace with n-pentane
foaming agent. Technology conversion was to have involved foaming line 1 and retrofitting
of line 2, including safety equipment to permit foaming with flammable n-pentane. The
implementation was expected to have resulted in an annual phaseout of 300 tons of ODP-
weighted consumption of CFC- 11.
*  POLFA  (Warsaw) - Conversion from CFC-111 and CFC-12 to hydrocarbon based
pharmaceutical propellant in the manufacture of dermatological antibiotic medications in
aerosol form. The sub-project implementation was to have phased out an annual consumption
of 320 tons of ODP, through refitting the pharmaceutical plant, filling the aerosol antibiotics
and corticoids to permnit the use of a non-ODS propellant mix. -- An Ozone Operations
Resource Group (OORG) review had been under way at appraisal and OORG approval -
based on the company's evidence of the feasibility of using hydrocarbon-based emulsion in an
aerosol. Satisfactory testing and the Ministry of Health's registration approval of the product,
as conditions of Sub-Grant Agreement signature, were obtained prior to disbursement.
*  EDA (Poniatowa) - Retooling of a domestic refrigerator compressor factory to produce
HFC-134a instead of CFC-12 and use of hermetic compressors for domestic refrigerators,
freezers and milk coolers through retrofitting the production line. Implementation was
expected to convert a production line for 500,000 units annually, with an indirect reduction of
150 tons of CFC-12 per year. -- The decision to produce HFC-134a compressors rather than
other non-ODS substitutes was dictated by the requirements of EDA's main customer,
POLAR (Wroclaw), which had previously opted for HFC-134a refrigerant technology.
Recovery, Reclaim and Recycle (3 R) Component
*  PrOzon (Warsaw) - Establishment and operation of a nationwide CFC-12 Recovery,
Reclamation and Recycle Network with PrOzon, a non-profit foundation for the protection
for the ozone layer, established by the two largest refrigerant gas distribution companies.
1600 was to have been equipped with recovery equipment (30% self financed and 70%
Sub-grant financed). A central CFC reclamation center and 17 collection/distribution depots
was to have been established. Under a sub-component refrigeration, servicemen would be
trained in CFC-12 conservation and HCF-134a services procedures by the Refrigeration
Center of Krakow (COCH). Annual potential recovery was estimated at 140 MT of ODS,
primarily R-12, which would be accounted as indirect phaseout of ODS.

Institutional Strengthening Component
*  State Fire Service Headquarters (Warsaw) - Training program for the use of non-halon
alternatives for fire protection. The objective was to organize and carry out two 3-day
training courses to train designers of fire protection systems, specialists in engineering
supervision and fire fighting engineers on alternatives to halon systems. A group of potential
instructors for future training courses was to have been selected from among the 60
participants. The Sub-project was to have been implemented by the State Fire Service
Headquarters in collaboration with the Science and Research Center for Fire Protection. Four
experts from the non-profit Halon Alternatives Research Corp. (USA) and two Polish experts
would conduct the courses and prepare a training manual.
* Institutional Strengthening of the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) and the Ozone
Layer Protection Unit (OLPU). - Assist IDA and OLPU to supervise Project
implementation. The IDA had been designated by the Ministry of Economy (MOE), to whom
it reports, as the implementing agency for the Project, housing the Project Management Unit.
The IDA was charged with coordinating project implementation, overseeing procurement and
disbursement and supervising all Project activities. The IDA staff was to be responsible for
Project administration, supplemented as required by technical, legal and financial experts. As
necessary, the OLPU would coordinate ODS phaseout policy, help identify technical
consultants to assist in project implementation supervision, and provide support to facilitate
cooperation among Government institutions and the consumers of ODS.
3.4 Revised Components:
With the exception of POLFA, EDAIMPW (now EKOPON) and PrOzon, no major re-design of
Sub-projects took place during the course of the Project and all other Sub-projects were
implemented essentially as designed. The changes on the above project components were as
follows:
* POLFA - Changes were made to the design of the POLFA Sub-project when the first OORG
review rejected the use HFC-134a as a medical aerosol propellant and the Bank's technical
expert recommended that HAP should be used instead. This change preceded the final
approval of this Sub-project and the signing of the Sub-grant Agreement.
* MPW/EKOPON - It was agreed that one piece of machinery would be modified instead of
replaced under the Sub-project as there was insufficient money in the budget to cover the cost
of a new machine. This was technically acceptable and agreed to fully by the Bank's technical
expert. This change did not in any way contribute to the other subsequent difficulties
experienced during the implementation of this Sub-project (see sections 4.1 and 5.1)
* PrOzon - The initial design of this sub project was based on the assumption that sales of
recovery machines to servicemen would cover the running costs of the organization managing
the project. This concept proved unworkable. When this became obvious in 1998, it was
agreed that some additional funds could be used under the Grant by PrOzon to cover initial
-5 -



incremental operating costs until the refrigerant recovery and reclaim got under way. This
enabled recovery machines to be distributed free of charge to technicians, provided they had
participated in the training courses organized under the Sub-project (COCH) and had
recovered 50 kg of refrigerant within three months. In the event more recovery machines than
originally anticipated were purchased and distributed, and more technicians received training.
These actions dramatically increased the participation rate of technicians in the 3 R scheme,
which has now become the Project's main success story (see Lessons Learned).
3.5 Quialitv at Enty:
The Project was not subject to a quality at entry review, therefore ratings or reporting on the
QAG process are not available.
There were no technical risks identified with the Project. There were no Project risks identified at
entry, since at the time of appraisal, the practice applied for the Czech, Hungarian and Slovenian
ODS Phaseout Project was followed, which did not envisage any financial sustainability or
bankruptcy problem and the legal documents did not include any clause for the occurrence of such
either. After the financial diagnostic of the enterprises had been done, the financial viability of the
selected ones was not considered to be a concern, macroeconomic conditions were good. Hence,
the subsequent bankruptcies of two participating enterprises, EDA/MPW/EKOPON (Sub-project
6) in January 2000 and Zamex (Sub-project 2) in October 2000 were not foreseen or envisaged at
entry.
Implementation Assessment
At first, procurement procedures and contracts were challenging for the PMU and the
participating enterprises. The PMU, IDA and OLPU say today that Bank procurement training for
the PMU and the participating enterprises at entry was insufficient, therefore contributing to
delays in the procurement process during implementation. Often "ad hoc" procurement and
project  management  "training"  had  to  be  provided  by  the  Bank  during
supervision/implementation. The Bank's decision to allow Polish Commercial Practices to be used
as the main procurement procedure under the Project speeded up the process and was especially
useful for the PrOzon Sub-project. At the start-up phase, the preparation and signatures of all the
Sub-grant Agreements (SGAs) and the Project Administration Agreement took a very long time,
in spite of the fact that local lawyers were hired under the Grant by the PMU for legal advice and
the preparation of these Agreements. The reasons for the delay were: difficulties with getting final
agreement of some enterprises on Bank procedures and conditions like auditing; some provisions
of the SGAs were not fully in line with Polish law; and some other enterprises intended to get
through the SGA negotiations more advantageous financial conditions at the end.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The objectives of the Project have been fully achieved. At completion, all enterprises under the
Project have successfully converted to non-ODS technologies and, except for EKOPON and
-6 -



Zamex, are meeting the non-ODS technology production demand for the market. --The
undisbursed balance under the grant was SDR 14,083.42 on May 18 which could be disbursed
during the grace period for disbursements by August 31 2001 for eligible expenses done and
submitted before the closing date.-- Therefore, the ICR rates the Project as being satisfactorily
implemented. Explanation of this rating is presented below.
Achievement of the Country Program Objectives
With assistance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Polish National Fund for Environmental Protection
and Water Management, Poland prepared a Country Program for ODS phaseout strategy. The
Country Program included key policy actions and proposed a phaseout of 1916 ODP tons of ODS
as described in Annexes A and B of the Montreal Protocol and based on 1994 consumption levels,
through the implementation of identified priority investments in the main sectors of aerosols,
foaming, solvents and refrigeration. Other enterprises did not participate in the GEF Project, as
they had phased out CFCs before the end of 1995 using their own financial resources. In the
solvent and aerosol sectors (excluding medical aerosols) elimination of CFCs had been completed
even earlier. In the refrigeration sector, non-ODS use (HFC-134a as refrigerant and cyclopentane
as foaming agent) technologies had been implemented at most of the enterprises prior to the
Project. Enterprises whose shift to non-ODS technologies involved the highest investment costs
became part of the GEF Project. As of the date of this ICR, the target of phasing out all the 1916
ODP tons has been fully met. GEF support was critical in achieving this goal.
Achievement of Project Objectives
The specific objectives of the Project were to contribute to the overall Country Program for
targets ODS phase-out by phasing out 914 t/y ODP consumption or 47% of the 1994 (base year)
total. Additionally, 140 ODP tons consumption by the refrigeration servicing sector was to be
phased out indirectly through establishment of the 3 R scheme, and another 150 ODP tons phased
out indirectly through the conversion of a compressor plant to non-ODS technology.
All three of these targets were achieved and, thus the Project's objective has been fully met
(Section 4.2.). In addition, the GEF Grant financed the technology conversion that allowed
participating enterprises to meet international standards and retain their domestic and export
markets; -- except for EDA/MPW and Zamex Companies, which went bankrupt (details and
related future operations are described in the next two paragraphs). -- Thus, the Project
contributed to global efforts to protect the Ozone Shield and helped Poland meet its obligations
under the Montreal Protocol and its amendments.
In the case of EDA/MPW, a new company EKOPON was established to take over its operations
in August 2000 by IDA, Poland's restructuring agency with the support of MOE. As IDA is the
owner of EKOPON, the Board of IDA brought decisions first on April 27, 2001 to award a loan
of US$ 700,000 for five years with two years grace period for investment purposes (buying the
necessary buildings, premises, old equipment from the two bankrupt companies, EDA and
Compressors Works, and for the rehabilitation and modernization of related infrastructure) and on
-7 -



May 10 2001 to increase the equity of EKOPON by PLN 1 million needed for the working
capital. Thus the equity of EKOPON amounts 1.83 million PLN. As planned today EKOPON
could begin full operation with the new equipment financed under the GEF grant in
August/September 2001. It is still hoped that the new company will gradually gain back its
market. About 60,000 units would be produced until end of 2001 and the company could reach
the break-even point during next year and become profitable in two years time according to
EKOPON's Business Plan of February 2001. The prospects are good that the equipment financed
by CGEF will be in full operation in fall 2001.
In October 2000, the Zamex Company domestic refrigeration producer in Zagan too went
bankrupt after one and half years' production of about 50,000 units with the new equipment. The
main reasons were the loss of markets in the East due to financial crisis and increased competition
among producers. The small company lost almost seven million PLN in 1999. A restructuring
effort in 2000 proved to be insufficient to save the company. Two tenders for the privatization of
the company were launched at end last year but were unsuccessful. Today the Receiver in
Bankruptcy, under the supervision of the Judge-Commissioner is responsible for selling the
enterprise primarily as a whole. The Ministry of Economy is doing its best to assist the Receiver
to find an investor who will put the equipment purchased under the Grant and the factory back
into operations. Three bidding processes have been done for selling the company as a whole, the
fourth one to sell the production line, as a whole will take place at end of June 2001. The
Receiver is in negotiations with a potential Polish investor, difficult to judge, but it is likely that
the equipment funded by the Grant will be in operation again.
Environmental Concerns
There were no major environmental concerns associated with the installation or operation of
non-ODS technologies and the Bank classified the Project as a category B, requiring limited
environmental analysis. Only modest environmental risks were associated with the use of
cyclopentane, a flammable substance in the foam sector. In order to mitigate and manage these
risks, all Sub-projects followed industrial safety guidelines. In addition, Environmental Impact
Assessments, including health and safety plans, were carried out for all Sub-projects in accordance
with the Polish Environmental Protection Act. Environmental and safety permits had to be
obtained by all the Sub-project enterprises prior to the start of operations with the new equipment
and technologies.
Legal and Regulatory Framework Development
The key policy elements of the phaseout strategy and domestic legislation that have been
implemented during the Project Period, with some impetus from the institutional strengthening
components, are as follows:
*  From 1992 through 1996: Government Decrees banned the use of halons in new equipment
and ships; introduced mandatory authority permits related to the imports and exports of all
ODS; banned trading in ODS with countries that are non-parties to the MP; banned imports of
products and equipment containing ODS from countries that are non-parties to the MP;
* In 1997: a Government Decree stipulated that CFCs be treated as hazardous wastes;
- 8 -



*  In 1997: a Government Decree banned products and equipment that contain CFCs, HCFCs
and halons from being placed on the Polish market;
*  In 2001: a Waste Management Act was passed by the Parliament, which qualifies existing
ODS in old appliances for recovery, reclamation and recycling purposes as non-hazardous
wastes; this Act thus ensures operation of the many cylinder depots and the reclamation center
are not subject to several strict restrictions.
*  January 2001: a new Act on ODS Management has been drafted and would soon be passed
by the Parliament and in force from July 1, 2002. This Act declares venting of CFCs to be an
illegal activity and sets high penalties. Back-up regulations of this Act to allow for the proper
monitoring and enforcement of this legislation, have also been drafted by the relevant
minstries.
* Currently a Product Fee Law is under preparation. Products containing HCFCs will be subject
to the Law, but not HFCs or HCs.
Relation to 3R Component
When implemented, both the Waste and the ODS Management Acts as well as the Product Fee
Law, will make sustainable operation of 3 R scheme by making venting ODS illegal, the "green
cards" for refrigeration servicemen compulsory, create proper penalties, and a framework for
enforcement, ensure that ODSs reclamation forrns would not be treated as hazardous waste and
allow central payments for the storage and incineration of non-reclaimable CFCs.
The current system of ODS Monitoring and in Poland has been built on the one established
already in 1994. It is in harmony with the European Union relevant directives. The Ozone Layer
Protection Unit (OLPU) in the Industrial Chemistry Research Institute in Warsaw had a key role
in the design and establishment of the ODS Monitoring System, which operates effectively today
in Poland.
Public Awareness Raising Campaign
A Public Awareness Raising Campaign under the umbrella of the ProCountry Agency and a well
know popular person, Mr. Korneliusz Pacuda, was completed. An impact assessment by the
Impact Assessment Commnittee of independent experts and NGO (,,Green Mazovia") found the
campaign to have been very successful. Extensive activities aimed at disseminating information on
the ozone shield protection and on the use of the "Green Cards", was carried out through: the
production and distribution of various kind of leaflets, design of film scenarios, organization of
concerts and seminars, interviews, publications, advertisements, TV programs, design of PrOzon'
s web-page, distributing video-films to schools, CDs on the 3R scheme for enterprises and to
NGOs for educational, knowledge management and environmental awareness raising purposes.
This campaign was not originally part of the Project but was added in 1999 when it became clear
that the sustainable operations of the 3R scheme needs support from the public. Also other
countries' experiences proved the usefulness of environmental awareness raising to effectively
achieve the objectives of the project.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
An economic analysis was not performed, since it would have been difficult to quantify the
- 10-



environmental benefits of each sub-project. The project clearly has global environmental benefits
since it contributed to preventing depletion of the earth's ozone layer. The thinning of the earth's
ozone layer has been linked to the global wanning, leading to a wide range of adverse
environmental effects.
Cost-effectiveness criteria of the Montreal Protocol were applied to the technology conversion
Sub-Project reduction process, with a view toward achieving the most appropriate targeting of
GEF funds. The approved and actual cost-effectiveness for each Sub-Project is shown below. The
actual cost of phase-out per unit ODP ton ($6.44/kg) was in line with the estimated cost
($6.80/kg). -- In comparison to other countries' actual cost-effectiveness figures (Bulgaria:
$26.51/kg; Hungary $6.24/kg; Czech Republic: $0.98/kg; and Slovenia: $15.88/kg) the Polish
project performance regarding cost-effectiveness was good, only the Czech project was much
more cost-effective. -- The right column below indicates the MP thresholds for the relevant ODS
phaseout sub-sector to be applied for the specific participating enterprise to show that each
sub-project was implemented a very cost-effective manner, well below or just around the
threshold figure.

4.4 Finiancial rate ofreturn:
Not applicable. A financial analysis for the project was not performed. However, an enterprise
financial viability analysis was carried out during preparation to determine the prospects of each
enterprise's remaining in business. The Bank, having a fiduciary responsibility towards the GEF,
performed this analysis to ensure that the Grant was being allocated to enterprises that had
prospects to survive in the transitional economy of Poland. The financial position of the
enterprises were reported on a quarterly basis throughout the project implementation period by
the local Bank acting as financial intermediary for the project. Except for EKOPON and Zamex,
the enterprises that have received the GEF Grant are in business today and with the technology
conversion are showing prospects of growth.
4.5 Institirtional development impact:
The project had a significant institutional development impact. In the public sector, creation of
the Ozone Layer Protection Unit (OLPU) and ODS Monitoring System was instrumental in
building capacity to develop and implement the policies required to switch to non-ODS
technology in the country. The change in technology has been complete and Poland is fully
meeting the requirements of the Montreal Protocol. In addition, the technical assistance provided
to PrOzon and COCH has helped to develop capacity to operate the 3 R scheme and train so far
almost 2000 refrigeration technicians in the use of non-ODS substance and upon successful
completion of the training receive the "Green card", which will become compulsory from July 1,
2002.
In the private sector, the project helped the enterprises meet the demand of ODS free products
both in the domestic and the export markets. Through the project, officials in the beneficiary
enterprises became fully acquainted with modem technology that does not use ODS. This has
helped the enterprises to remain competitive. The Bank's procurement procedures also helped the
enterprises appreciate the benefits of transparent and competitive bidding procedures.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factol s outside the control oJ govenm-7ent or im0plemeniting agency:
While the Project objectives were fully met, there were delays in implementation. The Grant
Agreement between Poland and the Bank became effective in June 1997, and the Project was
initially expected to be closed on December 31, 1998. However, the Grant was extended three
times, the first extension was provided until June 30, 2000, the second, until October 31, 2000
and the third, until April 30, 2001. The main reasons for the delay were the start-up phase
difficulties with the recipient enterprises to enter in agreement as required under the Grant and the
bankruptcy of EDA/MPW  which involved social issues and job losses in a highly depressed
region.
Macroeconomic Conditions
In the past decade Poland has been one of the most successful transition countries. The 1998
Russian crisis involving other former soviet countries had a significant impact on the
manufacturing and trade sectors, yet the economy overall continued to grow. Two companies
EDA/MPW and Zamex under the Project, however, lost their former CMEA markets primarily
due to this crisis and its deflationary impact and finally went Bankrupt. -- In case of EDA/MPW,
in an anyway depressed region where company turnaround and restructuring is more difficult, also
the dragging on restructuring of the holding company at its subsidiaries delayed procurement and
the implementation of the Sub-project. Probably, if the Sub-project had been completed well
before the 1998 financial crises when also the competition in the compressor markets for ozone
friendly appliances was not so strong, the company could have established a good market and
continued sustainable operations. Also in case of Zamex, the stronger competition worldwide, in
- 14 -



Europe as well as in Poland contributed to the difficulties in sales. -- Enterprise restructuring and
privatization has been accelerated by the Government. The Industrial Development Agency, the
Government's specialized entity for restructuring and privatization saved the viable activities,
including compressor production using GEF funded equipment, by establishing a new company
EKOPON in mid 2000. Since 1991, Poland has been an Associate Member of the EU. A National
Program is under implementation for the adoption of the EU legislation and directives, and
screening their compliance. Negotiations commenced in 1998 and encompass 31 areas, of which
harmonization with environmental directives is of high priority. Though significant progress has
been made to improve the quality of the environment, significant investment is still needed
especially in the areas of wastewater treatment and air pollution, as well as institutional
development to strengthen environmental management.
Financial Intermediary
Citibank Warsaw was the financial intermediary throughout the whole Project. The Suppliers as
well as the PMU, IDA experienced some delays in handling and clearing invoices.
Procurement
The PMU, IDA and some participating enterprises found the Bank's Procurement procedures at
times too troublesome, in spite of the fact that most of the procurement was made under Polish
Commercial Practices procedures. More Bank procurement training before implementation
started would have been useful.
Project Management Reporting and Auditing
The quarterly PMRs and annual audit requirements of participating enterprises and the Project
accounts were not always submitted in a timely manner and of good quality; some delays
occurred. The Project audit of 1999, prepared by Deloitte and Touche, had to be redone and
reissued to the Bank to meet formal requirements.
5.2 Factors generallv subject to government control:
The Government properly supported the Project and accomplished its tasks through the
development and introduction of suitable legislation and policy measures to meet the requirements
of the Montreal Protocol (details in Section 4. 1.).
5.3 Factors generally suibject to implementing agencl control:
Project Management
The Implementing Agency (IDA) assigned by the Recipient (MOE) was responsible for
monitoring Sub-project implementation activities, procurement management and approval process
for reporting and auditing, and for coordinating activities and information among all parties,
- 15 -



including Suppliers, participating entities and the Bank. At times IDA did not perform in a
proactive, preventative or constructive manner. Occasionally IDA was rather passive than active
and relied upon the Bank to resolve project imnplementation, suppliers' problems related to the
bankruptcies, or other delays and to bring involved parties together to find the way of how to
proceed (PrOzon and MPW). PMU staffing was at times inadequate; two professionals were
absent for health reasons for considerable (several months) periods, and no replacement was
provided by IDA for the PMU manager, who worked on this Project only part time. Requests
for Grant extensions, and the reallocation of the proceeds of the Grant were properly handled by
the PMU, as a result, all the Sub-projects were fully completed and Project objectives met.
The GEF Grant disbursements are shown below as an index of project progress during the
implementation period.
Period              Percent of Grant Disbursed   Cumulative Percent Disbursed
July 1, '97 to June 30, '98           0,07                       0,07
July I, '98 to June 30,'99           31,42                       31,49
July 1, '99 to June 30, '00          25,67                       57,16
July 1, '00 to June 30, '01          42,84                      100,00
5.4 Costs and financinig:
At appraisal the estimated total project cost was US$ 20.167 million, with incremental costs of
US$ 10.428 million. The financing plan was that the GEF Grant would provide US$ 6.214 million
while the enterprises would contribute US$ 13.953 million. The GEF Grant was awarded to
finance only items and activities included in the Indicative List of Eligible Incremental Costs
adopted by the Meeting Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The GEF Grant was denominated in
SDR (SDR 4.4 million corresponding to US$ 6.214 million) while the expenditures were mainly
in US$ or DEM. Due to the fluctuating exchange rates, at project closing, the US$ dollar
equivalent of the utilized GEF Grant was US$ 5.8 million. Details of the actual expenditures are
presented below.
Consistent with the November 1994 GEF guidelines used to develop this project, expenditures
incurred by enterprises after October 31, 1993 and before the date of Grant signing were eligible
for retroactive financing. Retroactive financing was provided for two projects: Sub-Project No.
1. Polar for an amount of US $ 529,000; and Sub-Project No. 4. Metalplast for an amount of US

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The Project is sustainable for the following reasons:
*  the policies required for Poland to meet the Montreal Protocol requirements are in place and
these policy measures are being introduced and enforced by the Government.
*  the domestic and export markets of the participating enterprises require the use of non-ODS
substances. As a result, all the enterprises participating in the Project, -- except for Zamex and
EKOPON, which are today not in operation, -- make the best use of the technology
-18 -



conversion implemented under the Grant and strive to remain competitive and expand their
businesses as possible.
*  from a global environmental sustainability perspective, the alternative substances introduced
as substitutes of CFCs are approved by the Montreal Protocol. From safety aspect, any fire or
explosive hazard due to the use of cyclopentane as foaming agent is minimized by the safety
audits and the rigorous, even more than the EU, Polish safety regulations. All new
installations that have been made so far, have received the environmental, fire protection and
labor safety permits as required by Polish law.
*  the public awareness raising campaign carried out under the Project and the Country Program
made relevant strata of the society aware of the benefits of the use of ozone friendly
technologies, the vital importance of the Ozone Shield and how everybody can/must
contribute to its protection.  Specifically, public pressure and demand will ensure that
enterprises do not use and vent deliberately ODS. The campaign  also helped the
understanding of the public of other global environmental issues, especially the climate
change.
*  The 3 R scheme initially seems to operate well in spite of not having had all the enabling
legislation in place. It allows for the recovery, reclamation and recycling not only of CFCs,
but also HCFCs and HFCs. This is beneficial to the environment and in the EU accession
process.
-  the training and certification program provided to almost 2,000 refrigeration technicians to
date has allowed the service sector to handle existing ODS in hermetically closed system and
repair old appliances for longer duration, and to move towards non-ODS equipment use.
6.2 T7ransition arrangement to regular operations:
The Country Program and Project objectives have fully been met and the technology conversion
has been completed as required by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. However, since
Poland is a EU pre-accession country, remaining ODSs (HCFCs and Methyl Bromide) according
to the schedules agreed with the EU will need to be phased out. A demonstration project on
Methyl Bromide alternatives financed in the framework of a UNEP/GEF Project for Central and
Eastern European countries is presently carried out in Poland. No follow-up project or support of
the Bank is required.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. I Lending:
The Bank was the Implementing Agency on behalf the GEF to administer the Grant Project and
was requested by the Government of Poland to assist in the preparation of the Project. The
Bank's experience in managing projects worldwide as well as its accumulated knowledge of good
practices was useful during preparation and implementation. While the Project was prepared in 13
months time, the Board approved it 11 months after appraisal. The implementation period was
underestimated at appraisal, but the fact has to be mentioned that the second and third closing
date extension was required because of the originally not foreseen bankruptcy of EDA/MPW. At
appraisal a financial viability analysis of all the enterprises with the potential to participate in the
-19-



Project was carried out. All the selected ones were found to be financially viable and sustainable.
Based on the Bank's practice in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia, the Grant Agreement
did not include any stipulation for the possible case of bankruptcy, also since the macroeconomic
conditions were very good at lending. This practice was followed also in case of the Polish
project. Later, other ODS Phaseout Projects in the region did actually anticipate the bankruptcy
problem and the below grant agreement clause was included:
"... a commitment by the Beneficiary, imnpending insolvency or discontinuation of activities, to
make arrangements with the Implementing Agency to ensure that equipment and materials
included in the sub-project and financed wholly or partly from the proceeds of the GEF Trust
Fund Grant shall continue to be utilized for purposes consistent with the objectives of the
Project."
This clause proved to be useful e.g. in case of the restructuring of one ODS phaseout project in
the region. Including this clause in the Grant Agreement for the Polish project might have urged
the Recipient to try to protect the interest of the GEF funds use, i.e. that equipment funded by the
GEF should be in operation in a sustainable manner during a reasonable lifetime of the equipment,
through trying to be more active in monitoring each sub-project also from financial viability
aspects and consider possible support to the enterprises, which were lacking modem management
techniques and staff. However as it looks today, both the EKOPON and Zamex equipment
supplied under the Grant will be in operation.
On the other hand, including such legal language in the GEF grant agreements might put
responsibilities on governments for which they can't be responsible. The GEF accepted private
enterprises, legally separate from the government, as the ultimate grant recipients after a careful
financial viability analysis and selection process at appraisal, thus taking a chance that some of
these enterprises won't be around at the end of the project. And just because GEF funds were
used, GEF should not give the Ministry of Economy any special right to control the equipment
financed under the grant when private enterprises were chosen to receive it. Rather enterprise
bankruptcy should be governed by bankruptcy rules, and the government should have to deal
within that framework. The point should be that GEF needs to take responsibility for choosing the
enterprises, and run the risk that equipment financed may go to a company that files for
bankruptcy, and in which case bankruptcy rules should be followed without any special privileges.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's support was necessary throughout the whole implementation period especially in the
following cases:
In April 99 when several problems culminated regarding the PrOzon Sub-project: PrOzon's
Manager resigned, its founders became keen to get rid of any liabilities regarding the operation of
the reclamation plant, since they didn't see how it could be operated without financial losses and
lack of proper legal regulatory framework and enforcement of legislation. The Bank promoted
proper communication, drafted a solution that was attractive to all stakeholders and urged the
Government for proper legislation making.
- 20 -



Mid 2000 the Bank helped again to convince the Government of Poland to speed up the
introduction of the necessary legislation for more stringent control including the banning of
venting of refrigerants exempt the recovered ODS from being treated as hazardous waste if they
are stored or transported for the purpose of further reclaim (cleaning).
The Bank has provided intensive support to the PMU since early 1999, when the MPW went
bankrupt. The issue was how to hive off the compressor production activity of the bankrupt
company that formed the GEF Sub-project in such a way that the implementation of the
Sub-project can continue and be completed with full success with the provisions of long term
sustainable operation and use of the equipment procured under the Grant. The Bank supported
the preparation of a comprehensive business plan, based on the findings and recommendations of
which, the Ministry of Economy could initiate with IDA the establishment of a new company. In
the transition period IDA informally and temporarily suspended payments to Suppliers, therefore
the Bank had to respond to and coordinate with complaining suppliers.
The Bank initiated and supported international workshops in Hungary, Slovenia and the Czech
Republic, which proved to be useful also for the Polish parties. Elements from legislation related
to the 3R scheme like the introduction of the "green card" for servicemen was adopted from the
Hungarian experience. Also learning from other countries' lessons, bad practices could be
avoided, which were useful regarding the operations of the 3R scheme and the public awareness
raising campaign.
7.3 Overall BankLperformance:
The Bank's performance was satisfactory. The project team was particularly helpful in assisting
the participating enterprises in designing technical solutions for phasing out ODS and in working
with Government to resolve issues associated with the bankruptcies of two participating firms.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The OLPU, the activities of which were financed by the Ministry of Economy and Ministry of
Environment, played a key and constructive role in the preparation of the Project and also in
developing the new legislation dealing with ODS.
7.5 Government implementtation performance:
The Borrower's performance was overall satisfactory. Despite some delays, the Borrower was
committed to the Project objective and to phasing out ozone depleting substances. Government
took seriously its obligations under the Montreal Protocol, passed appropriate legislation, and
adequately managed the project.
When the problems regarding the bankruptcies had surfaced, the MOE tried to help find a
solution for MPW and approved that IDA would establish a new company, EKOPON. Also
MOE informed Zamex's Receiver to handle the equipment funded by the Grant with special care.
- 21 -



7.6 Implementing Agency:
The overall Implementing Agency performance would be rated as marginally satisfactory, if there
were such rating in the ICR form, for reasons mentioned in sections 5.3 and 7.6. Overall the
PMU, IDA met its obligations under the Project Administration Agreement, but often with delay
and in a reactive manner trying to do "fire-fighting" rather than professional project management.
Participating enterprises, stakeholders of issues, suppliers and sometimes the Bank were not
properly informed in a timely manner. At times the PMU, IDA performance was close to being
unsatisfactory. IDA established a new company, EKOPON to save the MPW Sub-project. Also
IDA supervised the new management of EKOPON and injected own funds both as debt and
equity in EKOPON, thus enabling the new company to start operations. IDA's technical and legal
consultants made a considerable input to assist in the implementation of the Project. The overall
rating of the Implementing Agency as satisfactory (in Annex 6) took some consideration, but
since ultimately all actions needed were done, even if with delays, proved by the successful
achievement of the Project objectives, the consideration of the rating as unsatisfactory for the
Implementing Agency performance, was dropped.
7.7 Overall Borrowerperfol7nance:
The overall grant recipient performance was rated as satisfactory, since the Project met its
development objectives well, all ODS were phased out. The staff and the consultants of IDA and
OLPU were professionals, however IDA commitment to the success of the Project was not at all
times high enough. The performance of the participating enterprises was generally good. Excellent
management of the Polfa sub-project should be highlighted here.
8. Lessons Learned
The lessons learnt are elaborated below in Italics:
More careful selection of enterprises at appraisal from financial viability and sustainability
aspects
Difficult to anticipate the bankruptcy problem also at company level.
Even if the country's macroeconomics and financial situation is stable, thus country risks are low,
companies participating in the project can go bankrupt for unforeseeable reasons at appraisal,
when the financial viability of the participating enterprises is considered.
Environmental Public Awareness Raising Campaign should be part of such projects
Environmental projects, especially the ones that serve global environmental protection with
lesser local than global benefits and introduce new technologies, servicing activities and
market products, can only be successful with the support of the public, to which proper
understanding of the issues and how protection can be made is inevitable.
A public awareness raising campaign (PARC) was not originally part of the Project. Based on the
good practices of other countries' similar projects, the Bank supported the PrOzon initiative. The
-22-



carried out campaign proved to be inevitable for the operation of the 3 R scheme.
Utilize well-known relevant personalities and NGOs for Public Awareness Raising
Involve well-known, popular people and NGOs in the campaign, since they cost- and
time-effectively disseminate information.
The public always likes to listen to their favorites, and NGOs can easily, effectively and in a
convincing manner can reach the public, especially youth and local communities.
Environmental labeling and financial incentives are useful in the market
Companies' management require good, up-to-date marketing andfinancing skills in a more and
more competitive environment.
The small private company Inzynieria (Warsaw) that converted its technology from CFC-l 
blowing agent in the production of rigid polyurethane pipe insulation introduced "environmental
labeling" of their products. Inzynieria applied for an environmental credit line at the Polish Bank
for Environmental Protection (BOS). BOS provided the credit line to the buyers of Inzynieria -
small credits with lower than market interest rate, only 10 percent for the double positive
environmental impact of the Inzynieria products, for the ozone friendly and lower energy use,
reduction of GHG emissions. This credit is given to the companies, which have taken the decision
to cooperate with Inzynieria in the frame of changing the insulation of the pipes. The credit covers
the costs of the following: delivery of the new insulation, removal of the old insulation including
its possible recycling, the anti-corrosive protection of the pipes, and the installation of the new
insulation. The reduction of energy use for the pipes equipped with new insulation produced by
Inzynieria are 50% lower than the standard Polish. As a result their sales went up, current demand
for their products is higher than their production capacity.
Technical Assistance in Sub Project Design
Companies require real technical assistance when preparing sub-projects to other reliable cost
estimates.
From 1998 onwards, the Project provided regular technical supervision by a refrigeration expert.
Prior to that little specialist expert assistance was provided to either refrigeration sub-sector
enterprises, or those in other sub-sectors, such as foam. Three companies were surprised by the
extent of re-equipment required to implement their respective non-ODS technologies. Zamex had
underestimated the number of new molds required to convert its freezers to cyclopentane blown
foam and Inzynieria had not realized that much larger molds for pipe sections would be required
for implementing C02 foam. Metalplast had not realized that mechanical cooling would be
required for the n-pentane storage area, that a special panel saw would be required, or that the
metal adhesion properties of the new foam would require a special technique to maintain product
quality. Since project funding levels had effectively been capped by the MP cost effectiveness
threshold levels, better awareness of the cost implications of the new technology would have
- 23 -



helped these enterprises plan their counterpart funding more efficiently. Zamex' recent bankruptcy
cannot be blamed on the ODS Project, its need to find extra finance during a difficult period could
not have been helped. Both Metalplast and Inzynieria survived and report improving business.
POLFA could have received more funding including the new packaging equipment. Also they had
not anticipated the need for a facility to destroy rejected aerosol cans.
Effective Project Monitoring and Management.
It is important to choose the right PMU and enable it to concentrate fully on Project supervision.
The Bank was informed too late of financial problems experienced by two sub projects during
implementation. They were informed in January 2001 that in October 2000 Zamex had filed for
bankruptcy in the local court. At the end of January 2000 news of EKOPON's imminent
bankruptcy was suddenly communicated to the Bank, whereas the Project Progress Report for
end December 1999 gave a clear picture of "business as usual". This was too late for contracts to
be canceled without heavy damages being claimed by suppliers and has involved lengthy and
expensive efforts by both the Bank and the PMU to avoid an embarrassing situation from
developing.
Drawing a clear lesson from these failings is not straightforward. The fact is that the PMU was
only able to devote about half its time to ODS Project supervision. The Polish PMU is unusual in
that it is located within the IDA and run by its staff, something that ought to make them
particularly skillful in monitoring the financial performance of companies under their care. Perhaps
a more rigorous financial evaluation should have been carried out before GEF approval was
sought, however, the shock of the Russia crisis and subsequent devaluation were hard to
anticipate. At the same time the IDA staff will continue their jobs after the project is closed, thus
preserving the project files and institutional capacity to implement other such projects in future
(such as under POP's) should there be a role for Government to sponsor them.
The Success of the PrOzon 3R Sub project
Refrigerant Recovery and Reclaim will be practical and profitable, even when CFCs run out.
Legal certification for mechanics is not a pre-requisite for a successful scheme.
The present success of PrOzon was not anticipated in 1998 when the two main private refrigerant
distributors, the founders of the non-profit entity, expressed misgivings to the Bank mission
about whether the 3 R scheme could ever work. The Grant funded also the supply of the recovery
machines for the refrigeration servicemen so that they can safely, without the risk of venting, can
recover CFCs from the existing industrial and household appliances and submit the gases for
reclamation. The initial design of this sub project was based on the assumption that sales of
recovery machines to servicemen would cover the running costs of the organization managing the
project. This concept proved unworkable. When this became obvious in 1998, the Bank agreed
that some additional funds could be used under the Grant by PrOzon to cover initial incremental
operating costs until the refrigerant recovery and reclaim got under way. This enabled recovery
machines to be distributed free of charge to technicians, provided they had participated in the
- 24 -



environmental training courses (in CFC-12 conservation and HCF-134a services procedures)
organized by the Refrigeration Center of Krakow and meet the following conditions. Upon
successful pass of the exam at end of the course, the servicemen can get the recovery unit -- free
of charge in case they can deliver 50 kg of CFC within three months to the reclaim plant or the
cylinder depots, if not so they pay a lease fee of about USD 30 semi-annually. Also, servicemen,
who successfully pass the course, receive the "Green card", which will become compulsory from
July 1, 2002. In the event more recovery machines than originally anticipated were purchased and
distributed, and more technicians received training. These actions dramatically increased the
participation rate of technicians in the 3 R scheme. So far 1,840 servicemen have been trained
and COCH training courses are today over-subscribed. By March 2001 a total of nearly 31 tons
of refrigerant had been recovered. This comprises 14.5 tons of CFC-12 and 11, 5.5 tons of
HCFC-22, over 7 tons of HFC-134a and small but significant quantities of blends R-404a, R-409a
and R-406a in little over a year, fully vindicating the original support of this Sub-project. As yet,
there is no legal requirement for refrigeration technicians to have received refrigerant recovery
training, but such legislation under the ODS Management Act will be passed shortly. Technician
compliance has been achieved solely through the PARC, and awareness initiatives targeted
specifically at technicians. The idea that the public should demand that any technician should
possess a "Green Card" was successfully promoted through the PARC.
The lessons that can be drawn are (i) that it is both practical and profitable to recover and reclaim
HCFC and HFC refrigerants and bends, and that as CFCs are phased this contributes crucially to
the sustainability of 3 R schemes (ii) that training and awareness initiatives play a key role in the
success of a 3 R scheme, both in providing technical knowledge and sensitizing technicians to
environmental issues (iii) that recovery must be made financially attractive to technicians to enable
it to be successful (iv) that specific legal requirements for technicians to be trained in recovery and
reclaim techniques is not pre-requisite, but supports to have a successful scheme.
The Polish scheme joins the Hungarian, Belarus and Slovenian schemes as examples for other
countries preparing similar sub-projects. It differs from these in that it works through the
distribution network of companies selling refrigerant rather than refrigeration service companies
and offers a new model for designing a successful scheme.
