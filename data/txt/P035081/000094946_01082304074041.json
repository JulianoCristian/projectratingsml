Lessons reinforce the\n            validity in carefully selecting the participating\n            enterprises, based on strong financial viability, and\n            sustainability, at appraisal time, to avoid unforeseen\n            bankruptcy problems. Global environmental protection\n            projects in particular, due to their servicing, and\n            marketing nature, require specific public awareness, so that\n            issues involved are publicly understood on how protection\n            should be implemented. Furthermore, private companies that\n            convert technologies, e.g., from chlorofluorocarbon, to the\n            production of rigid polyurethane pipe insulation, should\n            consider the introduction of environmental labeling on their\n            products, through appropriate marketing, and financing\n            techniques to be more competitive. And it is important to\n            apply technical assistance in the preparation of\n            subprojects, to avoid surprises on the extent of\n            re-equipment needed, or technical issues required to\n            implement the respective technology transfer, under reliable\n            cost-effectiveness. Finally, project monitoring and\n            management should consider a more rigorous financial\n            evaluation, particularly, the financial evaluation\n            performance of participating companies, to avoid not only\n            bankruptcy problems, but cost overruns, specifically under\n            financial crisis and subsequent devaluation circumstances."}, "docdt": "2001-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
