There are four project components. First,\n            capacity strengthening of key stakeholders is to reinforce\n            the capacity of the government sector (state and municipal\n            governments) and non-governmental sector (nongovernmental\n            organizations and local consulting firms) to prepare and\n            evaluate the various TIPPEE (labor-based public works to be\n            contracted out to small- and medium-sized enterprises\n            [SMEs]) operations. This component will provide training to\n            key stakeholders for the use of such a methodology. Second,\n            pilot community-based infrastructure schemes will provide a\n            test for the TIPPEE approach in four under-serviced\n            neighborhoods in Libreville, Port-Gentil, and Franceville.\n            It will include road paving, preparation of community-based\n            development plans, and developing neighborhood amenities.\n            Third, project monitoring and evaluation will develop an\n            evaluation methodology for assessing socio-economic and\n            environmental impacts and a management system for the TIPPEE\n            contracts. Fourth, support for a longer-term program of\n            institutional reforms will prepare the institutional\n            framework for sustained development of local SME firms\n            specializing in construction and public works."}, "docdt": "1998-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
