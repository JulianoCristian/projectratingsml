development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            the project showed that in spite of identification of\n            capacity gaps in the BNC (Bureau National de Coordination -\n            National Coordination Office), Local Governments (LGs),\n            NIGETIP (Agence Nigerienne de Travaux d'Interet Public\n            pour l'Emploi - Niger Public Works and Employment\n            Creation Agency), and the construction industry in general,\n            and inclusion of substantial capacity building activities,\n            the starting point is very low and the project was\n            vulnerable to institutional and organizational changes. The\n            link between the operation and the project context\n            determines how far reforms can be pushed; care should be\n            taken not to lose momentum. Delegated contract management\n            has the potential to mitigate capacity shortcomings in\n            project implementation, but the approach needs to be\n            institutionalized and scaled up to succeed. The contractual\n            approach to results through city contracts is useful but its\n            full potential as a tool for public participation and\n            accountability of local governments should be developed.\n            Attention needs to be paid up-front to Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) aspects and early warning systems."}, "docdt": "2013-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
