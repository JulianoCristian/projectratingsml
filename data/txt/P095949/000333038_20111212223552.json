The changes are (i) reduction of the scope of\n            the Project in order to enable the Recipient to carry out\n            within the original timeframe activities under the Project\n            which better reflect the Government's current strategy;\n            (ii) as result of the above, reduction of the amount of the\n            financing, the cancelled amount being made available to the\n            Government for the financing of other development needs;\n            (iii) modification of the implementation arrangements; and\n            (iv) revision of key performance indicators. These changes\n            were the result of prior discussions between the Bank's\n            regional senior management and the Government of Niger to\n            improve performance of the project which was confirmed as\n            relevant. They were also aimed at taking account of new\n            development needs as identified by the new authorities for\n            rapid and tangible impacts after the recent political\n            transition. These changes were further confirmed during the\n            project Mid-Term Review (MTR) held in June 2011."}, "docdt": "2011-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
