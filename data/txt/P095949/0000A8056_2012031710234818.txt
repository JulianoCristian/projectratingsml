                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following project mid-term review (MTR) held in June 2011, the project restructuring was completed on December 28, 2011 with the signing of the Amendment to the Financing
                         Agreement by the Government of Niger. The aim of the restructuring is to improving performance in project implementation and in achievement of the PDO. Project restructuring has
                         resulted in (i) reduction of project scope (in terms of original costs) to enable carrying out activities which better reflect the Government's current strategy within the original timeframe
                         (project closing maintained on January 15, 2013); (ii) as a result, reduction of the amount of the financing from SDR18.3m to SDR14.4m; (iii) modification of project implementation
                         arrangements; and (iv) revision of key performance indicators.

                         All changes foreseen as part of project restructuring have been put in place, including with regard to project implementation arrangements. All three new experts (procurement,
                         support to local governments and M&E) expected for the project coordination unit are in place as well as the new project coordinator and a part-time consultant to support on
                         safeguards issues. NIGETIP has hired the two engineers identified for following up on trunk infrastructure works in Niamey and Maradi respectively. Finally, the steering committee

                         has been streamlined and the oversight ministry has been fulfilling more effectively its function, including through periodic visits of works sites. Hence, project implementation has
                         accelerated since MTR. Its disbursement rate has increased from 21% July 2011 to 33% in January 2012. So far, project implementation has resulted in targets achieved by about (i)
                         100% in terms of people provided with improved water sources; (ii) 80% in terms of people provided with improved drainage; (iii) 78% in terms of people provided with improved
                         sanitation; and (iv) 13% in terms of people provided with access to all-season roads. The bulk of ongoing works relate to trunk infrastructure (Niamey East-West road and Maradi
                         market) accounting for about 50% of total investments. Road works in Niamey are at 35% implementation rate while the works for the Maradi market are at their beginning. All works
                         are expected to be completed by end-September 2012.
