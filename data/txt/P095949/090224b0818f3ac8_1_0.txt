                         The project development objective is to increase and sustain access of urban residents to basic infrastructure and services, particularly those living in deprived

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR to provide an update on project implementation progress following the last implementation support mission from November 4 to 10, 2012.

                         Following the implementation of priority actions identified as result of project restructuring in December 2011 and subsequent implementation support missions , the project has
                         progressed relatively well towards its development objectives. Project implementation has gradually improved since its restructuring by focusing on a limited number of priority
                         activities that could be implemented during the remainder of project lifetime and through improved project management by the PIU. Reflecting this improvement, disbursements went

                         At the strategic level, the project has contributed to improve access for people in project areas to diverse infrastructure services, including to all-season roads (100% of target), to
                         drainage (100% of target) and to improved water sources facilities (100% of target) and sanitation facilities (100% of target). Systems to operate the central market of Maradi as well

                         as for the market and truck terminal of Dosso are yet to be put in place. For Maradi, the study for the system to operate the market is at its final stage and will not in all likelihood be in
                         place by project closing. In the meantime, an interim administration for the market was put in place in June 2012. The mission informed the client that failing to have these systems
                         put in place as planned will negatively impact on overall performance in PDO achievement. It is worth signaling significant strengthening of municipalities, where skills in planning and
                         implementation of small investments as well as in programming, funding and implementation of maintenance activities have improved over time despite repeated institutional
                         instability experienced at local level in Niger since project start.

                         The project has completed other strategic achievements, which were retained as triggers to project MTR i.e. (i) a draft law on public contract management and delegation (maitrise
                         d'ouvrage publique); (ii) a framework proposal for providing assistance to urban local governments; and (iii) a mechanism proposal for mobilizing and transferring financial resources
                         to municipalities. All over its period of implementation, the project has remained relevant for both the national urban development strategy and the Bank's CAS. This was already
                         confirmed during the project MTR held in June 2011 and further in the project restructuring paper completed in December 2011.

                         The project has provided a unique opportunity for learning to improve some urban development practices in Niger cities. For example an important workshop was held in Tillabery
                         after the mission (November 14 & 15, 2012), to discuss the challenges experienced under the project and then contribute with appropriate recommendations for the future.

                         In the perspective of project closing, the economic and social impact assessment of project outcomes was ongoing during November 2012. Its output will serve as basis for the
                         government to craft its own project implementation completion report (ICR).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission confirmed project closing on January 15, 2013 by which date all activities need to be fully implemented to be eligible to IDA payments. As per IDA requirements, a grace
                         period will be granted from January 16 up to May 14, 2013 to allow for payment of all outputs which would have been delivered by project closing. In the meantime, the Bank will
                         continue to closely support project implementing entities for effective implementation of the action plan agreed on.
