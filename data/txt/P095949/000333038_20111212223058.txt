                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY
1.      The proposed changes are (i) reduction of the scope of the Project in order to
enable the Recipient to carry out within the original timeframe activities under the Project
which better reflect the Government’s current strategy; (ii) as result of the above,
reduction of the amount of the financing, the cancelled amount being made available to
the Government for the financing of other development needs; (iii) modification of the
implementation arrangements; and (iv) revision of key performance indicators. These
changes were the result of prior discussions between the Bank’s regional senior
management and the Government of Niger to improve performance of the project which
was confirmed as relevant. They were also aimed at taking account of new development
needs as identified by the new authorities for rapid and tangible impacts after the recent
political transition. These changes were further confirmed during the project Mid-Term
Review (MTR) held in June 2011.



PROJECT STATUS
2.      Since effectiveness on December 15, 2008, the project has only reached a
disbursement rate of about 22% with about 15 months left to closing. Nevertheless,
despite this slow implementation pace, it must be noted that the project has resulted in a
higher overall level of competence of local governments resulting in the completion of all
first phase investments under these municipalities’ direct responsibility. The project has
specifically contributed to the strengthened capacity for annual programming, budgeting
and implementation of maintenance activities, as reflected in the achievement of all
relevant targets. Moreover, the completion of two strategic studies have resulted in the
preparation of (i) the draft of a new law on public contract management and delegation;
and (ii) a proposal for a framework for implementing decentralized urban development
interventions, including financial transfers and mechanisms to access such funding.

3.     At the same time, as a result of constant efforts in support of NIGETIP - the
delegated management agency responsible for 85% of the investments under the project -
the project commitment rate has drastically increased over the last few months from
about 30% in December 2010 to 56% in late September 2011.

4.      Despite these encouraging outcomes, the MTR concluded that the project would
unlikely achieve its development objectives (PDO) by the project closing date as a result
of some systemic institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints. While the mid-term
review mission of June 2011 concluded that the PDO remained relevant it proposed the
restructuring of the project to increase its implementation effectiveness while taking into

                                             4
account a prior agreement between the Government and the Bank (during a May 2011
mission by regional senior management) to not extend the project closing date. On the
basis of these parameters, the main proposals for project restructuring are (i) a priority
program defined to align the project scope to the existing capacities for further
implementation1; (ii) the modification of the implementation arrangements to further
clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various institutions involved in the project; and
(iii) the revision of key performance indicators based on the experience and the priorities
confirmed. One of the immediate expectations of the Government from the proposed
changes is the re-affectation of any cancelled amount from this project to the financing of
other projects in the country.


PROPOSED CHANGES
5.    The changes indicated above are detailed in this section; they serve as the basis to
amend the project Financial Agreement and align it with the agreed revised provisions for
improving the implementation effectiveness.

    • Reduced project scope
6.      The Project restructuring will preserve all project components, but result in
overall reduction of project scope (in terms of original costs) by about 21% for meeting
the agreements, as highlighted above, between the government and the Bank’s
management to drop activities unlikely to be completed before the project closing date
and affect the corresponding funds to other development needs. The changes proposed
have resulted in a reduction of project activities by 28.6% for Component A (capacity
building) and 7.6% for Component B (municipal investments in Niamey, Maradi and
Dosso). Changes to the Component C (project management, monitoring and evaluation)
remain minor with no substantial impact on project scope.

7.      Component A will retain activities in (i) support to local authorities: (ii) support
to central government entities; and (iii) support to the private sector. The reduction of the
component’s scope has been primarily the result of cancellation of seven activities out of
about 30 initially planned. The activities proposed to be dropped were either already
implemented through other funding or found no more relevant for the project because of
an evolving context.

8.      With regard to Component B, priority investment programs will be maintained in
all three project cities (Niamey, Maradi and Dosso) but with changes in activities scope
and reduction by about 85% of the overall physical and financial contingencies amount
for investments. In Niamey, the investments to be maintained will primarily consist of
roads rehabilitation, but with a reduction of the length of roads to be rehabilitated from 17
to 11.56 kilometers. Drainage works and schools rehabilitation sub-projects will also be
preserved in Niamey, while activities initially planned for construction or rehabilitation

1
 During the May 2011 mission by Bank management, it was agreed that, because of the impossibility of
completing works in the remaining project life, substantial share of investments will be dropped, including
about 32% of roads rehabilitation in Niamey and the trucks terminal of Maradi. At the same time, it was
agreed to give priority to the Maradi’s central market, which the government was willing to bring at a level
of national priority.
                                                     5
of health centers and diverse administration buildings are proposed to be dropped. With
regard to Maradi, the small infrastructure planned to improve livelihood in low-income
settlements will be retained while the envelope for the rehabilitation of Maradi’s central
market will be increased and the construction of a trucks terminal dropped. For Dosso, no
substantial change has been proposed in the scope of the investments initially planned
which will remain focused on the rehabilitation of two markets, the construction of a
trucks terminal, and investments to improve livelihood in low-income settlements
through works in drainage, standpipes and public latrines.

    • Results/indicators
9.      These changes will lead to the revision of the target values for the specific PDO
and the intermediate outcome indicators. Moreover, the indicator initially set to measure
fees expected by municipalities from markets and truck terminals upon rehabilitation of
these infrastructures has been dropped, the main reason being lack of time to complete
the works scheduled and perform collection of such fees before the project closing date.
Instead, a new outcome indicator for the setting up of effective management systems for
markets and truck terminal has been proposed. Furthermore, these systems will help
contribute to the improvement of municipal fees collection and overall management of
the assets with a clear expected impact on local economic development. The end-of-
project outcomes - as they will be actually achieved - will now be measured against the
revised target values.

    • Safeguards
10.    The current MS rating for safeguards was found to be the result of limited ability
to manage the environmental and social impacts of project implementation. A consultant
will be hired to support the BNC in monitoring and reporting on the implementation of
the environmental and social aspects of the project to assure full compliance with
safeguards requirements.

    • Institutional arrangements
11.      The proposed changes in the institutional arrangements are intended to strengthen
project coordination capacity and improve its implementation effectiveness. They involve
clarification in the roles and assignments as well as capacity strengthening for key
institutional stakeholders, including the oversight ministry, the Ministry of Urban
Development, Housing and Sanitation (Ministère de l’Urbanisme, du Logement et de
l’Assainissement - MULA); the Steering Committee; the local governments for Niamey,
Maradi and Dosso; the project coordination unit (Bureau National de Coordination -
BNC) and the public works delegation agency of Niger (Agence Nigérienne de Travaux
d’Intérêt Public - NIGETIP).

Role of the Government
12.      The MULA will be directly responsible for project implementation in place and
lieu of the Office of the Prime minister that has been so far the project oversight
institution. In particular, the MULA will be responsible for overall project coordination,
supervision and M&E and will be relying on the Steering Committee (SC), as
strengthened, for fulfilling its core mandate. The BNC, now under the oversight of the
MULA, will be ensuring that the project delivers results of a high quality.

                                            6
13.     The SC will continue to have the following principal functions: (a) provide the
project with overall guidance; (b) facilitate coordination of project operations; (c) ensure
coherence between the project and other GoN and donor-supported programs in the urban
and local government sectors, and (d) approve the annual action plans, budgets and
reports to be consolidated and submitted by the BNC. As a result of the project MTR, the
composition of the SC will be revised to focus on administration entities at central and
local levels with actual potential to contribute to the improvement of project
implementation effectiveness. This revision has taken into account the need to preserve
the authority of the SC’s chair by removing from the committee’s membership
representatives from the Office of the Prime minister and the Presidency respectively.
The details on these arrangements are given in the Arrêté No 0107/MUL/A/PDIL signed
by the oversight minister on August 9, 2011 to define the institutional framework for
project implementation.

14.     The BNC will plan project activities for approval by the SC and will further
coordinate for timely and effective implementation of all project activities either by self,
through the communes or other selected partners (by delegation or outsourcing).
Specifically, the BNC will ensure that: (a) all other project activities are undertaken on a
timely basis; (b) external audits are carried out on a timely basis; and (c) project
implementation completion report is delivered on due time. The BNC will also be
directly responsible for fiduciary aspects of the project, for consolidating the annual
programs in consultation with the targeted local governments and other stakeholders, for
preparing the quarterly implementation reports, and for liaising with IDA and other
development partners. The BNC will ensure that social and environmental safeguards are
put in place and properly operationalized. The BNC’s staffing will be reorganized as
agreed during MTR with the creation of additional positions( M&E specialist and
technical capacity support specialist), the recruitment of a dedicated coordinator for the
project – hence no more sharing of the same coordinator with the existing PAPST
(Project in support of the transport sector program) - as well as the replacement of the
procurement specialist who resigned during the project MTR and dropping of the
infrastructure specialist position that was assessed as no more relevant.. The financial
management and procurement positions will remain shared between the present project
and the PAPST.

15.      In addition to the overall project implementation on behalf of the MULA, the
BNC will be responsible for implementation of project Component A (capacity building)
and Component C (support to implementation, monitoring and evaluation). Studies and
technical assistance under Components A and C will be contracted out to consultants,
with the responsibility for technical oversight and implementation of action plans clearly
left to the relevant ministries or entities.

Role of the urban local governments
16.     The three cities targeted by the project will be maintained and their respective
local governments will continue to play a major role in the implementation of Component
B (municipal investments for the cities of Niamey, Maradi and Dosso) in terms of
programming, implementation, management, and maintenance of investments. The
ongoing contractual agreements (Contrats de ville) will be updated and signed between
the MULA and the following local authorities: (i) for Niamey, the Mayor of the Ville de
                                             7
Niamey; (ii) for Maradi, the Mayor of the Ville de Maradi; and (iii) for Dosso, the Mayor
of the Commune urbaine de Dosso. The contracts will set forth the details of the
investment and capacity building programs, the mutual obligations for their effective
implementation, as well as the continued efforts for further improving local governments’
overall performance. They will be approved by the SC before their signing by parties. To
consolidate the capacity gains so far achieved by these urban local governments, a
specific technical assistance program – tailored to the needs of each local government -
will be put in place, and implemented under the responsibility of the BNC in the
remaining implementation period.

17.     To continue coping with the risks associated with procurement activities while
meeting the needs for consolidating local capacities, the urban local governments will
continue to be responsible for direct procurement up to the already applied ceiling of
US$250,000 for Niamey and Maradi, and US$150,000 for Dosso. Operations above these
ceilings will continue to be procured and implemented through NIGETIP which
benefitted from strengthening over the project implementation period prior to MTR.
NIGETIP has agreed to take additional measures to improve its capabilities, including
the hiring of experienced engineers for effective supervision and follow-up of
infrastructure works as agreed on during project MTR.

    o Cancellations
18.      Project restructuring will result in the reduction of project scope by about US$6.3
million, mainly because of the dropping of part of roads investments in Niamey and
cancellation by about 85% of the overall physical and financial contingencies amount for
investments. The level of reduction of project scope was determined from the priority
activities as confirmed at project MTR and based on the likelihood of having their
implementation fully completed before the project closing date of January 15, 2013.
