                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The mid-term review (MTR) was held in a context of continued progress with a project commitment rate standing at 51% as of June 15, 2011. The large mobilization of project
                         stakeholders for the MTR showed evidence of continued relevance of the project in an evolving decentralization context which recently led the cities of Niamey and Maradi to become
                         new urban local governments.

                         Based on the assessment made available from the preparatory work for the MTR and the opening messages from the oversight Minister and the Bank's Country Manager in Niger at

                         the mission workshop the MTR resulted in the confirmation of the project development objectives and components and the definition of a priority program to be implemented before
                         project closing for an amount of US$23.7 million. This leaves about US$6.3 million, out of the total project amount of US$30 million, to become available for other development needs.

                         This will give the basis for project restructuring with as the following characteristics (i) overall decrease in project scope by 21% even with the city of Maradi recording an increase of
                         29.6% as a national priority given to the rehabilitation of its central market; (ii) the implementation of a second tranche of small local investments under the direct responsibility of
                         municipalities to consolidate the outcomes from a first tranche completed by the MTR; and (iii) increased accountability of project stakeholders in fulfilling their respective mandates
                         for timely and effective implementation of the project as restructured.
