                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following project restructuring completed in late 2011, project implementation performance has continued to improve over the period under review. To date, implementation progress
                         has already resulted in targets achieved by at least (i) 100% in terms of target population (all 3,010 expected) provided with improved water sources; (ii) 100% in terms of population
                         (all 11,254 expected) provided with improved drainage; (iii) 100% in terms of population (all 60,862 expected) provided with access to all-season roads; and (iv) 80% in terms of
                         population provided with improved sanitation (end of project target: 3250 people). This is the result of the construction of (i) 14 water points; (ii) 3.46Km drains; (iii) 13.82 Km roads
                         respectively. With regard to sanitation, the remainder of investments has experienced delays because of constraints in making available the expected sites for construction. The

                         outcomes relating to commercial infrastructure in terms of "effective management system established to operate markets and truck terminals upon rehabilitation/ construction under
                         the project" are not yet achieved. The study for establishing a management system for the Maradi central market is underway and is expected to be completed by early November
                         2012. Overall, the project disbursement rate has increased from 44% in March 2012 (including impact of reduction of project financing amount) to 71% in October 2012.

                         The bulk of ongoing investments relate to commercial infrastructure i.e. the central market of Maradi, the central market & small market of Dosso as well as the trucks terminal of
                         Dosso. These investments are expected to result in the creation/ improvement of about 3,924 stands in markets and parking places in the trucks terminal. The last Bank mission
                         identified needs for improving level of service for some of these infrastructures, including the central market of Maradi and the trucks terminal of Dosso. Amendments to a few works
                         contracts were hence recommended. Based on those amendments, all works are now expected to be completed by end-November 2012.
