INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRBCTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR A RICE PROCESSING
AND STORAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines in an amount in various currencies
equivalent to $14.3 million.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In October 1968, the Government of the Philippines forwarded to
the Bank a project proposal prepared by the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP) for the financing of grain processing and storage
facilities. The project proposal drew heavily on the findings of a
grain marketing and storage study financed by the United States Agency
for International Development. The Bank's economic report of May 24,
1968 had recognized the need for additional rice processing and storage
facilities in the Philippines.
3.        The project was appraised in April 1969, but further processing
of the loan was suspended until the introduction of legislation which
would have, inter alia, enabled the Government to relend the proceeds
of foreign loans to the private sector and would have authorized the
President to waive existing laws in the Philippines which did not conform
to the Bank's international competitive bidding procedures for the pro-
curement of goods to be financed with the proceeds of the proposed loan.
A Bank mission visited the Philippines in February-March 1970 to discuss
the effects of the pending legislation on the project.
)I.       Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in
July 1970. The Government was represented by Dr. Placido Mapa, then
Director General of the Presidential Economic Staff; DBP by Mr. Joaquin
Gochoco, Manager, Economic Research Department and Mr. Jesus Avancena,
Chief Legal Counsel. Following negotiations, a Bank mission visited the
Philippines in August 1970 to update project cost estimates and financial
projections with particular reference to the effects of the de facto
devaluation which resulted from the exchange reform adopted on February
21, 1970. The legislation mentioned above was signed in November 1970
becoming Republic Act No. 6142 after various amendments had been intro-
duced during its passage through Congress. Following further discussions
in Manila in December and in Washington in January this year final agree-
ment on the loan documents which take into account the effects of these
amendments was reached earlier this month.
5.        If approved, the proposed loan would be the fourteenth in the
'hilippines and would increase the total amount lent to $231.0 million,
net of cancellations. The proposed loan would be the fifth loan for
agriculture and the first for grain processing. The following is a

6.        Although project implementation in the public sector has been
gradually improving there remain problems of execution in several Bank
projects. Disbursement under two Bank loans has been adversely affected
by the February exchange reform. Sub-loan commitments under the Second
Rural Credit Project (Loan 607-PH) have been made at only about 20 per-
cent of the estimated rate due mainly to the uncertainties created for
farmers by the floating rate of exchange and the increase in the cost of
imported equipment. The Government is currently making a thorough review
of the project and a Bank mission is to go to the Philippines this
spring to examine further the effects of the exchange reform on the
financial position of farmers and to consider possible adjustments in the
project. The demand for industrial loans has also been affected by
fluctuations of the exchange rate in 1970 resulting in the slow disburse-
ment of the Bank's third loan (Loan No. 630-PH) to the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP). With regard to the Bataan Power
Project (Loan No. 491-PH), initial disbursements were slower than expected



due to delays in the award of equipment contracts but project construc-
tion is now proceeding satisfactorily. The financial position of the
borrower, the National Power Corporation, has been affected by increased
costs of debt service following the de facto devaluation and by delays
in raising tariffs. A rate increase has now been approved by the Govern-
ment and the effects of this on NPC's finances are currently the subject
of a Bank review. Although only $600,000 had been disbursed on the Upper
Pampanga Irrigation Project (Loan No. 637-PH) as of December 31, good
progress has been made in implementing the project and disbursements are
expected to accelerate with the recent award of the contract for dam-
construction.
7.        No IDA credits have been made to the Philippines.   IFC has made
5 commitments in the Philippines totalling $24.2 million, of which IFC
now holds, net of participations, sales and cancellations, $14.6 million.
In addition, IFC's Board of Directors approved on January 5, 1971 a loan
of $6.2 million and an equity investment of $1.8 million for the Philippine
Petroleum Corporation.
8.        A highway project requiring a loan of approximately $8 million
has been appraised and should be ready for the consideration of the
Executive Directors in the spring of 1971. Further Bank loans for power,
agriculture and education are under consideration for FT 1972.

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       An appraisal report entitled "Rice Processing Project - Philippines"
(PA-47a) on the proposed project is attached.
11.       Agriculture is the largest sector in the Philippine economy
generating about one-third of gross national product, accounting for 80
percent of export earnings and providing employment to over half of the
labor force. Rice is the staple diet of the Philippines and rice production
takes up almost 40 percent of the total area under cultivation. In the
six years prior to 1967, rice production increased at an annual rate of
about 1.5 percent, and the Philippines relied on substantial rice imports.
In 1967/68, rice production increased by about 11 percent following a
concerted government effort towards successful development and cultivation
of high yielding varieties. Drought affected rice production in 1968/69;
but the momentum has been regained and the Philippines is very near self-
sufficiency for the first time in the post war period.
12.       The breakthrough in rice production has created serious bottle-
necks in the marketing system. Lack of mechanical drying equipment is
hindering efficient processing of paddy varieties maturing in the wet
season, and traditional milling and handling techniques are proving
inadequate for handling commercial flows in major producing areas.
Finally, inadequate storage facilities contribute to relatively high
spoilage losses and to instability in producer prices.
13.       The proposed project would provide long-term credit to the
private sector for setting up modern integrated rice processing units
in major producing areas. Processing capacity created by the project
is expected to be distributed among 6 large units and 60 small units.
In total, the proposed project is expected to provide mechanical drying
capacity of about 225 tons/hour, modern milling capacity of about 60
tons/hour, bulk storage capacity of about 150,000 tons, warehouse capa-
city of about 24,000 tons and other required ancillary equipment and
facilities. Project capacity is expected to be located mainly in the
highly productive paddy growing regions of Central Luzon.



14.       The Bank loan of $14.3 million would cover the foreign exchange
component of the project, estimated at 68% of total project cost ($20.9
million equivalent). The legislation referred to in paragraph 4 does not
authorize the Government to channel the proceeds of foreign borrowings to the
private sector except through a government-controlled institution. The pro-
posed loan would therefore be made to the Government which would relend the
proceeds to DBP under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The interest rate and
repayment terms of the subsidiary loan would be the same as the Bank loan
except that the Government would bear the foreign exchange risk. Agreement
has been reached with the Government and DBP on the text of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement.
15.       DBP would make sub-loans from the proceeds of the Bank loan to
the private sector covering the foreign exchange cost of sub-projects.
DBP would, at the same time, provide finance from its own resources for
part of the local currency costs of sub-projects and meet the local cur-
rency costs of project administration.    The percentage of DBP's contribu-
tion to each sub-project would vary depending on the foreign exchange
component of the sub-project and the contribution made by the beneficiary,
but DBP's share of project financing is expected to amount to about 11
percent of total project costs. In addition, DBP would be obligated to
finance, where necessary, the working capital requirements of beneficiaries
on terms not less favorable than those which it extends to its other
clients for such purposes.   The remainder of project costs would come
from beneficiaries' contributions expected to amount to 21 percent of
project costs.   The size of the contribution is reasonable given the
financial capabilities of sub-borrowers expected to participate in the
project.
16.       DBP, a Government owned institution, has total resources of
F2,740 million (US $457 million), making it the largest development bank
in the Philippines and an important channel of finance for agriculture
and industry.   While its financial position, as described in paragraph
4.02 and in Annex 8 of the Appraisal Report, is such that the Bank would
not consider making a direct loan to the institution, it has the technical
competence to administer the project.    It has a professional staff of over
1,200 including more than 350 agriculturalists and engineers. It also
has prior experience in financing rice processing facilities and, with
the assistance of consultants, its staff would be able to handle the
appraisal and loan administration of the proposed sub-projects.    DBP
would be required to establish and maintain a special project account
through which all project funds would flow and would be restricted to
investing solely in Government securities any repayments on Bank-financed
sub-loans which are not currently required for servicing the debt on the
subsidiary loan or for meeting the costs of project administration.
17.       To strengthen further DBP's capacity to administer the project,
a special grain processing section is being established in the Office of
DBP's Chairman to implement the project; before the loan becomes effective,
consultants acceptable to the Bank, would be appointed to assist the
Section.   The appointment of the Head of the section, who is a qualified
senior officer of DBP, has been made after consultation with the Bank.



- 6 -
Most of the professional staff are expected to come from DBP' s Invest-
ment Banking Department which has developed appropriate appraisal and
supervision procedures for industrial lending.    Furthermore, all sub-
loans under the project exceeding $250,000 would be subject to the prior
approval of the Bank.    These arrangements would provide DBP with suffi-
cient technical assistance and supervision to carry out the project
effectively.
18.       Training would be required to provide beneficiaries' managerial,
technical and operating personnel with the skills that would enable them
to operate project facilities efficiently and for this reason it would be
a condition of effectiveness of this loan that the Government make
adequate arrangements for training beneficiaries' personnel at the Univer-
sity of the Philippines College of Agriculture at Los Banos.    It is expected
that this training would be provided under a UNDP-financed grain industries
training program which would begin operation this spring and for which the
FAO would be the Executing Agency.
19.       Beneficiaries would repay their sub-loans to DBP at 11 percent
interest over 14 years after approximately one year of grace to permit
construction to be carried out. The interest rate would allow satisfactory
incentives for beneficiaries to participate in the project and would leave
DBP with a spread of 3-3/4 percent on Bank funds, which would be an ade-
quate margin to meet administrative costs and reserves for bad debts. It
is expected that the Bank loan would be disbursed in 3 years but an addi-
tional year has been allowed for possible setbacks or delays.     Given the
proposed lending terms to the beneficiaries a term of 19 years including
4 years of grace would be appropriate for both the Bank loan and the
subsidiary loan.
20.       DBP would be responsible for the procurement of goods required
by sub-borrowers and all equipment and civil works contracts in excess
of $60,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding.   DBP, acting on behalf of beneficiaries, would re-
quest bids based on suitable bulking of approved sub-projects, 15 to 30
at a time.   Local manufacturers bidding on equipment contracts would be
allowed a preference of 15 percent or the level of custom duties which-
ever is lower.   The Bank loan would finance 100 percent of the cost of
imported equipment, materials and supplies financed under sub-loans. In
the event of a domestic manufacturer winning equipment contracts, the
Bank would finance 60 percent of the costs of such contracts, which would
represent the estimated foreign exchange component.   In addition the Bank
loan would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultants
and 50 percent of the cost of civil works contracts.    If foreign exchange
costs prove to be less than expected, it is proposed to increase the
number of facilities to be financed under the project.
21.       When all facilities are constructed, project processors would
handle about 480,000 tons of paddy per year producing 322,000 tons of
milled rice having a value, based on projected world market prices, of
between $30 and $40 million.    The estimated economic rate of return would



- 7 -
be about 25 percent.   Financial rates of return to the miller are 19 per-
cent for investment in a small facility and 24 percent for investment in
a large facility. While it is not clear at this time what par value will
eventually be agreed with the IMF (the peso has been trading at between
F5.80 and P6.43 to US $1.00), the appraisal report is based on a rate
of F6.o to a dollar.   Sensitivity analysis shows that possible de-
viations in the exchange rate from this assumed par value within the
range of likely alternatives (US$1 = F5.5 and US$1 = P6.5), have minor
effects on financial and economic rates of return and that returns would
remain satisfactory under the alternative assumptions considered. In
addition to providing an adequate return to project beneficiaries the project
is expected to lead to an increase in farmers' income, amounting to about
US$2 million annually.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
22.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III
Section IV(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
23.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions normally used for
agricultural credit projects.   A Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory
to the Bank, would be entered into between the Borrower and DBP and the
execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement is a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed loan.   The Operating Policies and Procedures governing
the onlending of the proceeds of the Loan are set forth in Schedule 5 to
the draft Loan Agreement.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
2h.       An economic report, "The Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of the Philippines" (No. EAP-16a, dated August 10, 1970), was
distributed to the Executive Directors on August 29, 1970.    This report
formed the basis of discussions at a meeting convened by the Bank in Paris
last October to consider the establishment of a Consultative Group for
the Philippines. The consensus of this meeting was that impressive efforts
had been made towards restoring financial stability to the Philippine
economy and that its long term growth prospects were favorable.
25.       An IMF mission is currently visiting the Philippines to discuss
progress under the Standby Agreement of February 1970 and to consider the
further requirements of monetary and fiscal policy for the year ahead.
Financial improvement, following the de facto devaluation of February 1970
and other stabilization measures has been satisfactory.    The external
situation was markedly better in the first 11 months of 1970; export
earnings reached a level of 20 percent above the 1969 mark, imports
were reduced and the trade deficit dropped from $263 million in 1969 to
only $5 million.   The Government has been successful in rescheduling
claims by European and US commercial baniks amounting to $227 million,



- 8 -
but debt service is nevertheless a heavy burden for the next few years.
It amouited to 33 percent of' exports in 1970.  I-However, with the imriproved
trade position, the Philippines was able to meet this debt service and
at the same time raise the level of international reserve:s by K6Y uidLlion
(October 1969 to October 1970).
26.       The need f'or effective management of the external debt has
recently received legislative recognition with the incorporation in
Republic Act No. 611h2 of a debt limitation clause.  This stipulates that
in contracting external debt the Government should ensure that the result-
ing debt service on both public and private debt should not exceed 20
percent of the average of the foreign exchange receipts for the three years
preceding the year in which the debt is incurred. This legislation should
help to keep the Pnilippines debt service ratios within manageable limits
in future years.   It also emphasizes the need for the Philippines to
mobilize a larger share of their resource requirements internally, and to
secure more advantageous repayments terms on its f'oreign borrowings.
Provided suitable grace periods are negotiated, the Philippines has room
to incur additional long-term debt on conventional terms within the ceilings
of this new legislation.
27.       The Philippines can also be considered creditworthy for substantial
additional borrowing . The present debt service difficulties should be out
of the way by the mid-1970's with a debt service ratio down to around the
15 percent level by 1976 or 1977.   Potentials and prospects for further
economic development and export growth justify substantial additional foreign
borrowing.   Growth of the econorm has been curbed in the past year by the
severe pinch of stabilization and debt service requirements.   However, the
longer term growth record of the Philippines has been reasonably favorable
and can be expected to be so in the future, given the substantial resources
of the country, its dynamic private sector, and the public development ef'fort
to which the Government is now comitted.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMIMENDATION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
