The\n            objective of the project is to assist the Government of the\n            Philippines in carrying out a program of modernization of\n            Philippines processing industry. The project is intended to\n            add to the country's milling capacity, to reduce grain\n            spoilage, and to increase the efficiency of grain\n            processing. The need for improvement in grain processing and\n            marketing has long been recognized. Although most or the\n            processing and storage facilities are in need of repair,\n            replacement or modernization, private investment in this\n            sector has been hindered by lack of credit on suitable terms\n            and inadequate training of plant operators. The scope for\n            investment in modern facilities in this sector was limited\n            until the mid-1960's, when new nigh yielding varieties\n            were introduced. As originally conceived the project was to\n            finance new construction of six large and 30 smaller\n            integrated modern rice processing plants, and modernization\n            of 30 existing mills. These mills then would have a combined\n            capacity of mechanically drying 225 tons per hour, milling\n            60 tons of paddies per hour, bulk storing about 150,000 tons\n            (static), and sack storing a further 24,000 tons. The\n            project provides funds to be relent through the Development\n            Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to private millers and\n            traders. Sub-loans to beneficiaries carry 12 percent annual\n            interest and run for 14 years, including about one\n            year's grace. Estimated total project cost was $21.0\n            million, including contingencies, of which $14.3 million (68\n            percent) will be provided by the Bank, $2.2 million (11\n            percent) by DBP, and $4.4 million (21 percent) by the beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "1974-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
