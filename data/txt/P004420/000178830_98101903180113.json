the project is expected to be\n            distributed among 6 large units and 60 small units. In\n            total, the proposed project is expected to provide\n            mechanical drying capacity of about 225 tons/hour, modern\n            milling capacity of about 60 tons/hour, bulk storage\n            capacity of about 150,000 tons, warehouse capacity of about\n            24,000 tons and other required ancillary equipment and\n            facilities.
