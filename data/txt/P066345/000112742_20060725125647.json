"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Energy, Water, and\n            Sanitation Sector Reform Technical Assistance Project in\n            Mauritania was unsatisfactory with an unlikely\n            sustainability.  The institutional development impact was\n            moderate with unsatisfactory performances by both the Bank\n            and Borrower. Several lessons were learned from the project.\n            Whenever private sector participation is included as an\n            objective and key output indicator, it is necessary\n            beforehand to examine in depth the political, economic, and\n            sectoral contexts.  To ensure understanding and expand\n            ownership of the institutional reform process, communication\n            and other institutional capacity gaps need to be assessed\n            through an internal audit and bridged through appropriate\n            staff training and information campaigns at the early\n            implementation phase.  Undivided political commitment\n            remains an essential element for a reform process of such a\n            sensitive nature.  Focusing on the sector fundamentals of\n            cost recovery tariff and financial viability is a key\n            element of the sector reform and essential to ensure\n            sustainability.  Studies for future investments are useful\n            only to the extent that financing of recommended investments\n            will be made available either through local resources or\n            through multilateral and bilateral assistance."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
