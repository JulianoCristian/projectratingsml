              ECONOMIC MANAGEMENTAND GROWTHCREDIT
                    CREDIT AND PROGRAMSUMMARY

Borrower:           Republic of Zambia

Amount:             SDR27.4 million(USrS40.0 million equivalent)

Terms:              Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and a 10-year grace period.

Objectivesand       The Economic Managementand Growth Credit of U S $40 million is the first
Description:        structural adjustment operation to support policy and institutional reforms as
                    outlined inthe Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No. 27654-ZA).
                    The CAS envisages that over the three-year period o f CAS implementation,
                    there could be two adjustment credits to support its implementation inthe
                    base-case lending scenario. This credit assists Zambia to:
                     +
                     +++ Return to a macroeconomic framework conducive to robust growth;
                         Strengthen the role o f the financial sector;
                         Strengthen the credibility and institutional.capacity o f the public sector;
                         Improve Zambia's business environment.
                    IDA and the Government o fthe Republic ofZambia agree that achieving these
                    objectives inpart depends on the implementation o f specific reforms inthe
                    areas of: (i) pensions and payment culture among Government agencies; (ii)
                    state owned non-bank financial institutions; (iii) expenditure
                                                                        public
                    management, debt management, and civil service reform; and (iv) private
                    sector development includingregulation o f public utilities and private
                    business.

Benefits:            The actions under the adjustment operation will aid fiscal adjustment and will
                    contribute to the sustainability o f the reform process by strengthening the
                     institutional infiastructure needed to improve the public sector's capacity to
                     carry out its expenditure policies more effectively and efficiently. At the same
                     time the actions supported by the EMGC will improve the institutional
                     environment for private sector development, The reforms will enhance
                     Zambia's prospects for successful implementation o f its Poverty Reduction
                     Strategy through its support for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The
                     EMGC measures will also provide a positive signal to international institutions
                     and bilateral donors regarding the Government's commitment to reform and
                     transition towards a full-fledged market economy.

Risks:               InlightofZambia's trackrecordinimplementingreformprograms, the
                     proposed credit could face significant risks. The mainrisks overlap directly
                     with the risks identifiedinthe CAS, and include (i)   political; (ii)
                                                                                         macro
                     economic issues; (iii)  external developments; (iv) failure to contain the further
                     spread o f the HIV/AIDS pandemic; and (v) implementation capacity.
                      bPolitical Risk: Eventhoughthe next general elections are plannedfor 2006,
                     it is expected that 2005 will show the beginning o fthe election campaign.
                     This can take away the needed attention to stay the course with the ongoing

                   economic reformefforts to further strengthen the effectiveness of the public
                    sector and the commitmentto work towards a resolutiono f state-owned non-
                   bank financial institutions. To mitigate these challenges some areas supported
                   bythe proposed operation are also supported, though often from a different
                   angle, bythe IMF's PRGF arrangement and its capacity buildingchallenges
                    through financial support by other donors, inparticular the Harmonizationin
                   Practice (HIP)group. Inaddition, for some milestones to have their expected
                    impact, the Government would needto follow up with amendmentsto the
                    existingconstitution. Eventhough a Constitutional Review Commissionhas
                    been working on a general constitutionalrevision, these changes,
                    constitutional changes cannot be guaranteed.
                    .Macroeconomic       stability: Pressureby civil service unions for increasesin
                    wages and allowances and demands for additional resources from other non-
                    priority sectors such as defense could potentially riskthe execution of the
                    fiscal program.
                    ,Shocks   to Growth: The country i s vulnerable to terms o ftrade shocks and
                    droughts. The upsurge incopper prices mightre-ignite the hope that Zambia
                    once more can count on the copper sector for economic success. A
                    reoccurrence o f a drought wouldharm the recent gains infood security and
                    could see a surge inthe need for food imports.
                    bHIV/AIDSpandemic: HIV/AIDSremainsthe most significant healththreat
                    to Zambia's population andhence to its prosperity. The impact of the disease
                    i s increasingly visible inall spheres o f Zambia's society and economy. With
                    prevalence remainingindouble-digit figures, the potential damage i s
                    enormous.
                     bImplementationcapacity: Inadditionto therisksidentifiedinthe CAS in
                    this area, weak policy implementationandlimitedGovernment administrative
                    capacity and coordination, could leadto delays inthe implementation o f key
                    measurespartly because o f the overarching goal of this Government to reach
                    HIPC Completion as soon as possible. The latter will require a significant
                    effort on the side o f GRZ and as such could absorb a significant portion o f the
                    limitedimplementation capacity ofGRZ. To mitigate these risks, IDAwill
                    continue to assist the Government inmobilizingtechnical assistanceto adopt
                    and implement the reforms and will also deepenthe ongoing dialogue with the
                    Government on structuralreform, working closely with other cooperating
                    partners to provide this technical assistance. This dialogue i s facilitated bythe
                    continuity that`the results focused CAS bringsto the interactionwith
                    Government.

Scheduleof           The proposedCredit will be disbursedthrough the Bank o f Zambia.
Disbursements:       Disbursement will be intwo tranches. The first tranche (US$20 million) will
                     bereleasedat effectiveness. The secondtranche (US$20 million) will be
                     released when the second tranche conditions are met, which i s expected to be
                     aroundJune 2005.

Box 1:Lessons learnedfromPastIDA Adjustment ProgramsinZambia

 Zambia's Country Assistance Evaluation(CAE) (Report No. 25075) completed inNovember 2002 gives a sober
 picture o fIDA's ability to guide development inZambia.

  OnAdjustment lending it states: Thefive structural adjustment credits that exited between FY96-01 represent three-
  quarters of closed commitments. During Board discussionof the FY94 and FY96 CASs, the Executive Directors
  highlighted the needfor greater speciJcity in adjustment lending conditions and a clearer definition of satisfactory
 performance. Two of thepast three structural adjustment credits have been rated in the unsatisfactory rangefor
  outcomes. In hindsight, even those adjustment operations initially rated marginally satisfactory have had less
  robust outcomes than expected. While conditions werefulfilled, pressurefor timely balance of payments support led
  to less results-oriented, weak, or vaguely worded conditions. Often, the relevance of the conditions tofulfilling the
  stated objectives waspoor.

  The CAE Evaluation o fthe FY96-01period leads to the following recommendations relevant for adjustment
  operations:
  Debt management and adjustment lending:
       Enhance the impact o f structuraladjustment lendingthrough operational designs that focus on results, with a

Growth Retrospect
Zambia's growth record during 1991-2003, a period duringwhich the Government followed stabilization and adjustment
programs, is mixed with different outcomes for the periods 1991-1998 and 1999-2003.
During 1991-98, Zambia's real GDP fell by an average rate of 0.2 percent a year. Poor performance can be traced
mainlyto the decline in the miningsector, which contracted at an average annual rate o f 8.7 percent, and poor performance
inthe agricultural sector, which contractedby 0.2 percent a year. Industrywas stagnant (manufacturing grew 0.9 percent,
utilities grew 1percent, and construction contracted 4.8 percent), and services grew 2.7 percent a year. With no growth in
industry,the service sector was the only significant sectoral source o f growth offsettingthe huge contraction inminingand
agricultural output.   Total factor productivity-the    efficiency with which capital and labor are combined to produce
output-declined at an average annual rate o f 1.9 percent a year during 1991-98, suggestingthat the reform process which
moved Zambia towards a market-based economy was byno means smooth and costless.

During 1999-2003 real GDP grew at an average rate of 4.0 percent a year. This period is unique in Zambia's
economic history since independence, as it represents the first period o f uninterrupted positive real per capita GDP growth
since 1965 and the only period during which almost all sectors experienced growth each year. The decline in the mining
sector was reversed and the sector actually grew, at an average annual rate o f 2.1 percent. Growth came from two sources:
higher growth rates across all sectors, perhaps suggestingthat the reforms o f the early and mid-1990s hadbegun to pay off,
andthe reversal of the decliningminingsector, as aresult o fthe privatizationo fthe Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines in
2000. Since 1999 total factor productivity i s estimated to have grown by an average of 1.4 percent a year-the      first time
such improvements have been seen in Zambia since independence.

Growth Prospect
Zambia's prospects for growth and povertyreductionover the next decade depend on both exogenousfactors and
policy and institutionalmeasures. The recently completed Country Economic Memorandum(CEM) simulates the growth
and welfare impact o f both exogenous changes and alternative government policies over the next decade (2004-2015). To
do such simulation, a base-case growth scenario i s projected, which i s based on key assumptions about population and
labor force growth, govemment spending, current account deficit, interest on foreign debt, and copper prices. Population
and labor force grow at around 2 percent and take into account the impact o f HIVIAIDS. Under this base case scenario,
Zambia is projectedto growth at an annual averagerate o f 4.1 percent inthe base-case.

The implications for growth and povertyreductionof exogenouschanges as well as alternativegovernment policies
are then simulatedaroundthe base-casegrowth pathusinga Zambia CGE model. For exogenous changes, the impact
o f alternative copper prices as well as the impact o f HIPC debt forgiveness are simulated. For policies that are under the
control o f the government, the impact o f increased spending on HIVIAIDS, increased spending on education, increased
productivity in subsistence and export agriculture, and increased investment in transportation and rural roads are simulated.

The simulation results provideseveral useful insights. First, targeting traditional and nontraditional crops, which have
strong links to foreign markets, i s the best way to enhance growth and household welfare. The pro-poor outcomes of
agricultural expansion would be greatly enhanced if market access were widened on a large scale. Improving the condition
o f the road network and extending the network to remote areas i s a key step not only to increasing growth but also tc
reducing rural poverty significantly.   Second, rural households will be cushioned from the negative effects o f a likelq
decline in copper prices (and output) over the next decade, while urban households will face increased poverty. Finally,
unless the funds released by HIPC are used to finance policies that favor the poor, the impact o f debt relief on povertq
reduction is likely to be very modest.

The simulation resultsalso show that Zambia is unlikelyto achieve the Millennium DevelopmentGoal of halving
povertyby 2015. Under the basecase growth scenario, Zambia will not be able to halvepoverty untilafter 2040.
However, ifthe govemment "breaks with the past" by implementing various pro-poor policy measures as mentioned above
the headcount poverty rate canbereducedbytwo to three additionalpercentagepoints over the next decade. Still, this is
not sufficient; Zambia needs to move to a much higher growth path-estimated to be between 8-10 percent per annum-to
reach this particular MDG.

Annex 2.1: Status of CASLendingTriggers

Justificationfor Moving Zambia to a Base Case Lending Scenario

Results for a CAS Base Case lendingscenario requires achievingmilestones infive areas:
   1. Maintenanceo f goodportfolio performance as measuredby a disbursement ratio of 20 percent per
        annum or higher and aportfolio rating of less that 20 percent unsatisfactory.
   2. Satisfactory implementationof the PRSP;
   3    Maintenanceo f sound macroeconomic framework;
   4. Continuedprogress inimproving economic governance;
   5. Satisfactory performance inthe Educationand Health sectors.

The country is inessence incompliance with all triggers as follows:
   The World Bank group portfolio i s inline with the benchmarks required. At present, the
   disbursement ratio i s around 31percent and the portfolio contains only one project ratedunsatisfactory
   out o f 15 resulting inarating clearly less than 20 percent.
   The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) for the period January 2002-June 2003 discussedwith the Board on
   June 15 stated that satisfactory progress inPRSP implementation andmonitoring still neededto be
   established. Current developments indicate that a positive review over the period July 2003-June 2004
   i s possible and a new PRSP- progress report has been drafted which indicates that satisfactory
   progress is being made. A formal JSAN is beingprepared and will accompany Zambia's HIPC
   Completion documentation.
   The country has maintained a sound macroeconomic framework since GRZ agreedon an extended
   IMFStaffMonitoringPrograminNovember2003, whichwas followed upwith athree-year PRGF
   arrangement that was approvedby the IMFExecutive Board inJune o f 2004. To remain inthe base
   case consecutive positive reviews of the PRGFwill be needed.
   Economic governance is steadily improving as canbe witnessed by a continuous effort to improve
   public expenditure management and civil service processesand progress inimproving the performance
   o f the energy utility, ZESCO, and findinga solution to the stalledprivatization of Zanaco.
        o Inthe areaofpublic sector managementreform, the MTEFhasbeen further enhanced
            through strengthening the bottom uppart o f the budget preparationprocessby involvingthe
            originally PRSP related sector advisory groups inevaluatingsectoral needs, the involvement o f
            Cabinet as an entity inthe setting of the sectoral expenditure ceilings, and wideningo f
            stakeholder consultations;
        o Eventhough IFMIShasnotyet beenimplementedinthree pilotministries, the commitment to
            putIFMISinto operationisno lessas canbewitnessed bythe agreementreachedwith the
            contractor andthe expectedsigning of the I F M I S 'turn key' contract inNovember", which
            not only commits the Government to its implementation but also commits the Government
            financially;
        o The ZESCOcommercializationprocess is to passthe interimpointas agreedinthe
            commercialization roadmap this December and as such will enter the final stage of
            commercialization this month;
        o ZANACO: Government isparallel negotiatingwiththe two preferredbidders. Progressis
            beingmade, but at a slow pace.
   Inthe area of humandevelopment satisfactory progress hasbeen made inthe areas ofeducation
   and health as measuredby the fact that student retentionrates increased for grades 1-7 from 96.5
   percent in2002 to 97.6 percent in2003 andthat cashreleasesto health and education in2003 were as
   provided inthe budget.

                            Letter of DevelopmentPolicy

 November 10,2004


 Mr.JamesD.Wolfensohn
 President
 Intemational Development Association
  1818 HSt. NW
 Washington, D.C.


 Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:

 Subject: Proposed Economic Management and Growth Credit
 Letter of Development Policy

  1.     IamwritingtorequestonbehalfoftheGovernmentoftheRepublicofZambia
  (GRZ), a Credit of US$40 million equivalent from the Intemational Development
 Association (IDA) in support of our reform efforts.           This Credit, the Economic
  Management and Growth Credit (EMGC) aims at helping my country to sustain the
  economic gains it has achieved over the last few years and to further enhance our
  capabilities to reduce poverty. The GRZ believes that the policies set forth in this Letter
  o f Development Policy are needed to achieve and sustain the objectives described inour
  Poverty Reduction and Strategy Paper (PRSP) as well as in our Transitional National
  Development Plan(TNDP).
  2.     Zambia adopted a multiparty democratic system in 1991 and initiated a transition
  from a state led economic system to one with private ownership where market forces
  determine decisions with regardto resource allocation. Duringthis transition, the country
  has experienced profound challenges.      The reform programs did not produce quick
  positiveresults. Although growth has resumedand it is now inits fifth consecutive year,
  it hasnotbeen inthe highrange of 6-8 percent, which is what isrequiredfor a significant
  impact on the livelihood of our citizens. Similarly, export diversificationis occurring and

                                           -29 -


non-copper exports now contribute about 35 percent o f total export earnings. However,
both economic growth andexport diversification are fragile andneedto be consolidated.
3.      InJuly 2002, GRZ launched its first PRSP for the period2002-2004. The PRSP
highlights as barriers to poverty reduction, lack of sustainable economic growth, high
inequality, excessive dependence on foreign aid, poor prioritization of public resources,
inadequate safety nets, and HIV/AIDS. It seeks to achieve poverty reduction through
promoting (i)economic growth and diversification o f production and exports; (ii)
improved access and quality in the provision o f social services; and (iii)the
mainstreaming of crosscutting issues of infrastructure, governance, HIV/AIDS, gender,
andthe environment. Inaddition to the PRSP, the GRZ preparedthe TNDP covering the
period 2002-2005. The TNDP, which was launched in December 2002, extends the
PRSP by bringing in additional sectors of the economy that were not included in the
PRSP.
4.      Macroeconomic stability, although within reach, i s not yet fully attained in
Zambia. The current economic environment of positive growth undoubtedly provides
opportunities to make the tough choices needed to reach and sustain macroeconomic
stability. Furtherfiscal consolidation through clearanceo f government arrears, improving
debt managementandbudget processes, and stronger efforts at implementingthe broader
public sector reforms remain the principalways through which the GRZ intendsto restore
macroeconomic stability (single digit inflation, lower real interest rates and a stable
Kwacha) and improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f the public sector. Improved
macroeconomic stability andpublic sector effectiveness are intum essentialfor improved
private sector investment and growth. Inthis regard, the GRZ welcomes the World Bank
support, through the proposed EMGC because it will assist the country consolidate the
recent macroeconomic gains and also help support the PRSP implementation.
5.      Inthe mediumterm growthwill also dependonimprovedbusinessenvironment
for private sector ledgrowth, the containment o fthe HIV/AIDS pandemic and investment
ininfrastructure. Investmentininfrastructure is particularlykeyto facilitatinggrowth in
agriculture and tourism, and to scaling up poverty reduction inrural areas. Inthe current
circumstances o f Zambia, the reform program should focus on consolidating the
macroeconomic environment for growth, improving the functioning and effectiveness of
public sector, and laying the foundation for improved business environment through
better dialogue, improved regulatory framework, and public-private partnership. We
request that this reform program be supported by the World Bank through the proposed
EMGC, to be released in two tranches. We fully understand that World Bank's support
will dependon makingadequate progressinthe proposed reform areas, which are further
articulatedbelow.
A.      Returning to a macroeconomicframework conducive to robust growth

6,      The GRZ aims, in the context of its program with IMFPRGF, to reduce inflation
to around 10% in 2006 and single digits thereafter and to increase gross international
reserves of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) to about 2 months o f import cover by 2007. In
addition, the GRZ aims to halt the unsustainable cycle o frisingdomestic debt andinterest
payments and reduce fiscal deficit to below 2.5% o f GDP by 2006 inorder to make room

                                             -30-


for increased spending on poverty-reducing programs.          Spending on priority poverty
reducing programs i s expected to increase from an estimated 1% o f GDP in 2003 to 2%
in2006. The crux of the needed fiscal adjustment will come from the expenditure side.
The wage bill and recurrent departmental charges will be reduced each by 0.5% o f GDP
and the foreign financed capital expenditures are expected to fall by a full percentage
point o f GDP in 2004. These developments together with the reduction o f the fiscal
deficit and an improved composition o f public expenditure should contribute to a
reduction in real interest rates, thereby improving Zambia's investment climate and
investment opportunities. Economic growth is expected to be at least 4.5% in2004,4.5%
in2005, and5% in2006 and2007.
7.      The GRZ also intends to eliminate the buildup o fbudgetary arrears and arrears by
parastatals with utilities as this threatens not only the financial viability o f the utilities
themselves and their ability to operate, but often will require budgetary transfers in the
end to settle them. Inaddition, the failure to pay utilitybills by the GRZ has also affected
the ability o f the utilities to settle the bills among themselves on time. The GRZ has
recognizedthis problem andhas taken measures aimed at ensuring that the line ministries
pay their utility bills and insurance premiums on time. With regard to the arrears, the
GRZ is committed to work out a time bound restructuring plan o f the arrears with the
utilitycompanies. Itis therefore our expectationthat when these arrears arebeingcleared,
the utilities will also be clearing their own arrears too. The GRZ nevertheless believes
that the long-term solution to the problem o f arrears, either between itself andthe utilities
or among the utilities themselves, i s to empower the utilities to operate strictly on
commercial lines o f business. This is one o f the measures that the GRZ is putting in
place to address the problem o f arrears.
8.      Prior to Board Presentation o f the proposed credit, the key results we expect to
achieve inthis area include:
 9 Cabinet has issued a decision to empower utilities and insurance companies to treat
    government institutions as any other client including that the utilities and insurance
    companies would be expected to discontinue their services to Government institutions
    insimilar fashionas anyother customer;
 9 The Accountant General has instructed accounting officers to pay their utility and
    insurance bills on time;
 P The Secretary of the Treasury has issued a letter to the utilities and insurance
    companies reiterating the decision made by Cabinet.
9.      Prior to the release o f the second tranche o f the credit, we will have achieved the
following:
 9 The MoFNP has adopted a time bound restructuring plan for payment of the
    Government's arrears to utility and insurance companies. The M o mhas developed
    an action plan in case o f no significant improvement inpayment pattems or signs o f
    independent commercial actions taken by utilities on public institutions not paying
    their bills on time;
 9 MoFNP, ifnecessary, has adopted a time boundrestructuringplanfor payment of(i)
    the Government's arrears to utility companies and (ii) utility arrears.
                                                             inter

                                           - 3 1 -



10.    The GRZ would like to undertake pension reforms to create a financially viable
and sustainable pensions system in the country.       InZambia, four major institutions
provide pensions to retirees. Civil service members hired before February 1,2000 belong
to either the Public Service Pensions Fund (PSPF) or the Local Authorities
Superannuation Fund (LASF).         The President's office and the Minister o f Local
Government and Housing, respectively, supervise the funds and the GRZ i s the financial
guarantor o f both. InFebruary 2000, the National Pension Scheme (NAPSA), which was
created by a 1996 Act, was implemented. Civil servants hired after February 2000 are
enrolled inNAPSA except for the teaching service and defence personnel. Public service
schemes, together have 130,000 active members, about a quarter o f the formal workforce,
and pay pensions to more than 50,000 retirees. NAPSA, which is supervised by the
Ministry o f Labor, covers about 350,000 workers.
11.     The financial status o f the pension schemes is mixed. The two public sector
schemes, PSPF and LASF, are insolvent, although both hold some assets and are owed
considerable amounts in contribution arrears. Benefits are simply too high relative to
current contribution rates and would remain too high even if contribution rates were
doubled.    The actuarial deficits o f the two public service funds i s almost 3 trillion
kwacha, an amount greater than 1/3rd o f external debt, and since benefit levels inthese
schemes are protected in the Constitution, reform has proved difficult without the
constitutional amendment. The GRZ has accepted the need to reform the PSPF and
LASF and has recognized that a constitutional amendment i s necessary to put the PSPF
andLASF on a sound financial footing. Therefore, Cabinet will have approvedbeforethe
release o f the second tranche (i)  a proposal to the constitutional review commission to
change the provisions o f article 124 to enable PSPF reforms to be applicable to existing
participants inPSPF and (ii)   a reform program that ensures the financial sustainability o f
the fund.
12.     The issues facing NAPSA are largely operational rather than financial. The most
urgent need i s for procedural reform, tooling up, and capacity building in asset
management. Currently NAPSA's investment guidelines do not adequately protect the
principle o f its assets or promote diversification, nor support effective development o f
Zambia's capital markets. In addition, NAPSA could benefit from reducing its high
administrative cost by allowing Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) to collect NAPSA
contributions.
13.     Prior to Board Presentation o f the proposed credit, the key results we expect to
achieve inthis area include:
9 PSPF Board has approved amendments to reform pensions including the benefit
    formula, commutation factors, and contribution rates for new PSPF members since
    the year 2005 and PSPF has completed a draft three year implementation plan to
    reduce administrative expenses to 12percent o f 2003 annual accrued contributions as

>   approved by its board;
    PSPF has introduced computer-based capability to produce monthly reports on
    benefits and full range o f beneficiary characteristics to improve PSPF policy
    development andprojections o f cash needs;

                                              - 3 2 -

>   LASF has shown progress towards completion of actuarial valuation of LASF and
>   completion collection of data for PROST analysis o fvarious policy reformoptions;
    MoFNP has proposed a draft law to set up PIA as an autonomous institution inline
    with the FSDP recommendationsandsubmitsthe draft law to Cabinet for approval.

14.     Prior to the release of the second tranche o f the credit, we will have achieved the
following:
9 Cabinet has approved (i)          a proposal to the constitutional review commission to
    change the provisions of article 124 to enable PSPF reforms to be applicable to
    existing participants in PSPF and (ii)a reform program that ensures the financial
>   sustainability ofthe fund;
     LASF has submitted a reform proposal for Cabinet approval based on actuarial
>   valuation and ifnecessaryPROST analysis;
     The National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA) has (i)adopted a revised
    investment policy, appointed a global custodian, and selected a pension fund
    manager; (ii)drafted an operations manual on corporate governance; and (iii)
>   developed aprogram for training trustees;
     Cabinet has submitted amendment to the ZRA Act to Parliament to allow ZRA to

>   collect NAPSA contributions;
     PIA haspreparedan overall vision paper backedbyoperating action plans, budgetary
    andHR needs.
B.       Strengtheningthe role of the financial sector

15.      Zambia's financial sector is characterizedby several weaknesses, which continue
to limit its role inprivate sector development and growth: Low financial intermediation;
high interest margins and ratio of fee income to average assets; limited capacity with
regard to financial sector supervision; multiple and conflicting roles by the GRZ in the
financial sector; and apoor credit culture.I2
16.      Inview oftheseweaknesses, the GRZinconsultationwithother stakeholdershas
prepareda Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), which provides for a systematic
and coherent action plan that would leadto the realization of a well functioning financial
sector in Zambia. The Cabinet has formally adopted the FSDP and as such agreed to
strengthen the supervisory powers of the BoZ through harmonization o f legislations (e.g.
inclusion o f state-owned non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) under the Company's
Act) and strengthening o fthe Bankof Zambia's supervisory powers over NBFIs.
In addition, the GRZ intends to strengthen the operational governance arrangements of
the BoZ. The Government plans to change the procedures by which the board members
of the BoZ are appointed to ensure maximum autonomy in the conduct of monetary
policy.


   These weaknesses were identifiedbythe Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) report of 2002
carried outjointly by the IMFand the World Bank, as well as by self-assessmentsundertaken by the Bank
ofZambia, includingassessmentofthe BadeCorePrinciplesfor effectiveBankingSupervisionandthe Monetary
aridFinancialPoliciesTransparencyCodes.

                                            - 33 -

17.     The BoZ will undertake a comprehensive evaluation o f the business model
options available for a credit bureau, before a credit bureau is set up. The establishment
o f a credit bureau is essential to improve Zambia's credit culture, which so far has been
characterizedbynon-timely servicing o f financial obligations by debtors.
18.     Prior to BoardPresentation o f the credit, we expect to achieve the following:
9 Cabinet has approved the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), which
    stipulates the repeal o f those sections o f the Building Societies Act, the National
    Savings and Credit Bank (NSCB) Act, and the Development Bank o f Zambia (DBZ),
    such that (i) institutions can be incorporated under the Company's Act, (ii)
                  these
    inconsistencies with the BFSA are removed; and (iii)     supervisory powers over NBFIs
    bythe Banko fZambia are strengthened;
9 The BankofZambia, MoFNP, andthe Development BankofZambia have signed a
    Memorandum o f Understanding, which specifies the supervisory role o f the Bank o f
    Zambia and the MoFNP with regard to the Development Bank o f Zambia untilDBZ
    falls under the BFS Act;
9 A ceiling on lending by DBZ of US$10 million would be adhered to pending the
    repeal o f the DBZ act, bringing DBZ under the Companies Act and under the
    provisions o f the BFS Act, including the provision regarding the limit o f single
     shareholding.

19.     Prior to the release o f the second tranche o f the credit, the GFU will have
achieved the following:
9 The GRZhasmadeprogress inthe processofadoptingthe necessary legalchangesto
     the Building Societies Act, the National Savings and Credit Bank Act, and the

9 The GRZ has commenced implementing our FSDP pertainingto the reform of state-
    .DevelopmentBankof     Zambia Act;

     owned NBFIs including NSCB, ZNBS, and DBZ,
9 DBZ shall not (i)accept deposits and (ii)raise any loan requiring Government
     guarantee;
9 Inaddition, GRZ has commenced implementing the recommendations of our FSDP
     pertainingto the provisions o f the Government's credit facility at the Banko f Zambia;
9 The independence of the BoZ is strengthened by changing the procedures bywhich
     the Governor i s appointed as well as its board o f directors;
9 BoZ has undertaken a comprehensive evaluation of available options with regard to
     which business model o f a credit bureaubefore setting up a credit bureau.

C.       Strengthening the credibility and institutional capacity of the Public Sector

20.      The GRZ embarked on its Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP) in 1993 with
the overall goal o f improving the quality, delivery, efficiency, and cost effectiveness o f
public services. Itwas recognizedthat this would require significant institutional changes
and capacity building over a medium term. With assistance from the World Bank, the
GRZ designed and started implementing its Public Service Capacity Building Project
(PSCAP) in 2001. Much o f the support under PSCAP i s focused on improving public

                                            - 34 -

expenditure management and accountability, and service delivery inthe public sector. In
2003, the GRZ prepared its first Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), based
upon the priorities laid out in the TNDP and the PRSP, introduced a programmatic
classification of the budget (known as an Activity Based Budgeting system). Inaddition,
to improve effectiveness of the public sector and service delivery, the Government also
implemented a pay reform strategy in 2003, which included the decompression o f salary
scales and consolidation of allowances. Further, an integrated personnel and payroll
system is being implemented to improve management and control o f the Government
payroll
21.     The Government with assistance o f the collaborating partners has prepared and
adopted an updated and revised Public Sector Reform Program, which includes a time
bound and phased implementation plan for three priority areas: (i)        public expenditure
management and financial accountability; (ii)      right sizing and pay reform; and (iii)
decentralization and strengthening o f Local Government. In the context o f these three
broad areas o f priorities, the main areas where Government seeks support are in
upgrading Government's debt management capacity, improving public expenditure
management and financial accountability practices, and streamlining o f ministerial
structures and improving incentives for service delivery.
22.      Upgrading Government's debt management capacity. Under the current
institutional arrangement for debt management, responsibilities are split between MoFNP
and BoZ, where BoZ is de facto responsible for the management o f domestic debt on
securities. This not only makes it difficult to formulate a consolidated strategy as well as
monitor and evaluate effectively Government debt, but also poses the risk that monetary
policy and debt management are not efficiently separated. To address this problem, the
MoFNP has taken two important initial steps, one o f which is strengthening the role o f
the MoFNP inthe process o f debt issuance. The other steps are the formulation o f a debt
management strategy for the post-HIPC completion period, including the; and the other
lead to an up to date database o f Government debt that can be used for monitoring and
evaluation.
23.     Prior to BoardPresentation o f the credit, we expect to achieve the following:
 9 MoFNP (i) prepared a detailed Terms of References and has established a Task
                 has
    Force with the objective o f reconciling the debt database covering domestic and
    foreign direct debt, as well as on-lending, (ii)is reporting on progress to the Secretary
    to the Treasury on a regular basis.
24.      Prior to the release o f the second tranche o f the credit, we will have achieved the
following:
 9 MoFNP (i)has established procedures for updating and maintaining the debt
    database; and (ii)has started producing regular reports on outstanding debt for
    internal, MoFNP and BoZ, use, and (iii)        has initiated work on establishing clear
    procedures for updating andmaintainingthe debt database;
 9 MoFNP (i) formulated inbroadterms a strategy for debt management post-HIPC
                 has
    completion point with a particular focus on the distribution between foreign and
    domestic borrowing; (ii)      has given and continuous to give inputs to the decision

                                           - 35 -

    making at the Tender Committee meetings; and (iii)has started preparing a
    framework within which the MoFNP can act as decision maker on issues regarding
    domestic debt with BoZ acting as agent.

25. Improving public expenditure management and financial accountability practices.
Notwithstanding the progress made in 2003, significant shortcomings still exist in
ensuring sound public expenditure management and financial accountability. The laws
andinstitutions for public expenditure and accountability inZambia are weak; the budget
lacks credibility as actual spending differs considerably from the planned amounts;
supplemental appropriations are large andparliamentary approval is usually granted after
the spending has occurred; budget execution is weak due to lack o f enforcement o f
expenditure controls, lack o f proper recording o f commitments, and weak procurement
practices and regulations; and the weak oversight and scrutiny o f the Executive's
financial management by the Office o f the Auditor General and the parliament has
undermined transparency and accountability. Key steps will be taken to improve the legal
basis for public expenditure management as well as strengthen the oversight functions o f
the Parliament andthe Office o fthe Auditor General (OAG).
26. Prior to BoardPresentation o fthe credit, we expect to achieve the following:
9 CabinethasadoptedZambia's revisedPublic Sector ReformStrategy;
9 The MoFNP has submittedrecommendations to the constitutional review committee
    that would (i) enable the budget to be approved by parliament before the start o f the
    fiscal year;   (ii)enhance accountability for public expenditure by restricting
    retroactive approval o f supplementary appropriations; and (iii)      the Office of the
    Auditor General has submitted its recommendations to the CRC on enhancing its
    autonomy and expanding its duties;
9 Cabinet has approved for submission to Parliament a revised Finance Act that
    strengthens financial management and accountability, including provisions that:.(i)
    Define the role and functions o f The Treasury; (ii)Strengthen the role o f internal audit

27. Prior to the release o f the second tranche o f the credit, we will have achieved the
following:

9 MoFNPhastabledinour legislature the annualbudget for 2005 including anannex,
    which compares the estimated expenditures for the year 2005 with the budget releases
    for the year 2004 and2003. This would bepresented insummary table aggregated by
    budget head, showing the PE andnon-PE spending from GRZ resources.

28.     Streamlining of ministerial structures and improving incentives for sewice
delivery. Until recently the Government's payroll has been managed by the MoFNP's
Data Center using an outdated system that was basically inaccessible to key decision-
makers and lacked adequate controls on data quality. Inaddition, the payroll database has
been completely separate from management o f the establishment registry, i.e., cabinet
office responsible for the management o f the civil service was generally unaware if
ministries had recruited people for unauthorized positions. Furthermore, as people have
been separated from the public service, the cabinet office has had difficulty assuring that
they are indeedremoved from the payroll.
29.     The proliferation o f allowances has created distortions in the pay system, where
job responsibility and qualification have less to do with ones total remuneration. The
medium-term pay reform strategy adopted by the Cabinet in 2002 therefore included the
elimination o f cash allowances in favor o f improvements in base salary.          This was
intended to improve transparency and equity in pay policy and enhance Government's
ability to accurate cost adjustments to the salary system. However, in2003, negotiations
between the Government and the public services unions failed to follow-through on the
policy o f eliminating allowances, and resulted insignificant increases inthe wage bill. As
a result, recent years have seen unsustainable growth in the wage bill from 5.3% percent
of GDP in 2000 to 8.4% in 2003. The growth in wages and salaries has crowded out
expenditures for recurrent departmental charges, which include expenditures for poverty
reduction programs, harming the ability o f Government to effectively implement its
PRSP. Looking forward, the Government believes it is important to regain control over
the wage bill, by reducing the number o f positions on the establishment, consistent with
the current budget levels for personnel emoluments as well as consolidate most
allowances into base salary.
30.     Prior to the release o f the second tranche o f the credit, we will have achieved the
following:
 9 PSMD inthe Cabinet office has consolidatedmost allowances into base salary and
    reduced the overall ratio o f allowances to base salary subject to negotiations with
    Public Service Unions andthe identification o f their fiscal implications;
 9 MoFNP has (i)     transferred the payroll to the PMEC system; (ii) users for all
                                                                         trained
    central ministries; (iii)
                            based Personal Emoluments releases on PMEC; (iv) matched
    each public servant to a specific post on the establishkent; and (v) ceased to pay
    public servants whose post i s not on the establishment except those identified for
    retrenchment but not yet paidoff;

    new PE arrears by line ministries;
9 Cabinet has approved the new structures for the four remaining ministries and any
>   excess staffs are removed from the payroll;
    The new annual performance appraisal system ( M A S ) has been implemented for all
    management positions and PSMD has issued a circular after agreements with the
    Public Service Unions that annual salary increments are no longer automatic but
    instead will be based on employee performance.

D.      ImprovingZambia's businessenvironment

31.     We recognize that improving the environment for doing business in Zambia is
imperative to accelerate our development. Good partnership between the public and the
private sector i s critical for this acceleration to materialize and therefore this partnership
can potentially bring significant benefits to Zambia. In the past we have undertaken
several initiatives to jump start private sector development and to streamline our
interactions with the private sector. However, for a variety o f reasons, those have not
always had the impact on Zambia's development that we had expected.
32.     One o f the lessons leamed was that we needed to develop our strategy more in
partnership and through various consultations with the private sector and other
stakeholders. Inaddition, the strategy for private sector development needs also to be not
only designed jointly but also implemented incooperation. To that effect we have held a
Private Sector Development Forum in Livingstone in June o f this year. This forum was
attended by all relevant stakeholders and has led to a variety o f implementable action
plans. Iwill not dwell on all the action plans that we agreed upon, but would like to
inform you that before Board presentation o f the credit, we expect to achieve the
following:
9 Cabinet has reaffirmed its commitment to market-based policies for private sector
    development by adopting the PSD Reform Action Plan;
9 Government has circulated to the private sector a paper outlining Zambia
    Development Agency proposal andreceived comments on the proposal;
9 RevisionofInvestment Act has been finalized inconsultation with the private sector
    and inthat process the Draft Act has been circulatedwidely to the private sector for
    comments.

33.     Prior to the release o f the second tranche o f the credit, we will have achieved the
following:
9 Government has established an implementation framework for the PSD Reform
    Action Planandbeganimplementing some o fthe actions;
9 Commenced work on rationalizing and enhancing effectiveness of ZIC, EBZ, ZPA,
    ZEPZA i.e. created a single Zambia Development Agency (ZDA);
9 The Government has completed a review ofrelated legislation to ensure consistency
    with the Investment Act and the Government's policy on PSD and to amend
    legislationifnecessary;

                                            - 38 -

9 Startedwork onsimplifjmg andrationalizingthe licensingframework for thetourism
    sector;
9 Government has identified priority infrastructuresectors, which lendthemselves to a
    PPIinZambia and started establishing an appropriate regulatory framework;
9 Governmenthas amended Statutory Instruments #s 2 and3 of2002to dealwiththese
    retrenchment and expatriate permit issues;
9 The Government has reviewed and updated the EPZ strategy andbusiness planand
    preparedrevisions o fEPZ legislation.

34.     We are well aware that policy stability and regulatory commitment are important
prerequisite for sustained large-scale private, especially foreign, investment. Ofparticular
importance is the country's institutional capacity to restrain arbitrary administrative action
and credibly commit to a stable regulatory and overall policy process. This is especially
relevant for our infrastructural sectors, where the establishment o f production systems,
transportation and distribution networks require large investments that are mostly sunk.
To succeed inthis task we need to establish an effective, market based, well-focused, and
flexible governance structure that serves the public interest. Therefore, we will need to
follow up the above actions with some sectoral measures in the energy and
telecommunications sectors, which are presented below. Our overall objective in the
energy sector is to establish a stable and credible policy and regulatory framework and a
market structure that i s consistent with regional initiatives and above all promotes
competition and private sector involvement.         This framework and structure should
continue to ensure a smooth transition to a liberalized electricity supply industry
consistent with the changing technological characteristics o f the industry and its demand
constraints.
35.     As you are aware we have initiated a commercialization program for ZESCO.
The implementation o f this road map is well on its way and all the Interim Point actions
for ZESCO's commercializationhave been met; and the achievements on the EntryPoint
actions have indeed been sustained. The main challenges that lie ahead o f us are related
to the articulation o f a consistent and forward looking energy policy, that defines the
sector's market structure and as a consequence the sector's legal and regulatory
frameworks. To that end we expect that prior to the release o f the second tranche of the
credit, we will have achieved the following:
9 Cabinet has adopted a comprehensive Policy Statement for the Energy that clearly
    articulates the Government's vision for the development o f the sector over the
    medium to long-term;
9 Amendmentsto ElectricityandERBActs havebeenmadeas stipulatedinthe adopted
    energy policy;
9 Satisfactory progress in ERE3 capacity building, and in implementation of ZESCO
    Commercialization.

36.     We face very similar issues inthe telecommunications sector, where technological
change and its impact on market structure o f the sector, requires a flexible and market-
based approach to policymaking. The absence o f a comprehensive policy document for

                                             - 39 -

the telecommunications sector that clearly articulates our vision for the development o f
that sector over the medium to long-term and guides the changes need to the legal and
regulatory frameworks therefore needs to be corrected. Therefore, we expect that prior to
the release o f the second tranche o fthe credit, we will have achieved the following:
P Cabinet has adopted a comprehensive Policy Statement for the telecommunications
    sector that clearly articulates our vision for the development o f the sector over the
    medium to long-term;
P Development ofnew telecommunication law has startedwhich isto ensure autonomy
    o f regulator and separation o fpolicy andregulatory functions;
9 We have embarked on the commercialization of ZAMTEL, which include a
    framework to ensure effective management andregulation o f ZAMTEL operations to
    prevent anti-competitive behavior byZAMTEL.

       Executive Directors welcomed the recent improvement inZambia's economic performance,
with growth in2003 attaining the highestrateintwo decadeswith falling inflation. However,
Directors observed that the easing o f drought conditions andhigher copper prices were largely
responsible for the positive outcome. They also noted with concern that sharp overruns in
expenditure stemming from wage increases andunbudgeted expenditures hadtaken place, and that
domestic debt and relatedinterest payments had increased sharply.

        Directors observed that Zambia's economy remainedfragile and significant progress toward
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will only be possiblewith faster growth andbetter
targeted public spending. They noted that more rapid and sustained economic growth will require
prudent macroeconomic management anda deepening o f structuralreforms to engender higher
donor inflows andprivate sector investment. Against this background, Directors welcomed the
recent actions taken bythe authorities to achieve macroeconomic stability. Inparticular, they
welcomed the government's efforts to contain the public sector wage bill, noting that this would
provide room for increasingspending on other priority poverty-reducingprograms.

        Directors noted that policy implementation andmacroeconomic performance has improved
under the extended Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). Directors, therefore, supported moving ahead
with anew arrangement underthe PRGFandurgedthe authorities to persevere inimplementing
reforms. Some Directors, however, indicatedthat they would have preferred a somewhat longer
track record o f sound performance under the SMP.

        Directors considered that the envisaged fiscal adjustment andre-orientation o f expenditure
would unlock resources for pro-poor spending, reduce public borrowing, and free up resources for
private sector growth. Giventhese important benefits, Directors urged the authorities to resist
pressures for higherexpenditures inareas not relatedto poverty reduction, including for wage
payments. They underscored the importance o f expeditingthe preparations o f plans for right-sizing
andpayreform o fthe public sector, with assistance from the World Bankandother donors.
Progress inthis area will be crucial to ensure the effective delivery ofpublic services by a better
paid, but affordable, government workforce.

        Directors expressed concern over the recent monetary expansion andurgedthe authorities
to monitor monetary developments closely-including       the effects o fnegativereal interest rates on
placements o f Treasury bills-and    be ready to absorb excess liquidityinthe bankingsystem that
couldjeopardize Zambia's inflation and external sector objectives. Directors supported the
maintenance o f a flexible exchange rate system to allow prompt adjustment to changes inZambia's
external circumstances.

        Directors welcomed the development o fthe Public Expenditure Management andFinancial
Accountability program incollaboration with key donors. They noted that successful
implementation o f the program would facilitate increasedbudgetary assistance critical for making
progress toward the MDGs.

        Directors considered the recent completion o f the Financial Sector Development Plan an
important step toward addressing the issues identified inthe Financial Sector Assessment Program.
They encouraged the authorities to ensure that urgent issues, such as the insolvencyo fthe non-
bankfinancial institutions, are addressedin2004. They welcomed further'progress toward the sale
o fthe Zambia National Commercial Bank.Directors encouraged the authorities to revise the anti-
money laundering legislationto comply with international best practice.

        Directors underscored the importance o f improving the environment for private sector
development and foreign investment inorder to accelerate economic growth. They considered the
elaborationo f a strategy and actionplanto remove obstacles to investments to be crucial, andwere
encouraged bythe process o f consultation now under way under the Private Sector Development
Initiative. Inthis context, they stressed the importance o f defining a consistent policy for tax
exemptions that achieves a prudent balance betweenthe desire to encourage investment and the
riskthat exemptions couldrapidly undermineZambia's resilient revenuebase. Directors welcomed
the govemment's efforts to improve governance through the anti-comption drive andthe
enhancement o f transparency and accountability o f government operations.

        Directors generally concurredwith the conclusions o f the Joint Staff Assessment on
Zambia's first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) Progress Report. They agreed that inlight
o fthe authorities' recent renewedcommitment to reforms andpolicy implementation, the strategy
proposedinthe PRSP continues to provide a credible framework for Fundconcessional assistance.

         Directors urgedthe authorities to make additional efforts to strengthen ownership o f the
PRSP andcontinue to make progress toward implementingthe few remainingHIPC completion
point triggers. Several Directors felt that the completionpoint couldbe reached inDecember 2004.
However, the majority o f the Executive Board looked forward to Zambia's sound policy
implementationunder the PRGFprogram as the basis for consideration o f the completion point in
early 2005.
