At that time Zambia was judged to be in\n            the low case scenario of the CAS. Since the discussion at\n            the Board, improvements have been made in macroeconomic\n            management as reflected by conclusion of an IMF Poverty\n            Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) plus progress towards\n            HIPC completion and key governance issues."}, "docdt": "2004-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
