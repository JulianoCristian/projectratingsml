I.Introduction

1.    This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to introduce the
following changes inthe Brazil Federal Water Resources Management Project
(P038895), and any accompanying amendments to the Project's legal documents. Project
financing has beenthrough LoanNo. 4310-BR of US$158 million and through an
Additional Financing (AF) LoanNo, 7420-BR of USD$5O million approved inDecember
2006. The AF included a restructuring and scale up o f the Project.

2.    The proposed changes include: (1) revisiono f Project scope, targets, and result
indicators, including cancelling of some water resources activities and works; (2) revision
o f Project costs related to the 3-year AF period from US$200 million to US$ 72.5
million, cancellation o f US$23 million from the AF loan amount, and increase inthe
disbursement percentage to 100%. The mainreasons for these changes are: (1) delays in
start up and implementation AF Loan financed activities; and (2) ensuringthat results
indicators are inline with the restructured Project, measurable withinthe timeframe for
Project completionand inline with the activities being supported by the Project.

11.Backgroundand Reasonsfor Restructuring

3.    The Federal Water ResourcesManagement Project was approved inApril 1998 and
was financed through Loan4310-BR,signed on June 3, 1998, inthe amount o f US$198
million. Out o f the Original Loan, US$40 millionwas cancelled by request o f the
Government o f Brazil inDecember 2003 mainly due to exchange rate variations, and the
remaining US$ 158 millionwas fully disbursedby December 31,2006. An AF LoanNo.
7420-BR inthe amount o f US$50 millionwas approved by the Board on December 19,
2006. The AF loanbecame effective onNovember 8,2007.

4.    The Project Development Objectives remained unchanged. They are to: (a) promote
rational and sustainable use and participatory management of water resources inBrazil in
general, and inthe Northeast inparticular; and (b) provide reliable and sustainable access
to water for domestic, agricultural, rural, municipal and other uses inpriority river basins
inthe Northeast.The Projectwas restructuredat the time ofthe AF Loanapproval, and
includes three components: (a) Water Resources Management; (b) Priority Works; and
(c) Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. Project activities include improving water
resources management and planning at national and state levels scaling up to include
states outside the Northeast region and expanding the benefits o f water infrastructure to
other areas inthe semiaridNortheast region. Works supported by the Project include




                                               2

water pipelines,rural water supply systems, medium size dams, and other similar
hydraulic infrastructure for multiple uses.

5.    Proiectperformance and expected achievement at Project completion. Results
indicate that the overall Project impact i s very positive at national and state levels. The
Project has been instrumental inthe creation and strengthening o f the National Water
Agency, ANA, which is now considered to be a world class water management
institution. The water resources management systems insemi-arid states, where the
Project focused its main actions, have evolved beyondthe other Brazilian states. With the
AF, the Project has continuedand deepenedthe water resources management support
includingproviding support to the other Brazilian states outside the Northeast. Inthe
original Project the works were very important in linking investments and management,
and empowering the newly created state water agencies. The works component also
helped states to access federal financing for water resources infrastructure, which
financing was not readily available.

6.    After the approval o fthe AF loan, the Federal Governmentlaunchedthe Brazilian
Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) that provides an unprecedented amount of federal
resources for infrastructure.All o f the works during AF are included inthe PAC and
therefore now have assured financing from Brazilian government resources. This greatly
lessened the need for Bank financing o f the works.

7.    Project implementationhas suffered delays, which have caused Projectperformance
to be downgraded from Satisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory inthe June 2008,
December 2008 and April 2009 review periods. The Project Development Objectives
remain achievable by Project completion.

8.    The reasons for Project restructuring are the following.

9.    Delay in start up and implementationof activities funded under the AF. A number
o f activities that were to be supported with AF will not be completed intime and are
being cancelled because o f delays instart up and implementationo f AF activities.
Although the AF Loan was approved by the Board on December 19,2006,the Loan
became effective only on November 8,2007. This delay was related to an unforeseen
delays inthe Brazilian Senate (which neededto approve the Loan); and the changes in
administration at Federaland State levels following the elections at the end of 2006.
Additionally because o f the delay inAF Loan effectiveness, the Project teams inthe
MinistryofNational Integrationandthe Statewater departments were deactivated and
could only be reactivatedafter the AF Loanbecame effective. Inaddition the
reactivationof the team inthe Ministryo fNational Integrationtook more time than
anticipatedbecause o f changes inBrazilian federal government general procedures for
hiringof staff. All ofthis resultedinnearly aone and ahalfyear delay for the
implementation o f a three-year AF, which made infeasible the completion of many o f the
Project works and some water resources management activities within the Project
financing period. During the mid-termreview o f the AF in September 2008 when all o f
the teams were reactivatedand significant progress was beingmade, the implementing
agencies requested an extension inorder to ensure the completion of Project activities.



                                               3

The possibility o f an extension was later discussed, however it was decided not to do so
because o f the overall length of the Project (8 years for original Project and 3 years for
AF), andBankpolicy that does not allow for extensions ofAF beyond 3 years from the
date o f AF approval.

10. An additional implementation problem arose inDecember 2008 when the Brazilian
FederalController (Tribunal de Contas da Uniiio) issued a rulingthat if followed would
go against Bank procurement guidelines, affecting procurement under all Bank-financed
projects as well as the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank supported programs. While
this issue was beingresolved, several procurement processesunder the Projectwere
stalled. The reduced Project scope still includes some priority works and water resources
management activities that will be completed after the Project closing date. The
Government has committedto completing these activities with counterpart funds and
there i s an agreement with OPCS to delay the preparation of the ICRto fully take into
account the results of these activities. The Bank has made the necessary arrangements to
ensure continued supervisiono f project implementation, including environmental and
social safeguard instruments, for all project activities untilthey are completed.

11. Activities cancelled from the Project will be completedwith povernment financing.
Although the scope o f the AF supported activities is being significantly reduced, it is
important to point out that all o f the activities will still be completed by the Government.
The PAC provides guaranteed government financing for the implementationof all ofthe
Project works, althoughtheir completion inmany cases will be well beyond Project
closing date. Activities that will be cancelled under the Water Resources Management
component will also be completed by the Brazilian government, although beyondthe
closing date, using government resources.

12. Maximize disbursement and limit loan cancellation. Eventhough there is
agreement that the Project scope needs to be significantly reduced, inorder to limit the
amount o f loan cancellation, the restructuring includes increasing the disbursement
percentage to 100%.

13, Needto revise results indicators. The cancellation o f a number o f activities from the
Project and a determination that some o f the indicators were not measurable by Project
closing resulted inthe need to revise the Project indicators and targets (Table 3).

111. Proposed Changes

14. The following are the proposed changes, which are also reflected inTables 1,2, and
3.

0  The revision of Project scope, targets and result indicators

    o Project scope is reduced cancelingsome of the Water Resources Management
         activities and 10works from the Priority Works component. The AF was
         designed to support 14works that were pre-approved duringAF preparation. An




                                                 4

        additional 3 works were later included for a total o f 17. There are now a total o f 7
        works to be implementedunder the revisedscope o f the AF.
    o The results indicators andtargets are revisedto reflect the new Project scope and
        to ensure they are measurable by Project completion (see Table 3). Because some
        o f the PDO outcome indicators are revisedthis is a 1'' order restructuring.

0  The revision of costs, loanamount anddisbursement percentages

    o Total Projectcosts for AF are reduced from US$200 million to US$ 72.5 million
        and US$23 million i s cancelled from the US$50 million loan (see Table 1);
    o The disbursement percentage for all components is increasedto 100% (see Table
        2).

IV. Analysis

15. The overall Project designremains unchanged. The proposed changes scale down
the AF supported activities without altering the type of activities being supported and will
not have a significant effect on the original technical, institutional or social aspects o f the
Project. The proposed changes do not affect the environmental category (A) o f the
Project nor do they trigger any new safeguards. The proposed changes do not involve any
exceptions to Bank policies. The remainingUS$27 million inthe AF Loan i s expected to
be fully expended by the current closing date of December 21, 2009 andfully disbursed
during a 4-month grace periodin2010.

16. No economic analysis was carried out for the Water Resources Management
component as is normal for these kinds o f technical assistance components. The main
economic and financial eligibility criteria for works presented inthe Project Paper for the
AF loanremainthe same. Detailed economic and financial analyses have been carried
out for each o f the 7 subprojects that remaininthe restructuredscope.

17. Technical criteria for Project activities inboththe Water Resources Management
and Priority Works components remainthe same as presented inthe Project Paper for the
AF Loan.

18. Financial management requirements set out inthe Project Paper for the AF Loan
remain the same. Procurement requirements have been revised during Project
implementation inaccordance with new procurement assessments by the Bank, which
include higher thresholds for certain procurement methods and for prior review o f
contracts. Changes have beenreflectedinthe updated procurement plans.

V. ExpectedOutcomes

19. The PDOs have not been changed. The ResultsFramework and Monitoring table
from the Project Paper for the AF Loan are for the AF supported activities and have been
revisedto reflect changes inoutcome indicators and targets as presentedinTable 3, with
their respectivejustifications. The original Project activities will be evaluated inrelation
to the Results Framework and Monitoring Table included inthe Project Appraisal
Document for the original Project.

20. Inaddition to the Results Framework andMonitoring table, the Project Paper for
the AF Loan included a list of activities to be supportedby the Project. This list has also
beenrevised inline withthe restructured scope as follows:

        Institutional strengtheningof the water resources planning and management
        agencieso f the 27 States and at the federal level;
        Updating and adapting water laws in8 States;
        Creation or strengtheningof 6 river basin committees infederal or state river
        basins;

        Carrying out training events for institutions of the national water resources
        management system in 10 states;
        Preparing 3 state water resourcesplans, 10river basinplans, and 5 proposals for
        water bodies quality classification system;
        Preparing strategic institutional developmentplans in4 states;
        Preparing 3 hydrogeological studies, 4 water availability studies, and 2 water
        infrastructure design studies;

        Preparing a pilot regulatory framework proposal for shared managementof an
        interstateaquifer;

        Designing the national water quality monitoring network;
        Development and upgrading of the national water resources information system;

         Strengtheningof national and statehydrometeorological monitoring networks
        with 100automated data collection platforms;
         Supporting 2 states inthe preparationof water resourcesmanagement and
        investmentprograms, to befinanced with national and international resources;
         Bulkwater supply planning for 1,500 municipalities (Water Supply Atlas);
         Development and updating of anational summary report on the status of
        availability and use of water resources;
         Implementationo f 7 water infrastructure works benefiting about 250,000 people
        intheNortheast Regionof Brazil.

VI. Benefits and Risks

21. The primary benefit is a greatly enhancedcapabilities and institutional framework
for water resourcesmanagement at the national, state and river basin levels. Mainly due


                                                   10

to the Project, that has supported a strong partnership betweenthe Bank and Brazil, the
country is at the vanguard o f developing countries inwater resources management and i s
considered an excellent example inhow to improve water resources management by
other parts o f the Bank and other developing countries throughout the world.

22. The main risksthat couldjeopardize the achievement o f the restructured outcome
targets andproposed mitigation measures include i):there i s a risk that further delays at
the federal and state levels would result innot completing some o f the Project activities
withinthe agreedtimeframe. This risk is considered to be low becausethere are adequate
budgetary resources and all of the major activities included inthe revised scope are either
underway or inthe final stages o f contracting; ii)there i s a risk that ANA'Sbudget could
be cut as a result of the Federal Governmentresponseto the global financial crisis. This
risk i s also considered to be low because the revised scope is very conservative compared
to available budgetary resources andthe cut would have to be very large to affect Project
implementation. The works budget i s considered to be reliable based on the Federal
Government decision to prioritize PAC resources.
