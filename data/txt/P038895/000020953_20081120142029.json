Improving capacity\n            for water quality monitoring and the corresponding\n            regulatory framework at the state level would reinforce\n            attention to water quality issues in a decentralized manner.\n            The implementation of water use charges and rates systems is\n            a new concept in the region. The payment by public agency\n            providers (e.g. State Water Companies) as well as\n            residential and industrial water users of bulk water charges\n            to basin agencies and/or SRHs may generate internal\n            controversy. In addition, the requirement that State water\n            providers and private users (including irrigation users)\n            obtain a water right from the relevant Federal or State\n            agency for the use of water resources may be controversial.\n            Effective participation of water users in the\n            decision-making process regarding the implementation of\n            hydraulic infrastructure is another controversial aspect\n            supported by the project. The project will be based on: (i)\n            improvements in the standards of living in the rural sector\n            related to improved health and income gains; and (ii)\n            increased beneficiary ability to cope with droughts. The\n            major negative impact is to assure fair and equitable\n            conflict resolution to prevent inequities from occurring and\n            obtain strong commitment from the Federal and State\n            Governments in this regard. Potential negative impacts of\n            the project include expropriation of 50 rural properties,\n            resulting in leaseback of 70 families, stoppage of\n            productive activities, cultural impacts and risks of\n            disintegration of family. The loss of infrastructure linked\n            to the Missi dam project consists of 70 houses, a school and\n            two cemeteries."}, "docdt": "2007-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
