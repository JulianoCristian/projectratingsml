satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: a longer-term, more comprehensive,\n            multisectoral, and process-focused approach to water\n            support, as has been recommended by the external advisory\n            panel of the independent evaluation group evaluation, may\n            require some changes in bank thinking about project\n            management and evaluation. Projects operating where both\n            federal and state institutions are involved require flexible\n            support from the project at the state level in line with\n            their stage of development and the use of horizontal\n            transfer of experiences among peer states. A country's\n            concerns for high transaction costs due to safeguards are\n            best addressed with clarity about what 'processes'\n            the safeguards entail, with an emphasis on the mechanisms to\n            address issues that will put public institutions and their\n            employees above reproach.
