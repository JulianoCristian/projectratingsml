F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
Promote rational and sustainable use and participatory management of water resources in Brazil in
general, and in the Northeast in particular. The project, which complements other Bank-supported
initiatives in the water sector including those in Northeastern states of Bahia and Ceará, would help
establish Federal and State regulatory and institutional frameworks. Once in place these changes would
help formulate and implement efficient and sustainable water resources management policies and plans
by: (i) strengthening relevant federal and state institutions; (ii) decentralizing water resources
management to river basin committees and local water user associations (WUAs); (iii) developing
mechanisms and institutional arrangements to promote efficient use of resource, allocation and
enforcement of water use rights; and (iv) setting up a well-coordinated monitoring and evaluation
system to track project performance and assessment of its impact on beneficiaries.

  Provide reliable and sustainable access to water for domestic, municipal, and other uses in priority
river basins in the Northeast, by: (i) supporting the construction and/or installation of
storage/conveyance structures and distribution networks to optimize the storage, delivery, and use of
water supplies within selected areas with high concentration of poor rural households; and (ii)
establishing sustainable administration, operation and maintenance (A, O&M) systems for water supply
infrastructure, including sound and efficient cost-recovery mechanisms. Project-financed infrastructure
investments in bulk water supply, by ensuring an increased year-round water supply for human
consumption and productive purposes, would provide sustainable and reliable supplies of water to rural
and semi-urban populations of the Northeast, and reduce the vulnerability of this region's economy, to
cyclical and prolonged droughts. This would lead to significant improvements in the standards of living,
health and sanitation of beneficiary populations, and would enhance local employment opportunities.

  With the creation of the National Water Agency (ANA) in December 2000, the project has also
supported the consolidation of ANA and its institutional strengthening as one of its main objectives.

       Notes: * Unsatisfactory Implementation Performance (IP) ratings reflect the challenges faced by the Project with the
       change in Administration in 2003, at Federal and most States levels; the cancellation of US$40 million from the Loan
       Amount; and difficulties in raising counterpart funds by Federal and States Governments due mostly to fiscal and
       budgetary constraints.
             ** As a result of the restructuring, the AF picked up pace in 2009, however, considering that ISR 24 was the
             last ISR of the project and needed to reflect the complete progress of the AF , IP was rated at Moderately

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. This Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report evaluates the performance of the
Brazil Federal Water Resources Management Project (PROAGUA), implemented as the original
project, approved March 13, 1998, and an Additional Financing with the same project
development objectives, approved November 27, 2006, and both closing on December 31, 2009.
In the late 1990s when the project was contemplated, less than 10 percent of the rural population
in the Northeast1 had access to safe water, and only 4 percent had proper residential sanitation
facilities. In periods of drought, many rural inhabitants had to walk several hours to the nearest
water source, often of low quality, while others had to wait for the arrival of publicly financed (at
great cost) water trucks. Even when there was no drought, it was the rural poor who suffered
most from inadequately operated and maintained infrastructure. Unreliable and poor-quality
water supplies contributed to dismal health and sanitation conditions and aggravated rural
poverty. Without appropriate institutions to direct and coordinate, and without a comprehensive
set of instruments developed to evaluate infrastructure subprojects comprehensively, the volume
of investments to address the above issues had fallen far short of what was needed.

Institutions and Instruments

2. At the institutional level, the Bank had been involved in the sector with projects such as the
Ceará Urban Development and Water Resources Management project (approved in 1994) that
had been strengthening local governments and water resources management in some states. The
focus of these projects was on the municipalities instead of a river basin. One of the reasons for
this lack of focus on river basins was that at the Federal level the institutions were either
nonexistent or weak, and coordination beyond a state for a river basin could not be delivered. In
addition, the laws at the national level had not been enacted yet. For example, though the State
of Ceará had a Water Law since 1992, it was only in January 1997 that the National Water Law
(No. 9433) was enacted. This law established for the whole nation that water resources
management (Gestão de Recursos Hídricos, Water Resources Management/WRM) in Brazil
must address the need for multiple uses of waters (instead of hydropower having a priority, as
was the case in the past), and that the river basin is the unit for WRM.

3. At the beginning of the project, many of the questions on instruments and processes for the
operation of river basin committees had not been addressed. These included: Who should be
members of the committee: federal, state, and municipal representatives; representatives of water
users, civil society, and indigenous communities? What should be the priority areas for such a
committee? Collect water charges for all uses, both inside and outside the basin? Develop a
roadmap to establish a water agency for the basin? What should the decennial water resources
plan include? Should it define a strategy for the rehabilitation, recovery, and environmental
conservation of the basin? Some answers to the above questions had been developing based on
Bank projects, but comprehensive guidance for the national level was yet to be established.

 The Project area includes the nine states of the Northeast Region of Brazil plus the Semi-arid part of the State of
Minas Gerais.

Investments

4. In Northeast Brazil, operation and maintenance (O&M) of existing hydraulic infrastructure
had been grossly inadequate. Over the past century, many reservoirs had been built in the
Northeast, costing the Federal Government over US$2 billion, in current terms, during the
period. In general, these reservoirs stored water just for local consumption, with no pipelines to
convey water to towns or rural communities located in the same river basins. Local landowners
managed the operation of these systems according to their own needs, ignoring the collective
interest and/or potential participation of both upstream and downstream water users. In addition,
maintenance had suffered from the lack of satisfactory cost-recovery mechanisms. As a result,
water availability and reliability were much lower than what could be achieved through proper
water resources management and operation.

5. In the provision of hydraulic infrastructure, the World Bank's involvement had been even
longer. In response to overwhelming demand by small rural communities, the Northeastern
States and the Bank had financed, under the reformulated Northeast Rural Development Program
and the follow-on Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects (RPAPs), small-scale rural water supply
systems in the semi-arid region. The Northeast Rural Development Program committed about
US$58 million for the construction of some 2,700 simple rural water supply systems, small
dams, and wells, and demand by rural communities for this type of investment was expected to
continue to be strong under the RPAPs. There was, however, not a general strategy that could
improve water availability and reliability to the majority of these disconnected systems.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

6. The development objectives of PROAGUA were to:

   ·   Promote rational and sustainable use and participatory management of water resources in
       Brazil in general, and in the Northeast in particular; and
   ·   Provide reliable and sustainable access to water for domestic, municipal, and other uses
       in priority river basins in the Northeast.

Key Performance Indicators

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Project Development Objectives (PDOs) included
in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)

7. On management of water resources: Stressing the rational and sustainable use of water the
PAD included the KPI: Establishment of regulatory and institutional frameworks to formulate
and implement efficient and sustainable water resources management policies and plans at the
federal level and in all 10 participating states. Stressing participatory management, the PAD
included the KPI: In the areas benefitting directly from the project's infrastructure component,
increase in the number of water user associations (Associação de Usuários de Água, WUAs)
established within the first three years of the project. Other outcome indicators that would lead to
rational and sustainable use were also included (see below). The original WUA indicator was
later amplified (for additional financing) to also indicate percentage of communities and


                                                 2
localities that benefitted from program works that have active and regular representation and
participation in the water management systems (user associations, river basin committees).

8. On access: Stressing the volume of water, the project included the KPI: Increase in the
number of households in project areas with year-round access to water for human consumption
by 15 percent by the second year of project implementation. In the additional financing, after the
project was delivering on volume increases, two impact-oriented indicators stressing health
issues were introduced: (a) reduction in prevalence rates of waterborne diseases in the areas
served by PROAGUA works; and (b) degree of improvements in housing or in the hydro-
sanitary system of households in areas benefitting from PROAGUA works.

9. From the various project outputs indicated in the PADs, (a long list was provided in Annex 6
of the PAD), Table 1 presents a set of project outcomes with KPIs.2

10. The PDO remained unchanged throughout the life of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11. The target population constituted some of the poorest segments of the Brazilian population,
with annual per capita incomes of about US$230 and socioeconomic indicators that were
significantly lower than for Brazilians living in other regions. From infrastructure works in the
first project years alone, the number of beneficiaries was estimated at some 1.3 million, or about
260,000 families. Of these, about half lived in isolated rural communities and small semi-rural
centers (of less than 15,000 inhabitants each), while the rest belonged to relatively larger
agglomerations of 20,000 to 50,000 people. Only Mossoró, the second-most-populated town in
the State of Rio Grande do Norte, could be called an important town. Statistics of the Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) showed
that, even in these semi-urban centers in the project area, close to 50 percent of the households
lived on a monthly income that was less than the minimum wage.

12. The public institutions in the water sector at both the federal and state levels were also to
benefit from the project. The project was expected to bring important, lasting institutional
benefits to the Brazilian water sector (a) by supporting the establishment of sound legal and
institutional frameworks at the Federal level and in all 10 participating states; (b) by financing
bulk water supply infrastructure that was viable not only in technical and economic terms but
also from institutional, social, and environmental standpoints; and (c) by developing financially
sustainable systems for their A, O&M. In addition, the project was to provide lessons and models
that could be replicated in other river basins both in the Northeast and elsewhere in Brazil.

1.5 Original Components

13. The project, broadly encompassing the water resources sector in the Northeast, covered all
water users--those who own, or should be granted, a water right. Its main focus was policy
support and institutional strengthening, to be achieved through its "soft" (WRM and studies and
project design) components both at the Federal and State/local levels. Project funds for these
activities and for the construction of priority infrastructure works were to be available to
participating States on a competitive basis, depending on their institutional, legal, and regulatory
performance that would be monitored based on an institutional "matrix" that was defined
specifically for each State. Works to be financed were expected to meet strict eligibility criteria,
laid out in the Project Operational Manual. It was expected that the studies and planning
exercises conducted under the project would feed through into additional investment programs or
a follow-up phase of PROAGUA. Other project components were expected to finance the
development of a specific WRM plan, together with pilot investments, for the São Francisco
river basin; and project management, monitoring, and evaluation.3 Even though the project also
included some water supply infrastructure, its main purpose was to finance investments in bulk
water linked to sound feasibility criteria, that were used as leverage for the structuring and/or
strengthening of water resources management in the states.

  Both stages of the project had the same type of components, presented differently in each stage. The Original
Project components are summarized below, with details in Annex 2.


                                                      4
14. Component 1: Water Resources Management (WRM) (US$53.1 million ­ including
contingencies, 16 percent of total estimated cost).The component helped establish the National
Water Resources Management System (SINGREH), pursuant to the 1997 National Water Law.
The component was to provide the necessary technical and financial resources to strengthen the
Federal Government, 10 state governments, river basin committees, and user associations to
effectively manage water resources in the Northeast. The Federal Government was responsible
for the implementation of SINGREH in rivers that cross state boundaries, the so-called "federal
rivers," and the State Governments in the "state rivers", in both cases with strong stakeholder
participation in the decision-making process. The WRM component had two major elements: (a)
institutional development, and (b) creation of the technical basis for the SINGREH.

15. Component 2: Infrastructure (US$212.0 million ­ including contingencies, 64 percent of
total estimated cost). This component was to finance the construction of water storage and
conveyance infrastructure to provide reliable water supplies (in terms of both quality and
quantity) for towns and communities with enduring problems of water supply for domestic
consumption4. The Federal Project Preparation Unit, responsible to the federal Secretariat of
Water Resources (SRH), selected the first-year works based on rigorous multi-criteria screening,
including: (a) the nature of the problem; (b) socioeconomic conditions prevailing in the area; (c)
level of local institutions' commitment; (d) consistency with water resources management plans;
and (e) level of technical preparation of the proposals submitted by the participating States. The
component also was to elaborate the eligibility criteria to be used for selecting proposed
subprojects and incorporate them into the Operational Manual.

16. Component 3: Planning, Studies, and Project Design (US$41.6 million ­ including
contingencies, 13 percent of total estimated cost). The component was to: (a) produce water
resources plans, which are the basic tools for implementing a sustainable water resources
management system in the region; (b) develop specific studies aimed to increase rationality in
the use of water (action on demand) and water availability and supply; and (c) develop a
portfolio of subprojects of needed infrastructure expansion, sufficiently detailed to be procured,
for construction under the infrastructure component of the project. The component was to have
two major elements: (a) planning, at both the State and river basin levels; and (b) specific studies
and pre-investment studies, necessary for the identification of solutions to the imbalance between
water demand and availability, during dry spells, in river basins of the semi-arid region.

17. Component 4: São Francisco Watershed (US$8.6 million ­ including contingencies, 3
percent of total estimated cost). The component was to: (a) support the creation and effective
start-up of the São Francisco River Basin Committee, as defined by the National Water Law; (b)
provide financial support toward the development of WUAs in the basin; and (c) develop a
simulation model for water allocation under the principle that water is an economic good, with
emphasis on aspects such as: (a) the system of water allocation; (b) the costs for the different
groups of users; (c) revenues of the Water Agency, also to be created as per the Water Law; and

  Project component focused on multi-purpose bulk water supply infrastructure that was mainly used for domestic
consumption.



                                                        5
(d) the priority investments, at the river basin level, that would be financed by the future São
Francisco Water Agency.

18. Component 5: Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (US$14.7 million ­ including
contingencies, 4 percent of total estimated cost). This component was subdivided into three
major interrelated but autonomous elements: (a) project oversight at the highest level; (b) project
management at federal level, in support of State Project Management Units (UEGPs) (see WRM
component); and (c) project monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and auditing.

1.6 Revised Components

19. During project implementation, two new components were added to the loan agreement to
meet new demands derived from the change in the Government of Brazil's (GOB's) structure:
(d) watershed management models and pilot initiatives that enabled ANA to prepare studies and
pilot experiences related to water resources management (WRM) issues for federal waters; and
(e) complementary studies to support the implementation of water resources infrastructure in the
Northeast region that enabled MI to carry out Federal studies and plans to implement
infrastructure in priority watersheds in the Northeast region. Nevertheless, the above two
components and the São Francisco River Basin Component were never effectively implemented
with project funds, as other sources of funding were used. However, the activities implemented
by the Government were consistent with project objectives.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

20. Reallocation and Cancellation of Funds: Under the original project, the amounts allocated
to the different categories were adjusted to allow for the proper reconciliation of expenses made
under the Loan and the appropriate disbursement of funds. The original loan had a cancellation
of US$40 million of proceeds mainly due to the devaluation of the Real and consequent over
dimension of loan funds compared to appraisal estimates. Under the additional financing, US$23
million were cancelled from the Loan amount because they would not be completed in time as a
result of delays in start up and implementation of activities.

21. Extensions of Closing Date: The original project had two extensions of Closing Date, from
December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2005 and then to December 31, 2006 to allow for an
appropriate timetable for the Government to conclude project implementation, ensuring the
successful achievement of an expanded set of PDO indicators. With the approval of the
Additional Financing, the whole project closing date was extended to December 21, 2009.
Despite strong requests from the Government, the additional financing closed at the end of its
allotted three years, in line with the Bank's policy of a maximum length of 3 years for AF
projects.

22. Amendments to the Loan Agreement: The original project had a first amendment in May
2000, which, among other things, inserted two new components. The second amendment
(January 2002) increased allocation for national public tenders. The third amendment (November
2003) reduced the loan amount by US$40 million. In addition, some important changes were
requested by the GOB and were reflected in the amendments. In 1999, the GOB reorganized its
ministries and created the Ministry of National Integration (MI) responsible for, among other

                                                6
tasks, constructing water infrastructure. In the following year, the GOB created the National
Water Agency (ANA), which became responsible for implementing the water resources
management activities at the Federal level and for assisting the states in this task. As a result, the
GOB requested to replace SRH with ANA and MI. ANA was made responsible for developing
the activities related to water resources management. MI, through its Secretariat of Hydraulic
Infrastructure (SIH), was responsible for assisting the States in implementing the water resources
infrastructure.

23. Additional Financing: The Federal Water Resources Management Additional Loan was
designed to help finance the costs associated with scaled-up activities to enhance the impact of a
well-performing project in the water sector and to continue to support the implementation of
actions and activities that promote and reinforce the achievement of the original objectives. The
development objectives remained unchanged and the components were rearranged and
consolidated into fewer ones. The Loan in the amount of US$50 million was approved by the
Board on December 19, 2006, became effective on November 8, 2007, and the Closing Date was
December 21, 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

24. The project was designed to support and strengthen the Government recent strategy in the
water resources sector. It also appropriately reflected the analysis and thinking that went into the
preparation of the National Law on Water Resources (No. 9.433), approved in January 1997,
which represented a fundamental step towards sustainable management of water resources in
Brazil, with emphasis on the concept of participatory and decentralized water resources
management and the creation of ANA and MI. Project scope complemented other Bank-financed
projects that addressed:

   ·   The water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in selected States in North, Northeast and
       Central West Brazil (PMSS II ­ Second Water Sector Modernization Project, Projeto de
       Modernização do Setor Saneamento II ­ P043420, approved in 1998);
   ·   Development of basic urban infrastructure, including for water supply, in about 40 cities
       in the State of Ceará (PROURB ­ Ceará Urban Development and Water Resources
       Management Project, Projeto de Desenvolvimento Urbano e Gerenciamento de Recursos
       Hídricos do Ceará, approved in 1994);
   ·   Measures to improve water resources management in Ceará (PROGERIRH - Ceará
       Integrated Water Resources Management Project, Projeto de Integração e
       Gerenciamento dos Recursos Hídricos do Estado do Ceará, approved in 2000);
   ·   Policy and institutional measures and priority infrastructure works in three river basins in
       Bahia (PGRH - Bahia Water Resources Management Project, Projeto de Gestão de
       Recursos Hídricos do Estado da Bahia, approved in 1997); and,
   ·   Small-scale rural infrastructure such as simple water supply systems (Northeast RPAPs).

25. Based on the extensive experience in the region and in the sector, the project design had the
right objectives and institutional framework, which could well incorporate an integrated water


                                                  7
resources management approach at the basin and local level to reconcile cross-sectoral water
demands. In terms of realism, the project design was not overly ambitious in its coverage and
used the window of opportunity created by the enactment of the federal law, thus making the
project a path-breaking contribution to Brazil's water resources sector. In one aspect, it was
overly optimistic. Although cost recovery, water tariffs, and tradable water rights were well
understood conceptually, project design did not fully take into account the risks of controversy
and lack of collection experience, which precluded introduction of water use charges prior to
delivering demonstrable benefits to users. In that sense, Project design seems to not have
entirely appreciated the complex political economy of introduction of bulk water rights and
water charges, especially in a rather short time period of only five years. However, even in this
complex area, the project made a substantive contribution, as evidenced by progress in several
states and should be commended for taking on such a complicated and sensitive issue.

Quality at Entry

26. As observed by the Latin America and the Caribbean Region (LCOSU5) Quality-at-Entry
assessment, the project was rated "Fully Satisfactory." LCOSU found that the project had
successfully incorporated the main provisions of the Bank's Water Resources Management
Policy Paper and generated commitment from the Federal Government and 10 State
Governments. However, it also flagged as risks: (a) possible delays in implementation of the
WRM component, and (b) sustainability of investments. There was no Quality at Entry rating by
the QAG.

Assessment of Quality at Entry

27. Given the overly optimistic expectations of adoption of cost recovery policies and their
implementation through water charges, the risks of delays in implementation of the WRM
component did indeed come about. For these reasons, the ICR rates Quality at Entry of the
project Moderately Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

Factors Affecting Project Implementation

28. The enactment of a National Water Law, No. 9433, in 1997, just before the project was
approved in April 1998, was crucial because the law put to rest, after considerable deliberation,
various intersectoral issues. Brazil gave top priority to access to water for human consumption in
the Northeast, and the project was seen as a means to deliver on that promise that was
instrumental in good implementation. The availability of State "role models" also made it easier
for the States that followed to develop their institutions at the State level relatively fast. On the
negative side, the economic/financial crisis that hit Brazil in September 1998 made it difficult for
the GOB to provide counterpart funding and hampered implementation of the infrastructure

                                                 8
component in the first two years. The change of government at the Federal level demanded time
and effort to regain momentum during the implementation in 2003.

29. The Additional Financing Loan, although approved by the Board in December 2006, became
effective only in November 2007 due to unforeseen delays in the Brazilian Senate (which needed
to approve the Loan); and the changes in administration at Federal and State levels following the
elections at the end of 2006. Additionally, the Project teams in the Ministry of National
Integration and the State water departments were deactivated and could only be reactivated
immediately after the AF Loan became effective. All of this resulted in nearly a one and a half
year delay of the implementation of a three-year AF, which made infeasible the completion of
many of the Project works and some water resources management activities within the Project
financing period. During the mid-term review of the AF in September 2008 when all of the
teams were reactivated and significant progress was being made, the implementing agencies
requested an extension in order to ensure the completion of Project activities. The possibility of
an extension was later discussed, however it was decided against because of the overall length of
the Project (8 years for original Project and 3 years for AF), and because Bank policy does not
allow for extensions of AF beyond 3 years from the date of AF approval. The Project was then
restructured in order to reduce its scope and Loan amount.

30. Restructuring: The Additional Financing was restructured in June 2009 to: (1) revise
Project scope, targets, and result indicators, including cancellation of some water resources
activities and 10 works; (2) revise Project costs related to the 3-year AF period from US$200
million to US$ 72.5 million, cancellation of US$ 23 million from the AF loan amount, and
increase in the disbursement percentage to 100%. The main reasons for these changes were: (1)
delays in start up and implementation of AF Loan financed activities; and (2) ensuring that
results indicators were in line with the restructured Project, measurable within the timeframe for
Project completion and in line with the activities being supported by the Project. The reduced
Project scope still included some priority works and water resources management activities that
were to be completed after the Project closing date. The Government committed to completing
these activities with counterpart funds and there was an agreement with OPCS to delay the
preparation of the ICR to fully take into account the results of these activities. Although the
scope of the AF supported activities was significantly reduced, the activities would still be
completed by the Government, however, their completion in many cases was to be well beyond
Project closing date. Activities that were cancelled under the Water Resources Management
component would also be completed by the Brazilian government, although beyond the closing
date, using government resources. Accordingly, Bank supervision continued until June 30, 2010,
six months after Project closing. Details on achievements during the AF period are discussed in
Section 3 and in Annex 2.

31. An additional implementation problem arose in December 2008 when the Brazilian Federal
Controller (Tribunal de Contas da União) issued a ruling that if followed would go against Bank
procurement guidelines, affecting procurement under all Bank-financed projects as well as the
Inter-American Development Bank supported programs. While this issue was resolved after a
few months, several procurement processes under the Project were stalled. This situation was
resolved later and procurement procedures of the Bank continued to be used in the project.




                                                9
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control

32. The GoB always showed strong commitment throughout project implementation.
Implementation was aided by a clear institutional framework at the Federal level from the third
year of implementation onwards. Initially, the project led to interministerial squabbles, but the
Bank's proactive engagement of the GOB in the discussion led to a clearer line of
responsibilities.

Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control

33. In spite of the interinstitutional conflicts indicated above, a very competent team was formed
within the Secretariat of Water Resources in the Ministry of Environment (SRH/MMA) to
coordinate project implementation. Implementation was strengthened with the transfer of
responsibilities from the Secretariat of Water Resources in MMA to the recently created National
Water Agency (ANA), for the implementation of the Water Resources Management Component;
and from the Secretariat of Water Resources­Ministry of Environment (MMA) to the Secretariat
of Hydraulic Infrastructure, under the Ministry of National Integration, for the implementation of
the Infrastructure Component in 2000. The project teams also focused on strict compliance with
Bank Procurement Procedures and delivery of high standards in technical specification for
procurement of equipment.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

34. M&E Design: Overall M&E design was dynamic and comprehensive. It was dynamic
because, as goals were achieved, M&E indicators were refined and amplified. This suited the
project because it started just after the Federal Water Law was enacted, and the participating
states were in different stages of their development in project-related matters. Monitoring and
Evaluation was comprehensive because in order to support the application/enforcement of the
law, the project required implementation of a long list of activities (as is amply demonstrated by
the Institutional Development subcomponent of WRM--see section 1.5 above). Annex 6 of the
PAD provided detailed information on output indicators. The outcome indicators were
continuously improved, and at the time the Additional Financing was prepared, they had been
firmly in place for an extended period.

35. M&E Implementation: Primary responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation rested
with the Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (UMA), a special independent unit created for
overseeing projects activities. Together with the federal and State UEGPs, the UMA (in regular
consultation with river basin committees, WUAs and other local stakeholders) monitored project
progress and identified implementation bottlenecks, in terms of both physical and institutional
performance. At the level of Outputs, the M&E system monitored the project closely, which,
given the enormity of the task, made M&E implementation satisfactory. In terms of Outcomes
(as per the table in section 3.1, below), the M&E system monitored well: (a) satisfactory
application/enforcement of the Federal Water Law, existing state water laws in seven states, and
creation of state water laws in the remaining three states in the Northeast; and, (b) establishment
of State Water Resources Management Entities (SRHs) capable of: (i) supporting competing
water users in conflict resolution; (ii) ensuring rational use and equitable distribution of water



                                                10
resources; (iii) administrating water rights system; and (iv) establishing integrated infrastructure
management systems for existing and proposed new facilities for water storage and distribution
in priority river basins.

36. M&E Utilization: Utilization of data from M&E of this project led to refinement of models
for predicting performance of infrastructure investments based on rigorous multi-criteria
screening, including: (a) the nature of the problem; (b) socioeconomic conditions prevailing in
the area; (c) level of local institutions' commitment; (d) consistency with water resources
management plans; and (e) level of technical preparation of the proposals submitted by the
participating States.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Safeguards

37. Adequate planning with an environmental strategy and close field-based supervision for this
Category A project ensured satisfactory compliance with environmental safeguards. Procedures
were in place, and safeguard specialists were part of the team during preparation and throughout
project implementation. The project financed a regional environmental analysis during
preparation. Later, during implementation, the project developed and improved a screening
system that continues to be used by project beneficiary states. In addition, the project financed
major environmental studies, important environmental components (through subprojects, for
example, Aguas Vermelhas, in Minas Gerais), and environmental education programs in almost
all participating States. In a country with strong civil society groups, PROAGUA was never the
source of any complaint. This may have been due to community involvement and stakeholder
participation in river basins' management.

38. In terms of compliance with Bank safeguards, despite the large number of infrastructure
systems that have been financed by PROAGUA, overall there were no major unaddressed
environmental issues. However, sometimes members of the project's technical implementation
team, at both the state and national level, were unfamiliar with Bank Safeguards and the project's
environmental guidelines. Cases of noncompliance included instances where (a) functioning
subprojects held construction licenses, but not operating licenses; (b) subprojects, once licensed,
did not conform with licensing requirements; (c) inadequate implementation of programs for
environmental and sanitary education; and (d) lack of implementation of mitigation measures.

39. When problems were detected, they were dealt with effectively. For example, there were two
small (simplified) subprojects of the Sistema Padrão Central that were not in compliance with
Bank safeguards OP 4.11 (Cultural Properties) and OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats). These
subprojects, for a planned small water source from an underground river situated in protected
areas and in the vicinity of culturally significant caves, were being implemented without
precautionary environmental impact assessment and licensing. Implementation of the works was
halted and the compliance issues were addressed.




                                                11
Social Safeguards

40. The project provided training, and mobilization support at the community level. Project
implementation was highly participatory involving state agencies and water users and
beneficiaries. Consultation took place upstream when watershed and state water resources plans
were developed, and downstream during the development prior to and during implementation of
subprojects. Beneficiaries had the opportunity to provide inputs and suggestions. Often, project
designs were adjusted to respond to their inputs. The final designs of most subprojects
implemented (for example, Aguas Vermelhas, Congo, Garrincho, and Serra de Santana) were
influenced and modified by local communities' inputs. These designs included the location of
standpipes for water withdrawal, communities to be serviced, and the O&M model to be
adopted.

41. In terms of indigenous people, model terms of reference were developed following OP 4.20
to be used in the evaluation process of any subproject that could possibly affect indigenous areas.
However, no subproject triggered this policy, as Brazilian law highly restricts the
implementation of interventions that could possibly affect indigenous lands.

Financial Management

42. In general, each implementing agency underwent a financial management review during
project implementation, to verify that the project's accounting and reporting system was in place.
Audits complying with Bank requirements were executed and furnished to the Bank, for
monitoring purposes and as part of the project reports and financial reports for the project
covering the each calendar quarter were prepared in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank.

43. The project's financial management system used Brazil's Integrated Federal Financial
Administration System (Sistema Integrado de Administração Financeira, SIAFI) and the Project
Information System (Sistema de Informações Gerenciais, SIGMA). They complied with OP/BP
10.02 and the Guidelines for Assessment of Financial Management Arrangements, to:

   ·   Ensure that funds were used only for their intended purposes efficiently and economically
       while implementing agreed activities;
   ·   Enable the preparation of financial reports that show costs budgeted and incurred for the
       current period and the total budget and cost of the project to date;
   ·   Enable the Federal Implementing Agencies (National Water Agency and the Secretariat
       of Hydraulic Infrastructure of the Ministry of Integration) and participating states to
       efficiently monitor implementation of the project; and,
   ·   Safeguard the project's resources and assets.

Procurement

44. In 1993, the GoB passed a new legislation regulating procurement (Law 8,666/93). The
legislation, which is in effect to date, is very detailed, as indicated by its many (125) articles. The
Government has also been putting a lot of effort into increasing transparency and improving the



                                                  12
supervision of Government procurement by making use of e-procurement mechanisms, such as
COMPRASNET and OBRASNET.

45. Procurement performance and contract management under this project is mixed. In general,
implementing agencies were familiar with the World Bank's procurement policies and
procedures and make use of the Standard Bidding Documents (Documento Padrão de Licitações,
SBD), but there are shortcomings in their application and interpretation, which have generally
resulted in delays.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

46. Federal and state institutions completed the project, which continues to successfully attract
new program initiatives, such as the Federal Integrated Water Sector Project (P112073), Rio
Grande do Norte Integrated Water Resources Management Project (P089929), Pernambuco
Sustainable Water Project (P108654) and Sergipe Water Project (P112074), including integrated
actions on water resources management and water supply and sanitation; and the Bahia
Integrated Health and Water Management Project (P095171). The project design and
implementation focused from the beginning on sustainable institutional capacity development
and use of country systems. The project had fully integrated Project Management Units (UGPs)
that operated within the federal and state frameworks and promoted institutional development of
various project implementing agencies and ministries. However, due to the lack of permanent
staff, these agencies often had to use consultants. This solution, while effective during project
implementation, did not produce the level of sustainability required to implement long term
water programs as needed.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

47. To better understand the relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation, the project
can be mapped with Annex 1 (Project Design Summary) of the PAD turned horizontally,
showing how components led to attainment of the PDOs (while dropping the indicators and data
collection elements) (see Table 2).

                                      of both physical and institutional
                                      performance.



48. The project achieved significant results in terms of implementing and supporting cutting-
edge approaches to WRM regulatory and institutional frameworks at the federal and target state
levels, and timely and relevant institutional strengthening of each state. It also contributed to
other important advances in the WRM sector in Brazil, including: (i) clear eligibility and

                                                           14
evaluation criteria for identifying hydraulic infrastructure investments in the target river basins;
(ii) significant beneficiary participation in subproject planning, design and implementation; (iii)
allowing in the project design for the fact that the different participating states had very different
capacity starting points, and tailoring project interventions to match these differences, while
successfully using `role model' states, such as Ceará,; (iv) successfully implementing very large
engineering design and civil works construction subprojects through state PMUs with federal
oversight; (vi) persistence, patience and pragmatism in implementation ­ despite there being
many factors outside of the control of the Bank and the government counterparts which slowed
down implementation at critical junctures; and (vii) competitive basis for accessing project funds
by state on a first-come first-serve basis.

49. The PDOs have high overall relevance because the CAS (FY 97-00) and the CPS (FY 08-
11) goals fully recognize the priority given by the Government to the project activities, its
emphasis in strengthening water resources management, and the actions to reduce poverty in
Brazil's most affected regions. The Project was path-breaking in the sustainable management of
natural resources using modern instruments for planning, monitoring, licensing and construction
of infrastructure to benefit mostly the rural poor. In addition, active participation of water users
is vital to reach sustainability and practical agreements for water allocation and operation and
maintenance activities. Institutions and infrastructure developed under the project were and still
are essential for productive activity in this semi-arid region. The priorities of the Government in
the water sector were maintained through the life of the Project and are again reflected in the
Country Partnership Strategy (FY 08-11) Moreover, other projects are deepening these priorities,
such as the state projects mentioned above and the Interáguas Project (P112073), presently in
advanced stage of preparation.

50. The above table also demonstrates the relevance of the design and implementation as shown
by the linkages between Outcomes and PDOs, and Outputs and Outcomes. While these linkages
appear to continue to be quite robust, there are developments underway that could weaken the
links in the future. Given that the political economy regarding charging for A, O&M remains
complex, the GoB might be tempted to continue subsidizing infrastructure maintenance from tax
resources, rather than continuing this important reform agenda.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

PDO 1: Promote rational and sustainable use and participatory management of water resources
in Brazil, in general, and in the Northeast, in particular.

PDO 2: Provide reliable and sustainable access to water for domestic, municipal, and other uses
in priority river basins in the Northeast.

51. While the project, in pursuit of PDO 1 delivered satisfactory application/enforcement of the
Federal Water Law, established capable State Water Resources Management Entities, and even
established integrated infrastructure management systems for existing and proposed new
facilities as required, it was unable to establish the requisite A, O&M systems and cost-recovery
mechanisms. In terms of institutions, the project was able to arrive at the structure presented in
Figure 1.

Figure 1. Project Structure




52. As shown in Figure 1, at the Federal level the project enabled the creation of the existing
structure for water management including the support for the critical start-up period of the
National Water Agency (ANA), with the mandate to enforce the National Water Resources
Policy. The project became the key instrument of SINGREH, particularly in the Semi-Arid
region. Upon ANA's creation, project resources made possible the establishment of a technical
team that strengthened the planning and management process.

53. At the state level, the project created the institutional structure indicated in Table 3 below.
The project contributed to the strengthening of water resources management entities through
acquisition of equipment and infrastructure, contracting of consultants to provide technical
support (provision of technical services, development of rights systems, information, among
others). In addition, it has supported the creation of states' water resources management agencies
(Rio Grande do Norte and Paraiba), and the restructuring of the Minas Gerais water resources
management entity.

54. All the above institutions, including most of those created before the project, were
strengthened under the project based on a comprehensive diagnosis of the institutional situation
in each state. After ANA was established, the project helped to determine the programs and
strategies needed to implement the SINGREH.

55. The results and impact of the project were different among the states, as a function of their
existing technical and institutional capacities when the project started. The project fostered
participatory water resources management, expanded the knowledge, its use and constraints, and
allowed for a selective preparation of projects and works with defined selection criteria. For the
majority of the states, the project was a tool for the development of technical and institutional
capacity in water resources management. In some of them, the project became the basis of the
state's capacity, such as in the states of Piauí and Alagoas that made some progress with the
project. At the other end there were states to which the project was equally important but more to
consolidate their water resources management systems already in place, as in the case of Minas
Gerais, Ceará and Bahia. These states already had ongoing institutional development in place
when the project started, as result of previous Bank-financed projects (PROURB in Ceará and
PGRH in Bahia; please refer to paragraph 23 for more detail).

56. Overall, in terms of their relative development, the States could have been divided into three
categories with Bahia, Ceará, and Rio Grande do Norte at the top; Minas Gerais, Paraiba,
Pernambuco, and Sergipe in the middle; and Alagoas, Maranhão, and Piauí behind them. After
the project, all have improved. In the top group, Ceará has surged ahead (including in the


                                                           17
introduction of cost-recovery mechanisms). Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Norte and Pernambuco
have come out as leaders from the second group. From the third group, Alagoas has caught up
with Paraiba and Sergipe, while Maranhao and Piauí, in spite of many developments, need
further attention.

57. The project was also key for the development of plans, diagnosis, water rights systems and
specific studies. Considering the differences among the states at project start-up, it was expected
that they would progress differently during the course of project implementation and that not all
states would arrive at the same level by end of the project. See Annex 2 for details on the States'
progress.

58. During implementation of the Additional Financing, the project supported the institutional
strengthening of water resources planning and management units in 26 states and the Federal
District. In addition, equipment to monitor and supervise water entitlements and to expand the
hydro-meteorological network was purchased in 17 states. To support the revision and/or
adequacy of the States' legal frameworks, studies were undertaken to review the State Laws in
the states of Ceará, Piauí and Maranhão.

59. The project prepared the feasibility and design studies that supported the construction of bulk
water supply systems that served two million people by the end of the project. Environmental
social, economic and financial studies were prepared for each of the project interventions that
helped to select the most pertinent alternatives to suit the local demands and with full
participation of the communities involved. It also led to the dissemination of these criteria for
funding projects that are now used by all projects of this type, as per the requirement of the
Federal Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas da União, TCU). The same idea underlies the
Certificates of Sustainability of Water Works issued by the ANA since 2002.

60. In terms of establishing the requisite A, O&M systems and cost-recovery mechanisms for
bulk water supply systems, which establish goals for the rational use of water and an efficient
functioning of the system, the project was partially successful. In terms of construction financed
under the project, all subprojects had to submit O&M plans, and required accountability for
regular maintenance. While some states, such as Bahia, Ceará, and Sergipe have instituted
similar mechanisms for some of the constructions with their own funds, others have been less
forthcoming.

61. Similarly, the cost-recovery mechanisms for bulk water supply have had mixed results. Some
states such as Bahia and Ceará have established their water management arrangements and made
themselves self-sufficient, while others have paid little attention to this important instrument to
finance their water management activities in a sustainable manner. At the same time, supported
by other Bank projects and Government interventions, most of the state water supply companies,
responsible for operating the systems, have been able to cover around 100% of their O&M costs.
A planned 25% of investment cost that was supposed to have been returned to the States' WRM
funds could only be achieved in a few cases (see Table 3 above).

62. As a result, this ICR rates the achievement of the PDO as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                18
3.3 Efficiency

63. In the PAD, the economic, financial and fiscal feasibility of the Project was calculated
separately for (1) Water Resources Management and (2) Infrastructure components.
Consequently, in this ICR for a clear comparison between the PAD estimate and actual results,
the same evaluation methodology applied ex ante by the Bank and used by GoB ex post to verify
the economic, financial and fiscal efficiency of the Project, has been used. Consequently, the
Water Resources Management Component has been evaluated using a Minimum Impact
Approach6, including a calculation of annual values of the most probable impacts, while the
Infrastructure Component was evaluated using traditional cost-benefit analysis. No attempt has
been made to evaluate other components.

64. As indicated in the PAD, the main benefit of WRM appears to have come through improved
coordination of US$210 Million of water-related investments leading to estimated benefits of
US$31.5 million. The difference with the ex-ante analysis was due to the unanticipated volume
of investments that benefitted from the institutional development (including development of
instruments) under the Project. The annual costs of the Water Resources Management
Component amounted to a value of US$5.75 million, below that estimated in the ex-ante
evaluation of US$8.7 million. This means that the minimum impact value to justify the
investment is only around 0.1% of the social value calculated post-project for the water resources
sector, which compares favorably with the minimum impact value of 0.2% at Appraisal.

65. For the Infrastructure Component, following the same methodology applied when the ex-ante
evaluation was made, the ex-post evaluation presented positive results although a little lower
than the estimate but above the threshold return of 12%. By analyzing the group of eight sub-
projects selected for implementation in the first year, it was verified that they had an internal
economic rate of return (IERR) of 15.6%, below the ex-ante estimate of 17.4%.

66. The cost to state and municipal governments to deliver water by trucks was estimated at
appraisal to be as much as US$4.50 per cubic meter compared to an estimated investment and
operation and maintenance cost under the project, in present value terms, of US$0.90 per cubic
meter.

67. It is noted that the appetite for civil works investments is much higher for investing in asset
management and sustainable financial and operational maintenance. However, the Project was
able to balance the interest of the states with the operation and maintenance agenda. Operation
and Maintenance Plans were prepared, and sound infrastructure criteria were used for decision-
making on new investments.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

  For further detail on this methodology, see Cummimngs R.,Dinar A., and Olson D., "New Evaluation Procedures
for a New Generation of Water-related Projects" (World Bank Technical Paper No 349), 1996.



                                                      19
68. Given the high relevance of the PDOs, the substantial achievement of PDO1, the full
achievement of PDO2, and the satisfactory efficiency of the project, the Overall Outcome rating
of Moderately Satisfactory reflects the project's achievements. A Satisfactory rating could have
been considered due to the overall achievements of the project; its importance to the structuring
and strengthening of water resources sector in Brazil; and to its capability of keeping a sustained
and successful dialogue and integration between federal and states water sectors. However,
shortcomings in establishing sustainable A, O&M systems for bulk water supply systems and
cost-recovery mechanisms, as well as final difficulties in the timely implementation of the
Additional Financing Loan, result in a Moderately Satisfactory rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

69. The target population constituted some of the poorest in Brazil as per the 1995 poverty
assessment of Brazil, and water scarcity especially affects this population group. The impact of
the project on the target population comes mainly from two sources: (a) through direct reduction
of the cost of piped water compared to that obtained from trucks; and (b) through the impact on
health from having much cleaner water. While the calculation of the impact on household
expenditure on water is straightforward, impacts on agricultural productivity increases and on
health are more complicated. As close to two million people benefitted from the provision of
clean water, the positive impact on poverty was large. (See indicators tables in Annex 2).

70. Project-financed infrastructure delivered bulk water and enabled the towns to provide better
piped water supply. The gender aspects come mainly from the incidence of the burden of
providing water at home, which appears to fall mainly on the women. Thus, lack of an adequate
supply of piped water can be expected to reduce the availability of time for other tasks for
women and girls in the household. If the burden is too onerous, it may even reduce their ability
to attend school and study at home, which in turn can be expected to reduce lifetime income and
even the woman's role within the family.

71. The project played a substantial positive role in social development through the formation of
351 WUAs. These gave voice to far-flung communities in the planning process for 10 or so river
basins and the construction that followed. With the introduction of bulk water charges to
communities, which had to be recouped from its members, the communities' appreciation for
this scarce resource possibly also changed.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

72. The project has been the main instrument to provide support for the creation and
strengthening of the ANA and to develop and implement water management legal and
institutional frameworks in the Northeast. The implementation of a comprehensive set of criteria
to select infrastructure subprojects is among the project's noteworthy achievements. It also
fostered the development of WRM plans in all 26 states of Brazil and the Federal District.
Finally, as indicated above, the project was instrumental in improving participation of the
beneficiaries in the water management process.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey

73. The beneficiary survey took place in 2007, upon completion of the Original Project activities.
The survey included the application of 812 questionnaires to a total of 3,503 people benefiting
from 18 works, out of the universe of 528,333 beneficiaries of these works in 9 states: Alagoas,
Bahia, Ceará, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. The
State of Maranhão was not included in the survey as the project did not finance any work in that
state. The survey results are a rough measure given that the project mostly financed bulk water
supply and final results would depend on how the water is supplied to the final consumers.

74. The survey focused on a key variable with the question of how the users considered their
quality of life improving or not with the project.

75. In the view of users, the project improved the quality of life of the beneficiaries. The states
that presented the best results were Ceará and Piauí. The one that had poorer results was
Alagoas. Considering that quality of life was the main variable focus, it can be concluded that, in
the view of the users, the project, succeeded very well in satisfying the expectations and
demands of the population

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low




                                                     21
76. At the technical level, the risk is negligible to low because the system of selection of water
projects is now standard practice in the Brazilian government and other initiatives use a technical
process to create a menu for the decisions makers to choose from, ensuring limited pressure from
politicians that could reduce the quality of evaluation. In the states, although the situation at the
end of the project has improved substantially in comparison to that observed previously, there is
some risk that the quality of activities may drop due to the limited number of permanent staff and
use of short term consultants. From the environmental aspect, the risk is similarly negligible to
low, given the increased awareness in this area. The beneficiaries have been organized by their
common need for water access, have strong water agencies serving their needs, and the country
is becoming more wealthy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77. The project was consistent with GOB and Bank priorities, because of the importance of
access to water in the Northeast. The project was particularly well timed and was prepared
rapidly following the enactment of the Water Law. The project preparation team understood the
significance of the Water Law and their design of the WRM component was quite appropriate to
the delivery of the outcomes. At the same time, project design was overly optimistic and did not
fully take into account the risks of controversy and lack of collection experience, which
precluded introduction of water use charges prior to delivering demonstrable benefits to users. It
seems to not have entirely appreciated the complex political economy of introduction of bulk
water rights and water charges, especially in a rather short time period of only five years. The
project did not require any strong covenants or government commitment to project objectives in
writing that the Latin America Operational Services Unit regional review had alluded to.7

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

78. The project team closely monitored project implementation, involved experienced staff in
water resources management, staffed well structured teams, provided the necessary support and
sought solutions to problems. Throughout implementation, the team reports indicated that the
Bank supervision was focused on the development objective of the project and always advised
the counterpart team to focus on the same. It was recognized during implementation by both the
Bank team and the Government that having a decentralized team in the Brazil office was
extremely important to guarantee adequate and timely responses to the client. The Bank Country

7
  The Latin America and the Caribbean Region (LCOSU7) Quality-at-Entry assessment highlighted that the
effectiveness of the task team was noteworthy in terms of moving this complex project from the original request of
the Government to Board approval in just two years and the rigorous and constructive reviews and support by
regional management.


                                                       22
Office also ensured adequate transition arrangements related to partial changes in the team and
three changes in team leadership. Significant implementation issues developed when the AF
financing was not extended, which required prompt action from the Bank. The Government
acted promptly to resolve them satisfactorily, and the four works still under construction will be
finalized with Government funding (see Table 2.2 in Annex 2).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79. The Moderately Satisfactory Development Effectiveness rating influenced the overall Bank
Performance rating, as reflected by the Moderately Satisfactory rating on Quality at Entry. The
project had mixed results during its 11 years of implementation. Persistence and patience was
needed to keep the momentum high for implementation. The Bank played a fundamental role in
providing for the continuity of the project and explanations to the different counterparts
involved. In addition, the Bank's role in keeping the dialogue led to new state and federal
operations as well as a non-lending technical assistance, such as the recently initiated "Adapting
Water Resources Planning and Operation to Climate Variability and Climate Change in Selected
River Basins in Northeast Brazil (P123869)". Nevertheless, excessive optimism by the Bank
team on the ability to implement cost recovery and water charging practices influenced this
rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80. The project gained immensely from the enactment of the Water Law before the project
started. The Government was supportive throughout the implementation period except for about
one year following the approval of additional financing, when the Senate, due to its focus on an
important internal matter, could not devote adequate attention to anything else, including this
Bank-financed project.

81. At the same time, during implementation, because of the economic crisis and changes in
federal and states governments in 2003, the Project suffered delays that affected the originally
planned schedule. During the preparation of the Additional Financing, Senate approval of the
Loan Agreement took over nine months causing constraints for the adequate implementation of
projects activities. Additionally, the ruling of the Brazilian Federal Controller (Tribunal de
Contas da União) caused significant delays in procurement activities.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Satisfactory




                                               23
82. During the first months of implementation a very competent team was formed in the Project
Implementation Unit (UGP) to coordinate project implementation within the SRH in the initial
months. Changes in implementation agencies occurred with the creation of the Ministry of
National Integration in 1999 and the subsequent establishment of the National Water Agency
(ANA) in 2000. With the transfer of activities to these new implementing agencies, both of them
were able to create well structured and well functioning project management units.

83. In addition, the States' Project Implementation Units (UEGPs) were created in each one of
the 10 participating states, performing satisfactorily throughout implementation. They were
committed to project objectives and facilitated beneficiary/stakeholder consultations and
involvement. Though there were some issues with fiduciary aspects of the project, they were few
and far between for a project implemented over 11 years. The UEGPs, together with the help of
consultants, provided the requisite transition arrangements for regular operation of project-
supported activities. One area where implementing agencies could have performed better is in
the introduction of cost-recovery mechanisms.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84. The Government remained true to its commitment and closely supported the implementation
of the project. Although during the implementation of this project the Brazilian economy
suffered to some degree a reduction in revenues, the Government made the full counterpart
contribution. The Government was always ready and available to discuss issues in the
implementation of the project and played an active role in proposing solutions to problems and in
most cases implemented agreed action albeit with a delay. However, based on the issues raised
above, overall Borrower Performance is considered Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

85. Many of the findings of the Independent Evaluation Group Evaluation of Water and
Development8 have been reconfirmed by the Bank experience in this project. In addition, some
of the lessons from this project may help to further refine or enrich approaches to address various
sectoral issues.

Lesson 1: A longer-term, more comprehensive, multisectoral, and process-focused approach to
water support, as has been recommended by the External Advisory Panel of the Independent
Evaluation Group Evaluation, may require some changes in Bank thinking about project
management and evaluation.

86. The project was able to apply the principles of the 1997 Water Law in its comprehensive,
multisectoral approach, and focus on process, but was designed for the "usual" five-year project
implementation period. Bank management was possibly aware that the comprehensive project
would require a longer-term commitment as well and did approve extensions that added six more

                                                 24
years (two extensions and through additional financing). However, given the five-to-seven-year
normal project implementation period, this 11-year project was considered a great exception, and
when the country requested extension for the additional financing phase of the project, it was not
approved. If it had been assumed that a 10-year Bank commitment was "normal" for this kind of
project, extension beyond the 11th year may not have been an issue. In the end, the additional
financing instrument was not the most appropriate solution to deal with the needed long-term
engagement for sector. For that reason, the project had to cancel US$23 million from the
additional financing loan and activities planned are now being financed with Government own
funds.

87. Similarly, project evaluation for this kind of longer-term commitment may have to be
revisited. A longer-term commitment will have high variability in disbursements and
Implementation Performance because the project will span a number of administrations, and
when a new government team is still analyzing the project, it is a fact that progress is slowed. In
the case of this project, the difficulties experienced in the slow start-up of the Additional
Financing were recorded in the Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) and had a
weight in the overall performance rating of the project.

Lesson 2: Projects operating where both Federal and State institutions are involved require
flexible support from the project at the state level in line with their stage of development and the
use of horizontal transfer of experiences among peer states.

88. The above-mentioned Independent Evaluation Group study found that support for
institutional reform and capacity building has had limited success in the water sector. The
Quality-at-Entry assessment had rated this as a major risk and expressed doubts about the
"weaker" states having "the time needed to pass laws and regulations and establish institutions."
The project appears to have developed a methodology that redresses this sectoral shortcoming.
The project's success in this area came from the long-term commitment, using the leading states,
such as Ceará, as a model for others, while keeping a flexible approach at every state. The Water
Law (and other changes included in the 1997 Fiscal Adjustment Program9) also made it easier to
address issues related to budget and authority accorded to the lower level of government.

Lesson 3: A country's concerns for high transaction costs due to safeguards (and their
consequent reluctance to have Bank financing) are best addressed with clarity about what
"processes" the safeguards entail, with an emphasis on the mechanisms to address issues that
would put public institutions and their employees above reproach.

89. The concerns for high transaction costs due to safeguards for water projects are well known.
However, the Project showed that if it is done right, then the safeguards can actually help in
dealing with complex issues in project implementation and provide the guidance and confidence
to properly manage technical, environmental and social issues. The project developed
environmental frameworks that had checklists of possible positive and negative impacts and the
environmental management plans designed to go with these impacts. Similarly, for the safety of
dams, the project created a panel of international experts that had to review and approve designs

 The Fiscal Adjustment Programs, originally designed to resolve states' debt crises, were also instrumental in the
development of the 2000 Fiscal Responsibility Law.


                                                       25
and supervise the construction. This also led to avoidance of "fait accompli," where the
contractor would proceed because the review from authorities was delayed due to lack of
qualified personnel in the government. The project was able to develop social arrangements to
manage complex resettlement issues during project implementation, particularly the ones related
to dam construction.

Lesson 4: Reforms such as the implementation of water charges systems take considerable time
and effort to build consensus and political support.

90. The project supported the implementation of WRM instruments at the federal and states'
levels with success. In terms of planning, studies, cadastre of users, water rights, institutional
strengthening and even formulation and adoption of investments selection criteria, the project
was very successful. However, further attention and a strong communication with the different
stakeholders is needed to ensure the implementation of economic pricing instruments, which
require maturity and high-level political support.

Lesson 5: An intersectoral approach to water issues is key to the achievement of results that go
beyond the WRM agenda.

91. Some of the most serious problems restricting the role of water in Brazil's development, such
as pollution, scarcity, floods, unequal access and conflicts over water use, have their roots and
impacts in diverse sectors of the economy, government and society. While it is important to
foster advancements in each sector, there are also many opportunities for better integration,
innovation and coordination among the different sectors to reconcile conflicting goals, mobilize
interests, and avoid impasses and setbacks and spark synergies, as defined in the intersectoral
program of the National Water Resources Plan (Plano Nacional de Recursos Hídricos, PNRH).
The diversity of Brazil's physical characteristics, socioeconomic realities and institutional
structures imposes challenges related to the management and use of water. Renewing its water
policies and strengthening investment capacity is essential to ensure that the water sector can
make important contributions to the reduction of poverty and inequality, the protection of the
environment and the sustainable growth of the economy. In this sense, the Government of Brazil
has prepared the Interáguas project to be financed by the Bank that brings to the table new
partners in the process: the Ministry of Cities (MCid) and Ministry of Environment (MMA)
together with the Ministry of National Integration (MI) and the National Water Agency (ANA)
to have a more comprehensive agenda to facilitate the sound implementation of the IWRM
principles and strategies adapted to the Brazilian context. At the same time the project will
facilitate the internalization of the future challenges that climate change now imposes on the
water sector and the role in South-South cooperation of Brazil with other countries.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

92. The Borrower prepared a completion report at the end of the implementation period of the
Original Project, in December 2006, which served as input for the preparation of this ICR. The
completion report that incorporates the results of the Additional Financing is under preparation.



                                               26
The draft ICR was submitted to the counterparts for comments on November 24, 2010. The
Borrower's implementing agencies, ANA and MI presented their comments to the draft report
through the letter Ofício n°411/2010/SIH/MI dated December 9 and received by the Bank on
December 13, 2010. The letter and a summary of the results of the Original Project and the
Additional financing phases received from the counterparts are presented in Annex 7.

93. In the letter, the Borrower expressed its satisfaction with the recognition of the significant
benefits of the Project to the quality of life and economic dynamism of its beneficiaries and of
the contribution of the works implemented to the increased good quality of water supply. The
Borrower also expressed satisfaction with the recognition that the Project, a pioneer in
sustainable water resources management, used modern instruments established by the Water Law
(Law 9,433/97) to support the implementation of the National Water Resources Management
System ­ SINGREH, particularly in the Brazilian Semi-Arid Region.

94. From the lessons learned presented in the ICR, the Borrower highlighted that the institutional
structure for the Project's management and administration worked adequately despite a few
problems resulting from changes in the Federal and States Government teams, typical of projects
with long periods of implementation as PROAGUA. The Borrower also highlighted the
budgetary priority given to the Project by the Ministry of National Integration and the Ministry
of Environment and the completion of 48 bulk water works important to address water supply
problems in the beneficiary areas, as well as the full execution of studies and projects needed to
promote the strengthening of water resources management. The partnerships were considered
fundamental to the success of Project actions, as the technical teams in the States and in the
Federal Government, through ANA and MI, were thereby able to overcome and learn from
adversities, which arose from time to time.

95. As a consequence of the results obtained by the Project, the letter highlights that the
Government of Brazil considers of great importance the following up of the actions in
partnership with the World Bank as expressed in the preparation of the Interáguas Project.

96. At the same time, the Borrower expressed its disagreement with the overall outcome rating of
moderately satisfactory. In its point of view, this rating does not reflect Project overall
performance, considering that its indicators show the achievement or exceeding of physical,
financial and social targets and impacts, duly presented in the ICR, which could not have been
better owing to the impossibility of extending the Project Closing Date as requested by the
Government.

97. In this sense, the Borrower pointed out the main advances achieved by the Project during its
11 years of implementation: (i) promotion of changes in paradigms for water resources
management in Brazil, with emphasis on the Semi-Arid Region, from the structuring of water
resources systems in all Brazilian states and the implementation of priority infrastructure; (ii)
establishment of lessons learned and best practices that can be replicated in other hydrographic
basins, both in the Semi-Arid Region and in other regions of Brazil; (iii) the execution of 48
water infrastructure works that were extremely important to address water needs and improve the
quality of life of over two million people; (iv) the evaluation, eligibility and prioritization of
works criteria that were implemented by the Project, recognized by the accounting control

institutions and which serve as model for other Government programs; and, (v) the participatory
methodology adopted by the Project involving social participation and the local public sector in
the implemented projects with positive impacts on the environmental education of communities'
beneficiaries of the Project.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1. The detailed original project components and their outputs are described as follows.

Component 1: Water Resources Management (WRM) (US$53.1 million ­ including
contingencies, 16 percent of total estimated cost)

2. Description. The component helped establish the National Water Resources Management
System (SINGERH), as established in the National Water Law, approved in 1997. The
component provided the necessary technical and financial resources to strengthen the Federal
Government, 10 state governments, river basin committees, and user associations to effectively
manage water resources in the Northeast of Brazil. The Federal Government is responsible for
the implementation of the SINGREH in rivers that cross state boundaries, the so-called "federal
rivers," and the State Governments are responsible for the implementation of the SINGREH in
the "state rivers," in both cases, with strong stakeholder participation in the decision-making
process. The WRM component had two major elements: (a) institutional development, and (b)
creation of the technical basis for the SINGERH, detailed as follows.

Institutional Development

3. National Water Resources Management System (SINGREH). Because the National Water
Law was very recent, the Federal Government was not yet equipped, both in terms of
methodology and human resources, to enforce it. The project provided technical assistance for
the implementation of the SINGREH.

4. State Water Resources Management Agencies. Specific WRM agencies existed in only some
of the 10 participating states. In many cases, the agency was legally constituted but not very
active, in terms of water resources assessment and planning, granting of water rights, issuing of
permits for the construction of hydraulic infrastructure, and mediation of water conflicts. The
component adopted a tailor-made procedure to help the establishment of capable water resources
agencies in all 10 states. State Project Management Units (UEGPs), created to launch
PROAGUA at the state level, were the seed for the formation of full-fledged State WRM
agencies.

5. Legislation. Not all states had a specific water law, which was to complement the National
Water Law. The component adopted a tailor-made procedure to help establish water laws in all
10 states.

6. Bulk water rights and tariffs. The component helped all 10 states to follow the example of
Ceará, which already had bulk water tariffs for some sectors. It assisted the states in developing
a cadastre of users, a necessary condition for the initial allocation of water rights.

7. Economic and financial tools. To increase the use of economic feasibility and financial
sustainability analysis of hydraulic infrastructure construction in the region, the project helped
with specific studies and research, such as assessment of the willingness to pay, and evaluation
of the economic impact of bulk water tariffs for different user sectors.



                                               32
8. Human Resources. The project supported several training programs designed to produce
skilled water resources professionals (a specialization that was difficult to find on the market)
and to trained water users and their associations.

9. Water user associations and river basin committees. Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte, had
already achieved good results through the organization of water users on local water resources
management. For example, water yields from the two largest reservoirs of Ceará (Banabuiu and
Oros) were in the past decided by technicians, without much attention to users' concerns. This
changed after the establishment of the State Water Resources Management Company
(COGERH), and the discussions among users, helped by decision support systems installed on
computers. The project helped spread this approach to all the other states under the project.

10. National PROAGUA. The Federal Government had launched PROAGUA on a nationwide
basis. While the Bank-funded project directly supported the implementation of this program in
the semi-arid Northeast, it intended to implement everywhere else in Brazil a quality control
process to ensure that the same standards and criteria were used. The project was successful in
expanding the WRM activities to the states outside the Semi-Arid region.

11. Hydrologic Panel. The component supported assessment studies of water availability
developed at the State and river basin levels by quality technical teams. Because investment
decisions are made based on competitive evaluations of these assessments, it is necessary to
ensure consistent and homogeneous treatment of data. This implied that collection, analysis, and
interpretation of data were to be performed under the supervision of a high-level hydrologic
panel.

Creation of Technical Basis

12. Hydro-meteorological networks. The number of hydro-meteorological gauging stations in the
project area was well below the recommendations of the World Meteorological Organization for
semi-arid regions. Because all assessments of water availability depend on raw data collected by
the network, the project helped expand the network, selecting the best sites for installing new
gauges based on cost-benefit analysis.

13. Information systems. Water resources planning depends on information about water rights,
water tariffs, hydraulic infrastructure, user associations, and water availability, in quantitative
and qualitative terms. The project helped make this information readily available to Government,
WUAs and civil society, including a Web-based information system.

14. Outputs. Project implementation at the federal level supported not only the initially planned
actions, but also responded to conjectural demands linked to the implementation of the National
Water Resources Plan (Plano Nacional de Recursos Hídricos, PNRH) and the National Water
Resources Management System (SINGREH). Outputs at the Federal level are presented below.

 the establishment of the Piranhas-Açu River Basin Committee and the Paranaíba River Basin
 Committee where a comprehensive federal and state water allocation system was implemented.

 16. The project supported dissemination, training and study tours in Brazil as well as 27
 Symposiums, Congresses and Workshops to discuss milestones and activities directly linked to
 water resources management.

 17. As part of the capacity building activities, the project funds were critical to buy PC
 computers, which were a very exclusive asset at the time, meteorological and hydro equipment to
 improve the coverage of the Water Information System in Brazil.

 18. The project supported the formulation of the National Water Plan for Brazil, which is the
 stone edge in the hydraulic policy of the country and has received considerable political support



                                                43
at the federal and state levels. and the formulation of Ceará's Strategic Water Resources Plan,
called Pacto das Aguas (Water Agrement of the Parties), which has been approved by the State
Assembly considering the different points of view of stakeholders and basin committees.

19. The Northeast Atlas for urban water supply was prepared to identify and select alternatives to
secure water sources to respond to present and future demands. The Atlas includes: (a) diagnosis
for the bulk water supply situation in the municipalities; (b) analysis of existing and possible
water conflicts considering the future economic growth; (c) identification of possible alternatives
to guarantee the supply of water for future demands and its technical solutions; (d) review of
future sustainability of the identified solutions. The Atlas provided information on surface and
groundwater, demand estimates, economic and financial analysis of alternatives, cost recovery
and institutional arrangements for the operation of the proposed solutions.

20. A summary of the achievements of the States in Water Resources Management supported by
Project is presented in the Table 2.1 below.

Component 2: Infrastructure (US$212.0 million--including contingencies, 64 percent of total
estimated cost)

21. Description: This component financed the construction of water storage and conveyance
infrastructure to provide reliable water supplies (in terms of both quality and quantity) for towns
and communities with enduring problems of water supply for domestic consumption. The local
Project Preparation Unit, under the federal Secretariat of Water Resources (SRH), selected the
first-year works based on rigorous multi-criteria screening, including: (a) the nature of the
problem, (b) socioeconomic conditions prevailing in the area, (c) the level of local institutions'
commitment, (d) consistency with water resources management plans, and (e) the level of
technical preparation of the proposals submitted by the participating States.

22. The component also o elaborated the eligibility criteria to be used for selecting proposed
subprojects and incorporate them into the Operational Manual. The major criteria were related to
the following indicators: (a) technical, for example, per capita water consumption of 150 liters
per day for towns with populations between 4,000 and 50,000 inhabitants and, for communities
of less than 4,000 inhabitants, 60 liters per day initially but increasing to 120 liters per day in 20
years; (b) economic/financial, for example, internal economic rates of return of at least 12
percent and water charges (based on applicable tariffs) covering 100 percent of O&M cost and at
least 25 percent of investment cost; (c) institutional, for example, construction of subprojects to
be preceded by the issuance of formal water rights for the proposed works and approval by the
Bank of a plan for A, O&M of the infrastructure considered (established criteria for acceptance
of the A, O&M plans were also incorporated into the Operational Manual); and (d)
environmental, for example, strict compliance with Bank procedures and guidelines, including
for resettlement and indigenous development plans.

23. The original project completed 41 works and the additional financing has already completed
three out of the seven works included in its revised scope. The total of 48 works, including
construction of pipelines, three dams, and recovery of pipeline systems directly benefiting a
population of 2 million inhabitants (originally estimated at 1.3 million). In addition, 2 million



                                                 44
water users in the Fortaleza Metropolitan Area have benefited directly from the completion of
the rehabilitation work in the Umburanas subproject, bringing the total number of beneficiaries
to nearly 4 million.

24. The works financed by the project include mostly bulk water supply systems. The project
also financed the construction of 3 dams and a few rural water supply systems, some of them
including environmental sanitation programs. (See Table 2.2 below.)

Component 3: Planning, Studies, and Project Design (US$41.6 million ­ including
contingencies, 13 percent of total estimated cost)

25. Description: The component: (a) produced water resources plans, which are the basic tools
for implementing a sustainable water resources management system in the region; (b) developed
specific studies aimed at increasing rationality in the use of water (action on demand) and water
availability/supply; and (c) developed a portfolio of subprojects of needed infrastructure
expansion, sufficiently detailed to be procured, for construction under the infrastructure
component of the project.

26. The component had two major elements: (a) planning, at both the State and river basin levels,
and (b) specific studies and pre-investment studies, necessary for the identification of solutions
to the imbalance between water demand and availability, during dry spells, in river basins of the
semi-arid region.

27. The planning subcomponent included: (a) initial assessment of water resources (to be
implemented only in those states that needed to elaborate basic water resources issues), (b)
implementing state WRM systems covering strategy specific to each state, (c) state water
resources master plans (for states that did not have one and updating for those that did) that went
beyond a collection of river basin plans to include ranking of initiatives for budgetary purposes,
(d) river basin water resources plans selected for river basins with actual or potential conflict in
the use of water, and (e) plan for rehabilitation of existing infrastructure.

28. The specific studies and pre-investment studies subcomponent included: (a) study of water
availability that included both surface water and groundwater (particularly in the context
technological advances on salt extraction); (b) pre-investment feasibility studies that
encompassed sufficient details (engineering designs, cost estimates, social and environmental
impact assessments, resettlement and compensation plans) to be procured under the
infrastructure component; (c) refinement of operation rules of several large reservoirs of the
region to incorporate long-term consequences and interests of downstream areas; and (d) drought
emergency plans that can coordinate various agencies better, for example, in the provision of
water trucks during droughts, and bring down costs.

29. The Federal and State Governments shared resources and responsibilities in the
implementation of the specific studies and pre-investment studies subcomponent. Allocation of
resources managed by the States was to be on a competitive basis, from the project-supported
State Studies Fund, using the same procedure as for the WRM component. States that were
"beginners" received initial financial support, outside the scope of State Studies Fund. This
support helped establish an initial basic knowledge that would serve as a launching platform for
competing for resources under the State Studies Fund.

40. The Component also included the preparation of Studies of Technical Feasibility,
Environmental Impacts and Economic and Financial Feasibility, Basic Projects and/or
Engineering Designs for 40 water supply works in the States of Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Minas
Gerais, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe.

Component 4: São Francisco Watershed (US$8.6 million ­ including contingencies, 3 percent
of total estimated cost)

41. Description: São Francisco river basin, the major river that traverses five of the 10 states of
the project area, was experiencing a number of problems including: (a) the degradation of its
upper basin where over 75 percent of the river total water flow is generated; (b) intensification of



                                                50
water conflicts within the basin, especially between hydropower and irrigation; and (c)
significant potential regional conflicts as the proposal of a trans-basin diversion to supply water
to other States (Ceará, Paraiba, and Rio Grande do Norte) was the most controversial water issue
in the Northeast. Solutions depended on political agreement on the principles that should guide
the allocation of water rights by the Federal and State Governments, for users in the São
Francisco river basin and for the eventual trans-basin diversion.

42. The component was to: (a) support the creation and effective start-up of the São Francisco
River Basin Committee, as defined by the National Water Law; (b) provide financial support
toward the development of WUAs in the basin; and (c) develop a simulation model for water
allocation under the principle that water is an economic good, with emphasis on aspects such as:
(a) the system of water allocation; (b) the costs for the different groups of users; (c) revenues of
the Water Agency, also to be created as per the Water Law; and (d) the priority investments, at
the river basin level, that would be financed by the future São Francisco Water Agency.

43. The activities planned under this Component were executed by the GoB with own resources.
The Loan amount was reallocated to other components.

Component 5: Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (US$14.7 million ­ including
contingencies, 4 percent of total estimated cost)

44. Description: This component was subdivided into three major interrelated but autonomous
elements: (a) project oversight at the highest level; (b) project management at federal level, in
support of State UEGPs (see WRM component); and (c) project monitoring and evaluation
(M&E), and auditing.

45. The interministerial PROAGUA Managing Committee (Comite Gestor, essentially the same
as the Executive Committee that was established to supervise project preparation), had
responsibility for overall project oversight and decision making on major issues affecting the
course of project implementation. With the federal Secretariat for Water Resources (SRH) acting
as its Executive Secretary, the Comite Gestor fulfilled the following functions: (a) definition of
the operational procedures to be followed for the planning, programming, and physical execution
of project activities, including procurement and contracting; (b) approval of project Annual
Operating Plans (Planos Operativos Anuais, POAs), both at the individual State level and in
consolidated form for the whole project; (c) approval of contract agreements (convenios)
between the Federal Government and participating States for project/subproject execution; and
(d) evaluation of project performance results and deficiencies, in order to issue opinions and
recommend corrective actions whenever necessary.

46. The core project management and coordinating unit was the Federal Project Management
Unit (Unidade de Gerenciamento do Projeto, UGP), established within SRH, initially with
consultants and private firm inputs. Consisting of a small general coordination team and two
operational units, the central UGP worked in close collaboration with sister UEGPs at the state
level, ensuring common standards and procedures for implementing and monitoring project
activities in each of the participating states.




                                                51
47. Primary responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation rested with the Project
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (Unidade de Monitoria e Avaliação, UMA), a special unit to be
created within the Secretariat for Regional Policies (SEPRE), MPO. Together with the Federal
and State UEGPs and in regular consultation with river basin committees, WUAs, and other local
stakeholders, the UMA operated a permanent system of monitoring project progress and
identifying implementation bottlenecks, in terms of both physical and institutional performance.
In particular, UMA monitored the adequate allocation of water rights and enforcement of water
use rights, efficient utilization of project infrastructure, participation of beneficiaries in A, O&M
and/or satisfactory resolution of water conflicts in project areas. It also evaluated the project's
socioeconomic impact and monitored the existence of adverse environmental impacts, if these
emerged during project implementation. Project auditing was undertaken under the supervision
of the Federal Secretariat for Control of the Ministry of Finance. Since Bank requirements for
audit may not follow the same procedures as those normally used by the Federal Secretariat for
Control.

48. Outputs: Structuring of Management Units within ANA (UGPG) and within MI (UGPO)
and the structuring of a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (UMA); Technical Cooperation
Agreement with UNESCO to support the federal management units at the total cost of
US$4,920,899.00; Technical Cooperation Agreement with United Nations Development
Programme to support the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit at the total cost of US$3,000,000.00;
Technical Cooperation Agreement with UNESCO to support UGPO at the total cost of
US$6,370,000.00; Technical Cooperation Project between SIH/MI and the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation to carry out the Project's Monitoring and Evaluation activities at the total cost of
US$2,629,050.00.

** According to the monitoring system developed by ANA in 2006 to evaluate water resource management at state level, which includes 30 variables
classified in three levels of complexity: basic, intermediate, and advanced. Water rights and plnning showed the best qualitative improvements with more
social participation. Although it was not object of this assessment, it was noticed that the lack of permanent staff is the main limitant factor to the progress of
water reources management.

Annex 3. Economic, Financial and Fiscal Impact Analysis

1. According to the PAD, the economic, financial and fiscal feasibility of the Project was
verified separately for the components (1) Water Resources Management and (2) Infrastructure.
In this ICR, for a clear comparison between the PAD estimate and actual results, the same
evaluation methodology ex-ante, applied at appraisal, was used to verify the economic, financial
and fiscal efficiency of the Project, after its implementation, incorporating all of the actual costs
of the investment, operation and maintenance, as well as the revenues. The Water Resources
Management Component was evaluated using a Minimum Impact Approach (Cummings, et
al.12), including a calculation of annual values of the most probable impacts, while the
Infrastructure Component was evaluated using the traditional cost-benefit analysis, with
analytical tools specific for each type of analyzed activity and the SIMOP.

Water Resources Management Component

2. The Water Resources Management Component promoted rational and efficient water
resources use by: (i) helping establish relevant institutions and entities in those States where they
did not exist; (ii) providing technical and financial assistance to strengthen relevant institutions
and entities; and (iii) developing the tools for establishing and implementing the National Water
Resources Management System (SINGREH).

3. The Minimum Impact Approach was then used to assess the minimum economic impact
needed to justify the investments in the Water Resources Management Component. This
approach determines the minimum impact (increased benefits and/or decreased cost) that the
component must have on the relevant values within the water sector, to yield a minimum
feasibility condition whereby benefits equal costs.

4. Therefore, the ex-post evaluation of the Water Resources Management Component, as the
ex-ante evaluation, considered that the impacts generated were calculated from economic values
of the following parameters: (i) rational water infrastructure investment decision-making
(through better coordination and planning, as well as demand management), which in turn would
impact the States' expenditures on water-related emergency and health expenditures; (ii) positive
affect on water demand, by establishing charges for water rights and water use; and (iii)
improvements in the A, O&M of existing and new water infrastructure.

5. Using the same methodology applied in the ex-ante evaluation, Table 3.1 below shows the
results of the ex-post evaluation that calculated an annual level of benefit equivalent to US$4.623
million, above the estimated during the ex-ante evaluation of US$3.881 million (the annual
average of investments in the water sector currently, is R$3.15 billion, above the value used in
the ex-ante evaluation). The annual costs of the Water Resources Management Component
resulted in an average value of US$5.75 million, below the estimated in the ex-ante evaluation of
US$8.7 million. This means that the minimum impact value to justify the investment, according
to the ex-ante evaluation methodology, was around 0.1% of the social value calculated for the

efficiency. The ex-post cost-benefit ratio was 19.68, above the estimate in the ex-ante evaluation

Infrastructure Component

7. In the ex-post evaluation of the Infrastructure Component the same methodology was used as
that applied in the ex-ante evaluation.

8. The following economic and financial considerations have been made:

9. Once the projects were conceived in a time horizon of 30 years, equipment replacements
were added at every 10 year point in the project. In relation to the benefits, from year 20 only the
increase in demand as a result of the vegetative growth of the beneficiary populations was
considered.

10. The conversion factors used in the transformation of financial prices into economic prices are
the same used in the studies carried out in the ambit of the water supply and sanitation sector,
financed by the Bank. These conversion factors are described in Table 3.3 below.

11. The price elasticity of demand of water used in the construction of the simulation model was
-0.55021 for residential users and -4.74 for commercial, industrial and public users, according to
the initial evaluation of the project Infrastructure Component.

12. The water tariffs used in the SIMOP modeling for consumption of current and future users of
the water supply public system correspond to the marginal cost of water obtained in the effective
tariff structure of the companies responsible for the operation of water supply systems.

13. Water demand is explained by economic relations that express the interaction between
consumed quantities, prices, income and socioeconomic characteristics of the users.

14. In the evaluations of these sub-projects, alternative costs and average consumption of users
currently not connected to the water supply public system, necessary for the SIMOP modeling,
were taken into account and are presented in Table 3.4 below.

16. Following the same methodology applied when the ex-ante evaluation was made, the ex-post
evaluation presented positive results although with a few indexes somewhat lower than the ones
previously estimated. By analyzing the group of eight sub-projects selected for implementation
in the first year, an internal economic rate of return (IERR) of 15.6% was calculated, below that
estimated in the ex-ante evaluation (17.4%).

20. The ex-post fiscal impact evaluation, as well as the ex-ante evaluation, considered a fiscal
gain generated by the Infrastructure Component as the effect of the infrastructure investment on
revenue from: (i) taxes generated by expanded water supply services; (ii) decrease in water
losses. Thus, in the ex-post evaluation a negative net present value of the net fiscal benefits of
approximately US$3.8 million was calculated, higher than the estimate in the ex-ante evaluation
of approximately US$5.4 million.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1. The beneficiary survey took place in 2007, upon completion of the Original Project activities.
The survey included the application of 812 questionnaires to a total of 3,503 people benefiting
from 18 works, out of the universe of 528,333 beneficiaries in 9 states: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará,
Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. The State of
Maranhão was not included in the survey as the project did not finance any work in that state.
The survey results are a rough measure given that the project mostly financed bulk water supply
and final results would depend on how the water is supplied to the final consumers.

2. The survey focused on a key variable with the question of how the users considered their
quality of life improving or not with the project. In this sense, considering that "improved"
encompasses "improved" and "improved a lot", the answers were, in general, not very dispersed.

3. The key variables used were: (i) quality of life, with the question "how do you compare your
current quality of life now with the period before the work that brought water to your house?";
(ii) economic dynamism, with the question "in your opinion, did the life of the people in this
community improve with the completion of the water supply works?"; and (iii) quality of current
water, with the question "how is the quality of the water used for consumption after the
implementation of the systems (taste, odor, purity, etc)?".

4. Using the beneficiary population in each work area as the ordering variable, it's possible to
aggregate and consolidate the works data by state. The Figure 5.1 below presents the results of
the quality of life index. It can be concluded that regarding improvement in quality of life, the
project presented very satisfactory answers in the users' opinion. The graph (Figure 5.1) shows
the states of Ceará and Piauí standing out the most positively; Bahia and Pernambuco slightly
above average; Rio Grande do Norte, Sergipe, Minas Gerais slightly below, and finally Paraíba
and Alagoas.

5. The Quality of Life Index was created, weighting the answers with weights: "improved a lot"
weight ­ 10; "improved" weights ­ 8; "didn't improve or didn't notice significant changes"
weight ­ 5; and "got worse" weight ­ 1.

6. The other variables, although they are not the key research focus, also illustrate the users'
view of the project and are being analyzed in summary below.

7. For the economic dynamism variable the answers are similar to the above. Figure 5.2 below
shows the results.

           Note: "good" ­ weight 10; "regular" ­ weight 6.5 (average from 8 to 5); "bad" ­ weight 1.

8. The highlight is again the states of Ceará and Piauí. At the lower level, there are: Alagoas,
Bahia, Minas Gerais and Paraíba. The remaining states are close to the average. In relation to this
index, it is seen that, in general, the values are slightly below the previous ones referent to the
quality of life.

9. With regards to the quality of water, the analysis becomes more clear when the comparison is
made of answers for situations "before" and "now" with the project, as Figure 5.3 below shows.
This analysis shows that it was the state of Ceará that had the greatest difference between the
quality of water "before" and "now", thus, the works in that state are the ones that had, in the
users' view, the most significant improvements in quality. The figure also indicates that, in
general, there was quality improvement with the exception of the states of Alagoas, Paraíba and
Sergipe, where the users pointed to a small decrease in quality.

10. The aggregate graph for the supply index is the following.

11. In this aspect the highlights are the states of Ceará, Paraíba, Piauí and Sergipe. The states that
indicate that they still have problems in supply are: Alagoas and Bahia, to a smaller degree.

Conclusion

12. Quantitative research was made for 18 works in 9 states: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Minas
Gerais, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. These works have a high
social impact, with a total number of beneficiaries of around 500 thousand people.


                                                        66
13. In the view of users, the project improved the quality of life of the beneficiaries. The states
that presented the best results were Ceará and Piauí. The one that had poorer results was
Alagoas. Considering that quality of life was the main variable of focus, it can be concluded that,
in the view of the users, the project, in general, succeeded very well.

14. In respect to the economic dynamism aspect, it is curious to observe that the simple
arithmetic average of the index used (7.9) is lower than the quality of life index (8.2). This
indicates that the users tend to perceive that there was a bigger gain from the individual point of
view than to the community in general. In that aspect, it's worth noting that probably more time
is needed for the works to influence positively the local economic dynamics.

15. Another relevant aspect that was studied was the improvement in the quality of water. In this
aspect, there was general improvement in the quality with the exception of the states of Alagoas,
Paraíba and Sergipe, where the users pointed out a small decrease in quality.

16. Finally, the last relevant aspect considered was the lack of water supply, analyzed through a
supply indicator. The analysis points out the positive evaluation of the states of Ceará, Paraíba,
Piauí and Sergipe. The states that indicate that they still have problems in supply are Alagoas and
Bahia, at smaller scale. It can conclude that, for the majority of the states, the project resolved a
regionally chronic problem related to supply.

17. Based on the data presented, it can be concluded that the project works brought significant
benefits to the quality of life and, at a slightly lower scale, contributed to the economic
dynamism of the beneficiary communities. The works also have provided water of good quality,
representing the greatest improvement to some served communities, while, in others, the
previous system already provided good quality water. Finally, the project contributed in a
significant way to resolve water supply problems in the region.

18. In terms of results by state, the states of Ceará and Piauí were the ones that showed better
results. These were also the ones that presented the largest group of works evaluated positively
by the users. The worse results are with Alagoas and Minas Gerais, when excluding Águas
Vermelhas System ­ which was very well evaluated by users. It is still worth noting that only
one work was analyzed in the state of Alagoas.

          WATER RESOURCES SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                              PROAGUA16

1. The Water Resources Sustainable Development Program for the Brazilian Semi-Arid ­
PROAGUA/Semi-Arid, Loan Agreement 4310-BR, was implemented from 1998 to 2006, with
investments of US$ 236.6 million, out of which US$ 158 million of World Bank financing and
US$ 78.6 million of counterpart funds (Federal and States Governments).

2. The Project's general objective was to guarantee the expansion of good quality water supply
to the Brazilian Semi-Arid Region, promoting rational water use and sustainable development of
the Region, including the States of Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Minas Gerais, Paraíba,
Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe.

3. The PROAGUA/Semi-Arid was the first Federal Government Project that encouraged public
participation in water resources management. For the financing of bulk water infrastructure, the
Project required the preparation of technical, financial, economic, environmental and social
feasibility studies; and it recognized the importance of associating works with water resources
management practices. The Project promoted big advances in water resources management in
Brazil, with emphasis on the Northeast Region, through the structuring of the States' Water
Resources Management Systems and the implementation of priority infrastructure, guaranteeing
expansion of good quality water supply.

4. For the implementation of the Project, a team of specialists was created inside the Secretariat
of Water Resources of the Ministry of Environment (SRH/MMA). The implementation was even
more strengthened with the transfer of responsibilities from the Secretariat of Water Resources to
the newly created National Water Agency (ANA) in 2001, for the execution of the water
resources management component; and from the Secretariat of Water Resources to the
Secretariat of Hydraulic Infrastructure (SIH), in the Ministry of National Integration (MI) in
2000, for the execution of the infrastructure component.

5. The Project institutional framework included Hydrographic Basins of federal and
participating states rivers that were beneficiaries of Project activities. The arrangements also
included a Management Committee and two Project Management Units at the federal level:
Project Management Unit ­ Management Components (UGPG/ANA) and Project Management
Unit ­ Works Component (UGPO/SIH/MI). Project actions were defined in the Procurement
Plans, which had yearly updates after the approval of the Consolidated Annual Operative Plan
(POA) by the Management Committee. Actions were carried out in two distinct areas: from one
side, the execution of actions under responsibility of the state management entities bodies
defined in the POA of each State; and, from the other side, the execution of actions under
responsibility of the federal executing entities, represented by ANA and SIH/MI, executed

  The name of the Project given by the Government was Water Resources Sustainable Development Program ­
PROAGUA, divided into PROAGUA/Semi-Arid (Original Project) and National PROAGUA (Additional
Financing).


                                                    69
directly as included in the Federal POA, or via contracts or cooperation agreements (convenios)
signed with the States.

6. From 2001 to 2006, ANA was responsible for the management and implementation of the
Water Resources Management, Studies and Projects, and part of the Administration, Monitoring
and Evaluation Components, both at Federal and States levels, the latter through the use of
specific cooperation agreements (convenios) with the States in the Semi-Arid Region. At the
States' level, ANA gave emphasis to the institutional strengthening of water resources
management bodies, to the implementation of water resources management instruments and to
the development of studies and projects, many which were needed for the execution of bulk
water infrastructure, under the responsibility of the Ministry of National Integration (MI). From
2001 to 2006, the agreements with the States amounted to R$53.4 million of federal and state
resources.

7. In the ambit of ANA, actions for institutional strengthening were carried out for the Agency
aiming at the continuity of the implementation of the National Policy of Water Resources and the
structuring of the National Water Resources Management System. Therefore, from 2001 to 2006,
R$27.7 million were invested in the acquisition of goods and services; studies and projects,
including Technical Cooperation Projects with international organizations.

8. In summary, during the first 8 years of implementation, the Project was responsible for major
advances and benefits to the Brazilian Semi-Arid Region, with continued and sustainable actions,
in the context of water resources planning and participatory management.

9.    Water resources management actions developed included:
·    Structuring of Water Resources Management Organizations;
·    Updating of Legal Instruments Applied to Water Resources;
·    Structuring of Water Rights Systems;
·    Training for Water Resources Management;
·    Support to the Creation of River Basins Committees;
·    Structuring of State Water Resources Management Systems;
·    Expansion of Hydrometeorological and Water Quality Networks;
·    Structuring of the States' Cartographic Database;
·    Structuring of Information Systems;
·    Environmental Education Projects;
·    Studies on Water Charges;
·    Water Resources Master Plans;
·    Water Resources State Plans;
·    Feasibility Studies and Basic Design Projects;
·    Surface and Groundwater Availability Studies;
·    Projects for Simplified Water Supply and Sanitation Systems;
·    Environmental Impact Studies;

10. Activities that are worth pointing out include the preparation of 50 Feasibility Studies and
Basic Designs Projects for Works; the preparation of 52 specific studies (environmental, water
availability, etc.) and 12 River Basin Master Plans and State Water Resources Plans; and the
creation and strengthening of 351 Water Users Organizations.

11. From 2000 to 2006, MI was responsible for the management and implementation of the
Priority Works Component, both at Federal and States levels, through specific cooperation
agreements (convenios) with the States in the Semi-Arid Region.

12. This component financed the construction of infrastructure works for supply and storage of
bulk water (quality and quantity) in small towns and communities that suffered of permanent
water supply problems for domestic consumption. The Project Preparation Unit, established
under the Secretariat of Water Resources, selected the first year works based on rigorous multi-
criteria, including (a) the nature of the problem; (b) the socioeconomic conditions in the area; (c)
the level of commitment of local institutions; (d) the coherence with water resources
management plans; and (e) the level of technical preparation of the proposals presented by the
States.

13. The Component included eligibility criteria to be used for the selection of future proposed
subprojects that were incorporated to the Operational Manual. The main criteria were related to
the following indicators: (a) technical, i.e. the consumption of water per capita of 150 liters per
day for cities with population between 4,000 and 50,000 inhabitants, and, for communities with
less than 4,000 inhabitants, 60 liters per day initially, increasing to 120 liters per day in 20 years;
(b) economic-financial, i.e. economic internal rates of return of at least 12% and water tariffs
(based on operating tariffs) covering 100% of the O&M cost and at least 25% of investment
costs; (c) institutional, i.e. the construction of subprojects should be preceded by the issuance of
formal water rights to the proposed works and the approval by the Bank of an O&M plan for
such infrastructure (criteria established for the preparation of O&M plans were also incorporated
to the Operational Manual); and (d) environmental, i.e. strict compliance to the Bank's
procedures and policies, including resettlement plans and indigenous peoples plans.

14. In summary, the Priority Works Component of PROAGUA/Semi-Arid promoted the
construction of 41 Bulk Water Supply Systems benefiting a population of around 4.7 million
people, 2 with million direct beneficiaries.

15. Continuing with the philosophy of PROAGUA/Semi-Arid and recognizing the importance of
associating structural works to water resources management practices, ANA in partnership with
MI carried out, during from 2007 to 2009, the National PROAGUA.




                                                  71
16. The Project was based on the successful experience of PROAGUA/Semi-Arid and kept its
structuring mission, with emphasis on the institutional strengthening of all actors involved in the
water resources management in Brazil and in the implementation of water infrastructure feasible
from the technical, financial, economic, environmental and social points of view, promoting the
rational use of water resources. PROAGUA/Semi-Arid and National PROAGUA were part of
the same partnership of the Brazilian Government with the World Bank in the water resources
area.

17. The National PROAGUA project was conceived as an Additional Financing to the previous
loan, through Loan Agreement 7420-BR, with duration of three years and, originally, with
resources equivalent to US$ 200 million, out of which 25% of World Bank financing and 75% of
national counterpart funds (Federal and States Governments).

18. The general objective of the Project was to contribute to the improvement of the quality of
life of the population, especially in the less developed regions of Brazil, through water resources
planning and management simultaneously with the expansion and optimization of water
infrastructure, in order to guarantee sustainable water supply in quantity and quality adequate to
the multiple uses.

19. Specifically, the Project had the following objectives:
· To consolidate the National Water Resources Management System, through the
   implementation and improvement of management instruments and the institutional
   strengthening of water resources management organizations;
· To expand the efficacy and efficiency of the management of surface and groundwater
   resources, in a decentralized and participatory way;
· To implement infrastructure works, observing sustainability principles, quality and technical,
   environmental, financial, economic and social feasibility; and,
· To consolidate the strategic and operational planning as guiding instruments of governmental
   action in the water resources area.

20. From the technical point of view, the National PROAGUA addressed relevant questions,
including: (i) the strengthening of water resources planning and management structures; (ii) the
obligation of carrying out executive planning, associating the selection of works to water
resources management, using adequate basic design studies; (iii) the implementation of
mechanisms that guarantee the adequate administration, operation and maintenance of
implemented systems; and (iv) the evaluation of impacts and results.

21. In comparison to PROAGUA/Semi-Arid, the main changes incorporated to the National
PROAGUA were: (i) the expansion of the project coverage area to the whole country for the
implementation of water resources management actions; and (ii) the consideration of broader
infrastructure investments in the Water Resources Management System, not only investing in
expanding water supply but also in works of multiple use.

22. For the implementation of Loan Agreement 7420-BR, the same arrangements and
institutional, managerial and operational models of PROAGUA/Semi-Arid were used. One the



                                                72
important points of the institutional arrangement is the sharing of Project management between
MI and ANA.

23. The National PROAGUA Project coverage area included all the States in the Semi-Arid
Region for the execution of water infrastructure actions; and expanded to the whole country for
the execution of water resources management actions.

24. The National PROAGUA reorganized the components included in PROAGUA/Semi-Arid,
keeping the same types of activities from the previous Project, with the following structure.

25. The Water Resources Management Component had the objective of consolidating the
National Water Resources Management System and supporting the Federal and State
Governments in the creation, improvement, modernization and qualification of water resources
management arrangements and instruments, as well as the preparation of plans, studies and
projects.

26. At the Federal level, the Component was divided into four sub-components and respective
actions:
a) Institutional Development
   · Institutional Strengthening of ANA;
   · Water Rights and Charges Systems;
   · Training of Human Resources;
   · Preparation of Programs and Projects in the Water Resources Area;

   · Models or Pilot Initiatives applied to Reuse of Water.
d) Studies to Support the Implementation of Water Infrastructure in the Northeast
   · Environmental Studies;
   · Environmental Impact Evaluations; and
   · Feasibility Studies.

27. At the level of the States, the Component was divided into three sub-components and
respective actions:



                                              73
a) Institutional Development
   · Structuring of Water Resources Management Bodies and State Project Management Units
      (UEGPs);
   · Legal and Regulatory Framework for Water Resources Management;
   · Water Rights and Charge Systems;
   · Projects of Communication, Dissemination and Participatory Management;
   · Training of Human Resources;
   · Hydrometeorological Network and Water Resources Information System;
   · Creation of Water Users Associations and River Basin Committees.
b) Plans, Studies and Projects
   · State Water Resources Plans and Hydrographic Basin Plans;
   · Management Plans of River Basins with Water Use Conflicts;
   · Plans for Rehabilitation of Water Infrastructure.
c) Specific Studies
   · Feasibility Studies, Environmental Impact Evaluations and Basic Design Projects;
   · Water Availability Studies;
   · Operational and Decision Support Models.

28. The Priority Works Component had the objective of financing bulk water infrastructure of
social interest, for storage and distribution of bulk water to communities suffering from
permanent supply problems, as well as multiple-use works. The Priority Works Component had
one sub-component with its respective actions:
a) Water Infrastructure
   · Pipelines;
   · Simplified Water Supply Systems;
   · Other Water Infrastructure, such as Water Treatment Plants, etc.;
   · Implementation of Environmental and Resettlement Mitigation Measures;
   · Systems for Catchment and Distribution of Groundwater;
   · Dams and Reservoirs;

29. The Management, Monitoring and Evaluation Component had as its objective the
management, monitoring and evaluation National PROAGUA actions, in order to guarantee the
compliance of targets, schedules and general and specific objectives of the Project. The actions
included in this Component are common to projects that use international financing resources,
such as the financing of management units, development and implementation of monitoring and
evaluation system. The eligible actions included:
· Coordination of Project Activities;
· Implementation and Operation of Managerial Information System;
· Preparation of Procurement Plans and Operative Plans;
· Preparation of Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation Reports;
· Preparation of Independent Evaluation Reports;
· Joint Supervision with World Bank staff;
· Preparation of Case Studies;
· Preparation of Mid-Term Evaluation;
· Final and Ex-post Evaluations;



                                              74
· Preparation of Baseline Studies.

30. Several factors contributed to the delays in the implementation of Project's activities, both
with regard to works and water resources management actions in the Semi-Arid States. The main
factors are listed below.

31. Delay in Project Effectiveness. Although the Loan Agreement 7420-BR was approved by the
World Bank Board of Directors on December 19, 2006, the Brazilian Federal Senate approval
took place only in August 2007 and the Agreement signing took place on September 20, 2007.
Only after the Loan effectiveness date, November 8, 2007, did the Project effectively start its
implementation. These events led to a delay of almost one year in the start-up of Project's
activities.

32. Discontinuity of the technical team in the Ministry of National Integration. In 2007, with the
closing of a Technical Cooperation Project between MI and UNESCO, there was a reduction of
the technical team in the Project Management Unit ­ Works Component (UGPO), making it
impossible to renew the contracts of consultants who supported the UGPO. The situation was
resolved only in September 2008, with the hiring of permanent and temporary staff, who still
needed to acquire knowledge in the area of external financing. These factors were reflected in
the pace of the supervision of Project actions in the States, affecting the preparation and analysis
of documents.

33. Discontinuity of the technical teams in the States. Similarly, the technical teams in the States
Project Management Units (UEGPs) were demobilized due to changes in State Governments
and to the gap between the closing of PROAGUA/Semi-Arid and the effectiveness of the
National PROAGUA.

34. With the closing of PROAGUA/Semi-Arid, the States didn't have resources to maintain their
technical teams until the start of the new Project, which affected the preparation of the technical
and bidding documents needed to start National PROAGUA activities.

35. Only in December 2007, with the signing of cooperation agreements (convenios) between
ANA and the States, were UEGPs teams reestablished and actions initiated. Part of the teams
effectively started to work only in March 2008.

36. National Accounts Court (Tribunal de Contas da União ­ TCU) Ruling. In addition to the
delays in the States in the preparation of bidding documents following Bank's guidelines, a
ruling issued by TCU created an impasse for carrying out procurement activities. TCU issued in
the Official Federal Government Journal (Diário Oficial da União ­ DOU), on December 1,
2008, the Ruling (Acórdão) No. 2690/2008, which specified to the Ministry of National
Integration a series of modifications in the works bidding documents, which were conflicting
with Bank's guidelines.

37. On December 9, 2009, the Department of Hydraulic Works of the Secretariat of Hydraulic
Works of the Ministry of National Integration sent a copy of this TCU ruling to the World Bank
for its reaction, followed by meetings and discussions with the Bank about the subject. In



                                                 75
response, the World Bank kept the same position expressed before when consulted about the
issue, which is reflected in the ruling, stressing that the Bank would not give "no objections" to
works that didn't follow the Bank's guidelines, as stated in the signed Loan Agreement. The
TCU determination, together with the Bank position, created an impasse that basically affected
all of the works under National PROAGUA.

38. Considering this context and the impossibility of extending the Additional Financing Closing
Date, in March 2009, the Brazilian Government proposed to the World Bank an amendment to
the Loan Agreement, including the reduction of its physical and financial targets, as well as the
revision of disbursement percentages, Project indicators and results. As a result, there was a
significant reduction in planned resources, with cuts in the number of works and water resources
management actions financed by the Project. The amendment to the Loan Agreement, including
the Project restructuring was countersigned by the Federal Government on July 17, 2009.

39. After the restructuring, 10 works were excluded from the Priority Works Component, out of
the 17 works initially planned for financing with Loan funds. However, the Federal Government
kept its commitment to guarantee resources needed for the completion of the works taken out of
the Agreement, implementing them with resources from the Government's Growth Acceleration
Program (Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento ­ PAC).

40. Among the actions planned, the Project main results are presented below.

41. Institutional strengthening of water resources planning and management bodies in 27 states
and at the Federal level. During the implementation of the National PROAGUA, cooperation
agreements (convênios) were signed with 10 States in the Semi-Arid Region. Also, equipment
was acquired for water rights monitoring and for the hydrometeorological networks in other 17
states, strengthening the states management bodies in the execution of their tasks.

42. Review and/or Adequacy of State Water Resources Laws. Studies were developed for the
adequacy of State Water Resources Laws in three States: Ceará, Piauí and Maranhão. The
actions are presented below:
· Technical Consulting Services Specialized in Water Resources and Environmental Legislation
   in the State of Ceará;
· Technical Consulting Services Specialized in the Implementation of Judicial and Extrajudicial
   Charge for Water Rights as Instrument for Water Resources Management in the State of
   Ceará;

   of Maranhão.

43. Creation, implementation or strengthening of the Federal and States River Basins
Committees. Directly, the Project supported River Basin Committees in the States of Alagoas,
Bahia, Ceará, Sergipe, Rio Grande do Norte, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. ForFederal
rivers, the installation of Piranhas-Açu and Paranaíba River Basins Committees was achieved.



                                                76

47. Preparation of Institutional Strategic Plans. The State of Ceará worked on its Water
Resources Strategic Plan, called Water Pact, with the support of National PROAGUA.

48. Preparation of Hydrogeological Studies; Water Availability Studies; and Water
Infrastructure Projects. The Project supported the State of Pernambuco with the
Hydrogeological Study of Jatoba Sedimentary Basin. In terms of the Water Availability Studies,
ANA contracted the study of "Qualification of Hydrological Data and Reconstitution of Natural
Flows in the Country". Besides, the State of Rio Grande do Norte developed the "Bathymetric
Study of Reservoirs".

49. Preparation of the Proposal for the Regulatory Framework for Joint Management of
Groundwater in Aquifers. With the support of the National PROAGUA, the study of
"Evaluation of Groundwater Resources and Proposition of Joint Management Model for the
Apodi Plateau Aquifers, between the States of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará" was carried out,
conducted by ANA.

50. Preparation of Proposal for the Project of the National Network for Water Quality
Monitoring. This activity was initially procured with PROAGUA financing. However, the
winning proposal presented a price much higher than the cost estimate, which caused the
cancellation of the process. ANA is now financing this contract with its own resources.

51. Structuring of the National Water Resources Information System - SNIRH. Several actions
were financed by the Project for the structuring of the Information System, including the
following:

                                              79
PCDs. Also, the State of Sergipe acquired 18 telepluviometers, and the State of Pernambuco
acquired 15 telepluviometers.

53. Support to the development of States Water Resources Programs and Projects for national
and international financing. National PROAGUA effectively supported the preparation of the
Pernambuco Sustainable Water Project.

54. Expansion of the Planning of Water Supply in, at least, 1,500 municipalities. The National
PROAGUA financed four big studies that together cover all Brazil's municipalities in relation to
planning of water supply. These are: Update and Improvement of Northeast Atlas ­ Urban
Water Supply; South Atlas ­ Urban Water Supply; Metropolitan Regions Atlas ­ Urban Water
Supply; and Water Supply Atlas ­ Complementing Brazil. With the completion of the
Complementary Northeast Atlas, the South Atlas and the Metropolitan Regions Atlas, the
number of municipalities with planned water supply systems for a 20-year horizon is 2,965.
With the completion of the Brazil Atlas, under final stage, the remaining municipalities will be
covered, totalizing 5,561 municipalities.

55. Systematizing of the State of the Art Report of Water Resources in Brazil. With the objective
of presenting a broad vision of water resources conditions in Brazil, ANA prepared, with
PROAGUA support, the State of the Art Report, which has its 2010 version already available in
the ANA website for consultations.

56. Implementation of bulk water infrastructure in the Northeast, benefiting around 250,000
inhabitants. Under the Priority Works Component, out of the seven works planned for financing
of National PROAGUA, two of them are completed: Third Phase of Serra de Santana Pipeline in
the State of Rio Grande do Norte, and Ibaretama Pipeline in the State of Ceará. The works of
Rehabilitation of Water Losses of Belo Jardim System and Limoeiro and Agrestina Pipeline
Systems in the State of Pernambuco are partially completed and under operation. The works of
Missi and Riacho da Serra dams in the State of Ceará are in advanced stage of implementation
(table presented in Annex 2).

Lessons Learned

57. One of the main characteristics of PROAGUA was its structuring mission, with emphasis on
the institutional strengthening for Water Resources Management in the States of the Northeast
Region and Minas Gerais and, at the federal level, combined with the development of
structuring actions addressed to guaranteeing the expansion of good quality water supply for the
Brazilian Semi-Arid Region.

58. The first aspect to be stressed was the importance of the Project at its start-up for the specific
situation through which the water resources sector in the Brazilian Northeast was passing. Until
the beginning of the 1990s, the use and management of water resources in the Brazilian Semi-
Arid was the responsibility, in great part, of the Federal Government ­ which has the
responsability for combating the effects of droughts by constitutional mandate ­ specifically the
National Department of Works against Droughts ­ DNOCS. At the State level, there were no
legal basis or organization for the water resources sector; the States' roles were dispersed among



                                                  80
several institutions and limited essentially to the construction and operation of small reservoirs
and wells. The Federal Government was responsible for the big and medium-size works,
considered more strategic to water resources management. The water infrastructure built by
DNOCS and other federal institutions is responsible for the largest part of water storage in these
States.

59. For decades, the dominant culture was the "hydraulic solution", meaning the belief was that
big drought problems could be resolved with the indefinite construction of reservoirs and
complementary water infrastructure to increase water supply; many reservoirs built didn't even
have pipeline systems capable of transporting the stored water to the population. Very little
focus was made on the actual water resources management and appropriate maintenance of the
vast water infrastructure. However, this approach reached its limit because although these
investments had decreased the vulnerability to droughts, these conditions continued to strongly
affect the populations.

60. This context suffered major modifications, with the insertion in the Federal Constitution of
1988, among the competencies of the Federal Government, of the obligation to institute a
national water resources management system; the regulation and institutionalization of the
National Water Resources Management System ­ SINGREH, with its administrative
arrangement and its management instruments (Law 9,433/97); the creation of the National Water
Agency, the federal entity responsible for implementation of the National Water Resources
Policy and coordination of SINGREH; and the launch, in 2006, of the National Water Resources
Plan. The States started to organize themselves for the management of water resources,
following institutional reforms initiated in São Paulo, Ceará and other pioneering states.

61. It was exactly in this context that PROAGUA was prepared: at a very timely moment and
favorable to institutional changes in search of new practices of water resources management.
However, the challenges were huge, for with a few exceptions ­ Minas Gerais, Ceará and Bahia,
for example ­ everything or almost everything was to be done in terms of installing the
institutional capacity for water resources management.

62. After a little more than ten years from Project start, the role played by PROAGUA in the
States, its results and impacts are recognized as highly positive. The influence of the Project in
the process of technical and institutional development of the states is remarkable, in terms of the
incentive to participatory water resources management, in terms of water infrastructure; in the
expansion of knowledge about water resources, its uses and problems; and in a more selective
preparation of projects and works. Nevertheless, difficulties and constraints are observable, and
this restricted some of the potential impacts of the Project in relation to its objectives.

63. PROAGUA influence and impacts were translated in distinct ways in the different states as a
result of the technical and institutional capacities existent at Project start. For most of the states,
the Project was certainly structuring for the development of technical and institutional capacity
in water resources management. In a few of them, PROAGUA was not only a structuring
influence but also became the essence of the installed institutional capacity. In the extreme of
this situation, in some states PROAGUA was equally of great importance but only to the
consolidation of the water resources management systems already in place, i.e. Minas Gerais,



                                                  81
Ceará and Bahia. In these states, when the Project started its activities, there was already an
ongoing structural institutional dynamic, supported by other Bank financed projects (PROURB
and PROGERIRH in Ceará, and PGRH in Bahia).

64. In relation to the constraints observed, the main one refers to the state management bodies
which, in general, do not have permanent staff or logistical and infrastructure resources
commensurate to their missions. In general, the technical personnel are composed of
professionals from other state institutions, temporary nominated staff or consultants. Therefore,
the dominant situation in terms of technical and institutional capacity of the state water
resources managers is still fragile, more or less depending on the state. There are exceptions to
this situation as observed in the States of Ceará, Bahia and Minas Gerais, for example. In this
sense, the objectives of institutional strengthening of PROAGUA were partially achieved: the
situation is incomparably better than what was observed in 1997/1998 ­ as there was almost
nothing in most of the states, but it is still unsustainable from an institutional point of view.

65. As observed in various international agencies' documents, institutional changes require more
time for their implementation and consolidation than the usual time period of implementation of
infrastructure works. Therefore, considering the current circumstances of most of the states,
PROAGUA will be able to completely account for the big advances generated and impelled in
the water resources management only if there is a similar follow up project that is capable of
evoking more efforts from the state governments to guarantee the consolidation of the state
water resources management system, particularly the strengthening of state water resources
management bodies.

66. Following this direction, the Government of Brazil is currently preparing the Water Sector
Development Program ­ Interáguas, to be financed with World Bank funds. Interáguas
originated from the need to seek better dialogue and coordination of actions in the water sector
(water resources multiple uses and associated services) and has the objective of contributing to
strengthen the planning and management capacity in the water sector, especially in the less
developed regions of the country, aiming at: increasing the efficiency in water use and services;
increasing sustainable water supply in quantity and quality adequate to the multiple uses; and
improving the application of public resources in the water sector reducing diseconomies caused
by deficiencies in intersectoral dialogue and coordination.

67. In regards to the Priority Works Component, PROAGUA contributed to form a new
technical culture in the water infrastructure sector, reflected in the quality of its projects
compared to the traditional practices, such as with the incorporation of socio-environmental
variables, and with concern for the operation and maintenance of the water infrastructure built.

68. The social benefits brought about by the Project are clear, as demonstrated in its evaluations.
In reference to the achieved results, it is possible to affirm that the effects of the Project in the
Semi-Arid Region contributed to significant changes in the socioeconomic situation of the
benefited regions, also contributing to the rooting of populations who traditionally migrate in
search of better alternatives of life, thus transcending the Project benefits to other regions
beyond those assisted.




                                                 82
69. Finally, it is possible to affirm that the main impact related to the Priority Works Component
consisted of the reduction of child mortality rates and the incidence of waterborne diseases,
although it is not always possible to demonstrate this reduction based on data from the health
and other systems. Another substantive impact, although less evident, is the possibility of
structuring social and economic life in the localities benefited by the works implemented by
PROAGUA. Water scarcity and the unreliability of its supply disarticulate the social network as
they lead to strategies of life for subsistence in a context of permanent privation.

70. The main lessons learned from the implementation of PROAGUA are presented below.
· More than an infrastructure project, PROAGUA revealed to be a Project of cultural change
   and strengthening of social capital ­ prerequisite to any sustainable process of economic,
   social, political and environmental development;
· PROAGUA successfully used evaluation and prioritization criteria for works that became
   models for public administration;
· The competitiveness that was established as a criterion for the distribution of resources among
   beneficiary states can and should be used in investments financed with public resources;
· The States where the best Project overall performance was verified are the ones in which the
   institutions are well organized, have more autonomy and experienced, during this period, less
   administrative changes;
· PROAGUA made it clear that the solution to the difficult challenge that governs the
   relationship between man and natural resources, water especially, necessarily turns on one
   word: "management";
· The restructuring of water resources systems associated with the implementation of priority
   infrastructure, in all Brazilian States and with emphasis on the Semi-Arid Region, promoted
   by PROAGUA contributed to change paradigms of water resources management in Brazil;
· The evaluation, eligibility and prioritization of works criteria that were implemented by the
   Project were recognized by the accounting control institutions and serve as models for other
   Government programs;
· The participatory methodology adopted by the Project involving social participation and the
   local public sector in the implemented projects had positive impacts on the environmental
   education of communities' beneficiaries of the Project;
· The Project established lessons and best practices that can be replicated in other hydrographic
   basins, both in the Semi-Arid Region and in other regions of Brazil.
