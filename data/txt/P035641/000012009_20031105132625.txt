    OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthroughexcellenceand independenceinevaluation.


  About this Report
       The Operations EvaluationDepartment assesses the programs and activitiesof theWorld Bankfor two
  purposes: first, to ensurethe integrity of the Bank's self-evaluationprocessandto verify that the Bank'swork is
  producingthe expectedresults, andsecond, to help develop improved directions, policies, and proceduresthrough
 the disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience. As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percentof
 the Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento thosethat are
 innovative,large, or complex; thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations; those forwhich
  ExecutiveDirectors or Bank management haverequestedassessments; and thosethat are likelyto generate
 importantlessons.The projects, topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessment support larger evaluation
 studies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowingcountry for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to
 validate and augment the informationprovided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interestto broader
 OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally, the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsibleBank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

 About the OED RatingSystem
      The time-tested evaluationmethods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank'swork.
 The methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, projectdesign, or
 sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is
 the definitionand rating scale usedfor each evaluationcriterion (more informationis availableon the OEDwebsite:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.     html).
      Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's

      Efficiency: The extentto which the projectachieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunitycost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustmentoperations.
      Sustainabilify; The resilienceto riskof net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitableand sustainableuse of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition,stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutionalarrangementsand/or (b)
better alignment of the missionand capacityof an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact includes both intended and unintendedeffects of a
project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extentto which the project's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possibleratings: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

 Summary

 1.      Attached is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the above credits to
 Zambia, approved and operative from 1995 to 2000.

 2.      The objectives of the Economic Recovery and Investment Promotion Credit (ERIP)
 were to promoteprivate sector investmentinthe ZambianConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
 through privatization, alter miningsector policy to stimulate private sector-led sectoral
 development, increase the supply o f long-termbank finance, andmaintaina satisfactory
 macroeconomic policy environment. Other goals includedsupporting introductiono f a
 value-added tax (VAT), maintaininga minimally-acceptable level o f social sector spending,
 and initiatingreforms o fthe pension and social security systems.

 3.      The objectives of the SecondEconomic and SocialAdjustment Credit (ESACIr) included
macroeconomic stabilization, promotiono f import tariffliberalization; landand labor market
reforms to stimulate export competitiveness; enhanceddelivery o f social services; strengthened
nutritional andpharmaceutical policies; andimprovedpublic procurement.

4.       The objectives ofthe Public Sector Reform and Export Promotion Credit (PSREP)
included completingthe transfer o fZCCM miningassets to the winningprivatebidder; financing
the costs o fredundancy for ZCCM miners; redesigning the public sector reformprogram; easing
restrictions on importedinputs; streamlining approvals by the Zambian Investment Center; and
maintaining budgetary allocations for the social sectors.

5.      ERTP's results were mixedbut disappointing, for the most part. Sustainable progress
toward macroeconomic stability was modest, despite successful introductiono f a value-added
tax strengthening the tax base. ZCCM was brought to auction, but the auction was cancelled by
the Borrower after ERIP had completely disbursed, introducinguncertainty into the mining
sector and deepeningZambia's fiscal crisis. The supply o f long-term bankingfinance didnot
significantly increase. And, maintainingthe share o fpublic spending devoted to socialpurposes
was not enough to shore up the social safety net, not only becausethe level o frealpublic
spending declined so rapidly that real social spendingduringthis periodactually contracted, but
also becausethe public sector's capacity to deliver basic services actually deteriorated. Only the
reforms o fthe pension systemwere largely achieved, although with major delays.

6.      Inlightofthesedevelopments,theoutcomeratingforERTPwas downgradedfrom
satisfactory at the time o f OED's initial review to moderately unsatisfactory. Onthe other hand,
since the pension andtax reforms remainintact, sustainability was upgraded from a rating o f
uncertain to likely. Institutionaldevelopment impact, which depended, at its core, on successful
ZCCM privatization, was downgraded from substantial to modest. Finally, because o f the
weaknesses inERTP's design notedpreviously, IDA performancewas downgraded fiom
satisfactory to unsatisfactory.

7.     Achievement o fESAC17`s objectives was also mixed. Macroeconomic management was
compromised by erratic expenditure discipline, inadequate monitoring andcontrol, anda lack o f

                                                    vi


 sustainable extemal financing. Trade liberalization measureswere fully achieved, but results
have beenmixed-better       for consumers, but modest for exporters, givencontinued non-price
 structural barriers, such as the poor infrastructure, as well as continuedprotectionisminthe
markets ofsome important regional trading partners. ESAC11conditionality for protectingthe
share o f 1996 social spending intotal budgetaryallocations suffered from the same deficiency as
the earlier, and similar, conditionality inERTP. Addedto this were complications arising from
the operation o f the cashbudgetingsystem. Inlight o fthese developments, the rating o f
outcome was downgraded to unsatisfactory, from satisfactory at the time o f OED review. Given
evidence o f continued weak GRZ commitment, sustainability was downgraded from uncertain to
unlikely and Bankperformance from satisfactory to unsatisfactory. Only the ratingo f
institutional development was maintained unchanged at modest.

8.      The PSREP's most important objective was achieved, then severely disruptedby a buyer
change-of-heart. Fiveyears after donors first identified ZCCM privatizationas a core reform,
the state enterprise was finally sold inMarch2000. Sadly, the sense oftriumph andrelief at
achieving this long-sought goal lasted barelytwo more years. InAugust 2002, the winning
bidderabandonedits mininginterests inZambia, announcing that it couldno longer find
economic justification for further investment.

9.      Other supported reforms fared modestly better. Weak government commitment
continued to undercut efforts to improve the efficiency o f the civil service. Tariffs on imported
inputswere lowered, butprovidedonly marginalbenefits for exportersbesetbymorepressing
operating problems. Following introductiono f streamlined procedures, the numbero f
applications to the Zambia Investment Center actually declined, and, to date, the Center has
failed to become the envisioned "one stop shop" for foreign investors. And, as inESAC11,social
budgets were maintained inreal terms duringPSREP implementation, but expenditures were not
adequately monitored for results, and a wide number o f social indicators deteriorated. Inview o f
these factors, the outcome ratinghas been downgraded from moderately satisfactory inthe ICR
Reviewto moderately unsatisfactory, andsustainability from likely to unlikely. Despite some
shortcomings inproject design, IDA did all that couldbereasonably expected to try and salvage
ZCCM privatization, the operation's most important objective. On this basis, IDAperformance
was maintained unchanged at satisfactory, as was the modest rating for IDI.

10.     Major lessons o f general applicability include:

    0   When pressures to maintaina Client current on the service o f its extemal debt have a
        major impact on lendingdecisions, it is incumbent uponManagement to discuss these
        pressures, and any impact they had on the timing, content, and size o f aproposed
        operation, with the Board at the time o f loanpresentation.

    e   "Stroke o f the pen" measures are an unreliable indicator o f Borrower commitment to
        undertaking deeper structural reform.

    e   Unevenmacroeconomic performance sharply reduces the expected long-term benefits o f
        structural reform, and cripples the prospects for private sector-led growth.

  1. Background

  1.1      At independencein1964, Zambia enjoyed one o fthe highestper capitaincomes
  inSub-SaharanAfrica (SSA). The economywas, then asnow, dependent onthemining
  sector, with copper exports accounting for virtually all foreign exchange earnings. The
  newly-constituted govemment rapidly assumed a dominant economic role, keepingsocial
  spending high, and financing it fiom the copper export earningso f the state-owned
  enterprises .
  1.2      Bythe early 1980s, after years ofpublic sectormismanagement, exacerbatedby a
 recession ininternational copper markets, these policies were no longer viable. Public
 spending remained highfor a time, financed bymassive extemalborrowing. But, then,
 even this optionwas foreclosed, compellingZambia to seek emergency assistancefiom
 extemal donors. After several abortive attempts at reform, the KaundaAdministration
 suspendedregular contacts with the BrettonWoods institutionsin 1987, andbeganto
 accumulate arrears on its international obligations. Talks resumed in 1989, andwere
 followed inearly 1991with Borrowerpledges to initiate structural reforms, whch were
 matchedby donor actions to clear Zambia's arrears with IDA. Following the electoral
 defeat o fthe incumbent administration inNovember 1991,IDA embarked on amore
 ambitious reform dialogue.

 Macro Stabilizationin the 1990s

 1.3      The newly-elected administration implemented tough fiscal, exchange rate, and
 financial sector reforms, despite beingbeset by social tensions exacerbatedby severe
 drought. Recurrent expenditures, excludinginterest payments, were slashed fi-om 18
percent o f GDP in 1991to 12percent in 1992. Pricecontrols were dismantled, the
 exchangeratewas unified andbecame market-determined,interest rates on loans were
 liberalizedinthe Fallo f 1992, andregular auctions o ftreasury bills initiated.

 1.4      However, problems insynchronizing these measuresdelayed price stabilization
for morethan two years. Strong fiscal measureswere upstaged, to some extent, bythe
decision to prematurely liberalizethe capital accounts. Combinedwith exchange rate
devaluation, t h s decision ledto a prolongation o fZambia's inflation.' This, inturn,
eroded the real growth o f tax revenues, undercutting fiscal austerity. Inturn,delays in
stabilizingthe economy extended the periodo f stagnant growth, distractingpolicymakers
fiom undertakingmuch-needed structural reforms.

1.5      To a great extent, official donors concentrated on helpingZambia stay current
with its extemal debt, andmeet other urgentbalance-of-payment needs, needsmade
even largerbecauseunfavorable internationalmarkets and faltering localproduction

'Asdiscussedin    the Extemal Evaluation of theESAF -Report of a Group of IndependentExperts
(http:llwww.unf.org/externallpubslfxtev/), opening the capital account prior to achieving stabilization led
to a large one-time flight o f capital and a sharp decline inmoney demand. Hence, the dampening effects o f
public expenditure reduction were swamped by the ensuing monetary and capital market pressures placed
onprices.

 combined to seriously depress Zambia's copper export earnings, the primary source o f
 foreign exchange. Thanks to an increaseinofficial aid, Zambia was able to restructure
 its external obligations, increasing the ratio of concessionalto commercial debt from
 9-to-1 in 1990 to over 100-to-1 in 1999.

 1.6      IDA lending far outpacedthat ofother donors, totaling over US$900million
duringFY96-01, halfofwhich was delivered as quick-disbursing adjustment lending
(Table 1.1). Subtracting reflows from service of leftover BRDdebt, IDA net transfers
were more modest. For example, during 1991-95, service on IBRD debt reduced IDA net
transfers by44 percent, but by 18 percent duringthe latter halfo fthe decade, when the
IBRDdebthadbeenlargelyrepaid. Between 1996and 1999, waningbilateralassistance
stemmingfrom concerns about Zambia's governance made IDA disbursements
indispensable for Zambia to continue servicing its external debt, but left little for
financing other development needs.2

Macroeconomic Management

1.7       Macroeconomic management performance inthe nineties was mixed, trending
from acceptableto distinctly unfavorableduringthe evaluation period. A rapidpace o f
early reform at the start o fthe 1990s was followed by a loss o fmomentum inthe latter
halfo fthe decade, duringwhich fiscal laxity, rising inflation, a hesitancy incarryingout

  OED's 1996Zambia Country AssistanceReview (Report No. 15675,June 3,1996) called attention to the
danger that IDA might be left largely alone inZambia, should the bilateral donors withdraw, a prediction
fulfilled soonthereafter.

 further structural reform, and deterioration o f the investment climate stymied growth.
 Between 1995 and 2001, performance targets agreedwith the IMFwere largely missed.

 Growth and Poverty Reduction

 1.8       Real GDP fell at an annual average rate of-1.2                       percent between 1991 and 1995,
turningmoderately positivebetween 1996and2000, when it averaged2.8 percent. Little
real diversificationoccurred. The share o f agriculture and manufacturing innational
value added increased, but this was largelydue to a contractiono fthe miningsector.
Increasesinnon-traditional exports peakedin 1997, andhave largely stagnated since.

  Privatization of Copper ~perations'

  1.10 Since two ofthe three operations evaluatedinthis PPAR focused onprivatization
 o f Zambia's major state-owned copper company, ZCCM, what follows i s an overview o f
 the copper sector and a chronology ofthe key events surrounding privatizationo fthat
 company.

  1.11 Copper, Zambia's mainexport, hasbeendecliningsince 1970. As aresult ofa
 lack o finvestment andmaintenance, the gradual exhaustion of existing mines, and
 periodic low internationalcopper prices, copper output fell from over 680,000 metric tons
 in1970to 260,000 metrictons in2000, andcopper exports from over 99 percentoftotal
 exports in 1970 to 66 percent in2000. In1995, the GRZ announcedits decision to
 privatize Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), a large integrated copper mining
 andprocessingparastatal, bythe end ofJune 1997.

 1.12 Implementationofthe plantook far longer than expected, andwas completed
 only inMarch 2000. After protracted negotiations from mid-1997 to early-1999
 collapsed, the GRZ started negotiations with Anglo-American Corporation (AAC),
 ZCCM's largest private sector shareholder. OnMarch 31,2000, ZCCM sold its Konkola
 andNchanga divisions andthe Nampundwepyritemine to KCM, a company established
 inZambia for this purpose. KCMis 65 percent ownedbyZambia Copper Investments
 (ZCI), a subsidiaryo fAnglo-American, 7.5 percent by IntemationalFinance Corporation,
 7.5 percent by CDC Group, and20 percent by ZCCM-M. During2001, it i s estimated
 that K C Mproduced about 200,000 tons which represented about 67 percent o fthe total
 copper production inZambia.

 1.13   The primaryrationale for Anglo's participationwas the development ofthe
KonkolaDeep MiningProject (KDMP). After completing a feasibility study for the
KDMP inJanuary 2001,Anglo informedthe GRZ inOctober 2001that it intendedto
defer development ofKDMP, due to weak market conditions and the inability to secure
neededproject financing. On 24 January 2002, Anglo advised the GRZ that it would not
make further investments inKCM, following two years o fheavy financial losses, weak
copper prices, and a lack o f funding for KDMP.

1.14    An emergency task force comprised ofthe GRZ andthe World BankGroup was
formed immediately to deal with the crisis engenderedbythis announcement. The PRSP
for Zambia, completed inMarch 2002, assumed average annual growth ofroughly 4
percent over the near term, implyingthat the negative effects o f closingthe ZCCM mines
would betangible, butmanageable-on the order o f 1percent of GDP annually for the
next few years. Although Anglo's withdrawal had a depressing effect on copper mining
investment in2002, other companies are proceeding with their investment programs, with
the result that overall copper productionis expected to resume growth over 2003-2004.

  2.       OperationsUnder Evaluation

  2.1      This PPARcovers three ofthe five adjustment operations approvedbyIDA
  duringthe latter halfo fthe 1990s-the        Economic Recovery andInvestment Promotion
  (ERIP),the Economic andSocial Adjustment Credit II(ESACII),andthe Public Sector
 Reform andExport Promotion(PSREP)operations. All ofthese credits sharedstated
 goals o f supportingmacroeconomic stabilization, private sector development, andthe
 targetingo f social expenditures.6

 2.2      EMP sought to promoteprivatesector investment via privatizationo f the
 ZambianConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), to transform miningsector policy so that
 it would better serve the needs ofthe expectedprivate investors, andto provide increased
 long-term bank finance. To a lesser degree, ERIP supportedthe introductiono f a value-
 addedtax (VAT), the maintenance o fthe share o f social sector spendinginthe budget,
 andincipientreforms ofthepensionandsocial security systems.

 2.3      ESACI1aimed to improve export competitivenessvia import tariffliberalization
 andreformswhich would easebottlenecks inlandand labor markets. Otherobjectives
 included enhancing the delivery o f social services, strengthening nutritional and
 pharmaceutical policies, and improving public procurement.

 2.4      The PSREP operation addressedmajor impedimentsto ZCCM privatization. The
 initial tranche financed mainly the costs o f a redundancy programfor miners, while the
 second facilitated transfer o fZCCM's miningassets to aprivatebidder plusZCCM's
 conversion into a holding company. A third floating tranchebacked a redesign o fthe
Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP). PSREP also backedmeasurespermitting
Zambianexporters to more easily import inputs, streamliningapprovals by the Zambian
Investment Center, and maintainingbudgetary allocations for social sectors.


3.        AssessmentsofIndividualOperations

3.1       Adjustment lendingis particularly difficult to evaluate. It is not easy to
disentangle the impact of successive operations, especially when, as inZambia, the
periods o f implementation, andthe reforms supported, overlap to a considerable degree.
A case inpoint was the attempted privatizationofZCCM. ERIP supportedthe original
biddingprocess, started in 1995, then suspendedin 1997infavor o fanew process
preferred by the Borrower. ESACI1hadno conditionality covering ZCCM privatization,
andwas left without any legalremedywhen the GRZunexpectedly annulled the results
o fthe first round o fbids, a few months after ESAC11was approved. Under the PSREP,
ZCCM's sale was finally consummated, butnot for long. Hardest o f all i s to determine
the probable impact of these operations, given that the specific conditions triggering
disbursement were not always closely linked to the achievement o fhigher-order project
objectives, impairingthe relevance o fthe project design.



 The specific objectives associated witheach operation are discussed ingreater detail later inthis report.

 Overview

 3.2      ERIP was the fifthina series ofIDA adjustment credits to Zambia duringthe
  1990s. Balance o fpayments support o f SDR 90 million (US$140 million equivalent) was
 disbursedintwo equal tranches, one at credit effectiveness, the secondwhen release
 conditions were satisfied. At approval, full disbursement was projected within six
 months of effectiveness.

  Design, Implementation,and Outcome

 3.3      ERIP's statedobjectives included': (i)      macroeconomic stabilization, with an
 emphasisonmaintaining austerity inpublic spending,while increasingexpenditure
 effectiveness; protecting social sector allocations; andcompleting selectedtrade andtax
 reforms; (ii)  mobilizationo fterm finance for private businessesfrom banks, insurance
 companies, andpensionfunds, while maintaining the viability o fthe contractual savings
 institutions; (iii)establishmentof anewbasic pension system; and(iv) reform o fthe legal,
 fiscal andenvironmental framework for mining,while preparingthe Zambia Consolidated
 Copper Mines, Ltd. (ZCCM) for privatization. O fthe four objectives, the macroeconomic
 andthe miningreforms were themost important. ERIP financingwent towardmeeting
 Zambia's external financing requirements for the secondhalfo f 1995 and all o f 1996.

 3.4      Duringappraisal, concernswere expressedinternallyabout whether this quick-
 disbursing operation: (a) had conditionality sufficient to advance the reform agenda
 significantly;* (b) would do enough to shore up Zambia's capacity deficiencies; (c) was
 sufficiently realistic about the prospects for fiscal discipline, given the approach o f
 elections inlate-1996; (d) would be the proper instrument for delivering notjust balance
 o f payments support, but consolidated structural reform; and (e) would be buttressedby
 sufficient Borrower commitment to complete privatizationo f ZCCM. The latter concern
was heightened bythe perception that past GRZ steps to privatize small andmedium
public enterprises, close down the ZambianPublic Enterprise Holding Corporation
 (ZIMCO), and comply with the conditions for second-tranche ESAC disbursement had
been surrounded byhesitation and delay. Inretrospect, all o fthese concerns appear to
have beenwell-founded.

3.5       Macroeconomicmanagement. Lower-than-expected revenues, combinedwith
higher-than-expected public spending, led to a fiscal crisis forcing a two-month delay in
Boardpresentationto July 1995. This, inturn, exacerbated Zambia's already grave
extemal financing shortfall. A key stumblingblock was GRZ insistence onbailing out
Zambia's largest commercial bank, Meridien, with public transfers amounting to nearly

longstanding relationslup with Zambia. Froman internalmemorandum.

  1.5 percent o f GDP. Eventually, the GRZ acquiescedinputtingMeridien into
 receivership. Weak macroeconomic policy performance meantthat Zambia's eligibility
 to tap into the IMF's RightsAccumulation Program hadto be postponed as well. By
 June 1995, Zambia's international reserves haddeclined to precariously low levels.

 3.6       Fittingarecurrent pattern, the policy slippages ofthe first halfo f 1995 hadto be
 rectifiedinthe secondhalfg So, inthis instance, expenditure cuts and introductiono f a
 value-added tax inJuly 1995 ledto immediate gains inrevenue, declining interest rates,
 reserve accumulation, andcurrency stabilization. However, no sooner hadZambia won
 agreement on a new ESAFinearly December 1995, thenZambiawas, once again, out of
 compliance, this time with six o fthe ten specified performance criteria. Prominent
 among the GRZ's fiscal problems was coping with the immense fiscal drain o f a cash-
 strappedZCCM.

 3.7       With a few variants, muchthe same story was repeatedin1996. As predicted,
 electoral pressuresdid trigger substantial unbudgetedexpenditures, with the result that
 Zambia could not meet all its mid-term ESAFbenchmarks, leadingto suspension o fthe
 February1996agreementwith the Paris Club for rescheduling o fits official external
 debt. Byend-1996, inflation, at 35 percent, soaredfar above the original 10percent
 ESAFtarget.

 3.8       The GRZ exceededthe ERIPtargets for social sector spending, settingaside 35
percent o fnon-debt service budgetreleasesin 1995 for this purpose (compared to the
 minimumrequirement of33 percent), andmaintainingthe shareofnon-personnel public
 expenditures inthis sector at 25 percent (compared to a minimumo f24 percent).l0 Yet,
 as notedbythe Government, becauseoverallpublic spendinghadto be reduced sharply
inrealterms duringthisperiod, anincreasing set aside for social spendingwas not
sufficient to prevent a contraction inthe realpublic social spending duringthis period."
The Borrower notedthat school attendancerates declined duringthis period, which

stagnated, ifnot deteriorated, around this time.'*

these services fell. Although all major social groups appear to have lost,. ..losses in[the smallholder]

majority o fwhich show either stasis or deterioration. For example, the share of population 5 years and
older with no education rose from 18 to 27 percent; primary grade net attendance declined from 69 to 66
percent; and the percentage o f stunted children rose from 46 to 53 percent.

  Thereafter, the DBZ continued to engage innew retail lendingoperations, contrary to its
  commitment to focus on recovering its existing retailportfolio. Eventually, the GRZ
  decided to recapitalize the DBZ with its own resource^.'^

  3.10    Private sector development of the miningsector. ERIP was intended inpart to
  provide early support for Zambia's transition from a state-owned to aprivate sector-
  dominated miningsector.I4 The GRZ announcedits willingness to privatizeZCCM only
  months before ERTP was approved. As a condition o f effectiveness, the Government
  agreedto select qualified international legal andinvestment banking advisors to help
  prepareandimplement an action plan for privatization. Submission of a satisfactory plan
  was a condition o f second tranche release.

  3.11    Advisors were selectedbyZPA in 1995. The planthey developed called for the
  sale of ZCCM assets innine parcels, so as to increasebiddinginterest andmaximize the
  proceeds to the Government. This planwas approved by the ZCCMboard, the ZPA, and
  the Cabinet, andissued inMay 1996, meeting a key second tranche release c~ndition.'~

  3.12    Biddingproceedednormallyduring 1996, with ZPA receivinganumbero foffers,
  including one from the Kafue consortium16for more thanhalfof ZCCM's assets. Bidding
 was completed on schedule inFebruary 1997. However, just before an awardwas to be
  announced, the GRZ removedcontrol fiom ZPA, which had legal responsibility under
 the PrivatizationLaw, andtransferred it to an ex-CEO o f ZCCM, known to have been
 critical o fZCCM privatization. The negotiating team was re-staffed with ZCCM
 employees hostile to privatization. The Kafuebidwas formally rejected inNovember
  1997. ByJune 1998, all negotiations with Kafuehad ceased, leaving the Anglo
 American Corporation(AAC) as the sole remaining potentialbuyer.

 3.13     Some improvements to the policy andregulatory Erameworkwere achieved, with
 furtherbackingfrom theERTP TechnicalAssistance Project (C2875-ZA). A new Mines
 andMineralsAct was passed, alongwith amendmentsto existinglegislation concerning
 collectiono f mineral sector taxes and fees and environmentalprotection regulations.
Also, policy coordinationwas tightened among the Ministries o fMines andMineral
Development, Finance, and LegalAffairs.

3.14     Social security reform. ERIP supported three reforms inthis area: i)establishing
a legal andregulatory framework for pension andinsurance fundmanagement; ii)
transforming the Zambian National Provident Fund(ZNPF) into abasic compulsory
social insurance scheme; and iii)payingthe outstanding liabilities o fthe Public Service
Pension Fund(PSPF), while rolling it into a new compulsory scheme. A major portion
o fthese objectives was achieved. A Pension RegulationAct and aNationalPensionAct
were adopted in 1996, and a Pension InsuranceAuthority (PIA) established. These

second tranche disbursement didnot take place for another 15 months, inAugust 1997.

 legislativeandregulatory changes proved critical for transforming ZNPF into the      `
 NationalPension SchemeAuthority (NAPSA), perthe ERIP actionplan. Later, the ERIP
 technical assistance credit fixthered NAPSA's organizational restructuring through
 retrenchment, adoption in 1998 o fregulations for the NationalPension Scheme (NPS),
 development o f an actuarial modelincorporating the impact ofHN/AIDS, definitiono f
 NAPSA's investment guidelines, andNPS's launchinFebruary2000. Ownership of
 these reforms remains high, andERIP's contributions are viewedpositively.

 3.15     Onthe other hand, achievement ofthe PSPFcomponent was modest. After rapid
 adoption o f an action plan as a Boardcondition inmid-1995, little follow up took place
 over the succeeding three years. Only in 1999, underthe incentive o f a forthcoming IDA
 FYOOFiscalSustainability Credit didmodest progressresumewith a studyofPSPF
 liabilities and development o f a planfor liquidatingthem. Paymentsto statutory
 retirees -totaling   KW 140billion-began     only in2001.

 Ratings

 Relevance

 3.16     Overallrelevance i s ratedmodest. Most relevantwas the goal o f launching a
 value-added tax, which was vitally neededto shore up Zambia's fiscal position. O f
modest relevance were the objectives onprivatization, term lending, andsocial security
reform. With one possible exception-the      social security reformproposal, which
 contained aprovision for creation o f a secondpillar inunpromising conditions-ERIP's
objectives were uobjectionable. However, incritical instances, they didnot go far
enough. For example, ERIP conditionality pressedthe GFUto formulate a viable
privatizationplanfor ZCCM and the restructuring o fminingpolicy, but stopped short of
requiringthe GRZ to actually complete the sale before second-tranche disbursement. In
other words, becauseo fthe way ERIP was designed, the Borrower was able to annulthe
biddingprocedure with impunity, as far as IDAwas concemed.

3.17      However, the relevance o fthe pension reforms was considered only modest for
several reasons. First, the old-age security provisions o fthe statutory pension system
affected only about one-tenth ofthe active labor force, mostly those inurbanareas
already enjoying relativelyhighwages. This meant the reforms, even when completed,
would have had a negligibleimpact on the retirement security ofthe far larger segment o f
poor rural laborers. Secondly, the reforms did little to rectify Zambia's fiscal difficulties,
since pension fundpayouts represented only a smallportion ofpublic sector spending.
Finally, given the myriad constraints on development o f capital markets, strengthening
the pension funds was o frelatively low priority.

3.18     Finally, the term lending objective was ratedsubstantial for relevance, becauseit
was, and is, and an important constraint onprivate sector-led development. However,
the likelihood that commercialbankswould participate inexpanding such lendingwhile
facing subsidized competition from the state-owned DBZrequired more careful analysis.

                                              10




 3.19    Achievement o fERIP's statedobjectives is rated modest overall. Onthe negative
 side ofthe ledger, the Government's record on maintainingmacroeconomic performance
 was disappointing; budgetary protection ofthe share o f social expenditures was
 ineffectualinshoring up the social safety net; privatizationo fZCCM was derailed; the
 supply o f long-term bank credit failed to expand; and the state development bank (DBZ)
 continued providing subsidizedretail credit, incontravention of IDA understandingswith
 the GRZ. Onthe positive side, avalue-added tax was successfully launched andmanyo f
 the planned social security reforms were achieved.

 3.20    Not surprisingly, the supplyo fterm capital to the private sector didnot increase
 significantly duringthis period, not only because ofreluctance on the part o f commercial
 banksto compete with subsidized public term lending, but also becausethe inflationary
 environment combined with the appealo fhighshort-term treasury billrates left
 commercial banks, insurance companies, andpension funds with little incentiveto
 undertakeriskier long-termlending.

 3.21    The intended social security reforms were mostly achieved with adoption ofthe
 PensionRegulationandNationalPensionActs in 1996; andthe establishment o f the
Pension Insurance (PIA) andthe National Pension Scheme Authorities (NAPSA) in 1997.
 Onlythe actionplanfor creating aPublic Service PensionFund(PSPF) was not
implemented.


Outcome

3.22     Takinginto account the unsatisfactory macroeconomic performance, the
negligibleresults ingetting commercial bank term lendingup andrunning, andthe long
andcostly delays incompletingthe ZCCM auction, against themodestly-relevant
achievements of ERIP's socialprotectionagenda, outcome i s downgraded from
satisfactory at the time o f ICRreview to moderately unsatisfactory.

Sustainability

3.23    Inview ofthe renewedprogress since 1999towardbroader socialsecurity reform,
andthe continued operationality ofthe value-added tax, sustainability was upgraded from
uncertain inthe ICRreview to likely.

Institutional Development Impact

3.24    Themost significant andlasting change promotedbyERIP was the improvement
to the tax baseresultingfrom the value-added tax. The social security reforms were o f a
lesser order, although they represented a modest start toward the launcho f anew basic
pension system. Finally, little o f lastingsignificance was achieved inthe miningsector.
Hence, the rating for institutional development impactwas downgraded fiom substantial
inthe ICRreviewto modest.

BankandBorrowerPerformance

 3.25    Bankperformance was ratedunsatisfactory, andBorrowerperformance high& so,
both o fwhich were downgraded from satisfactory ratings inthe ICRreview. Bothparties
 shareresponsibilityfor ERIP's design shortcomings. Inthe first instance, the formulation
o f conditionality was overly-reliant on easy-to-implement preparatory steps, rather than
hard-to-reverse final actions. Secondly, there were the GRZ's recurrent lapses infiscal
management, which distracted attention fkom implementation o fthe non-fiscal reforms,
andlimited the potentialbenefits ofthose reforms which were implemented. ERIP's
framework for monitoring macroeconomic performance was not up to the task. Thrdly,
the Parliament's unwillingnessto approve anewapex institutiondoomedthe planned
restructuring o f the ZambianDevelopment Bank,which continued to engage in
subsidized retail operations (contrary to its ERP commitments), and, thereby,
discouraged commercial banks fkom supplyinglarger volumes o fterm lending. Fourthly,
the social protectionmeasuressupportedbytheproject were ineffectual. Finally, the
Borrower's decision to annul the results o f the ERIP-sponsoredbiddingprocess for
ZCCM privatizationwas a costly mistake, transforming what mighthave beena
profitable sale under favorable world pricing conditions into an untimely sale under
unfavorable circumstances. While awaiting a second chance to privatize ZCCM,
taxpayers hadto absorbthe burdeno fZCCM's mountingoperational losses and a
deterioration inthe quality o f its assets. As a result, Zambia missed out on its single best
chanceto kick-start the economy through a private-sector-led growth strategy.

SecondEconomicand Social Adjustment Credit
(ESAC 11,Cr. 2910-ZA)

Overview

3.26    TheESACIIcredit, approved inFY97representedthe sixth IDA adjustment
credit to Zambia inas many years. Like the FirstESAC inFY94, it focused on
maintaining social expenditures, institutingsocial sector reforms, andimprovingpublic
service delivery. The stated objectives o fthe operation were to:'' (i) support
establishment o f a stable macroeconomic environment; (ii)    improve export
competitiveness through rationalizationo f the structure o f effective protection; (iii)
accelerate implementation o fthe landmarketreforms approvedbyParliament in 1995;
and(iv) improvethe deliveryofvital social services.

3.27    Giventhat ZCCMprivatizationwas acornerstone o ftheBank's adjustment
program throughout the 199Os, particularly ERIP,it is somewhat surprisingthat
satisfactory progress on privatization was made a conditiononly for the second tranche.




"Thestatedobjectives aretakenfromaninternaldocument.

                                                 12


    Management's rationale was that conditionality should leave sufficient flexibility inthe
    timing andcontent so as to maintaintheplaying field levelbetweenthe GRZ andthe
    mostly large-enterprise bidders.

    Design,Implementation,and Outcome

    3.28   Thedesign ofESACIIwas complex anddemanding. Borrower capacity was
   taxed to the limitbydesign features which includedeleven conditions for secondtranche
   release, requiringinputs from eight ministries and several agencies. Moreover,
   compliance with a recently-approved IMFESAF(December 1995) was made difficult,
   due to the effects o f drought, declining domestic copper production, andpolicy drift as
   elections approachedinlate-1996. The extemal financing situation tumed critical inthe
,  first halfo fthat year, whenbilateral donors suspendedtheir assistanceon governance
   grounds. Hence, as ESACIIwas reachingappraisal, IDA hadbecome the sole significant
   remainingsource o f external finance.

   3.29    TheESAC11operationwas approved inAugust 1996, inthe amount of SDR 62.4
   million(US$90 million equivalent). Fundswere disbursed intwo equal tranches, the first

   3.30    Macroeconomicmanagement. Onthe macroeconomic front, tightmonetary
   policy lowered inflation. Improvedinternational markets generatedhigherprices for
   copper exports, leading to the first consecutive years o freal GDP growth (1996-97) since
   the 1980s. Onthe negative side, budgetary management remained erratic. A large
   unbudgeted wage increase for civil servants wasjust one o f several program
   transgressionsduringthis period. After the elections, the GRZ tightenedfiscal
   management sufficiently to passthe ESACIImid-term review inMarch 1997. Yet, one
   month after that review, the Government decreed another large civil service salary
   increase, boosting the total public sector wage billbynearly 15 percent above budgeted
   amounts. The above-program fiscal deficit, the GRZ decisions leadingto major delay in
  privatizingZCCM, andthe suspension o f all bilateral assistance doomed continuation o f
  the IMFESAF arrangement, which was haltedinlate 1997, andnot reneweduntilearly
   1999, long after ESACI1hadclosed.

  3.3 1 Improveexport competitivenessthrough trade, procurement,land, and
  labor marketreforms. Trade liberalization was successhlly achieved, buthadlittle
  sustainedimpact on growth innon-copper exports, an important motivation for the
  reform. Most tariffexemptions were eliminated and the tariff structure was compressed,
  withduties ofzeroto 5 percent for most capitalgoods andbasic materials, 15percent for
  intermediate goods, and 25 percent for final products. However, continued hightrading
  barriers among Zambia's regional trading partners diminished the immediate benefits for
  Zambianexporters, althoughaffording some benefit to consumers, whose access to cheap
  imports improved. Withrespect to public procurement, ESACIIpromoted
  decentralization ofthe process to line ministries. However, to date, there i s little
  evidence this change has produced significant improvements inprocurement
  transparency or efficiency.

 3.32      Landreformsfocused on implementingthe 1995 LandsAct, speedingup
 processing o f applications for leasehold landtenure and issuanceof landtitles, and
 regularizingthe status o f informal urbansettlements. Regulations for the LandsAct were
 issued, a LandDevelopment Fundwas establishedto assist local councils inimproving
 localinfrastructure, and a Lands Tribunal createdto deal with grievances anddisputes.
 However, the Borrower recently acknowledgedthat low utilizationo f agricultural
 continues, due inpart to cumbersome proceduresinobtaining title deeds-97           percent o f
 farmers still have no title to the landthey cultivate-and   that "very little progresshad
 beenmade inmarket development for land, titlingbothcustomary as well as state lands,
 andsettingup a landadministrationandprocedure.'y18For most o fthe urbanpoor, similar
 lack of title precludes them from capitalizing on income-generating activities. An
 amendment to the Employment Act, passedinlate 1997, eliminated sector-wide wage
 bargaining and the provision o fhousingor housing allowances by employers, but failed
 to redress other key constraints to private sector development, such as lack o f areliable
 source o f long-term capital, poor public services, including for training andbusiness
 information, macroeconomic instability, andpoor governance. Hence, the labor reforms
 have had little tangible effect inimprovingbusinessconditions.

 3.33      Social sector services. Like two preceding adjustment credits, ESAC IIsought to
 protect the levelo f expenditures for education, health, the social safety net, andwater
 and sanitationbystipulatingthat budgetary allocations should rise over time as a shareo f
 total discretionary spending. However, as aninstrument for ensuring anincreased flow
 o frealpublic resourcesto address social needs, this condition left something to be
 desired. The mainproblem was that Zambia's risingburdeno f service onthe public debt
 forced the contraction o freal discretionary spending. Ths meant that even a gradually
increasing share set aside for social expenditures translated into declining social spending
inrealterms.

3.34      Addedto t h s were complications arisingfrom the operationo fthe cashbudgeting
system, which disbursedresources erratically, disruptingplanningandimplementation;
and lax expenditure monitoring, which made it virtually impossible to ensurethat the
cashreleasedwas actually spent on the provisiono f social services. For example, cash
releasesauthorized late inthe fiscal year to satisfy the tranche conditionon social
spending frequently left too little time for lineministriesto spendthem for their intended
purposebefore the fiscal year reached an end. This opened the way for poorly-monitored
post-fiscal year reallocations by cash-strapped line ministries.

3.35      The evidence, such as it is, suggeststhat the social expenditure protectionclauses
had atangible, but modest, impact on the availabilityo f social services. Cashreleasesto
the social sectors increasedgradually, from 33 percent o fthe domestic discretionary
budgetin 1995 to 36 percent in 1999 (Table 3.1). Itis instructivethat, inthe only year o f
this series when no IDA conditionality existed with respect to public sector social
spending, 1998, budgetary allocations declined 15 percent inrealterms. Otherwise, it
would appear that, between 1991and 1999, real social spending remained roughly

 inper capita terms. Inthis regard, disaster relief faredconsiderably better than all the
 other social categories, while healthand education heldtheir own, and spending on social
 safety nets and water and sanitation fell well behind.

DrugPolicy; iii)adoption ofa framework definingthe role o fthe NationalFoodand

 Ratings

 Relevance

 3.40    Relevance is rated substantial, largelyreflectingthe centrality o fthe service
 delivery andmacroeconomic aims o fESACI1to Zambia's critical development
 constraints, and IDA'SCountry Assistance Strategy (CAS). However, the design o fthe
 land, procurement, labor, trade, andZCCM reforms rendered them at best modestly
 relevant, since, even under ideal circumstances, their net development impact was
 unlikelyto besignificant, becausethey failedto assemble a critical mass ofnecessary
 reform steps sufficient to produce such animpact.



3.41    Overall efficacy is ratedmodest. Macroeconomic management was compromised
byerratic expenditure discipline, inadequatemonitoringandcontrol, andthe lack o fa
sustainableprogramo f external financing, once ESAF andbilateral donor financing
ceased. Trade liberalizationmeasureswere fully achieved, but results have beenmixed,
better for consumers, but modest for exporters, given continued protection inthe markets
ofregional tradingpartners. The ESAC11devices for protecting social spending did
maintain budgetaryallocations roughly constant, but failed to address major deficiencies
inhowthat spending is accountedfor, andhow ittranslated into increased service
availability. Similarly, the health and education measuresconstituted auseful beginning,
and satisfied therelevant tranche conditions, but generally made little difference in
increasingthe availability o f essential social services.

Outcome

3.42    Takinginto account the severe disruptionexperiencedwithrespect to the process
of ZCCM privatization andthe erratic macroeconomic policies pursued, combinedwith
themodestrelevance ofthe land, labor, health, trade, andeducation reforms
implemented, andcontinued inadequaciespost-closing indelivering andmonitoringbasic
social services, outcome is rated unsatisfactory, as compared to satisfactory at the time o f

  conditionality to cover the still-incomplete ZCCM privatizationleft IDA without an
  effective remedywhen the GRZbacked away fi-om the biddingprocess. Andthe GRZ
  decision to restart the auctionprocess with only one remainingbidderwas even more
  reprehensible, costing the public coffers hundreds o fmillions ofU S dollars inadditional
  subsidies to cover ZCCM's operational losses, and substantial capital lossesby declining

  Public Sector ReformandExportPromotionCredit
  (PSREP,Cr. 3167-ZA)
  Overview

  3.46    Duringpreparation, PSREP objectives were revisedsignificandy, reflectingthe
 growing interdependence between fiscal viability andthe removal o fZCCM fi-om
 dependence onpublic subsidies. Originally, the credit, as its name suggests, was to focus
 on public sector reform, and, inthe process, also supply approximately US$140million
 o f quick-disbursing, balance o fpayments support. When Zambia fell out o f compliance
 with the ESAFinearly 1998, negotiations on a new IDA operationwere suspended.
 Meanwhile, the fiscal drag ofZCCM lossesreachedunsustainable levels, averaging $20-
 $30millionmonthly.2o Growing supplier arrearagesbrought the threat o flawsuits
 placing liens on ZCCM's assets, makingthem effectively unavailable for privatization.

 3.47     Moreover, PSREP's putative public sector reform goals appeared increasingly
 unrealistic, as the realizationset inthat downsizing from 120,000 to 80,000 civil servants
 would have resulted inthe entire government having fewer civil servants thanjust those
 currently inthe health, education, andpublic safety sectors. This was regarded as
politically undoable within the relatively short timefi-ame o f an adjustment operation.

 3.48    For all these reasons, IDA andthe GRZ agreed to reformulate PSREP
conditionality so that it focused primarilyon ZCCM privatization. A financing planwas
reached with external donors, after the GRZ signed a memorandum o funderstanding
guaranteeing the sale o fZCCM assets on specified terms. The PSREP commitment
amount was raisedbyUS$30 millionto US$170 milliontotal. Disbursement o ftwo of
the three tranches, representing US$130million, was tied to ZCCM privatization, and


'O Inanintemaldocument, IDA contended that there was noviable macroeconomic scenario without
privatizationofZCCM.

 only US$40million to public sector reform. The first tranche o fUS$65 million was
 releasedupon effectiveness, two days after IDA approval, inJanuary 1999. The proceeds
 financed separation grants for a large portion of ZCCM's workforce, numberinginthe
 tens o fthousands, providing the newly laid offworkers with terminationbenefits and
 retraining. Without this contribution, it i s unlikelythat the social andpoliticalconditions
 would have beenright for makingprivatizationdomestically palatable.

 3.49      InMarch2000, fiveyearsafterdonorsfirst identifiedZCCMprivatizationasa
 core reform, the state enterprise was sold on terms highlyunfavorable to the GRZ,21and
 nullifiedsoon thereafter bythe purchaser's change-of-heart. Other supported reforms
 faredlittle better. Weak government commitment continued to undercut efforts to
 improve the efficiency o fthe civil service. Once again, tariffs on importedinputswere
 lowered, but providedmarginalbenefits for exporters beset by a myriado fmorepressing
 operating conditions. Followingintroduction o f streamlined procedures, the number o f
 applications to the Zambia Investment Center actually declined, and, to date, the Center
 has failed to become the envisioned "one stop shop" for foreign investors. And, similar
 to the experience withESACII,social budgetswere maintained inrealterms during
 PSREPimplementation, but continued to be inadequately monitored for results.

 Design, Implementation,andOutcome

 3.50     The primarystated objectives o f the PSREP were to (i)                complete ZCCM
 privatizationand (ii)      implementaZCCM labor reduction program.22ZCCM's largeand
 growing operating losses converted the PSREP into something o f a rescue operation.
Additional PSREP objectives included: (iii)              improvingthe public service by reforming
pay, employment, andmanagement controls; (iv) promotingprivate sector activity,
especially export trade, by improving accessto imported inputs and streamlining
investmentapprovals; and(v) strengthening the delivery o fsocial services andthe safety
net bymonitoring keybudgetary allocations and supporting policy reforms.

3.51     ByMarch 1999,ZCCMhadbegunrestructuring itselfinto aholdingcompany, so
it couldmanagethepublic sector's remainingclaims andobligations vis-a-vis the
company's new private mine owners. About this time, a newthree-year PRGFwas
approved, providing an initial infusion o f SDR 10million. However, Zambia couldnot
meet the PRGFperformance criteria specified for end-June 1999,resulting insuspension
o f disbursements fi-om that program. Meanwhile, the sale o fZCCM's assets also raninto
anunexpectedroadblock inJuly 1999,when AAC announced it didnot want to be the
sole stakeholder. Eventually, this obstacle, too, was overcome, when the Intemational
Finance Corporation (IFC) andthe CommonwealthDevelopment Corporation(CDC)
agreedto take minority stakes o f 7.5 percent each.




21Duringits lastthree fiscal years, ZCCM's cumulative operational losses amounted to US$927 million.
To complete the sale, the Government assumed outstandingZCCM debts ofUS$770millionowed to
suppliers (35 percent), official bilateral creditors (39 percent), andmultilateral agencies (25 percent).
  The objectives are drawn from an internal document.

                                                     18


  3.52    With this final push,the sale ofZCCMtook place onMarch31,2000. The
  Konkola andNchanga Divisions, the Nampundwe Mines and Chinogola Refractory Ores
  became the Konkola Mining Company (KCM), with AAC, IFC, and CDC asjoint
  shareholders. K C M also agreedto managethe Nkana smelter andrefinery under
  contract. The Mufulira Divisionandthe Nkanamine and concentrator were soldto
  Mopani Copper Mines, owned by Glencore AG Ltd. andFirstQuantumLtd.
 Retrenchment o fthe workforce was completed a year later inMarch2001.

  3.53    Then, inJanuary2002, AAC announcedthat, due to their short remaining life and
 highoperationalcosts, its existing miningoperationswere notprofitable, andthat further
 investment inthem would not be value-enhancing for its shareholders. The company
 took this decisioninthe context o f aplanfor rationalizingits activities worldwide.
 Needless to say, this announcement dealt an enormous blow to investor confidence, not
 only inZambia's miningsector but inits entire economy.23

 3.54     The floating tranche was releasedinJune 2000, upon Cabinet approval o f a Public
 Sector ReformProgram (PSRP) action plan. Someprogress was made towardreducing
 the size o f the civil service, from 117,000 at the end o f 1998 to 102,000 at the start o f
 2001,but few improvements with respectto pay or management controls were achieved.
 Still, given past experience, approval o fthe PSRP must beregarded as amodest initial
 step toward securing greater civil service productivity.

 3.55     Finally, with respect to the trade and investment components ofthe PSREP,what
 can be stated is that duty drawback (DDB) andmanufacturedunderbond(MUB)
 schemes were revamped to improve access to importedinputs. However, these measures
 had only a tangential impact on exporters, who face a plethorao f daunting challenges to
 become intemationally competitive. These include strengthened regional trade
 liberalization agreements, more efficient public regulation, accessto credit, and
 improvements inlabor relations. Similarly, the investmentapprovalprocesses o f the
 Zambia Investment Center (ZIC) were streamlined, but with minimal effect. Infact, the
 number o fprivate applications actually declined duringPSREP implementation, due to
 the unresolved investment bottlenecks alluded to inthe page 12discussion above.

  essentialto Zambia's economic rehabilitation. Social expenditure protection was also
  substantially relevant, although its relevance was diminishedby the inattention to
 installingmuch-needed monitoring andexpenditure controls to track impact on the target
 population.

 3.57     Inotherareas,PSREP'sobjectiveswere, atbest,modestlyrelevant. Thepublic
 sector reform actionplanwas little more than a rehash ofthe failed plandrawn up for the
  1997 PSW, and gave little reason to expect a better result. Indeed, IDA has now
 acknowledged that adjustment lending i s an inappropriate instrument for promoting
 meaningfulpublic sector reform, andhas abandonedits support o fthe PSRP. Instead,
 IDA plans to rely moreheavily on adaptableprogram lendingwithin a longer-term
 framework. PSREP components for investmentand export promotioninvolved
 easy-to-meet, but low-impact conditionality, providing, at best, modest relief fkom the
 critical constraints inthese sectors.



 3.58     Efficacy is ratedmodest, inlight o fthe ultimate failure to privatizeZCCM
 permanently. As a subsidiarymatter, retrenchment o fthe workforce was successful, and
 helpedclear animportant obstacle to completing the sale o fZCCM. However, AAC's
 withdrawal from the miningsector, andthe highinvestor uncertainty this decision has
 engendered, have depressedZambia's near-term growthprospects by something on the
 order o f 1percent of GDP annually. Finally, the measuresundertaken inthe areas o f
 investment, export promotion, public sector reform, and social expenditure protection
 were o fmoment, but, becauseo f the omission o fcomplementary reforms inthe project
 design, had only a modest development impact.

 Outcome

 3.59    Giventhat ZCCM's privatizationprocesswas severely disrupted, andthat the
`remainingsupported reforms are expectedto generate meager net benefits, the rating for
 outcome has beendowngraded from moderately satisfactory at the ICRreview stage to
moderately unsatisfactory.

Sustainability

3.60     Sustainability is ratedunlikely, rather than likely, after the definitive unravelingo f
the ZCCM privatization.Private sector activity i s expected to continue, but at a lower
levelthan hadbeenenvisaged for the next several years. Needless to say, AAC's virtual
abandonmento f its copper mininginvestment inZambia sent a negative signal to other
potential bidders for these assets.

Institutional Development Impact

3.61     Institutional development impact was rated modest, as at the time o fICRreview,
reflectingnot only a diminishedperspective on private sector-led growthprospects,
post-Anglo American, but also the modest transformationachieved innon-mining
institutions.

 Bank and Borrower Performance

 3.62     Notwithstandingflaws inthe PSREP design, which didnot achieve critical mass
 inpromotingnon-mininggrowth, therewas littlemorethat IDAcouldhave done to
 promote ZCCM privatization. It agreedto finance important collateral costs associated
 withrestructuring the company, notablyseparationbenefits andtraining, andafforded the
 key investor additional "comfort" inthe form o f a minority IFC equity stake. Onthese
 grounds, IDA's performance was ratedsatisfactory, unchanged from the ICRreview.

 3.63     Nor can the Borrowerbeheldresponsible for decisions made bythe private
 investor. The GRZ completed its endofthe bargain on ZCCM, andmade modest
 progress on non-mining reform. Therefore, Borrower performance on the PSREP was
 ratedsatisfuctoiy, unchanged from the ICRreview.


 4.       Summary Findings andLessons

 4.1      The summaryfindings and lessons draw primarilyfrom the performance
 assessments, but also benefitfrom the findings o f OED's 2002 Country Assistance
 Evaluation(CAE) for Zambia. Issuestranscending the individual operations are raised,
 particularlyas regards the highand sustainedlevels o fBank adjustment lendingto
 Zambia. In this way, it i s anticipated that broad lessons for countries inAfrica engaged
 inlongtermreformprogramswill emerge.

 Issue 1: When pressuresto maintaina Clientcurrenton the service of itsexternal

 a proposedoperation, with the Boardat the time of loanpresentation.

 4.2     Findings. Judging from a successiono f CAS reports and adjustment lending
 appraisal documents, there i s ample evidence for the view that the volume and frequency
 o f IDA's adjustment lendingto Zambiawere influencedbythe desire to keep the
Borrower current on its external debt service obligations. Indeed, IDA staffhave
defended the frequency o f adjustment lendingby arguing that, hadZambia failed to meet
its payment obligations, the economy would have been thrown into a tailspin. Reflecting
thisbelief, the CASs of 1994,1997, and 1999providedfor a steadyrhythmo fadjustment
operations, at the rate o f one per year. The lendingamounts associatedwith these
operations exceededagreedIDA allotments by a wide margin.24Yet, never was the goal
ofkeepingZambia current with its external debt obligations mentioned amongthe stated
objectives o fthese operations.




24According to IDA financial riskassessment specialists, actual IDA lending commitments exceeded the
agreed amounts for the FY98-00periodby +I36 percent for Zambia, whereas, inthe remainder o f the
Africa Region, there was a shortfall o f 19percent. Agreed IDA lending targets are determined usinga
standardized allocation formula based onpopulationand policy performance, adjusted for certain other
factors agreed between the Region inquestion and the financial risk department.

  4.3       The pressure for large and fiequent IDA credits undermined quality at entry.
  Pressures to disburse on a schedulecompatible with Zambia's debt service requirements
  ledto conditionality which relied onnumerous, but often superficial, tranche
 requirements. Supported reforms relied excessively on easy-to-implement "stroke o fthe
 pen" measures, whose ultimate impact was bluntedbythe lack ofwider support inside
  and outside the public sector for implementation and enforcement. The hghvolume o f
 IDA quick-disbursinglending also diminishedpressure on a reluctant Borrower to act
 more expeditiously on crucial, but politically-sensitive, reforms, such as privatizationo f
 the copper mines. Finally, quick-disbursing instruments were inappropriate vehicles, in
 manycases, for supporting longandcomplex reforms (e.g., public sector reform inthe
 PSREP operation andZCCMprivatizationsupportedbyERIP,ESAC11,andPSREP
 operations).

 4.4        IDAwas slow to acknowledge the fact that Zambia's external debt burdenhad
 becomeunsustainable, and inneedo f substantial reduction rather thancontinued
 servicing, ifthe considerable investment needs o f the economy were to be adequately
 financed. Other advocacy groups anddonors were quicker ingivingvoice to this
 reality.25

 4.5        Lesson. Pressuresto lendfor debt andbalance o fpayments reasons can easily
 leadto hastily-conceived, superficial conditionality which generatesfew long-term
 benefits. The drive to findnew sectors to lend oftenpiles on new conditionality, even
 though previously-supported reforms have not yet been consolidated. The HIPC
 initiative helps separate debt servicing considerations from support for structural reform,
 butonly partially so. For example, H P C debt reliefto Zambia, as presently configured,
 will not lower debt servicepayments significantly untilafter 2005. Hence, IDA will
 continue to face pressures to relyexcessively on quick-disbursing vehicles inZambia,
 such as programmatic lending, when such vehicles have repeatedly failed to achieve the
 desiredreformresults.

 Issue2: "Stroke ofthepen" measuresare an unreliableindicator of Borrower
 commitmentto genuinereform

4.6        Findings. The Chiluba regimewon international praise for its initial roundo f
reforms inthe early nineties. However, many o fthese reforms were what have been
termed "stroke o f the pen" measures, meaningthey couldbe placedinto effect solely
withthe consent of the ChiefExecutive. This includedmeasuresto liberalizeprice,
interest rate, and exchangerate controls, which experience has shown were sustained.

4.7        Onthe other hand, with thebenefit o fhindsight, other "stroke o fthe pen" reforms                .
haveprovenless durable, possibly because they were adopted without having securedthe


25For example, OED's 1996 CountryAssistance Review (Report No. 15675, June 3, 1996)noted (para.
6.29, p. 107) that "some inZambia still believe the debt service curtailment in1987-89 was the appropriate
approach. They suggest that paying off arrears andcontinuing full debt servicing postponed investment in
infrastructure and diverted management attention to debt service, both delaying recovery. The implied
criticism is that the Bank has failed to deal realistically with Zambia's debt overhang, and has misplaced
priorities-focusing   onrestoring creditworthiness rather thanrecovery o f economic growth, and
emphasizing servicing o fthe debt rather than debt forgiveness."

requisitesupport o fkey affected stakeholders. For example, there is the case o fZCCM
privatization, wherein the initialbiddingprocess was subsequently annulled, leading to
 costly andprotracted rebidding. Another areawas reform o f the public sector. The
PSREPwas initiallypremisedon securingreformofthe civil service, withthe agreement
o fthe President andthe Ministero fFinance. However, afier serious oppositionsurfaced
fromaffected civil service organizations, PSREPhadto berefocused, as bothIDAand
the GRZ acknowledged that the required broad support for such reform didnot exist.
IDA hasnow opted for amore gradual approach, extending adaptableprogramloans for
public service reform over the anticipated space o f at least a decade.

4.8     Lesson. "Stroke ofthe pen" measures do not provide reliable guidance about the
true extent o f commitment to structural reform. The small core ofreformers inthe
Presidency and the Ministryo f Finance found their efforts quickly stymied, once the
affected interest groups became aware o f what was beingplanned, and how it would
affect their interests. Participatory approaches, including evidence o fpublic support fiom
key interest groups, stand a better chance o f elicitingthe requisite support for core
reforms, even ifthe process takes longer, and the reforms dilutedrelative to what would
have been ideal.

Issue 3: Inconsistent macroeconomic performance severely constricts the benefits of
reform intended to promote private sector-led growth.

4.9     Findings. The appraisal documents o f the EMP, ESAC11,andPSREPoperations
underlinedthe importance o f continued satisfactory implementationo f an acceptable
macroeconomic framework. Yet, the Borrower repeatedly faltered incomplying with
this framework.

4.10    After loweringinflationfrom triple-digit levels in 1990to roughly 50percent in
1994, budgetarydiscipline lapsed, with the result that inflation duringthe remainder o f
the decade floundered indouble digits, with severe consequences for private sector
growth. Inparticular, private sector representatives cited chronic inflation andexchange
rate instability, bothby-products o fthe Borrower's uncertainmacroeconomic
management, as key constraints to investment. Inflation also thwarted the development
o f a market for long-term credit, a key aim o fthe EMP-supportedbank reforms, which
has posedanother bottleneck to private sector development, especially for the multitude
o f small and medium enterprises.

4.11 Lesson. Steadyprogress toward consolidating macroeconomic stability is asine
qua non for successfully achieving the sort o fprivatization andfinancial sector reforms
supportedbythese operations, as well as for attaining the desired private sector response.

Issue4: Diversificationofproductionhasnot occurredat the pacethat would have
beendesirable, inpartbecausethe reformssupporteddidnotincludemeasuresto
addressother key non-priceconstraints,such as the poor conditionof Zambia's
infrastructureand itsweak governance.

4.12    Findings. Although recognized as one key to sustainablegrowth, Zambia's
manufacturing sector remains largely undiversifiedand dependentupon the copper
miningsector.

4.13    Thereforms supportedby IDA adjustment lendinginthe 90s were necessary, but
far from sufficient to produce atangible result. For example, reductions inimporttariffs
stimulated only amodest export response, constrained by a varietyo f supplybottlenecks.
One difficulty hasbeenthe limitedmanagement experience o fmost Zambiannon-mining
companies. Other factors includedthe poor condition o fZambia's infrastructure,
inefficiency inthe deliveryof most public sector services, over-regulation, andthe impact
of HIV/AIDSon the supply andquality o fthe work force.

4.14    Lesson. A multivalent focus, addressing the full range o f constraints onprivate
sector development, will beneeded, ifthe pace o f diversificationi s to be accelerated.
This task is all the more urgent, now that the largestprivately-ownedminingcompany
has decided to terminate its mininginterests inZambia.

                       Commentsfromthe Regionon the Draft PPAR

 (i)     PrivatizationofZCCM: Privatization is alongprocess andevenwhenitruns
 on smoothly it can take average 18 months. ZCCM i s a big enterprise and its
 privatizationwas lengthy. Recruitment of its Transaction advisors, preparation o f
 enterprise for privatization, audit reports, valuation o f company assets and agreeing on
 what to privatize was a lengthyprocess. The fact that the project assisted GRZ on this
 process was commendable. The completion o fprivatizationi s something which nor IDA
 nor GRZ had control over. The market determine when to buy andafter aproper due
 diligence on assets can decide to completetransaction. Inthis case, the revisionon rating
 on outcome to moderately Unsatisfactory is notjustified.

 (ii)    As for other ratings inparticular that ofBorrower andBankperformance to our
 opinion shouldbe satisfactory. Boththe Bank and government worked very hardand
 cautiously on the project.

(iii)    OnPSREP, the outcome is proposedto bedowngraded to "moderately
unsatisfactory" "giventhat ZCCMs privatizationi s reversed andthat the remaining
reforms.......I' We do not agree with the assessment that ZCCM privatizationwas
reversed; K C M andthe Copperbelt regionhave benefited from the new investments in
terms o fincreased demand from suppliers and economic activity. Also, the Government
hasput inadequate effort infindinganother strategic partner for K C M after Anglo-
American's exit. Infact, a successfulbidderhas beenidentified and approvedbythe
Cabinet.

(iv)     The PPAR arguesthat for ESAC 11,the "outcome" ratingnow is unsatisfactory,
compared to a previous "satisfactory" ratingbyboth OED's ES andthe ICR. The
reasons, the PPAR argues, are that the "conditionality for protectingthe share o f 1996
social spending intotal budgetary allocations sufferedthe same deficiency as inERIP"
andthat there are "complications fkomthe operation o fthe cashbudgeting system". Yet
inthetext, thePPARacknowledges that "Cashreleasesto the socialsectors increases
gradually from 33% o fthe domestic discretionary budget in 1995 to 36%in 1999" and
that "inthe year inwhich no IDA conditionality existed, the allocations declined by 15%"
(para. 3.33-3.35, PPAR). SO thenwhy does the PPARhave a problem? Perhapsbecause
the PPARwas arguingthat "between 1991and 1999, real social spendingremained
roughly constant, although,   ......,thisimplied a decline inper capita terms" (para. 3.35).

        This argument is notjustified inthe context o fan economy that hadto drastically
reduce its public spendingdue to external shocks, and more importantlydue to the need
for adjustingto amuchlower level o fresources, given the unrealistic initial levels o f
public spending inthe 1960's and 1970's when copper revenue was abundant. In this
tight financial situation, keepingsocial spendinginrealterms while the overallENTIRE
GOVERNMENT BUDGET was falling was indeedan achievement. Sure, ifone had
extra resources, one should increase the per capital social spending, but during this

                                               36


period, this was not the case. It i s also not clear what the PPARwould suggest the
country should do as an altemative. As far as the cashbudget was concerned, it was
establishedbefore ESACII, and still exist today, and its problems was not discovered
until 1998,whenthe "Budget ManagementReport" was issued, so Ifail to see any
connection betweenthe cashbudget andESAC 11.
 (v)    Perhapsbecause o fthis weak analysis, the lessons that the PPARtries to draw
have very limitedrelevance: Whether one should include the fiscal andBOPneeds as an
objective inthe President'sReport (and o f course these are the raisond'etre for
adjustment lending) should have no bearing on the outcome; ex-ante decision to support
an adjustment programdoes not have the luxury o f ex-post commitment to reform and
has to rely on "stroke o fthe pen" reforms; anddiversificationo f course cannot be
addressedinthe context o f adjustment lendinginstruments.

(vi)    Insum, we believe the PPARfails to make aconvincing caseto changethe
ratings of OED's ESs and,o fthe ICRs.

                      OED's Responseto Commentsfromthe Region

 1.      PrivatizationofZCCM. OED agrees that privatizationis oftenlengthyand
 complex. However, three points shouldbemade here:

         First, ERlPhadfour objectives, which includednotjust (i) sector reform
                                                                       mining
 andprivatization, but also (ii) macroeconomic stabilization, (iii)  mobilizationo fterm
 finance for the private sector, and (iv) establishment o f a newbasic pension system. The
 PPARprovided evidence that two o fthe four-macro         stabilization andmobilizationo f
term finance-were     not achieved at all, while two-mining sector reform andthe new
pensionsystem-were       only partially achieved. Ths i s the basis for the moderately
unsatisfactory outcome rating.

        Second, the original biddingfor ZCCM failed, not becausethe market was
reluctant to buy (there were many competitive bids on offer), but becausethe GRZ was
fundamentally ambivalent about selling offits major state-owned enterprise, as evidenced
byits decision to replace the pro-privatizationZPA team withofficials knownto be
hostile to ZCCM's salejust before an awardwas to be announced (paras. 3.10-3.12).
Since ERIPwas designed to support the original bid, the miningprivatization objective
was not achieved. The subsequentbiddingwas supported by the PSREP, and, thus, i s not
germane to thejudgment o f the ERIP outcome.

        Third, with respectto IDA andBorrower performance, the PPAR cited specific
reasonsfor the ratings o f unsatisfactory andhighlyunsatisfactory which the Region's
comments didnot address. The PPARnotes that IDA andthe Borrower share
responsibilityfor the significant flaws inERIP'sdesign and execution. For example:
(a) conditionality relied excessively on easy-to-implement preparatory steps, rather than
hard-to-reverse final actions, a concern which was raised within the Regionduring
appraisal, but not acted upon(footnote 8, p. 6); (b) there were recurrent lapses inthe
GRZ'sfiscal management, which distracted attention fiom implementation ofthe non-
fiscal reforms, and limitedthe potentialbenefits o f those reforms which were
implemented; (c) the Parliament's unwillingnessto approve a new apex institution
doomed the planned restructuring o fthe Zambian DevelopmentBank,which continued to
engage insubsidized retail operations (contrary to its ERIPcommitments) and, thereby,
discouraged commercial banks fiom supplying larger volumes o fterm lending; (d) the
social protectionmeasures supported by the project were ineffectual; and (e) the
Borrower's decision to annul the results o fthe Em-sponsoredbiddingprocessprovedto
bea costly mistake, transforming what mighthave been a profitablesale underfavorable
world pricingconditions into a virtual fire-sale under unfavorable circumstances. Thus,
OED sees no reasonto alter theseratings.

                                              38


 2.      PSREP. Withrespectto the PSREP, the Regionarguesthat the privatization of
 ZCCM was actually not reversed; that K C M andthe Copperbelt regionhave benefited
 from the new investment interms o f increaseddemandfrom suppliersand economic
 activity; and that the Government has put inadequate effort to find another strategic
 partnerfor KCM.

         OED agreesthat claimingprivatizationwas "reversed" maybetoo strong aterm,
 since, as the Regionpoints out, there are ongoing efforts to find a replacement buyer. So
 this reference has been amended to readthat "theprivatizationprocesswas severely
 disrupted". However, whatever the result infinding another bidder, there canbeno doubt
 that Anglo-American's pullout has imposed significant additional costs to the Zambian
 economy, on the order o f 1percent o f GDP per mum, according to IDA'Sownreport on
 the subject.

         The PSREP, like ERIP, hadmultipleobjectives, all ofwhich were taken into
 account inratingoutcome. The PPARpresents evidence that only one o fthe two primary
 statedobjectives-implementing      a ZCCM labor reductionprogram-was       fully acheved.
 Privatizationo f ZCCM, was partiallyachieved inlight o f the Anglo-Americanpullout.
 Onesecondary objective-strengthening      thedelivery ofsocial servicesandthe safety
net-was     also not achieved, based on the evidence presentedinthe ICR, a recent PRSP,
 andanindependent panelreport onthe IMFESAF(para. 3.8 andfootnote 12, pp. 7-8).

         Lastly, two minor objectives-improving    public service by reforming pay,
employment, andmanagement controls andpromotingprivate sector activity through
export trade-were     partially achieved. On this basis, OEDbelieves that the ratingo f
moderately unsatisfactory i s welljustified.

3.       ESAC11. RegardingESAC II, Regioncontends that thePPAR'sjustification
                                         the
for rating the project outcome unsatisfactory is narrow andweak. The Regionhas
understatedthe reasonsthe PPAR offeredfor why the outcome was downgraded to
unsatisfactory. This project had muZtipZe objectives, which included(i)   supporting a
stable macroeconomic environment; (ii)    improving export competitiveness through
rationalizationofthe structure o f effectiveprotection; (iii)
                                                            accelerating implementationo f
the landmarket reforms; and (iv) improvingthe delivery o fvital social services. An
unstated fifthobjective was to achieve satisfactory progress on ZCCM privatization,
which was a secondtranche condition. The PPARpresents extensive evidence to
indicate that the measures selected to achieve three o fthese objectives-export
competitiveness, landmarketreform, and delivery o f social services-were      only
modestly relevant andpartially achieved, representing, for the most part, "paper" reforms
havinglittle or no impact on the ground. Theremainingtwo objectives-macroeconomic
stabilization andZCCM privatization-were       not achieved at all. Quoting from the
current draft o fthe PPAR (para. 3.42): "Taking into account the severe disruption
experienced with respect to the process o fZCCM privatizationandthe erratic
macroeconomic policiespursued, combinedwith the modest relevance o fthe land,

                                               39


 labor, health, trade, and education reforms implemented, and continued inadequacies
 post-closingindelivering andmonitoringbasic social services, outcome is rated
 unsatisfactory, as compared to satisfactory at the time of ICR review."

         Withrespect to the Region's specific points on social spending andcash
 budgeting, please note that Management chose to convey this objective to the Board as
 seeking to "improve the delivery of vital social services". The fact that the share of the
 discretionary budgetdevoted to social spendingincreasedduringthis period was
 insufficient, by itself, to ensureimproved service delivery, andnotjust becausethe
 contraction indiscretionary spendinginreal terms largely offset the increasing share o f
 social spending. It was also the case that public sector capacity to deliver social services
 deteriorated, a fact documented fiom a variety o f sources, includingthe 2002 PRSP and
Joint StaffAssessment (pp. 7-8). Nor should the fact that the GRZ'schaotic management
of cash expenditures-cited inthe PPAR as an additional dimension o fthe social service
deliveryproblem-was         discovered only a year after ESAC I1closed inany way imply
that this problemdidnot exist during ESAC implementation, as the Regionseems to
suggest.

         The Regionasks what IDA or the GRZ could have done insuch dire economic
circumstances to have preventedthe decline inreal social spending. IDA couldhave
beenmorepro-active inlobbying for external debt relief for Zambia duringthis period, as
the 2002 CAE pointedout. Moreover, IDA should have taken an earlier interest inseeing
that this and other projects includedstrict monitoringof cashexpenditures to see that they
complied, inletter andinspirit, with loan conditionality. As for the GRZ, it was obvious
that the Borrower succumbed to the pressureso fvarious interest groups who opposed
ZCCM privatization, and didnot adopt a good faith attitude toward complying with its
fiscal obligations. For example, paragraph 3.30 o f the PPAR describes the large civil
service salary boost grantedjust one month after the mid-tennESAC I1review.
Obviously, this kindo f decision crowds out expenditures for key social programs.

4.      Lessons. OED hasre-characterized the lesson on the role o f external debt in
IDA's decisions surrounding these operations as follows:

          "When pressures to maintaina Client current on the service o f its external debt
          have a major impact on lendingdecisions, it is incumbent uponManagement to
          discuss these pressures, and any impact they hadon the timing, content, and size
         o f aproposed operation, withthe Board at the time o f loanpresentation."

        This point was also highlightedinthe November2002 OED CAE on Zambia,
which concluded that the emphasis on exceptional levels o f adjustment lendingto finance
an unsustainable debt overhang was a significant weakness inIDA'sadjustment lending
programto that country.
