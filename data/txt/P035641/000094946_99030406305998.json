in its labor reduction program; b)\n            improve the performance of the public service by reforming\n            pay and employment practices and improving management\n            controls; c) promote private investment by improving access\n            to imported inputs and streamlining investment approvals;\n            and d) strengthen the delivery of social services by\n            monitoring budget allocations to key social expenditure\n            categories and supporting key policy reforms. The credit\n            will bring about faster economic growth, employment\n            creation, and poverty reduction. There are two possible\n            risks: 1) It is possible that the Government's reform\n            could falter due to policy reversal, the impact of major\n            external shocks, or a continuing shortfall in external donor\n            support. The Government's steadfast commitment,\n            privatization of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, and\n            efforts to expand non-mining exports will help withstand the\n            risk. 2) The second risk, related to the reforms supported\n            by the credit, is mitigated Government's continuing\n            consultation with all major stakeholders."}, "docdt": "1998-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
