                         Most of the activities under IMO will be completed by December 31st, 2012. The navigation equipment under DGST has been procured and the newly granted project closing date
                         extension of the Indonesian grant till May 15, 2013 should allow time to install the equipment. The tri-State dialogue on marine environmental and safety issues, a critical outcome of
                         the project, has evolved further and is now established and a regional sustainability arrangement beyond the Project closing date was agreed during the Tripartite Technical Experts
                         Group and Co-operative Mechanism meeting held in Singapore in September 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has made good implementation progress. The sea trials have been successfully conducted. In addition to the present link to the MEH Data Centre IT System in Batam,
                         the three littoral States agreed to establish a separate network of real-time direct link among the littoral States as a back-up. At the 37th TTEG Meeting and at the Sixth PSC Meeting
                         both Singapore and Malaysia reported that their back-up stations will be ready by January 2013 for Singapore and May 2013 for Malaysia (Malaysia has already secured the funding).

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
