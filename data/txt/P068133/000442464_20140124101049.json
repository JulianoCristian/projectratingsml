Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            need to comply with global environment facility (GEF)\n            requirements may lengthen the project preparation time. The\n            project adequately identified the risks that emerged during\n            project implementation, but failed to provide adequate\n            mitigation measures. A simpler project scope focusing only\n            on the hydrographic survey, the development of models, and\n            the preparation of electronic navigation charts (ENCs) may\n            have permitted to finalize these activities before the sea\n            trial.
