F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The objectives of the project are:
  (a) to assist the Republic of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Singapore, and
representative of some of the large commercial ship owners that use the Strait of Malacca
and the Strait of Singapore, to collectively decide whether to establish a marine electronic
highway for the entire length of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, and
  (b) to improve maritime safety and reduce the risk of environmental damage to the
globally-significant shared natural resources of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Straits of Malacca and Singapore, situated between Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula,
are approximately 1,000 kilometers long, 300 kilometers wide at their north-west entrance, and
just 12 kilometers wide at their south-east entrance, between Singapore and Indonesia’s Riau
Archipelago. The Straits are shallow, with narrow channels, irregular tides and shifting bottom
topography, and hence are hazardous to navigation for large ships. Despite their difficult
navigational features, the Straits are the shortest and hence the preferred shipping route between
the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, and for oil tankers trading between the Persian Gulf
and the fast-growing countries of East Asia. Every year roughly 80,000 ships transit the strait
every year, more than 60 percent of which are tankers or container ships.

2.       In 1998, the three littoral states of Republic of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Republic of
Singapore jointly commissioned a mandatory Straits Ships Reporting System (STRAITREP) for
the most congested 300 kilometer section of the Straits from One Fathom Bank to the Singapore
Strait, which combines radar and automatic ship identification and tracking. The maritime safety
infrastructure and regulatory mechanisms in place at the time of appraisal in the Straits of
Malacca and Singapore reduced the frequency of ship collisions, groundings and oil spills.
However the threats of collisions, groundings and consequent environmental damage were still
significant and, with rapid traffic growth, was increasing.

3.      An innovative approach to improving the management of maritime traffic and marine
environment protection in the Straits was expected to ameliorate these impacts and enhance the
carrying capacity of the Straits for various uses and activities.

4.       The best-proven of the new marine navigation technologies that could reduce this threat
was the Marine Electronic Highway (MEH). It combines an Electronic Chart Display and
Information System (ECDIS) using updated Electronic Navigation Charts (ENCs), an Automated
Identification System (AIS), shore-based marine information databases and advanced ship-to-
shore communications. Data to mariners is provided through an MIS (Maritime Information
System). By providing mariners with accurate, real-time navigational information, the new
technologies was expected to reduce shipping costs by permitting safe navigation in poor weather,
optimize loading to take account of better information on minimum depths, and reduce fuel
consumption by giving more accurate and timely information so that more advantage can be
taken of favorable tides and currents.

5.      The implementation of the MEH involved the three littoral states of Indonesia, Malaysia,
and the Republic of Singapore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the shipping
industry. Only Indonesia and the IMO were grant recipients. Indonesia was the recipient of a
US$1.44 million grant to procure navigation equipment and install it on the Indonesian territory.
The IMO was the recipient of a US$6.86 million grant for the hydrological survey and the other
components of the MEH as well as for project management.

Rationale for Bank assistance

6.     The Bank had a unique combination of convening power and technical skills that were
expected to help the littoral states to overcome the barriers that have prevented implementation of


                                                1
the system. The Bank could facilitate collaboration between the International Maritime
Organization (IMO), the international institution responsible for promoting environmentally-
sound marine navigation, the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), responsible for
marine mapping, major international ship-owner representative organizations, and the
government of the three littoral states. Financially, the Bank could help access the resources of
the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which in its International Waters Focal Area, could help
to provide grants or concessional funding to help countries address major environmental threats
to shared water bodies, such as the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Global Environment Objective

7.     The statement of objectives presented the ICR Data Sheet is taken from the GEF grant
agreements:

    The objectives of the project are:
    (a) to assist the Republic of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Singapore, and
    representative of some of the large commercial ship owners that use the Strait of
    Malacca and the Strait of Singapore, to collectively decide whether to establish a
    marine electronic highway for the entire length of the Straits of Malacca and
    Singapore, and
    (b) to improve maritime safety and reduce the risk of environmental damage to the
    globally-significant shared natural resources of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.

8.       The same objectives are stated in the PAD, except that the first objective (decision to
establish a scaled-up MEH) was called the “PDO” and the second objective (improved safety and
reduced risk of environmental damage) was called as the “GEO.” However, as a stand-alone GEF
project, technically the project should only have a GEO, and indeed the GEF grant agreements
combine both objectives in a single statement that by definition serves as the GEO.

9.       However, in assessing outcomes it is cr itical to note that the “GEO” in the PAD, while
inextricably linked to the project rationale, justification of GEF financing, and longer-term
impacts of the MEH, was not expected to be direct achieved or demonstrated by the project itself.
This is reflected unambiguously in the PAD, which states (emphasis added) that:

    “The Project’s global environment objective is to improve maritime safety and reduce
    environmental damage to the globally-significant shared natural resources of the Straits of
    Malacca and Singapore. It will not be possible to determine with certainty if it has achieved
    this objective in its short life. An evaluation of the Marine Electronic Highway demonstration
    system’s technical performance and the project stakeholders’ decision whether to maintain
    and/or expand it will indicate if this objective is s likely to be achieved in the longer term.”

10.      Therefore this element of the project objectives is linked to and advanced by achievement
of the shorter term objective of demonstrating and facilitating a decision to scale up the MEH, but
is not directly monitorable or attributable to the project. The activities and results framework are
consistent with this distinction, as there is no attempt to measure actual environmental impacts or
their mitigation, or even actual maritime safety.


                                                 2
Key Indicators

11.       The two key outcome indicators in the PAD Results Framework are
         The littoral states and commercial shipping users of the Straits jointly decide whether or
          not to develop a Marine Electronic Highway (MEH) for the entire Straits and an
          Environment Fund, based on evaluation of this MEH Demonstration Project and a
          cost/benefit and financial/legal feasibility analysis o f a potential full-scale MEH system
          for the entire Straits.
         If their decision is positive, a full-scale MEH for the entire Straits of Malacca and
          Singapore and an Environment Fund are designed and a financing and institutional plan
          prepared.

12.     The GEF grant agreement with IMO did not include these two outcome indicators, or
indeed any outcome indicators distinct from the intermediate results and output indicators. It did
include an end-of-project indicator (considered an intermediate indicator in the PAD) that
essentially captures these two outcomes, but that only specifies preparation of a “proposal” for
the design, financing, and institutional arrangements of the scale-up at project completion rather
than an actual design.

13.      The DGST grant agreement included only a s ingle performance indicator: “Indonesian
navigational data gathering system in Straits upgraded and data provided to MEH PMO,” which
is linked to Component 2 and considered and intermediate indicator in the PAD.

14.     Since (a) the two outcome indicators are not included in the grant agreements, (b) there is
some ambiguity about exactly what decision or design is expected, and (c) the MEH decision
cannot be isolated from delivery of the demonstration, in assessing achievement of objectives (see
Sections 3.2 and 3.4) it is reasonable to also consider the operation’s full design features and
planned outputs rather than only the narrow question of whether a decision for future
development of the MEH was taken.

1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

15.       The GEO, and key indicators were not revised.

1.3 Main Beneficiaries

16.      From a global environment perspective the primary intended benefits are protection and
conservation of sensitive, globally significant natural and environmental resources shared by the
countries bordering the Straits. A secondary benefit is reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
resulting from more efficient cargo shipping operations.

17.      However, the main direct benefits of the MEH actually accrue to the ship owners and
other stakeholders(as summarized below and in Annex 3) in the form of reduced expenses due to
more reliable and efficient shipping as well as fewer clean-ups of spills and contamination caused
by groundings, collisions, and other discharges. GEF financing of the MEH demonstration was
justified because these direct benefits did not provide sufficient incentive in themselves for
creation of the MEH, particularly a system with the added environmental design features
promoted by the project.



                                                  3
18.      The three littoral states would benefit from the MEH through the reduced cost of clean-up
of sea pollutants and a reduction in the loss in value of the marine and coastal resources of the
Straits. In turn, the coastal inhabitants in the surrounding area were to benefit from the improved
coastal environment and natural resources, which was expected to also enhance their quality of
life.

19.       The ship operators including their crews and customers would benefit through savings in
operational and maintenance costs due to the reduced under-keel clearance requirement of the
Straits as the result of more accurate hydrographic and navigation information. This was expected
to enable them to load more on their ships. Better navigational information would also reduce
transit times, particularly when low visibility or other constraints would otherwise limit speeds or
even require delaying transit. Other benefit for the operators and the customers were reduction of
accident and fatalities, and would also reduce the risk to pay the damages caused by oil spills to
the marine and coastal environments.

1.5 Original Components

20.       The project had five components:
          1.   MEH System Design, Coordination and Operation
          2.   MEH System Development
          3.   Ship-board Equipment and Communications
          4.   Marine Environment Protection
          5.   Information Dissemination, Evaluation and Scale-up Plan

21.      Component 1: MEH System Design, Coordination and Operation (US$2.88 million). This
component was meant for project management by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
on behalf of the participating states, coordination of the design, development and operation of the
MEH demonstration system and also provided for key technical inputs to the project. The major
tasks to be undertaken within this component are:

      (a) System Planning and International Maritime Organization Management, focusing on
          operational aspects of project implementation itself.
      (b) Strengthening of the Project Management Office in Batam and establishment of the MEH
          Data Centers and training for their staff.
      (c) Support to the Project Steering Committee and its technical committees and working
          groups.

22.     Component 2: MEH System Development (US$7.04 million).This component provided
for the production of the navigational information on which the MEH system is based, and its
incorporation into real-time electronic charts that ship operators will be able to use to navigate
with precision through the MEH demonstration section of the Straits. The specific
subcomponents and outputs are:

      (a) Tide and Current Facilities. Tidal and current monitoring on the Indonesian coast of the
          Strait of Malacca, including provision of relevant equipment.
      (b) Hydrographic Survey. Carry out a hydrographic survey of the TSS area and provide
          training to surveyors in the hydrographic offices of the littoral states.
      (c) Electronic Navigation Charts. Produce high-resolution ENCs for the project area,
          including provision of relevant computer software licenses.


                                                  4
      (d) Information Exchange System. Establish the MEH information exchange system,
          including data servers, data exchange protocols and training of staff.

23.      Component 3: Ship-board Equipment and Communications (US$6.00 million).This
component was expected to be implemented in cooperation with the owners of large oil tankers
and container ships that regularly transit the Straits, and facilitated by two major ship owner
representative organizations, the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners
(Intertanko) and The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS). By the end of year three, at least
160 ships would be fitted with internationally-approved Electronic Chart Display and Information
Systems (ECDIS) and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) and have internet connectivity so
that they can demonstrate the MEH system and provide detailed feedback on its performance as
an input for assessment of the costs, benefits and legal/financial feasibility of expanding the MEH

24.    Component 4: Marine Environment Protection (US$0.85 million). This component was
executed jointly by institutions in the littoral states that are responsible for marine navigation and
environmental management and the IMO. It included:

      (a) Oil Spill and Sand Wave Models. Modeling and analyses of the likely movement of oil
          spills and of sand wave formation and movement.
      (b) Sensitive Area Mapping. Research and development of options for providing real-time,
          geo-referenced environmental protection information to mariners navigating in the Straits
          of Malacca and Singapore and for conservation and coastal resources management and
          mapping of sensitive areas.
      (c) Emergency Response Systems. Carry out simulated oil and chemical spill emergency
          response exercises to determine the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the MEH system
          in the event of chemical and oil spill incidents from ships.

25.     Component 5: Information Dissemination, Evaluation and Scale-up Plan (US$0.23
million). This component was managed by the IMO through the Project Management Office
(PMO). It included:

      (a) Website and publicity for the MEH to both disseminate information about the system and
          its benefits and to seek feedback.
      (b) Evaluation and assessment of the costs and benefits, technical functionality, performance,
          institutional and legal aspects of the MEH, and consolidation of findings for decision and
          management purposes.
      (c) System development and marketing strategies to package the MEH system and its
          products and services.

1.6 Revised Components

26.       The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

27.    The project closing date was extended three times. The first extension to June 30, 2012,
was necessary due to the delays in hydrographic survey and procurement of goods.

28.    The second extension to December 31, 2012, was necessary to allow more time to import
to Indonesia and install the delayed maritime safety equipment, including testing and


                                                  5
commissioning, ensuring the equipment performed functionally prior to hand-over, and training
of the DGST staff in operating and managing the MEH Data Center.

29.     The third extension to May 15, 2013, was necessary in order to extend the validity date of
the Letter of Credit, complete installation and training of the navigation equipment, and to allow
Indonesia to include MEH project in the 2013 budget. Bank of Indonesia and the World Bank
will not authorize payment to contractor for completed works if the Letter of Credit is expired.
Consequently the contractor will not be able to complete the remaining tasks if no payment was
made.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

30.      Formal cooperation and coordination between the three littoral states and other
stakeholders already existed before the project started and developed during project
implementation. The cooperation and coordination were facilitated by the Tripartite Technical
Experts Group the (TTEG) set up in 1977.The TTEG is a group of experts from the maritime
administration of the three littoral states. The TTEG meets annually to discuss and collaborate on
issues to enhance navigational safety and protection of the marine environment, as well as other
traffic management measures in the Straits.

31.      For example, the TTEG was the instrument through which the littoral states developed,
achieved consensus, and implemented the STRAITREP system in 1998 that created the Traffic
Separation Scheme and require designated vessels transiting the Straits to report to authorities on
their identity, cargo, and navigation capacity, and to use ship-to-shore communications for traffic
control in the Straits.

32.     The main risks were identified adequately but their mitigation measures were
inadequate. In particular in term of political risks, there was an awareness that the project
requiring cooperation among states that have not been consistent in maintaining such relations.
Furthermore IMO also realized that they only have few powers of enforcement of conventions
and agreements on using international waters. Despite this, the proposed mitigation measures
only relied on the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Memorandum of
Arrangements (MOA) for this project. The MOU and MOA were important documents where
commitments of the littoral states as well as all other participating organizations listed and agreed,
but mitigation measures to anticipate unfulfilled commitments and/or change of commitments,
and also delays in delivering the commitments were not prepared.

33.      The performance of managerial, technical, and financial aspects of the project could be
associated with inadequate mitigation measures of political risks. For instance mitigation
measures on lack of commitment of INTERTANKO and ICS in supplying 160 adequately
equipped vessels were not prepared. Participation of the vessels in the sea trial was an important
part in producing a good evaluation report of MEH Demonstration Project. Another example was
unfulfilled commitment of Indonesia to assign IT specialist during project implementation. It
largely influenced managerial and technical aspect of the project in term of day to day operation
of the center. The other managerial risks not anticipated were lack of capacity and/or experience
of the implementing agencies with the Bank project that delays procurement and disbursement,


                                                 6
and delays in importing navigation equipment in Indonesia as it went to several procedures,
especially custom clearance.

34.       The design of the project was complex, and it was ambitious to have the three
littoral states collaboratively deciding to establish an income generating regional institution.
Even though the project was prepared carefully, taking into account the lessons learned and
formal procedures from previously implemented project, some of the components were too
ambitious to be implemented. In particular, in term of preparing design and plan to establish a
formal institution collaboratively managed by the three littoral states. In addition, this institution
supposed to generate income from users to maintain and operate the system as well as become
main source of Environment Fund. Such institution to some extents would be a politically
sensitive issue. It would involve legal discussion on the boundary of country, sharing detail data
of seabed to other countries, share of power of each country in the institution, and distribution of
income generated. Creating such institution also need a similar level of capacity of the three
littoral states, especially in technical, financial, and human resources. Therefore a full design and
plan of such institution would need a very long process. In fact, the three littoral states only
manage to have two forums to facilitate discussion and collaboration in managing the Straits,
namely TTEG (established in 1977) and the Cooperative Mechanism (created in 2007).

2.2 Implementation

35.       Cooperative Mechanism of the TTEG. In 2007, shortly after project approval, the
littoral states established the Cooperative Mechanism on Safety of the Navigation and
Environmental Protection in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. The Cooperative Mechanism
enhanced the TTEG by creating a formal mechanism to facilitate dialogue and collaboration
between the three littoral states and the international maritime community on issues of common
interest in the Straits. This Mechanism also coordinates the implementation of projects in the
Straits and receives direct financial contributions from the international maritime community to
maintain marine navigational aids in the Straits (Aids to Navigation Fund). The TTEG and the
cooperative mechanism played a significant role during project implementation, especially in
facilitating decisions on some key issues (e.g. accepting/rejecting financial and/or technical
support from user states and other stakeholders).

36.     Leveraging of co-financing. The project leveraged a USD850,000 grant from the
Republic of Korea for the establishment of the Batam MEH Data Center, which covered the
hardware and software of the IT equipment, including capacity-building (training and workshops)
on the management and operation of the MEH Data Center. The system was installed and running
by December 2011 including the training of Project staff and officers from the three littoral States.
The co-financing was necessary since there was no provision for an operating system that could
integrate data streaming from the Indonesian facilities similar to an emulated ECDIS. The co-
financing earmarked for Indonesia was utilized solely for the development of the MEH system.

37.     Slow project implementation. The project progressed slowly prior to the mid-term
review on both implementing agencies, namely IMO and DGST. It was because of the resignation
of the MEH Project Manager after only 10 months of service, delay of hydrographic survey, lack
of capacity and/or experience of the implementing agencies with the World Bank procedures, and
long process in issuing permit and clearance in Indonesia.

38.    The resignation of MEH Project Manager. The resignation in October 2008 of the
MEH Project Manager after only 10 months of service delayed some activities planned. IMO had
to mobilize their MEH Project Coordinator as an interim Project Manager to handle the project

                                                  7
day-to-day operation remotely from London and from Jakarta from February to July 2010. This
arrangement was also not too effective since the interim project manager was also IMO MEH
Project Coordinator. A new Project Manager together with an Administrative Assistant was
appointed in November 2010 and both were based in Batam until the end of the project. Since the
recruitment of the new project manager, the progress of the project was then improved.

39.      Delay of hydrographic survey. Since 2007, the project had initiated the hydrographic
survey but the hydrographic survey preparation activity took nearly two years before the contract
was awarded in May 2009 and another nine months before field operation commenced in April
2010.The delay in procurement was attributed to the cost estimate being far too low, and as a
result all bids came in well above the budget for the activity. The PAD explicitly recognized that
as a demonstration project, the cost estimate for some activities would be more uncertain than
usual, particularly the hydrographic survey. This was indeed the case. The project explored the
possibility that the hydrographic departments of Indonesia and Malaysia could carry out the
survey themselves, but since this was not possible, the solution adopted was to contract a
commercial survey of as much of the TSS as the budget would allow, focusing on the section
with the most critical navigation challenges and risks.

40.     The delay of the hydrographic survey was also due to a long process of getting permit
and clearances to undertake the survey from Indonesia. The issuance of the permit and clearances
in Indonesia required tedious coordination between at least six government agencies, namely
MOE (as the national focal point), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dishidros (the Indonesian Navy
Hydro-Oceanographic Service), Directorate General of Immigration, Directorate General of
Customs, and Ministry of Defense. The clearances were finally obtained after the survey
commenced in the Malaysian waters.

41.      Repercussions of the delay in the hydrographic survey on other activities . The delay
in hydrographic survey affected the sand wave study. The high resolution Electronic Navigation
Charts (ENCs) resulting from the hydrographic survey were supposed to be used as the basis for
the sand wave study. The bidding documents were prepared for this activity. However the
remaining time until project closing did not allow for the sand wave study to be implemented,
taking into account the bidding process and duration of the study.

42.     Lack of capacity and/or experience of the implementing agencies with the World
Bank procedures and commitment. On Indonesian side, it really delayed project
implementation since procurement and disbursement could not be done timely. There was issue
with the DGST readiness to conduct the procurement prior to the mid-term review. Even though
the Bank already issued NOL to the bidding documents on February 2008, changes in DGST
personnel took place and there was no staff assigned to follow up with the procurement process.
When the Bank re-emphasized the importance of DGST commitment, only then DGST assumed
stronger ownership and involved more actively in the project. The procurement activity was
resumed in late-2009 although the actual procurement took place in mid-2010 after the activity
was included in the DGST budget.

43.     The lack of capacity and commitment also delayed the installation of some of navigation
equipment. The navigation equipment could not enter Batam from Singapore due to lack of
capacity of DGST in processing customs clearance and Letter of Credit from Bank of Indonesia.
It took quite long time to get the clearance and reissue Letter of Credit. As the result, some
equipment had exceeded the storage time and had to be sent back to the manufacturer for
recalibration to prevent inappropriate equipment performance.


                                                8
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

44.      M & E Design. Since the objective of improved maritime safety and reduced
environmental damage was not intended to be directly measured or achieved by the project, the
results framework did not include indicators related to collisions, groundings, and transit times
for shipping, or to actual damage to environmental resources in the straits. Instead, the RF
focused on the MEH system itself, outputs related to the MEH capabilities and its demonstration,
evaluation of the system and scale-up options, and the resulting decision of the littoral states and
ship owners. The demonstration would not directly improve safety and reduce impacts, but the
scale up of the system which would be expected to result in such benefits in the future.

45.     The design correctly tracked the progress of the inputs and activities as well as the
outputs and analysis needed for a robust demonstration of the MEH. The M&E arrangements for
tracking activities and outputs was very clear in terms of defining their contribution toward
achieving the objectives, and very practical in terms of monitoring progress. The outcome
indicators related to the decision and design of a scaled-up were dependent on the results of the
demonstration and findings of the feasibility and options study, but were not clear as to what an
actual design and plan were expected to comprise, or whether the intent was to produce a
proposal as reflected in the grant agreement, or finished plan as suggested in the PAD results
framework. The project itself did not include a subcomponent to finance and support preparation
of an actual design, financing plan, and institutional arrangements for a full scale MEH,
suggesting that this was to be left to the stakeholders themselves (and which they have indeed
taken on without Bank or GEF assistance).

46.      M&E Implementation. Activities and data were collected and monitored during
supervisions, PSC and TTEG meetings, and communications with PMO and the three littoral
states. M&E arrangements were carried out as designed and provided useful and timely
information on progress and/or hurdles in carrying out the activities and producing the outputs
needed to achieve the project’s objectives. Some sites where navigation equipment was installed
could not be visited easily for direct inspection because of their remoteness, but the installation
and function of the equipment itself was confirmed, and the data feed functioned properly. Some
data on indicators were not updated regularly after supervision missions, but this did not in itself
affect or limit capacity to effectively manage the project. While indicators measuring percentage
progress toward a particular output did not always give a clear picture of the progress in the
activity, information was available that detail edits specific status.

47.      M&E Utilization. While the M&E did a good job of tracking the technical aspects of
setting up the MEH demonstration, some intangible dimensions of the process where not reflected
as clearly, such as dialogue between the three littoral states and other stakeholders about issues
related to the ultimate scale-up decision. Monitoring of specific aspects of the Project
Implementation Plan helped identify where tasks were falling behind schedule or institutional
performance was weak, so that greater attention and support could be targeted to those issue
(though not always with convincing results). Close tracking of progress and problems in
contracting the hydrological survey resulted in exploration or alternative means or carrying out
the survey (through government agencies), and finally to the decision to narrow the target area to
cover the most critical parts of the TSS.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

48.     Safeguard. The Project was classified as an environmental category “C” project since no
direct or indirect adverse impacts to the environment were associated with it. Although the

                                                 9
Project triggered OP/BP/GP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways, the requirement of
notification of other riparian did not arise, due to the three littoral states of the Straits of Malacca,
namely Republic of Indonesia, Malaysia and Republic of Singapore, were participants as well as
beneficiaries of the projects and the three states have signed an MOU regarding their participation.
There were no safeguards compliance problems or shortcomings.

49.      Financial Management. The two implementing agencies made significant efforts to
maintain adequate financial management (FM) arrangements. Although the IMO and the
Directorate General of Sea Transportation (DGST) needed time to adopt the Bank’s FM standards,
appropriate actions were taken to address the FM findings and issues during implementation.
There were no major FM issues. The two implementing agencies assigned project officers for
carrying out the FM functions at all times. The interim financial reports submitted to and
reviewed by the Bank during implementation were in a format acceptable to the Bank with only
minor issues identified. In close coordination with the Bank, the MoF, the IMO, the Bank of
Indonesia, and the DGST addressed all these FM issues. The Bank received the FY 2012 audit
report for the IMO in which the auditors provided an unqualified opinion. The Bank also received
the FY 2013 audit report for DGST in which the auditors provided an unqualified opinion.
Therefore, throughout project implementation the ISRs rated financial management as
Moderately Satisfactory.

50.     Procurement. There were some procurement issues related to quality, procedural
compliance, or processes encountered during implementation. Those procurement issues were
caused by lack of capacity and experience of the staff of the implementing agencies with Bank
procedures and also to a lesser extend to shortcomings in the commitment of the implementing
agencies to speed up the process. Changes in procurement arrangements also had to be done to
accommodate the dynamic of actual conditions in the field. Despite close coordination between
the Bank and the implementing agencies, those issues led to significant delays in procurement.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.      Some activities were not completed, but the system was functional. Although some
activities were not completed, the project achieved significant success in enhancing stakeholder
coordination and cooperation and in improving navigation equipment and system in the straits of
Malacca and Singapore. The enhancement of coordination and cooperation was not only between
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and users of the straits, but also between institutions within the
littoral states, especially Indonesia. For Indonesia, this project had been a platform for
coordination and cooperation in maritime safety and environment issues between Ministry of
Transportation, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Indonesian Hydro
Oceanographic Offices. Hydrographic survey of the One Fathom Bank Traffic Separation
Scheme Area in Malacca Strait was conducted, bathymetric charts were produced, and very good
ENCs had been prepared, though they could not actually be used in the MEH demonstration
because of their limited scope and lack of type-approval. Indonesian navigational data gathering
system in Straits was upgraded with the installation of the tidal stations and the AIS units to
provide data to MEH PMO in Batam. This has enhanced the safety of navigation in the pilot areas
and to some extent in the straits of Malacca and Singapore. The project provided very valuable
support to all participating countries in improving capacity of institutions and personnel
responsible in maritime safety and environment through substantial training and equipment.
Furthermore, the project has contributed to include information on environmentally sensitive
areas to existing ENCs of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.



                                                  10
52.       As the result of better coordination and cooperation and improvement of navigation
equipment, the MEH Demonstration Project was able to develop and establish a pilot MEH
System for the 300 km congested part of SOMS. The main facility of MEH system in Batam
(Indonesia) is managed and operated by Indonesia. Malaysia and Singapore had developed
similar systems to back-up MEH system in Batam, which are accessible via the Internet. The
littoral states are in a process to technically and legally improve the system to be able to use it for
maritime traffic management in the whole SOMS. Apart from improving the utility of the MEH
System, the three littoral States commits to have regular meetings to review the progress being
made and to address problems that may arise.

53.     MEH becomes part of Cooperative Mechanism (CM) and TTEG. The littoral states
agreed to put MEH pilot project under the Cooperative Mechanism and TTEG, then MEH is not a
stand-alone project, but become an integral part of projects under Cooperative Mechanism. There
are some projects related to MEH managed by CM. Therefore, M&E of long term GEO could be
done by the Cooperative Mechanism.

54.    Indonesia allocated in its own budget of USD70.000 in 2014 to continue to operate
and maintain MEH Data Center in Batam, and of USD700.000 to install the two remaining
navigation equipment. In the 2013 Bali meeting, Indonesia committed to finance the operation
and maintenance of MEH Data Center and procurement of two remaining navigation equipment
namely DGPS and Ocean Data Buoy in 2014.

55.     DGST recruits IT specialists and some of them will be posted in MEH Data Center
in Batam. In September 2013, Ministry of Transport of Indonesia recruited new officers from
different education backgrounds. DGST in particular recruited some IT specialist and some of
them will be posted in Batam MEH Data Center to handle day to day operation of the MEH pilot
system.

56.     Malaysia will lead multibeam hydrographic survey in critical areas of the Straits.
The main investment needed for expanding the MEH would be for a hydrographic survey of the
area not covered during the Demonstration Phase. The hydrographic surveys that will be taken
are an important step of the expansion.

57.      All three data centers will be synchronized. Malaysia and Singapore technical
personnel will visit the MEH Batam Data Centre to find solutions for the
synchronization/replication of user data base and data streaming matters. When the data centers
are synchronized, users do not necessarily need to register at all 3 littoral States in order to access
the information provided under the MEH.

58.     Serial switch over for the backup of Batam MEH Data Center was agreed . Serial
switch over between Malaysia and Singapore for the backup of Batam MEH Data Center will be
done on 6 monthly bases. From 1st January to 30 June, Malaysia will be the backup for MEH
Batam Data Centre. While 1 July to 31 December Singapore will be the backup.

59.     Ship owners pointed out that they will use the MEH system if it is completely
functional and approved by the littoral states. The non-participation of the project’s shipping
partners in the sea trial was attributed to the lack of confidence on the utility/reliability of the
MEH and its collected data in general. Furthermore, the participants of the sea trial stated that
beyond merely tidal, currents, oceanographic and meteorological data, they would like to see real-
time, dynamic data that will help ships avoid navigational hazards, enhance emergency responses
and improve navigation. In addition to real time features, information/data generated from the

                                                  11
MEH must be accurate and precise, which would be useful to land-based participants, particularly
those involved in the administration and management of coastal areas and resources. In order to
incentivize ship owners to actively utilize the MEH system, it must meet the expectations of ship
owners and other stakeholders. The littoral states then must technically and legally approve it,
before using it for maritime traffic management in the SOMS.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

60.       The GEO and the design and the implementation of this project are highly relevant for
the three literal states and other stakeholders using the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. The
GEO is in line with the long-term development plan (2005-2025) of the Government of
Indonesia’s Ministry of Transport (MOT). The MOT is in charge of ensuring the safe and orderly
flow of vessel traffic, monitoring maritime safety, optimizing search and rescue operations in
case of sea accidents, and improving the readiness of marine and coastal infrastructure and
facilities, especially in the surrounding of the Strait of Malacca.

61.     In line with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), one of the Bank’s core
objectives is the Pro-Green development, including emphasize on the sustainability and
protection of coral and marine resources. As the Straits of Malacca and Singapore is a zone of
high marine biological diversity, the MEH demonstration project is highly relevant. The MEH
integrate natural and marine resources data with navigational information. It increases the users’
environmental awareness and helps in their navigating decision to protect the Straits natural
resources.

62.     The MEH Demonstration Projects is consistent with one of the major objectives of the
GEF’s International Waters Operational Program 10, as it overcomes the barriers to the adoption
of the best-practice technology in marine navigation and pollution control in the Straits, and
thereby reduces the risk of contamination of an international water body. As the project is a
partnership between governments, the GEF, and the private sector, it is also consistent with one
of the GEF’s key strategic objectives, to promote public-private partnerships that benefit the
global environment.

63.      Although the objectives were highly relevant in the light of the objectives of all the
project’s stakeholders, the design and implementation of the project were not fully adequate to
achieve all indicators and the project’s objectives. Some important components of the project , e.g.
hydrographic survey, simulated marine environment emergency response exercises, were not well
designed and implemented.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

64.       The GEO defined two main objectives:
      (a) to assist the Republic of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Singapore, and
      representative of some of the large commercial ship owners that use the Strait of Malacca and
      the Strait of Singapore, to collectively decide whether to establish a marine electronic
      highway for the entire length of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, and
      (b) to improve maritime safety and reduce the risk of environmental damage to the globally-
      significant shared natural resources of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.

                                                 12
65.      As discussed in Section 1.2, the PAD distinguished between a “PDO” (facilitating a
decision regarding scale-up of the MEH) and a “GEO” (improved maritime safety and reduced
environmental damage). But as a stand-alone GEF project, both objectives should be considered
part of the GEO. Furthermore, while the second objective is inextricably linked to achievement of
the first, it is explicitly defined in the PAD as a longer-term impact that is not directly
monitorable or attributable to the project itself (within the scope or duration of the project).
Therefore the assessment of achievement of objectives focuses mainly on the successful
demonstration of the MEH system as way of arriving at a decision to scale-up, while maritime
safety and environmental protection are largely assessed as a function of the future prospects for
successful implementation of the system.

Objective 1– Assisting in decision to establish a marine electronic highway for the entire
length of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore

66.      While a decision was made based on the demonstration project (and its evaluation of
MEH scale-up costs, benefits, and feasibility), the demonstration itself was not of the scope, scale,
or duration originally planned, and a decision was not taken on whether to establish an
Environmental Fund, as specified in the outcome indicator. Perhaps most importantly, the sea
trial did not include participation by the large oil tankers and container ships that had committed
to participate at the outset of the project, and whose adoption of the MEH is critical to its success
and perhaps to its financing.

67.      A very positive outcome is that the TTEG has now adopted development of the MEH as a
key undertaking, and there is agreement on overall design, strategy, and perhaps most importantly
institutional arrangements. But the financing plan is, if anything, less clear due to the lack of
commitment by private ship owners.

68.      If assessed solely on the question of whether the essential technological elements of the
MEH were in place and the project helped facilitate a decision, the outcome could be considered
to have been largely achieved. But if the assessment encompasses the delivery of planned outputs,
and a system demonstration of the thoroughness, scale, and elements envisioned in the approved
design, then the project fell well short of expectations.

69.     Results Chain / Design. The project design envisioned a results chain in which
investments in specific equipment, facilities, software, and training would create the
technological infrastructure to gather, transmit, aggregate, exchange, and share information with
ship and shore-based users to improve navigation, maritime safety, and ultimately reduce
environment impacts from accidents and other discharges from ships. In addition, hydrographic
surveys would provide the data needed to create detailed and updated ENCs, which would be
adopted by ships using ECDIS systems on their bridge to integrate information from the ENCs
with data collected from buoys, automatic identification systems, tidal monitoring equipment,
GPS systems, oil spill and sand wave models, environmental marine information overlays, and
shore-to-ship transmissions from the MEH Data Centers.

70.     All of these elements would constitute a fully functioning MEH demonstration system,
which would undergo sea trials by at least 160 large tankers and container ships over a period of
about a year, to test how the system worked and provide detailed feedback on its performance.
The indicator related to the sea trial required not only that that ships be equipped to use the
system, but would also “choose” to use the ENCs and “all other components” of the
demonstration system to navigate the Straits. The ships would also finance the cost of required
shipboard equipment and systems required (about $50,000 per ship) and pay the cost of internet

                                                13
access. Participation by ship owners was considered central to the demonstration. In addition,
both the longer term safety and environmental outcomes, as well as the most likely financing
model for the full-scale system, required that a high percentage of all ships transiting the Straits
use the MEH.

71.     Based on the sea trial, the project would conduct a cost-benefit analysis and feasibility
study of different scale-up options, which in turn would provide the littoral states and commercial
shipping users the information needed to collectively make a decision on the scale-up, and
prepare a design and financing plan for the MEH as well as the Environment Fund.

72.      Actual Demonstration. The actual demonstration did not include all of the inputs and
elements originally planned. The hydrographic survey covered only 14 percent of the original
area, and though it was used to produce ENCs, they were not used as part of the sea trial. One of
the four data centers was not established, some of the ocean data buoys and the DGPS were not
installed, the sand wave model was not completed, and environmental information overlays were
produced by another source rather than the project (and were not used in the demonstration).
Rather than a long-term trial involving 160 large ships that regularly transit the Straits, the sea
trial was conducted for six weeks and included only 18 smaller ships that engage in cross-straits
traffic.

73.      The loss of interest by ship owners who originally had indicated commitment to
participating in the demonstration was mainly due to the cost of participation and the perception
that the information and capabilities offered by the demonstration system did not serve their
needs or substantially improve their ship-board information and navigational capacity. In
particular, the ships were interested in having dynamic information on water depths to determine
under-keel clearance in real time, which the current system could not provide. The extent to
which lack of interest was due to inadequate promotion of the system’s benefits was not
evaluated, and more proactive promotion of the system is clearly needed, but is unlikely to have
been a significant factor in the ships’ choice not to participate in the demonstration sea trial.

74.     Nevertheless, even without all intended inputs, the basic elements of the system were
functional, and in particular the information exchange system that is at the core of the MEH. This
allowed a successful though scaled-back test of the interconnectivity and data sharing of various
data servers, exchange protocols, and staff capacity.

75.      Technically the MEH pilot system worked well during the sea trial. All participants in the
trial were able to access the information and data of the MEH through the Internet portal. The
participants found the information and data useful and suggested improving the pilot system with
more real time and dynamic data. The economic evaluation after the sea trial indicated that
developing a full-scale MEH system was economically and financially viable.

76.     Decision to Scale Up (first GEO indicator).Consequently, at the September 2012 meeting
of Tripartite Technical Experts Group (TTEG), the three littoral states signed Letters of
Acknowledgement to continue with the operation of the pilot MEH and to work closely together
to further advance and scale-up the MEH under the Cooperative Mechanism on Safety of the
Navigation and Environmental Protection in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. Following the
signing of the Letters of Acknowledgement, TTEG agreed to establish Technical Working Group
on MEH under TTEG.

77.      Setting up an Environmental Fund to support local marine environmental conservation
activities was not specifically discussed by the littoral states and consequently no decision was

                                                14
taken with respect to this topic. However, since the littoral states agreed to put MEH project
under the Cooperative Mechanism and TTEG, the MEH is not a stand-alone project, but become
an integral part of projects under Cooperative Mechanism. Consequently the objective of the
Environment Fund could be fulfilled by one of the projects under the Cooperative Mechanism
(e.g. Straits Project 2 – Cooperation and Capacity Building on Hazardous and Noxious Substance
Incidents Preparedness and Response in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore) and/or using
available funds (e.g. the Aids to Navigation Fund (ANF).

78.      Design of Full-Scale MEH and Environment Fund (second GEO indicator). At the
Tripartite Technical Experts Group (TTEG) meeting in September 2012, the littoral states
decided to conduct hydrographic surveys covering critical areas in the Straits and to produce
larger scale ENCs. At the TTEG meeting in October2013, the littoral states agreed to set up a
technical committee led by Malaysia to conduct the joint hydrographic survey. India offered of
in-kind contributions to the joint survey. This offer still needs to be evaluated by the technical
committee.

79.      In financing terms, the littoral states agreed to fund the maintenance and operation of the
current MEH pilot system under the Straits Project 4, which aims at setting up a Tide, Current
and Wind Measurement System for Straits of Malacca and Singapore, and also welcomed user
States and stakeholders to contribute. They also agreed to use the Aids to Navigation Fund (ANF)
to harmonize the data display between the Straits Project 4 and the MEH. Since MEH is now
under the Cooperative Mechanism and TTEG, the expansion of MEH will be the responsibility of
the three littoral states and international marine community.

80.     In term of institutional aspects, the littoral states agreed to use the Cooperative
Mechanism as a regional body to oversee the continued development and future operation of the
MEH System. In the October 2013 TTEG meeting, the financial and institutional aspects of MEH
were fine-tuned in the following way: (i) the three data centers will be synchronized to avoid
having to register with all three littoral states in order to access the information provided under
the MEH; (ii) Malaysia and Singapore will be the backup for the MEH Batam Data Center on a
six-month rotating basis; and (iii) Indonesia will be responsible for the maintenance of the Batam
MEH Data Center, for which funding of US$70,000 was set aside in the 2014 budget. The Batam
MEH data center will be a joint center supported by the three littoral states.

81.     Inputs, outputs, and intermediate indicators. Although the GEO-level indicators were, on
the surface, largely achieved, most of the inputs and outputs reflected in the intermediate
indicators were either not achieved, or only partially achieved. Some activities and outputs
suffered from lengthy procurement processes and unexpected delays in shipping the navigation
equipment from Singapore to Indonesia. Some were not sufficiently funded (hydrographic
survey), were not carried out with project resources (environmental mapping), or couldn’t be
completed before closing (sand wave models). Although participation of commercial ship owners
was outside the control of the project, their loss of interest was lack of participation was a major
shortcoming. While all this had an impact on the scope of the pilot MEH system, it did not
preclude testing and evaluating the system’s functionality, nor the ability of the littoral states to
take a decision on whether or not to expand it.

Objective 2 –Improving maritime safety and reducing the risk of environmental damage
to the globally-significant shared natural resources of the Straits of Malacca and
Singapore


                                                 15
82.     Direct demonstration of this objective was not intended by project completion, and the
results framework did not include indicators to measure it (such as the rate of collisions,
groundings, and other accidents; chemical and oil spills including deliberate discharges; and
impact on environmental resources and response and mitigation when such damage does occur).

83.     However, some project activities and outputs were specifically targeted at the
environmental damage reduction and mitigation aspects or the MEH as a ship traffic management
system, as well as to provide non-shipping stakeholders with data to help predict and respond to
the impacts of incidents when they do occur. Many of these activities were either not completed,
or only partially completed. For example, planned sand wave models were not developed,
environmental marine information overlays could not be created by the project and were instead
undertaken by the government of Singapore (but not incorporated with the ENCs during the
demonstration), and development of an emergency response system was cancelled and response
exercises continued to be carried out by individual authorities rather than through the project. The
Environment Fund was not established or financed (though other initiatives and sources of
financing might help fulfill the intended purpose of the Funds).

84.     In any case, the most important linkage of this objective to the project is the expectation
that a full-scale MEH, with high participation rates by commercial shipping, will decrease
accidents and the resulting environment impacts. The decision to scale-up the MEH and the
strong indication of commitment by the TTEG to serve as the main institution responsible for
seeing the scale-up through to fruition are highly encouraging signs that the longer-term maritime
safety and damage reductions will be achieved, possibly sooner rather than later. Though not as
large or comprehensive as originally planned, the demonstration still provided enough
information to conduct the evaluation study used to inform the decision.

85.      The primary reason to temper these expectations is that commercial shipping users, who
had been interested and apparently committed to the demonstration at the outset, did not
participate in the actual sea trial of the MEH as planned, and their future interest and participation
is not assured. Without a high rate of adoption of the MEH, particularly by the largest and
potentially most damaging ships, the benefits of the system for both safety and reduced
environmental damage would be critically compromised. Although other financing strategies are
under consideration, paid participation by commercial ships is also essential to the favored
approach to financing the hydrographic surveys and system operation necessary for a fully
functioning MEH.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

86.      The economic evaluation in the PAD used NPV, ERR, and MERR as indicators to
measure economic feasibility of the MEH. All of these indicators involve converting a stream of
future costs and benefits into a single number, the NPV, the ERR or the MERR. The benefit
included in the evaluation was reduction of clean-up costs of oil spills. The cost included
investment, operation, and maintenance costs. The evaluation did not take into account other
benefit, namely reduced under keel-clearance which increases efficiency of ships, and cost of
collision or grounding.

87.     In the evaluation, number of tanker voyages through the Straits was projected from 2002
to 2025, and the investment costs are taken to include operating and maintenance and resurveying
every four years. The net present value was about U$26 million (using a discount rate of 12

                                                 16
percent), the economic rate of return was about 32 percent and the modified economic rate of
return was about 21 percent. These values were robust to projections in the number of voyages,
even with a continuation of the 2002 number of voyages the evaluation results were U$13 million
for the NPV, 24 percent for the ERR and 18 percent for the MERR. At appraisal the analysis
showed that the project was economically feasible.

88.     During project implementation, a socio economic evaluation was also undertaken. The
economic analysis evaluated three possible scenarios for extending the Demonstration Phase (DP)
of the MEH. They were:
  Scenario 1: completing the DP and making it operationally and financially sustainable;
  Scenario 2: extending the DP (scenario 1) to cover the whole area of the Traffic Separation
     Scheme (TSS), and:
  Scenario 3: extending the scenario 2 to cover the whole of the Straits of Malacca and
     Singapore.

89.     The NPV, ERR, and MERR were also calculated in this evaluation. The evaluation was
for 20 years of investment from 2014 to 2033. There were at least four quantifiable benefits of
maintaining and expanding the MEHSOMS: reduced cost of oil spills, reduced cost of groundings
and collisions, reduction in ship operating costs (fuel), and reduction in loss of life and injuries.
The investment cost includes among others hydrographic surveys, development of ENCs, etc.

90.     Using a discount rate of 12%, the analysis showed that all three scenarios have a positive
annual net benefit and cost benefit ratio greater than 1.0. It also indicated that all three scenarios
are economically and financially feasible. Amongst the three scenarios, the analysis showed that
scenario 2 was the most feasible one. The preferred path is to invest based on scenario 1, and
then to proceed to invest based on scenario 2.The result of the socio-economic evaluation done
during project implementation was consistent with the economic evaluation in the PAD.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

91.       The demonstration provided by the MEH project and the decision of the littoral states to
complete the MEH demonstration system and to scale it up to a larger area are important
outcomes of the project. On this basis alone the outcome might reasonably be considered
moderately satisfactory. But viewed in its entirety, there were also substantial shortcomings
relative to the outputs and outcomes envisioned in the appraised project design. These
shortcomings (discussed in more detail in Section 3.2) involve the scope, scale, and quality of the
demonstration, the participation of key stakeholders (ship owners) in both the demonstration and
the scale-up decision, the lack of a clear decision on the Environment Fund, and in some of the
small environmental activities intended to strengthen the local environmental response to any
incidents that the MEH safety improvements are unable to prevent. Therefore and considering
that (i) the project was and is highly relevant in terms of objectives, but was not fully adequate in
terms of design and implementation, and (ii) the efficiency is considered substantial, the overall
outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory.


92.     In a narrow sense the MEH demonstration system functioned well enough to provide the
basis for a cost-benefit and feasibility assessment that helped the littoral states in the decision to
move forward with a larger-scale MEH. The design of the system and plan for its financing are


                                                 17
not contained in a single, distinct design document (which in any case was not explicitly called
for in the project results framework), rather comprise the littoral states’ agreement on an overall
strategy, definition of critical next steps, commitment to several specific MEH-related projects,
and continued exploration of long-term financing options.

93.     However, a reasonable interpretation of the project objective is not only that a decision
was taken, but that the outputs and elements of the MEH demonstration that were to form the
basis of the decision were also delivered, and that the decision included the key stakeholders
needed for a full-scale MEH to be sustainable and deliver the promised benefits in shipping safety
and reduced environmental damage. In this respect, there were a number of significant
shortcomings.

94.      The hydrographic survey covered a much smaller area than planned; limited ENCs were
produced based on the survey but were not actually used in the sea trials; overlays of
environmentally sensitive areas were not created by the project and those created by other sources
were not used; some electronic monitoring and reporting equipment was not installed, sand wave
models were not done, and an emergency response plan was not developed nor were exercises
conducted. The result was a demonstration system that allowed key system functionality to be
tested, including the information exchange system, but did not integrate “all the elements” that
the commercial ships were originally expected to test in the sea trials.

95.     If the key outcome of the project could have been achieved without these intermediate
outputs and elements, it is reasonable to assume that it would have been designed without them.
The reasons these activities were not achieved, despite almost two years’ extension of the project,
was because of delays, capacity constraints, costs, and other implementation issues, not because
they were determined to be unnecessary.

96.      Perhaps most importantly, owners of the (minimum) 160 large tankers and cargo ships
that was to test the system lost interest as the project progressed, and ultimately chose not to
participate in demonstration. The participation of these ships was highlighted repeatedly in the
project design as a key element of the demonstration, both for testing and for generating feedback.
They were replaced by 18 smaller, trans-straits ships recruited by the project implementing
agency, which allowed the project to conduct a smaller, shorter sea trial that was still deemed
sufficient for evaluative purposes. But even if that is the case, the significance of these ships goes
beyond technical trials of the MEH, as their participation in the MEH is critical to the system’s
ability to deliver benefits and possibly to its financing and sustainability as well.

97.      The second GEO objective (improved safety and reduced environmental damage) is
mainly a long-term impact that is dependent on achievement of the first objective (scale-up of the
MEH). To the extent that the MEH demonstration was not fully developed and all of its elements
not yet installed or integrated, and the commitment of shipping users is uncertain, the prospect of
achieving the intended safety and environmental benefits, while likely at some point, are not as
strong as the original project design envisioned. The project envisioned a fully functioning, fully
equipped and updated MEH demonstration system, with clear private-sector interest and strong
stakeholder commitment to scale-up in scope and adoption. The project delivered a smaller
demonstration that did not integrate all of the planned elements, and led to a scale-up decision,
but without the involvement of a critical stakeholder.

98.      Other environmental activities and outputs related to response rather than mitigation were
not completed or fully achieved, such as the Environment Fund, sand wave modeling, mapping of
sensitive areas, and emergency response planning and exercises. While the main environmental

                                                 18
benefits are likely to accrue from avoidance of incidents that damage natural resources (because
of improved navigation and maritime safety), it does not change the fact that these relatively
small elements of the project were not achieved.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

99.    The project did not have any poverty-specific emphasis, gender aspect, nor any social
development aspect to it.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

100.     The project contributed to institutional strengthening/changes in the following way:
 Capacity building through trainings of hydrographic survey, ENC software suite, and MEH
    Data Center IT equipment software and hardware to the participants from the three littoral
    states.
 Upgrading the Government of Indonesia’s navigation safety equipment and DGST officers’
    capability with regard to monitoring the maritime safety.
 Improving capacity of the IMO staff and DGST officers in regard to the financial
    management and procurement procedures of the Bank’s project.
 Better coordination in marine safety and marine environment issues for Indonesia.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

101.     Integration of MEH to Cooperative Mechanism integrated marine safety and
marine environment development. Under Cooperative mechanism, there are separate projects
on marine safety and marine environment. The MEH integrated these two different focuses into a
single integrated focus in CM.

102.    Enhanced environmental awareness. This project introduced the environmental
awareness by integrating physical data and marine environment data into the MEH database. All
stakeholders who are involved with the Project and the users who have access to the data will be
presented with sufficient natural and marine resources information in order to support in their
decision making related to the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.

103.   Open dialogue between the three littoral states. The MEH demonstration project has
provided a platform for the three littoral states to strengthen their coordination with regard to the
maritime safety and marine environmental issues over the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

104.    The main factor contributing to the substantial risk rating to outcomes is the uncertainty
about the interest of private ships in using the MEH. The importance of convincing ship owners

                                                 19
of the benefits and utility of the system was recognized at appraisal, but was not considered a
major hurdle. In fact, there was a strong expectation that more ships would participate in the sea
trial than the minimum of 160 that was planned. In the end, no ships of the type targeted as the
most critical users chose to participate, and they were not directly involved in the decision to
scale up. There is high confidence that once the full system capabilities are in place (particularly
the data required to provide dynamic under-keel clearance information) and greater efforts are
made to disseminate and market the MEH, their interest will be rekindled. But while the
likelihood of ship owners declining to use the system in the long-term is low, the impact if they
did not would be critical, essentially preventing the system from delivering the intended benefits.

105.     Reliability of MEH Data Center. If the MEH is to provide a fully functional, 24/7
system with no allowance for downtime, there must be permanent and capable operating staff at
the Data Center. The newly recruited IT specialists of the DGST that will be allocated to the
Batam Data Center must be highly qualified to manage the Data Center; otherwise there is a risk
that the Center will not perform as expected. The IT specialists need to attend to the data systems,
ensure that the electrical system is functioning and that any back-up facilities are operational, in
order to ensure that both input and output data transmissions are functioning. The specialists also
need to maintain records of performance and the use of the systems. While these will be mostly
automatic, these records need to be analyzed, and performance and monitoring reports need to be
prepared and disseminated. Feedback from users also need to be collected and analyzed, in order
to gauge how system performance can be improved to better meet users’ needs.

106.      Availability of sufficient budget for operation and maintenance of the MEH Data
Centers. There will be maintenance and operation cost to be carried by the three littoral states for
the running of MEH Data Centers and for the equipment installed in various location, i.e. the cost
of staff, the internet bandwidth service, maintenance of the servers and the equipment. MEH Data
Centers relies for their absolute reliability to continuously provide data. There is risk associated
with the littoral states future budget availability to meet the minimum cost of operation and
maintenance. The cost of operating the MEH is estimated to a little less than US$ 1.5 million per
year, which could be shared equally or based on GDP of the three littoral States. Nevertheless,
the operating cost can be offset by the revenue that will be accrued from the operation of the
MEH.

107.      Users’ interest to utilize the data provided by the MEH. The MEH Data Center will
perform its function when there are the user of data, in this case the ships that are passing the
Strait. There is cost associated with communication service to the user. The users need to use
satellite service to connect to the internet and obtain the data from MEH Data Center. The risks
are related to the willingness of the user to use the data provided by MEH Data Center and pay
for the associated fees. Although the representatives of the ship operators (ICS and Intertanko)
were supporting the MEH when it started, that interest had significantly lessened by the time it
was drawing to a close. This lack of interest was demonstrated by their reluctance to encourage
their members to take part in the sea trials of the systems. Unless that interest can be rekindled
there is no purpose in further developing the MEH. There needs to be more convincing benefits
from the MEH, which can be achieved if the MEH is more reliable, operated 24/7, and provides
more coverage area. A public relation campaign directed towards the ship operators can attract
the potential user of MEH. This campaign can be done through promotion of MEH in the website,
in articles in maritime journals and presentation in conferences.

108.   GEO is not achieved if the system’s performance is not satisfactory and/or ship
operators do not willing to use MEH. The main strength of MEH is that marine navigation
information/data is integrated with marine environment sensitive areas in a real time situation.

                                                20
The system is also capable to estimate the likely areas impacted by oil spills. If the system fails to
perform satisfactorily, it will reduce attractiveness of MEH and will increase the risk of collision
as well as environmental damage.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

109.    Project preparation took a long time and involved several very seasoned sector specialists.
Some initial preparatory studies for the project were carried out in 1997. Formal project
preparation started in 2000. The project was approved by the Board in June 2006. The long
preparation time was mainly due to the need to reach an agreement among the three littoral states
to work together in jointly managing their sea space in the Straits through the implementation of
the MEH. The joint management of the sea space in the Straits had not always been without
controversy and conflicts in the past. The Bank team was instrumental in reaching this agreement.
The Bank team also carried out due diligence in fiduciary and safeguard terms. The need to
comply with GEF requirements added to the length of project preparation.

110.    The Bank team underestimated the complexity of this project, which required the active
involvement of three different countries and several agencies in each country, the IMO and the
shipping industry. Only the GOI and the IMO were formal project implementation agencies and
signed the respective legal agreements. The involvement of Singapore, Malaysia and the two
shipping associations were assured through MOUs.

111.    The Bank team did not realize the existence of the TTEG, a group of experts from the
maritime administrations of the three littoral states, which meet annually to discuss and
collaborate in the areas of maritime safety and environment protection. Had the Bank involved
the TTEG, it would have benefited from the beginning in project preparation, design and
implementation.

112.    The project was also overly ambitious in the design of its component. It envisaged a large
amount of different activities, which diluted the efforts of the implementation agencies. A focus
on the key elements of the MEH, including the hydrologic survey and the preparation of the ENC
could have helped to speed up project implementation and maintain the interest of the shipping
sector. Additionally, the Bank team underestimated the project costs, especially the cost to
implement the hydrologic survey.

113.    Finally, although most of the project risks were adequately identified, the project had
shortcomings in the design of the risk mitigation measures. For instance, the limited participation
of the shipping sector in the field trial could have been mitigated through adequate incentives,
including monitory incentive to cover the cost of their participation.




                                                 21
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

114.    Overall, the Bank team was strongly involved in project implementation and had an
instrumental role in solving implementation bottlenecks and maintaining the support of all parties.
However, during the initial phase of project implementation, supervision missions were
conducted irregularly and the project implementation support was not as intense. After the mid-
term review and towards project closing, supervision missions became regular and the project
implementation support magnified. Many initiatives to proceed came from the Bank team. This in
turn assisted both IMO and DGST in performing their parts. In addition to this, the Bank team
maintained continuous communications and held discussions throughout the project with all
stakeholders to ensure that any issue could be resolved as soon as possible.

115.      The Bank kept reminding the clients to stick to the agreements in the PAD and the legal
agreements, especially in terms of timing, use of resources and the scope of work of each activity.
The Bank provided a considerable amount of implementation support, especially in reviewing the
economic evaluation of the MEH carried out under the project. The Bank team had a crucial role
in trying to maintain the support of all project parties. The Bank team also spent a lot of efforts in
facilitating the institutional coordination in Indonesia. Most time during supervision was used to
deal with these issues.

116.     However, the facts that the project involved many stakeholders in different countries, the
project sites were scattered in remote areas, especially those were the navigation equipment was
installed, and the supervision budget was limited created some supervision challenges.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

117.    The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was rated moderately unsatisfactory
and the quality of supervision was rated moderately satisfactory. Therefore, the Bank’s overall
performance was rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

118.    The GOI had a proactive role during project preparation. It called for several meetings
among stakeholder to make progress on project implementation bottlenecks. The GOI also
showed strong commitment and played an important role in facilitating project implementation.
Issues with inter-agency bureaucracy were addressed appropriately, e.g. through the frequent
calling of inter-agency meetings by the Ministry of Finance, cooperative dialogue to resolve
differences between agencies, and the resolution of technical problems in the data center using
their own budgets. The Ministries of Finance and Environment, as well as the Bank of Indonesia,
responded in a timely manner to any issue raised by the Bank during project implementation.
Despite this proactive approach, it often took longer to reach solution than desirable. This is not
due to a lack of commitment of the GOI. It stems from the multi-stakeholder nature of the project

                                                 22
and the local bureaucracy, which often require lengthy exchanges of formal letters between
agencies. It is also due to complicated and lengthy clearance procedures in Indonesia.

119.     The commitment of the GOI in post project completion is demonstrated through the
allocation of funds and human capital to provide continuity the project, as elucidated below.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

120.    The IMO maintained a strong commitment throughout the project. Its convening power
was effective in bringing stakeholders to the table for multilateral discussions. The IMO
responded quickly to resolve problems, such as in financial reporting. When the project
coordinator resigned, the IMO quickly assigned one of their officials to temporarily lead project
implementation.

121.    In terms of fiduciary performance, the IMO made significant efforts to maintain adequate
FM arrangements and comply with the Bank’s procurement rules. However, the IMO struggled
with the Bank’s procurement and FM rules and procedures. As a consequence, minor FM issues
arose, which were resolved in close collaboration with the Bank. Shortcomings also took place in
terms of procurement and caused significant delays. These shortcomings were due to a lack of
capacity and experience of IMO staff. However, in the later years of project implementation,
along with close coordination with the Bank, IMO managed to resolve these issues and
implemented their part of the project.

122.     On the side of the GOI, project implementation relied heavily on the Ministry of
Transport, through the DGST as the implementing agency. Due to the unfamiliarity with the
project and a lack of experience with Bank rules and procedures, the progress in the
implementation of the components under the DGST was slow, especially in terms of procurement.
Some shortcomings in terms of quality and procedural compliance were encountered. Starting in
2010, the capacity of the DGST’s project management team markedly improved. With a better
understanding of the importance of this regional project and a greater familiarity with Bank rules
and procedures, the DGST assumed a stronger ownership for its parts of the project. In the post-
completion phase, the DGST assumed the O&M expenditures of the data center and the cost of
the building, navigational equipment, and the newly-recruited IT staff.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

123.     Since the performance of the Government was satisfactory and the implementation
agencies’ performance was moderately satisfactory, the overall performance is rated moderately
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

124.    The need to comply with GEF requirements may lengthen the project preparation
time. As mentioned, some preparatory activities for this project took place already in 1997,
formal project preparation started in 2000 and the project was approved by the board only in May

                                               23
2006. The long preparation period cannot only be attributed to the involvement of multiple
stakeholders in the project, but is also caused by the need to comply with GEF requirement. This
not only refers to the additional approval process within GEF. In the case of Indonesia, it required
the involvement of the Ministry of Environment as the main focal point, which complicated
communication and coordination. In addition, it took the three littoral states and the IMO a long
time to agree on the project objectives in line with GEF requirements. Therefore, when deciding
embarking on a GEF project, time and budget constraints should be careful considered.

125.    Appropriate risk mitigation is crucial. This project adequately identified the risks that
emerged during project implementation, but failed to propose adequate mitigation measures.
Most of the delays in the implementation of the project components and the shortfalls in the
achievement of the project outcomes could have been avoided if adequate mitigation measures
were in place. For instance, the project could have engaged with additional ship owner
associations and shipping lines from the outset in order to make sure that a sufficient amount of
ships participated in the sea trial.

126.    Projects involving multiple countries and stakeholders should be kept simple.
Regional projects are difficult to manage and need a very close attention: the success of this type
of projects depend on the performance of the weakest country/stakeholder. The complexity of this
project negatively affected both project implementation and its outcomes. A simpler project scope
focusing only on the hydrographic survey, the development of models, and the preparation of
ENCs might have permitted to finalize these activities before the sea trial. This in turn might have
ensured the participation of the ship owners in this trial.

127.    Proper cost estimation and the allocation of sufficient budget to the project
components are essential. The main activity of the project was the development of new ENCs
based on new and better hydrographic data and models. These ENCs were expected to be used for
the navigation of ships in SOMS to increase safety and the efficiency of shipping. Nevertheless,
the budget allocated to implement this component was too small; hence it was not properly
implemented and did not fully achieve the overall project outcome.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

128.    The Bank appreciates the comments from the Government of Indonesia, who was
represented by the Directorate General of Sea Transportation, who finds the MEH Demonstration
Project as positive support in upgrading the navigational equipment and providing capacity
building for the DGST officers in the new technologies of sea navigation.

                                                        standard, and that the East Asian Hydrographic

                                                        China in S-100 ENCs by early 2014.

                                                        Hence, the Project was able to demonstrate the
                                                        production of ENC with E-MIOs, however, such
                                                        materials were not officially verified by the
                                                        hydrographic offices of the three littoral States.
                                                        Moreover, MIOs have been used mostly for non-

                                                        MEH website.

                                                        In light of the above, the PSC requested Malaysia to
                                                        take the lead in providing the requisite information
                                                        on emergency response to the Project. Thus, open
                                                        provisions of such information will be subject to

                                                          the reduced fuel consumption; and

                                                          collisions.

                                                       The result of the evaluations indicate that the second

                                                       TSS would bring the largest net benefits of all three
                                                       Scenarios, and is therefore the preferred scope of
                                                       scaling-up of the MEH.

                                                       The sea trial was carried out from 28 March 2012 to

                                                       involved 72 registered participants. Overall, all the
                                                       participants were able to access the MEH through

                                                       success. In terms of availability of information/data,
                                                       most of the respondents would like to see real time

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Excerpt from the Executive Summary of Socio Economic Evaluation and Assessment of Scaling
Up the Marine Electronic Highway (MEH) System for the Straits of Malacca and Singapore

Costs and Benefits of extending the Demonstration Phase

Three possible scenarios for extending the Demonstration Phase of the MEH were evaluated:
Scenario 1      Completing the DP and making it operationally and financially sustainable;
Scenario 2      Building on the first Scenario, extending the sustainable DP to cover the entire
                area of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS), and:
Scenario 3      Extending the second Scenario, to cover the entire Straits of Malacca and
                Singapore.

The evaluation was undertaken in the form of a cost benefit analysis. Five sources of benefit were
identified and measured:
     a reduction of the costs of oil spill clean-ups;
     a reduction of the loss in Straits marine and coastal resources value;
     a reduction of the costs of groundings and collisions of vessels;
     savings in the cost of bunker fuel used by vessels using the Straits, and an assessment of
         the reduction of GHGs that would result from reduced fuel consumption, and;
     a reduction of fatalities and injuries to ship crews, through the reduction of the number of
         collisions.

The value of these benefits for each of the Scenarios was compared to the cost of scaling-up and
maintaining the MEH as it is now. The major cost for the second and third Scenarios would be for
undertaking new hydrographic surveys and the production of high resolution ENCs based on
those surveys. Other costs for these two scenarios would be for additional equipment to obtain
and transmit data to feed into the MEH. All Scenarios would include operating costs for the MEH
and its MIS, as well as maintenance costs for the equipment used to generate and transmit the
data for the MIS.

Results of the evaluation

The cost-benefit analysis was undertaken in two Parts. The first was relatively straightforward
and used the largest annual average net benefit and Benefit/Cost ratio as the decision criteria,
while the second required many more assumptions and projections, and used the Net Present
Value (NPV), Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Modified Economic Rate of Return (MERR)
as the decision criteria. Both parts of the evaluation demonstrated that it would be most
worthwhile to scale-up the MEH to Scenario 2, although all three Scenarios would have positive
outcomes.

For the first Scenario, the decision criteria that are relative to the size of the project yields
relatively small results, with an average annual net benefit at just over U$1 M per year and an
NPV of U$5M. However, the criteria that are not dependent on the scale of the project yields
more positive results, with a Benefit/Cost ratio of 2.0, an ERR of39.2% and an MERR of 19.3%.




                                                33
The second Scenario has larger absolute benefits, its average annual benefit being more than
U$12 M per year and its NPV being more than U$50 M. The Benefit/Cost ratio is 2.7, the ERR is
33.9% and the MERR is 16.1%.
Scenario 3 has an average annual net benefit less than Scenario 2, of just less than U$12M, as
well as a slightly smaller NPV (U$40.2m) and Benefit/Cost ratio (2.0), and ERR and MERRs that
are less than Scenario 1 and 2 (29.8% and 15.5% respectively).

The results for the third Scenario require careful interpretation than the straightforward results for
Scenarios 1 and 2, since the definition of the Scenarios makes them cumulative (each includes the
actions of the preceding Scenario/s). The less positive outcomes for Scenario 3 indicate that the
additional costs of scaling-up Scenario 2 to Scenario 3 would be less than the additional benefits
it would bring. This implies that scaling-up from Scenario 2 to Scenario 3 would not be
worthwhile.

Given the limited geographic scope of Scenario1,it would not be able to realize many of the
potential benefits of the other Scenarios. Scenario 2 would overcome these limitations, yielding
much higher benefits, but at the cost of having to undertake a new hydrographic survey. The third
Scenario would involve costs of a more extensive hydrographic survey and investment in more
data equipment, but would bring only limited additional benefits since there is little congestion
and are no shallow depth points that hinder navigation in the expanded area.

The robustness of these results was tested using switching values - values of the main parameters
in the evaluation needed to change its outcome. The probability of occurrence of the switching
values was considered to be so low as to make them improbable, hence the results of the
evaluations were deemed to be robust.

Distribution of benefits and costs

The distribution of the benefits and costs of scaling-up the MEH to Scenario 2 will depend on
whether and how the investment and operating costs of the scaling -up are charged to its users. If
no charges were to be made, the people and governments of the littoral states would have a
negative net benefit, since the social and environmental benefits would be less than the
investment and operating costs of the MEH. Ship operators would accrue most of the net benefits
(all the benefits of fuel savings and most of those of reduced groundings and collisions) and ships’
crews (through reduced fatalities and injuries) would accrue the remainder.

If a user charge were implemented to recover all the investment costs of the MEH, the
governments’ net benefit share would become 4% (they would still incur the operating costs of
the MEH) and ship operators’ share would be reduced to 67% (viz. they would now incur the
investment cost of the hydrographic survey) while the savings in lives and accidents to ship’s
crew would remain at 29% of the net benefit.

Conclusion of the Evaluation

The results of the evaluations indicate that the second Scenario, completing the MEH of the
Demonstration Phase and rendering it sustainable, and extending its geographic coverage to the
whole of the TSS, would bring the largest net benefits of all three Scenarios, and is therefore the
preferred scope of scaling-up of the MEH. The major beneficiaries of the scaling-up would be
ship operators.

Role of users of the MEH

For Scenario 2 to be successfully implemented, it will need the active and willing support of its
users: the operators of ships using the TSS. Although the main objectives of scaling-up the MEH
are to reduce the risk of damage to the marine and coastal environment of the Straits and to
improve the safety of navigation, in monetary terms the largest benefits will accrue to ship
owners and operators. Their savings in fuel costs and other benefits make up about 70% of the
total benefits of each Scenario.

This is significant, because the high cost of the new hydrographic survey that would be needed
for the expansion is beyond the resources of the institutions that would be responsible for its
undertaking. A consideration of three ways of financing the expansion of the MEH to the whole
of the TSS found that the most viable option would require some form of user charging. The
amount of the charge, however it was levied, would need to be less than the benefits to the ship
operators, so that the scheme could be of interest to them. But this can only occur if the cost is
shared between a high proportion of ships using the Straits – if the survey costs were to be
recovered over a period of ten years, the user charge would have to be paid by about 70% of
transiting vessels to make the charge low enough to leave the ship operators with a residual
benefit large enough to make participation in the MEH worthwhile to them.

If the charge were to be paid only by the VLCCs and deep-draught container ships (about 21% of
the projected transits), it would be nearlyUS$800 per transit (more than the benefits per transit).
But if about 50% of the transiting vessels were also to pay the charge, it would reduce the average
charge to about U$200 per transit, low enough to make it worthwhile for them to pay.

If, on further consideration and consultation with ship owners, it appears that less than half the
transiting vessels would be prepared to pay the fee, a potentially viable alternative for funding
expansion of the MEH would be for the hydrographic departments of the littoral states themselves
to undertake the survey. If this proves to be feasible (and it was not feasible for the
Demonstration Phase), then the cost would be reduced sufficiently to be easily recoverable from a
user charge.

The dependence of funding the MEH on implementing a user charge underscores the importance
of ship operators being fully aware of the benefits an MEH in the TSS could offer them. The
benefits can best be demonstrated by making the current MEH system fully operational and able
to transmit its data ships in a form that they can receive, without undue difficulties or additional
cost. This demonstration would need to be complemented by a deliberate campaign to
disseminate information on the successful operation of the MEH and the usefulness of its outputs
to ships using the Straits. This campaign would include presentations of the MEH at conferences
and exhibitions attended by operators of ships using the Straits, publicity of the MEH website and
scope of services it provides, publication of articles in professional and trade journals and
magazines, as well as frequent and direct contact with the ship owners and their representative
chambers, trade associations and industry groups.

Operation of the MEH

The need to maintain the MIS of the current MEH so as to provide a demonstrably reliable and
useful data service to mariners highlights the necessity of establishing a full-time MEH
management capacity. The recent transfer of decision-making responsibility of the MEH to the
Tri-partite Technical Experts Group is a positive step forward, but it does not fully address how
the day–to-day operations of the MEH will be managed. Among the few precedents of the full-

                                                35
time management of a maritime agreement is that of the Helsinki Commission and its permanent
Secretariat. While the context in which the Helsinki Commission 1 operates for the Baltic Sea is
not directly comparable to that of the SOMS, the way that its Secretariat is structured and funded
provides many useful exemplars for how the day–to-day functioning of the MEH can best be
managed.

Recommendations

         The MEH should be scaled-up to cover the entire TSS. As the first stage, the
          Demonstration Phase should be completed by making its MIS more reliable and fully
          populated with the expected data;
         Once agreement on scaling-up the MEH has been reached, in order to start
          implementation of the agreement, the TTEG should further investigate the options for
          undertaking and funding a hydrographic survey that will cover the TSS and permit the
          creation of ENCs of a comparable standard to those available for the Strait of Singapore;
         To ensure that the Demonstration Phase of the MEH is completed and its MIS remains
          operational and available, the TTEG should quickly hire a full-time and fully-staffed
          Operations Unit to ensure that the MIS can be kept operating. The Secretariat to
          HELCOM (the Helsinki Commission) offers a useful precedent and, with necessary
          adaptations to the local context, could be an exemplary model for the MEH Operations
          Unit;
         To encourage the necessary participation by and commitment of the operators of ships
          using the TSS in the scaling-up process, the TTEG should also design and implement a
          public relations operation. This will make the advantages of the fully functioning
          Demonstration Phase MIS more visible to the ship operators (who will need to make a
          commitment to participating in the scaled-up MEH in order to justify investment in the
          new hydrographic survey), while at the same time, bringing knowledge about the MEH to
          a wider audience.

Comments from the Directorate General of Sea Transportation

Dear Pak Aldian,

Please find our comments on the ICR for MEH Project as follows:

1.       We think that the ICR is comprehensive and covers all of the issues encountered during
implementation.
2.       Regarding the need for IT Specialist to be appointed at the Batam MEH Data Center,
please be informed that the Ministry of Transportation is recruiting new officers including IT
specialist. Hopefully there will be new officers qualified for the position in Batam.
3.       We found that the Bank payment procedures were complicated and thus has caused
delays to equipment delivery. Despite the complicated procedures experienced during project
implementation involving payment process, the Bank team provided solid assistance in the form
of continuous communication and discussion to find good solution.
4.       We suggest that all aspects of project management were prepared and discussed
thoroughly between the Bank and the Ministry of Finance prior to project implementation.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide our comments.

1.2.2 Reason(s) for Difference(s) in Project Scope between Original and Actual

The Contractor, until the end of contract date – 15 May 2013, was not able to provide the
equipment mentioned in MEH Project contract no.: 01/PP/PKP/III-11, dated 4 March 2011:
DGPS and Ocean Data Buoy (ODB), by reasons of:

“Several equipment, had been in the warehouse located in Singapore, had to be taken back to
each fabricant, as the storage time had expired. This was done to prevent inappropriate equipment
performance that may have resulted due to forced usage of the equipment ”.

Receipt of the equipment return to original fabricant is attached,

However, the Contractor agrees to finish the work for DGPS and Ocean Data Buoy (ODB) as
mentioned in Contractor’s Statement Letter

1.3. Necessity of the Project
1.3.1 Necessity/Background of the Project
Implementation of the Marine Electronic Highway (MEH) Demonstration Project in the Straits of
Malacca and Singapore (SoMS) was given the go ahead in June2006 following the signing of a
grant agreement between the Global Environment Facility (GEF)/World Bank and the
International Maritime Organization (IMO).

1). The MEH is being built upon a network of Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) using
Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS) and environmental management
tools. Positioning systems, real-time navigational information like tidal and current data
providing meteorological and oceanographic information is designed to assist in the overall traffic
management of the Straits and provide the basis for sound marine environmental protection and
management.



                                                    42
2). The overall objectives of MEH are to enhance maritime services, improve navigational safety
and [security], promote marine environment protection and the sustainable development, and use
of the coastal and marine resources of the littoral States.

3). The regional demonstration project involves littoral States aims to link shore based marine
information and communication infrastructure with the corresponding navigational and
communication facilities aboard transiting ships.

Summary of International Maritime Organization (IMO) Project Terminal Report

Project Implementation - Summary

Implementation of the MEH Demonstration Project was initiated following the signing of the
Grant Agreement between IMO and the World Bank and initiated the recruitment of a Project
Launching Consultant (J. Kramer, Project Manager) and a Procurement Specialist (E. Hanselman)
in early 2006. In March 2007, the Project established its headquarters, the Project Management
Office (PMO), in Batam following the appointment in December 2006 of the Project Manager
and the Procurement Specialist by IMO’s Secretary-General as field staff of the Project based at
PMO.

The period from 2007 to June 2010 can be construed as planning phase due to the limited
implementation of activities in the field as the focus was on the preparation of procurement
documents, including bidding, bid assessment and selection as well as securing agreements or
arrangements on various aspects of Project activities, in particular, the work permits or visas of
Project staff, development of work plan and establishment of financial arrangements. During this
period, three Project Steering Committee (PSC) meetings were held, the awarding of the bid on
the hydrographic survey of a part of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) of the Straits of
Malacca and Singapore to a private firm (GEMS Survey Limited), the hiring of an IT consultant
to develop the blueprint of the MEH and the recruitment of a new Project Manager (A. Tcheng)
who subsequently resigned in October 2008. The contract on the hydrographic survey in the TSS
was signed in May 2009 but it took more than 6 months to mobilize resources for survey,
including the survey vessel. On 10 February 2010, the survey vessel set sailed from Singapore to
begin its survey.

The Project Coordinator (J. Paw) took over the Project as interim Project Manager following the
resignation of Mr Tcheng and was based in Jakarta from February to July 2010. The Project
Coordinator oversaw the implementation of the hydrographic survey, the training of
hydrographers from the littoral States on the use of ENC production software, the finalization of
the bid document for the development of the MEH, holding of the Third PSC Meeting and
workshop on data feed as well as the restructuring of Project activities.

The period from July 2010 to 31 December 2012 saw the operational phase of the Project where
planned activities were implemented and completed as well as the closure of the Project. A new
Project Manager (Raja Malik Saripulazan, Malaysia) together with an Administrative Assistant
were appointed in November 2010 and both were based in Batam. Prior to the closure of the
PMO, all Project assets were turned over to the Directorate General of Sea Transportation
(DGST), which was the lead implementing agency of the Project. Earlier on 3 August 2013,
IMO’s Secretary-General handed over the MEH System in Batam to the Director General of
DGST in a formal ceremony held at the PMO.

During the development of the PAD and the negotiation period on the grant agreement in 2005
and throughout the implementation period of the Project, the World Bank carried out several
missions to provide assistance on the Bank’s procurement and financial procedures as well as to
monitor, review and assess the progress of the Project. A grace period of 4 months ending on 30
April 2013 was granted to IMO for the financial closure of the Project following its technical
closure on 31 December 2012.

                                               46
IMO was given a grace period of four months from the technical closure of the MEH
Demonstration Project (January to 30 April 2013) for the purpose of administrative closure
(financial). For the last two quarters of the Project from October 2012 to April 2013, the
disbursed fund by World Bank to IMO totaled US$334,510.15 and the final expenditure of the
Project was US$153,496.35. The balance of US$181,013.80 was refunded to the World Bank on
11 June 2013 (duly acknowledged by World Bank Manila Office on 19 June 2013.

With respect to the GEF Trust Fund Grant allocation, the final disbursement status by Category
was as follow:

The total amount disbursed was 73.88% of the total grant. Of the cancelled amount, US$560,000
was unallocated cost as indicated in the Grant Agreement. If this is excluded from the total grant
amount, the disbursement to the Project was 80.45%.

Achievements and Impacts

With the completion of the MEH Demonstration Project in December 2012, it bequeathed the
following:
    1. An operational MEH Data Center in Batam, Indonesia, which was handed over to DGST
        on 3 August 2012 by IMO’s Secretary-General;
    2. all Project assets installed at the Project Management Office in Batam transferred to
        DGST as the beneficiary, including a hydrodynamic-coupled oil spill modelling software
        (DGST) and a suite of ENC Production tools to both Indonesia (DISHIDROS) and
        Malaysia (National Hydrographic Centre); and
    3. Trained IT staff to operate the MEH Data Center in Batam and hydrographers on
        hydrographic survey techniques (all three littoral States).

As the executing agency of the MEH Demonstration Project, IMO has successfully transferred
the responsibility on the continued development and operation of the Batam MEH Data Center
directly to DGST under the guidance of TTEG and the Cooperative Mechanism. As mentioned
previously in this report, an MEH Working Group has been established within the TTEG, which
met intersessionally in July 2013 and organized by IMO and MPA of Singapore.



                                               47
The impacts of the Project are less visible and this will be so until TTEG and the Cooperative
Mechanism will address relevant issues that the MEH Working Group and the littoral States will
present at its forthcoming meeting in Bali, Indonesia in October 2013. In the case of the MEH
Data Center, Malaysia and Singapore have established backup systems which will operate during
downtime of the Batam MEH Data Center ensuring transmitted data are not lost. For Malaysia,
the backup system is also linked to the Marine Department’s database system and is being
accessed by various agencies in Malaysia including the MEH Data.

The Project has successfully produced E-MIOs for the SOMS’ ENCs, mainly static entities like
mangroves and coral reefs using IHO S-100 standards. As a result of this milestone development
by the Project, the East Asian Hydrographic Commission will produced E-MIOs for the South
China in S-100 ENCs as its initial project by early 2014 to be followed by the second project in
the SOMS.

Sustainability

The MEH Demonstration Project was able to develop and establish a pilot MEH System for the
SOMS and the main facility is located in Batam, Indonesia under the management and operation
by the DGST. Back-up systems have been established by Marine Department, Peninsular
Malaysia and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, respectively and accessible via the
Internet. However, the pilot MEH System, although operational, cannot be used for maritime
traffic management in the SOMS until the littoral States technically and legally approve it. The
approval process will depend on several factors, including availability of funds. Firstly, the
Batam MEH must be reconfigured in order to remove all Project-related aspects either as
archived materials or background information. This will require some level of programming with
the endpoint that the system can be mainstreamed into the existing maritime mechanisms in the
SOMS. Apart from reprogramming the Batam MEH, DGST should also endeavor to apply the
system to its maritime activities on an experimental basis to add to its utility as a decision support
system paving the way to its mainstreaming. The hardware and operating modules must be
regularly maintained and upgraded, including Internet connectivity. Apart from developing and
improving the utility of the MEH System, the three littoral States should have regular meetings to
review the progress being made and to address problems that may arise and justify funding
requirements.

Recognizing that further work beyond the Project will be required in order to make the MEH
operational in the three littoral States, the PSC at its fourth meeting and subsequent informal
meetings suggested two options for a regional body to oversee the continued development of the
MEH System. The first option would be under the governance of the TTEG but because TTEG is
more an advisory body, activities geared toward enhancing the capability of the MEH System,
including capacity building cannot be properly addressed. In this case, these activities could be
realized under the second option, which is the Cooperative Mechanism and is also the operational
arm of the TTEG as several of its projects were related to the activities of the MEH
Demonstration Project. At the 5th PSC Meeting in June 2012, the littoral States reported that an
MEH Working Group has been established in TTEG meetings. On the other hand, activities
leading to the regional MEH development and operation will be programmed under the
Cooperative Mechanism for funding and implementation.

In terms of sustainability, there are two aspects that concern the pilot MEH system. At the level
of physical sustainability, DGST must continue to operate even though at pilot scale and interact
closely with Malaysia and Singapore on data feed and exchange. As part of capacity building, the
Project trained selected IT staff from the three littoral States on the operation of the MEH,

                                                 48
including advance training for DGST staff assigned to operate and maintain the system.
Technical support was also provided well up to the closure of the Project on 31 December 2012.
DGST has assigned staff to operate and maintain the Batam MEH Data Center and this should be
a continuous commitment on the part of DGST, in particular, the allocation of national budget for
the Data Center and the staff. During the transition period following Project closure, IMO
extended the Internet subscription for 12 months (up to December 2013) to ensure continuous
operation of the website as well as organized a meeting on 1-2 August 2013 in Singapore to
evaluate the progress of the MEH under the TTEG/CM.

The second aspect on sustainability is institutional and some progress has already been made
during the transition period. This included the backup systems of Malaysia and Singapore as well
as the transfer of responsibility to Indonesia (DGST) and for the continued development of the
MEH System under TTEG/CM. With those arrangements, the potential for funding is significant
(TTEG/CM have at their disposal the following funding sources – Aid to Navigation Trust and
the IMO Malacca and Singapore Straits Trust Fund), particularly to mainstream the system.

The baseline sustainability mechanisms are already in place. It is now up to the relevant agencies
of the three littoral States to work closely together to develop and mainstream the MEH System
so that it will become a decision support system for SOMS maritime traffic management and
other activities.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments from the MEH Working Group under Tripartite Technical Expert
Group

The following comments were given by Dr. Parry Oei (Director of Port Services Division,
Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore).

Can you give a good example of a benefit to the region by the pilot MEH in Batam and the
back-ups in Singapore and Malaysia?
Besides the better and continuous cooperation among the 3 littoral States, the main benefit of the
MEH project is the deliverance of integrated information such as tides, meteorological
information in a common format. And the information can be accessed via the internet by any
user who registers with the MEH project. The common format and feel goes beyond the main
MEH Batam Data Centre and will be similar for the back-ups in Singapore and Malaysia. The
information is freely available for use by anyone who can value add to it, for example, use for
passage planning or under-keel-clearance monitoring.

What are the key results (3 to 4 results)?
1. It is one of the largest scale data integration of shore base station information stations at one of
the world’s busiest waterways.
2. Real time observation and display of weather data along the entire Straits.
3. Production of the first Environmental Marine Information Overlay in the Straits for use by
mariners and other stakeholders.
4. Strong demonstration of the Littoral States i.e. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore’s
Commitment and collaboration to further ensuring navigational safety and protection of the
marine environment in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore (SOMS).
5. The commitment of the 3 Littoral States to the MEH project is further demonstrated by the
permanent absorption of the project into Tripartite Technical Expert Group for SOMS

What are the key lessons learned (3 to 4 answers)?
1. A better understanding of the technologies by more importantly establishment of relationship
between stakeholders and the 3 Littoral States.
2. The potential of new technologies which could make the MEH project more useful e.g.
development of the IHO S-100 data standards which is being developed has lots of potential.
3. THE ECDIS is the key to users and Littoral States sharing information as it provides a common
platform for display.

Quotes (2 to 3): what do you think about the MEH system? What about the MEH Project?
(Note: this will be in the context of your participation in the MEH Project and in the
development of the MEH and its backups).
The MEH Infrastructure is the beginning of a next phase of actualizing the e-Navigation strategy
of IMO. The MEH project is proof that it works and is beneficial to not only Navigational for
Mariners but also the Environmental aspect of the whole shipping ecosystem. There are still
many gaps to fill for the realization of the e-Navigation. The MEH provides the platform for new
technologies to be developed and tested for the safety of navigation in SOMS and around the
world. We belief it is the future and the future is now a reality with MEH.

1. The Co-operative Mechanism is the key platform in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore for
   the littoral States, user states, stakeholders and the industry to dialogue, exchange information
   and share their valuable perspectives on important Straits issues. It was launched at the IMO-
   Singapore Meeting in September 2007 as a result of a series of IMO-sponsored meetings on
   the Straits of Malacca and Singapore under the IMO’s “Protection of Vital Shipping Lanes”
   initiative. This was a significant event for the international maritime community as it realized,
   for the first time, the spirit and intent of Article 431 of the United Nations Law of the Sea
   Convention (UNCLOS).

2. The Co-operative Mechanism consists of three components, namely, the Cooperation
   Forum, the Project Co-ordination Committee and the Aids to Navigation Fund. The
   components of the Co-operative Mechanism are interconnected and complementary. The Co-
   operative Mechanism has been structured to be flexible so as to provide a range of modalities
   or menu of options to users and stakeholders through which they can work with the littoral
   States. Contributions and participation can be in-kind, such as the provision of technical
   expertise and consultancy, or financial in the form of direct monetary contributions. This is
   intended to accommodate the varied interests and circumstances of the contributing parties.

Co-operation Forum

3. The Co-operation Forum is the main avenue for user States, the shipping industry and other
   stakeholders to meet and engage in dialogue with the littoral States of the Straits of Malacca
   and Singapore. The 5th Co-operation Forum will continue constructive discussions on
   possible measures to enhance navigational safety in the Straits, as well as address the issue of
   corporate social responsibility in promoting green and clean shipping. The meeting will also
   examine the synergies between the Marine Electronic Highway (MEH) project and E-
   Navigation, and discuss how to further develop the MEH project beyond its demonstration
   phase.

Project Coordination Committee


                                                52
4. The Project Co-ordination Committee is the body that implements the various projects under
   the Co-operative Mechanism to promote safety of navigation and environmental protection. It
   is a concrete demonstration of co-operation and burden sharing between the littoral States and
   user States, the shipping industry and other stakeholders. Through the Project Co-ordination
   Committee, user States, the shipping industry and other stakeholders can contribute either by
   financing a project that has been identified and agreed upon, or a component therein, or by
   providing in kind resources such as technical assistance and equipment to specific aspects of
