in accordance with the provisions of Part B.2 of this Schedule if, at any time, the Bank 
shall have notified the Recipient of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of 
the Recipient to make withdrawals from the GEF Trust Fund Grant Account pursuant to

the Special Account may be made and what procedures should be followed for making 
such deposits, and shall notify the Recipient of its determination. 
 
6.

Account was made for an expenditure which is not an Eligible Expenditure, or was not 
justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice 
from the Bank, provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request, or deposit into 
the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal

by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Recipient has provided such
