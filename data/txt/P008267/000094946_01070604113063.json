Sustainability of\n            the project is likely. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances were adjudged to be satisfactory. Several\n            lessons learned from this project include the following:\n            Good projects are usually the result of adequate\n            coordination of the work with good counterparts. Road\n            administration should keep in mind that planning for the use\n            of resources should be based on an economic analysis which\n            justifies the optimal choice for improving road sections;\n            contracting on a competitive basis increases procurement\n            transparency, decreases cost, and improves efficiency and\n            quality; careful supervision including timely payments, are\n            essential; and expropriations and final designs should be\n            ready for bidding well before starting related works. Full\n            development of agricultural areas depends on the existence\n            of a good rural road network and access to the main road\n            network. Domestic contractors and consultants benefit from\n            IDA projects. Application of a labor-intensive method has\n            social and economic benefits in creating employment and\n            alleviating poverty. Local government should be responsible\n            for the rural road network. Bureaucratic procedures delay payments."}, "docdt": "2001-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
