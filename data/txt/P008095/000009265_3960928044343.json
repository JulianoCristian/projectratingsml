policy that are key to growth.\n            The program aims at raising the efficiency of public sector\n            management, removing the allocative inefficiencies produced\n            by the prevailing restrictive trade regime, and providing\n            the social underpinnings for the sustainability of the\n            adjustment process. Specifically, the loan will support a\n            reform program encompassing: (a) public sector resource\n            mobilization and allocation which includes state enterprise\n            restructuring and divestiture, efficiency improvements and\n            tariff increases in the public utilities, and strengthening\n            the management of public sector investment; (b) improving\n            the incentive framework, particularly the trade regime and\n            investment incentives; and (c) strengthening the\n            Government's social sector policies and programs,\n            including ameliorating the social impact of the adjustment\n            and maintaining an adequate social safety net."}, "docdt": "1989-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
