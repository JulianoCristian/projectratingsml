There are three project\n            components. 1) The crisis relief program will provide\n            scholarships to the poor and special assistance funds to\n            schools serving poor communities. 2) Institutional reform\n            will enable districts, subdistricts, and schools to plan\n            education activities within their district, manage the\n            education program between the different agencies, use\n            appropriate techniques for planning and implementation,\n            assign staff according to needs, and carry out targeted\n            activities.
