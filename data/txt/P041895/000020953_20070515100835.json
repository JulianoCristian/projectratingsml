This\n            includes: setting training objectives; ability to\n            identify/obtain good training material and trainers; and\n            developing post-training activities; 5) Systematic\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is critical to the\n            success of a project with widely dispersed project\n            activities and sites; 6) School Mapping can be an excellent\n            technique to support education planning, but there should be\n            a pre-commitment to update the 'map' each year -\n            thereby overcoming the potential static nature of the\n            process; 7) The establishment of a strongly staffed, and\n            well managed central project implementation unit (CPIU) must\n            be considered a key contributing factor to the successful\n            implementation of any project with widely disbursed\n            operations; 8) When a project has widely disbursed project\n            sites, local administrators, coordinators and teachers\n            should be more fully briefed regarding the advantages of\n            participating in the project as well as their\n            responsibilities; and 9) When technical consultants (i.e.,\n            architects, structural engineers, electrical engineers,\n            M&E specialists, and quantity surveyors) are selected\n            and contracted as individuals, rather than as teams\n            (organizations), by the Borrower, there is a strong\n            possibility that they may not form a cohesive working unit\n            so necessary in large projects."}, "docdt": "2007-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
