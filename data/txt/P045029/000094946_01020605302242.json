World Bank\n            performance in project identification, preparation, and\n            appraisal was generally satisfactory, and supervision\n            missions were welcomed by government as a means of assisting\n            in the resolution of more difficult issues firsthand in the\n            field. Overall Borrower performance was considered\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned included the following:\n            Local governments were willing and able to respond\n            positively to performance incentives although accountability\n            was still weak in some areas. Strong donor coordination had\n            direct benefits for project implementation. Private sector\n            involvement needed to be recognized and strengthened. State\n            lands in growth points in the rural district council (RDC)\n            areas of the country were an underutilized resource. RDC\n            planning and budgeting could and should have been linked to\n            explicit poverty reduction."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
