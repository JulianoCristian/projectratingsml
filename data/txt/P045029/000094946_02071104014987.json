The performance of both\n            projects was strongly affected by Zimbabwe's historic\n            distortions of spatial segregation along racial lines in\n            both urban and rural areas, and the government's\n            fast-tracked land reform efforts designed to deal with them.\n            A sudden shift of borrower policy can undermine the project\n            results. Some OED lessons with these projects include: a) A\n            one-size-fits-all approach to urban project design should\n            give way to a design firmly anchored to the particular\n            conditions of a borrower's cities and urban\n            development. b) Project objective statements should clearly\n            signal intended development results."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
