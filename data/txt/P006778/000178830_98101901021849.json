output at competitive costs. One\n            of the main project components involves research\n            infrastructural development for about two veterinary\n            laboratories, 15 existing research centers and stations as\n            well as a new one to be established. For this component, the\n            loan will provide: (i) civil works and land preparation on\n            research stations; (ii) scientific instruments, laboratory\n            equipment, vehicles, farm equipment along with laboratory\n            and office furniture; (iii) library and documentation\n            services as well as computing facilities. In addition, other\n            project components include; (b) technical assistance\n            including training; and (c) incremental operating costs for\n            salaries and equipment."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
