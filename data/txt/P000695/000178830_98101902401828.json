     production of basic consumer goods in short supply. The\n            project will provide part of AIDB's resource\n            requirements for the two year period from July 1982 to June\n            1984 for lending to small-, medium- and large-scale\n            industrial enterprises, and include an experimental pilot\n            program to help small-scale contractors finance their fixed\n            investment requirements. In addition, the project will\n            strengthen AIDB and other sector institutions, and promote\n            improved sector planning and project preparation by\n            providing funds for training and technical assistance. The\n            project's employment benefits will be considerable. It\n            is estimated that about 960 jobs will be created in medium-\n            and large-scale industrial enterprises and ll00 jobs in\n            small-scale industries."}, "docdt": "1982-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
