MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Ethiopia - Agricultural and
Industrial Development Bank Project (AIDB) (Credit 1275-ET)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Ethiopia - Agricultural
and Industrial Development Bank Project (AIDB) (Credit 1275-ET)" prepared by the Africa Regional
Office. No contribution has been received from the Borrower.
The project outcome has been affected by adverse macroeconomic conditions, political
instability, government interference in decision-making, and an intermediary plagued by institutional,
operational, and portfolio problems.
The PCR does not dwell on the severity of AIDB's financial condition, magnitude of non-
performing assets and arrears, restructuring requirements or the dubious merit of many subprojects,
especially large industrial schemes launched by parastatals; 70% of the medium-large subprojects
financed and over half of the small scale industry subprojects experienced low capacity utilization and
debt servicing problems.
The project is rated as unsatisfactory. Institutional development is rated as negligible, while
sustainability is rated as uncertain.
Since an audit is not likely to enhance understanding of project outcomes, the operation will not
be audited.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ETHIOPIA
AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK
(CREDIT 1275-ET)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Agricultural and Industrial Development
Bank Project in Ethiopia for which credit in the amount of SDR 27.0 million (US$30 million) was
signed on August 27, 1982 and became effective on November 29, 1982. The project was due to close
in June 1989, however, after three extensions, it was finally closed on December 31, 1991.
This report constitutes Parts I and III of the PCR. It was prepared by the Industry and Energy
Division, Eastern Africa Department of the Africa Region (AF2IE). The PCR is based on information
from the Staff Appraisal Report, the President's Report, supervision reports, correspondence between
the Bank and the Borrower and Beneficiaries, internal Bank documents, and interviews with Bank staff
involved in the preparation and implementation of the Project.
The Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) in Addis Ababa is preparing Part II
of the PCR, but to date nothing has been received.

(CREDIT 1275-ET)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Project Obiectives: Designed as a "traditional" IDA Development Finance Corporation
(DFC) operation, the project had two main objectives: (i) to strengthen the capabilities of the only
development finance institution in Ethiopia (the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank -
AIDB) involved in agricultural and industrial development; and (ii) to assist the Government's efforts
in expanding the capacity of the manufacturing sector by financing industrial investment and technical
assistance. An additional project objective was for AIDB to provide assistance to small contractors
in financing their equipment requirements.
2.    Implementation Experienc: The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was completed on May 3,
1982 and Credit and Project Agreements signed on August 27, 1982. The Credit became effective
on November 29, 1982 with no delay.
3.    Weaknesses in AIDB's financial structure, contributed to largely by its agricultural portfolio,
continued as an obstacle to successful strengthening the bank through the course of the project. The
bank's Industrial Department was strengthened under the project resulting in an enhancement in
project appraisal capabilities. However, project implementation/supervision continued to be weak.
4.    An over-estimation in demand during appraisal and some project design constraints may have
contributed to the slow movement in credit disbursement for medium and large enterprises.
According to AIDB sources, the credit ceiling of US$4 million to a single entity limited the rate of
disbursement; this ceiling was subsequently removed. On the other hand, the credit demand from
small industries and small contractors was extremely strong.
5.    Initial delays in assembling and appraising medium and large scale projects were partly offset
by the improved performance of AIDB staff in the following years, largely due to managerial efforts
and technical assistance and training financed by the project. However, the original closing date of
June 1989 was extended first to June 30, 1990, then to June 1991 and finally to December 31, 1991.
Political instability, and related administrative difficulties in late eighties, added to project
implementation delays in the latter years.
6.    Project Results: On the whole, the Project was reasonably successful in achieving its
objectives. It achieved the effective transfer of financial resources and technical expertise to Ethiopia
which in turn permitted a considerable expansion and modernization of the country's manufac-
turing/productive sector capacity. Although the credit component for small-scale enterprises was
relatively small, it stimulated a considerable amount of entrepreneurial interest in the productive
sector.

7.     Central among the 'indirect' benefits achieved by the project was the transfer of the risk
associated with the State Farm portfolio from AIDB to the Government. This was brought about by
pressure from IDA supervision missions. Support provided by supervision missions and enhanced
staff capabilities have contributed to the current dialogue within the Government to increase AIDB's
managerial and financial autonomy.
8.     The fragility in AIDB's financial condition persisted through the life of the project and
continues at the present time. The removal of the State Farm portfolio (for purposes of risk
assessment) in 1988 brought AIDB's long-term debt to equity ratio below 4:1. This ratio could not
be sustained owing to the general weakness of Ethiopia's financial sector and AIDB's lack of
managerial and financial autonomy.
9.     Project Sustainabilitv: The sustained operations of the industrial enterprises supported by
the line of credit has been difficult and sporadic however, indications are that their impact has been
positive. The enterprises were (and continue to be) severely constrained by the country's extreme
dependence on imported raw materials and the shortage of foreign exchange. The project successfully
provided for capacity expansion but the working capital (particularly the foreign component) was not
forthcoming. As a result, several of the enterprises financed are operating at low capacity utilization
rates and are having difficulty in servicing their debts. The enterprises are considered economically
viable and it should be possible to revitalize them once the country's foreign exchange constraint is
removed or alleviated.
10.   AIDB's staff skills and overall institutional capabilities have been improved considerably
under the project and will contribute to future industrial development efforts.
11.    Lessons Learned: At the project level, the key lesson learnt is the need to address longer-
term foreign exchange requirements, and situational constraints, in industrial modernization and
capacity expansion projects. This is particularly true for import-substitution oriented industries but
also applies wherever balance of payment difficulties exist.
12.    On the policy and institutional levels, improvements in the performance of Government-
owned institutions is not sustainable if the "enabling environment" declines or collapses (as it did in
Ethiopia); particularly adverse were Government interferences in AIDB management and operations.
A constituency for transparent and legally appropriate relationships between Government and
Government-owned corporations has to be in place to permit operational autonomy. When the Bank
fully appreciated the extent of these issues it rightly sought ways to raise them with the Government
as a part of its sectoral policy dialogue.

2- BACKGROUND
Country Background
2.01   After the revolution in 1974, Ethiopia was ruled by a Military Administrative Council. The
new Government's general objectives emphasized raising the living standards of the population. With
an annual per-capita GNP of about US$140 in 1980, Ethiopia was one of the most underdeveloped
countries in the world. At the time of project appraisal, population below absolute poverty income
level was estimated at 60% in urban centers and 65% in rural areas. A number of specific reforms
were introduced to raise living conditions of the population: one of the most relevant was the 1975
land reform, under which all rural land was made the "collective property of the Ethiopian people".
Former commercial farms were either handed over to peasants for individual or collective cultivation,
or retained as state farms. In the urban sector, ownership of houses was restricted to one per family,
with extra houses nationalized.
2.02   Most large enterprises in the modem sector were also nationalized during 1975, and subjected
to centralized policy guidance and investment approval. Under legislation introduced in 1979, a large
part of public enterprise profits were also allocated centrally. The private sector retained a role in
the Ethiopian economy, mainly in construction, small scale manufacturing, trade, and peasant
agriculture.
2.03   From 1974 to 1978, GDP grew at less than 0.5% per annum in real terms, reflecting security
problems and the uncertainties and difficulties which accompanied the economic reforms. Export
earnings were maintained in the coffee sector, but declined in other sectors, while imports increased
sharply at a rate of 21 % per annum. In the industrial sector,
the closure of factories in Eritrea, which previously accounted for about one-third of industrial
production, and increasing shortages of raw materials, spare parts and industrial machinery drastically
reduced output.
2.04   During this period, the role of the central Government and of the public sector increased
significantly. Central Government expenditure reached 22% of GDP in 1977/1978, from about 12%



-2-
of GDP in the early seventies. The Government was forced to increase its reliance on domestic
borrowing. In addition, a large part of the increase in bank credit to the non-central Government
sector was accounted for by public enterprises (particularly the state farms).
2.05   Against this increasingly difficult scenario, in September 1978 the Government started a series
of "economic campaigns" to revitalize the economy. Specific priority was assigned to the productive
sectors. An economic revival was experienced in the late seventies, with a real average GDP growth
of 5.4% per annum between 1977/78 and 1979/1980. Main causes were the improvement in the
security situation, which permitted a reallocation of resources to productive sectors, the re-functioning
of several industries in Eritrea, good production levels in grain-producing areas, and a recovery in
coffee export earnings. Furthermore, the Government imposed more stringent discipline in the
management of public sector enterprises, whose real output grew by about 35% during the first
economic campaign (1978) and by about 14% during the second (1979/80). Among the substantial
number of programs and projects the Government launched since 1974, increasing emphasis was
given in the manufacturing sector to expand small-scale, cottage and handicraft industries, and to
increase the production of mass consumer goods.
The Manufacturing Sector
2.06 Medium and Large Scale Enterprises. In 1979/80, medium and large-scale manufacturing
accounted for about 5% of GDP, 2% of export earnings and less than 1% of total employment in
Ethiopia. This subsector comprised about 140 public enterprises, grouped into fourteen holding
corporations under the Ministry of Industry. These public enterprises accounted for about 90% of
value added and 80% of the sector's employment. Food processing, textiles and beverages were the
largest sub-sectors and contributed about 32%, 20% and 19% respectively of the sector's value
added. In contrast to most countries where public enterprises have been a significant drain on the
budget, in Ethiopia these public enterprises have been a net contributor to Government revenues,
through profit taxes, a 5% annual charge on government equity capital, and the remittance to the
Government of all profit surpluses exceeding the accumulation of reserves in the amount of 30% of
the capital.
2.07   While public enterprises were legally autonomous entities, they did not have Boards of
Directors and for all purposes were directly managed by the Ministry of Industry, which appointed
the company management and directed operational and investment programs. Besides operational
difficulties produced by such limitations in autonomy, public enterprises faced substantial constraints
in terms of skilled manpower and foreign exchange availability.
2.08   Small-Scale Manufacturing Sector. In 1980, this sector was estimated to account for about
6.5 % of GDP and about 3 % employment of Ethiopia's labor force (about 400,000 persons). Of this,
handicraft enterprises accounted for about 85% of employment and two-thirds of value added to GDP.
The sector produced mainly basic consumer goods (particularly flour, clothes, furniture, cooking
utensils, etc.), relying mainly on domestic raw materials and contributing negligibly to exports.
Small-scale enterprises were predominantly privately owned, by sole proprietorship, partnerships or
cooperatives.
2.09   The Construction Sector. In 1980, the construction sector contributed to about 4% of GDP.
Of this, 30% was produced by the informal sector. In the formal sector, which included eight large
contractors and some 160 small-scale contractors, construction activities related mainly to buildings
and housing (60% of the total) and roads (25%). The construction work was almost equally divided



- 3 -
between private contractors and government enterprises. The Government, while strengthening its
own construction agencies to support its economic campaigns, did not have specific policies with
respect to limiting the role of private contractors, in view of the large demand for construction work.
However, small-scale contractors were constrained by a number of factors, including access to credit,
difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled manpower, and shortage of building materials.
2.10   As previously mentioned, since the late seventies, the Government strongly promoting the
development of the manufacturing sector, which was mostly publicly owned. In the medium and
large-scale sector, manpower problems were addressed through increased technical training and
expanded use of expatriate expertise. To the extent possible, foreign exchange was made available
to import needed raw materials and industrial equipment. However, capacity constraints and shortage
of investment for expansion/rehabilitation continued to represent a key limitation against improving
public enterprise performance.  To promote the development of Small-Scale enterprises, the
Government established the Handicraft and Small Industries Development Agency (HASIDA), to
assist in preparing projects, provide technical assistance and promote artisanal cooperatives. In
addition, at the time of project appraisal, the Government was preparing a policy proposal to support
the development of the small-scale private sector by relaxing restrictions on private ownership and
allowing preferential treatment of SSIs with regard to taxes, interest rates, procurement, and raw
material allocation.
The Financial Sector -and AIDB
2.11   A key constraint to the development of the manufacturing sector was the shortage of available
credit. Following a rationalization of Ethiopia's development banking institutions, the Agricultural
and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) was established in November 1970 as a wholly-government-
owned institution by the merger of two development institutions, the Development Bank of Ethiopia
(EDB) and the Ethiopian Investment Corporation. It was re-established as a public corporation under
a 1979 proclamation. After the 1975 nationalizations and subsequent restructuring in 1976, in
addition to AIDB the financial sector included four institutions: (i) The National Bank of Ethiopia
(NBE) - the central bank; (ii) The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) - the only commercial bank;
(iii) The Housing and Savings Bank (HSB) - the one home mortgage institution; and (iv) The
Ethiopian Insurance Corporation (EIC) - the only insurance firm.
2.12   Banking in Ethiopia was highly regulated. NBE coordinated all banking activities in Ethiopia,
and issued guidelines on credit and foreign exchange allocation and interest rate levels. NBE also
established guidelines for the allocation of credit on an annual basis. In 1982, for instance, the public
sector was eligible to receive 70% of the total, the private sector 28% and cooperatives 2%.
Allocations by economic sector were set at 44% for agriculture, 37% for services, 11 % for industry
and 8% for housing. Market forces were essentially not considered by the Government as a factor
in resource mobilization and allocation. Therefore, availability of banking facilities was considered
more important than lending policies to attract private borrowers.
2.13   AIDB was the only financial institution in Ethiopia to promote agricultural and industrial
development through short, medium and long-term loans. The bank functions with a low level of
autonomy, with the NBE (and the NBE Board) having supervising authority over AIDB. AIDB's
General Manager can approve loans under Birr 3 million for medium and large enterprises and under
Birr 0.5 million for small-scale enterprises. Loans in excess of these amounts need NBE approval.
AIDB was headed by a competent General Manager and organized in four main departments -
Agricultural, Industrial, Finance and Banking, and Controllers - and five support units - Legal,



- 4 -
Research and Planning, Engineering, Public Relations, and Administration. AIDB had eight branches
outside Addis Ababa and a staff of about 100 professionals. Although the AIDB's statutes comprised
a mandate also in the areas of equity investment, government fund management and promotion of
projects, the bank's role was de-facto limited to providing loans and managing various funds. The
World Bank Group has had extensive experience with development banks in Ethiopia and, during
appraisal, the structure of AIDB was considered by IDA to be appropriate for its role. AIDB
performance and capacity were also considered broadly acceptable, however areas of needed
improvements were identified, mainly to: (i) reduce AIDB's exposure to financial and investment
risks; (ii) develop suitable guidelines for project appraisal; (iii) establish suitable procedures to
expedite loan processing; and (iv) strengthen its operational capabilities in several professional areas
and particularly the Industrial Department by acquiring improved engineering expertise.
IDA Assistance to AIDB
2.14   The 1970 merger of the Development Bank of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Investment
Corporation into the newly-formed AIDB was suggested by IDA, which also assisted the Government
to implement the merging process. In 1972, a US$11.0 million Credit (No.304-ET) was provided
through AIDB to finance agricultural and industrial projects, complementing parallel assistance to the
manufacturing sector by IFC which, between 1965 and 1970, provided equity investments and loans
to the textile, paper and sugar sub-sectors. This IDA Credit was fully disbursed in April 1977 and
substantially met its objectives. The new credit (1275-ET) was therefore conceived in a perspective
of long term assistance to AIDB to support rehabilitation and expansion of the manufacturing sector,
enhance private sector participation and continue strengthening AIDB as a development finance
company (DFC).
3 - PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
Project Objectives
3.01   The project was overall a "traditional" DFC operation. It had two main objectives: first,
to strengthen AIDB to fulfill its role as the only development finance institution in Ethiopia lending
for agricultural and industrial development. The second objective was to assist the Government, by
financing industrial investment and technical assistance, in its efforts to expand the capacity of the
manufacturing sector to satisfy the demand for basic consumer goods. In addition to these objectives,
the project was to assist AIDB, on an experimental basis, in financing small contractors.
Project Description
3.02   The Project credit of SDR 27.0 million (US$30.0 million equivalent) was comprised of the
following five components:
(i)    A US$25.0 million line of credit to AIDB to cover part of its foreign resource needs for
lending to medium and large scale industrial enterprises. The investments to be financed under this
component were for rehabilitation and expansion of existing enterprises, and also for new projects
with strong links to existing operations. To ensure that AIDB did not lend to only a few large
projects, the ceiling for a single loan was originally set at US$4 million equivalent. Minimum
lending was established at US$250,000 equivalent.

(ii)    A US$2.0 million line of credit to AIDB to cover part of its needs for lending to small scale
industrial enterprises. The ceiling for a single loan was set at US$250,000 equivalent.
(iii)    A US$1.0 million line of credit to AIDB to launch an experimental scheme for financing the
equipment requirements of small scale contractors. The ceiling for a single loan was set at
US$150,000 equivalent.
(iv)    A US$500,000 grant training fund to help AIDB and other public sector institutions involved
in the industrial sector to upgrade the quality of their professional staff in project development,
project management and accounting.
(v)    A US$1.5 million grant component for technical assistance and consulting services to help
alleviate the critical shortage of manpower for sectoral studies, sector planning, feasibility studies and
enterprise management and operation.
Project Organizational Arrangements
3.03   AIDB was responsible for implementing all components of the project, particularly evaluating
sub-projects for financing. Small scale borrowers could receive technical assistance from Handicrafts
and Small Industries Development Agency (HASIDA), in line with existing cooperation arrangements
between AIDB and HASIDA. A full-time project officer was appointed by AIDB to coordinate the
training and technical assistance components. The training component was mainly designed for short
term skill upgrading for AIDB staff.
3.04  IDA was responsible for final approval of all credit to medium and large-scale enterprises,
support to small contractors during the initial phase of the project, studies, technical assistance and
training programs. IDA approval was not required for AIDB credit to small scale enterprises.
Project's Contribution to Institutional Development
3.05   The Project was expected to significantly contribute to the institutional development of AIDB
through a number of improvements to AIDB structure, including (i) improvements in the functioning
of AIDB management; (ii) the creation of a "Mini Board" to closely monitor project implementation;
and (iii) the establishment of a Technical Services Department and of a Training division. Attention
was paid to strengthening the AIDB staff through recruitment of additional qualified professionals,
particularly in the Industry Department.
4 - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.01   The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was completed on May 3, 1982 and Credit and Project
Agreements signed on August 27, 1982. The Credit became effective on November 29, 1982 with
no delay.
4.02   During the first IDA supervision mission in March 1983, three outstanding issues were
highlighted: (i) the need to strengthen AIDB's financial condition, (ii) the lengthy time required for
appraising projects, particularly in the medium and large-scale industrial sector, and (iii) the need for
all loan agreements with public enterprises to specify the seniority of debt servicing over residual
surplus payments to the Treasury, in the appropriation of their profits (para.2.06). While issues (ii)



- 6 -
and (iii) were eventually resolved, the financial condition of AIDB remained weak through the
project's life and was the single most negative element affecting project performance (see section 8).
4.03   Initially AIDB experienced difficulties in the area of project assessment: AIDB staff were
not familiar with the appraisal of large-size rehabilitation/restructuring projects, which were
technically more complex than appraising new projects. Similar difficulties were experienced at the
Ministry of Industry, where technical proposals were expected to be formulated .There were also
problems with the quality of the proposals, which frequently were not presented in a bankable format.
Movement in the pipeline for medium-large scale projects remained sluggish and may have been
overestimated at appraisal. In May 1984, seventeen months after Credit effectiveness, only 18% of
the medium-large scale industries component was committed, with few prospects for additional
proposals, except five potential projects for which studies were launched (asbestos, metal tools,
cigarette, tannery and oil mill/soap). Pressure was put by IDA on AIDB and the Ministry of
Industry, to finalize a suitable pipeline before the expiration date for sub-project commitment, which
was originally set at June 30, 1985. AIDB contended that the single-project ceiling of US$4 million
equivalent was a constraint to disbursement in this category; the ceiling was increased to
accommodate projects requiring higher investment.
4.04   On the other hand, the pipelines for small industries and small contractors were significantly
strong. In May 1984, 66% of the component for small scale industries was committed (18 projects),
and the pipeline indicated the need for additional US$1 million financing over the component ceiling
of US$2 million. In the same period, 36% of the US$1 million for small contractors was committed,
and there was a demand in the pipeline for an additional US$1.8 million.
4.05   While slowness in commitment and disbursements continued in 1985, sub-project appraisal
capabilities by AIDB staff gradually improved, thanks to managerial efforts, technical assistance and
effective training. The establishment and functioning of the 'Mini-Board" resulted in improving
commitment and disbursement performance. Initial delays in assembling and appraising medium-
large scale projects were partly offset by the improved performance of AIDB staff in the following
years. However, the original closing date of June 1989 had to be extended to June 30, 1990, then
to June 1991 and finally to December 31, 1991. The aggravation of the political situation, and
related administrative difficulties in late eighties, also contributed to some project delays in the final
period of project implementation.
5 - PROCUREMENT
5.01   Procurement was in accordance with established AIDB procedures,which were reviewed and
approved by IDA. Procurement was in general satisfactory and did not represent an issue during
project implementation.
6 - DISBURSEMENT
6.01   The proceeds of the Credit to be used for medium and large scale enterprises were to finance
100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported goods; 80% of the total cost of previously imported
goods and 60% of the total cost of civil works. The proceeds of the Credit for the other components
would finance 100% of the total cost of goods and services. On May 3, 1984, of the US$25 million
allocated for medium and large enterprises (or 83.3% of total Credit), only $4.46 million were



committed. For Small Scale industries, of the US$2.0 million in the component, $1.33 million was
committed to 18 industries. For Small Scale Contractors, $0.36 million, of a budgeted US$1 million,
were committed.
6.02   Disbursements were expected to be completed by June 1989. However, as of September 28,
1988, US$12.1 million, or only 40% of the total Credit, had been disbursed, compared to US$25.3
million (or 84.3% of total credit) estimated in the SAR. On May 10, 1990 the credit to small scale
industrial enterprises was fully disbursed, but delays still persisted in completing the disbursement
for two medium-large scale industrial projects (exercise books and Ambo Mineral Water factories).
According to AIDB sources (in May 1992), amounts actually approved for each project had been
fully disbursed. There is, however, an outstanding balance of about SDR 1 million (in AIDB's favor)
created by exchange rate fluctuations.
7 - TRAINING
7.01   On June 3, 1983 AIDB presented a detailed training program to IDA for approval. The
program was designed and implemented effectively, and was substantially completed by the end of
1985. Key areas of training were accounting, finance and project analysis. The largest part of
trainees was sent for short term courses in U.K.
8 - AIDB FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CONDITIONS
8.01   The fragility of AIDB's financial position was accurately detected at the time of Project
Appraisal. Since 1976, AIDB's profitability declined as a result of a growth in arrears that
accompanied the rapid increase in the level of its operations. The state farm portion of the
agriculture portfolio was very weak, suggesting that the arrears problems were indications of
fundamental operating and financial problems in the state farm sector. AIDB had only limited
responsibility for poor performance in this area as loans to state farm enterprises were extended upon
instructions from the Government.
8.02   The situation of the industrial portfolio was weak as well, with all the loans inherited from
EIC in arrears by more than twelve month at the time of project appraisal. In addition, about 12%
of the principal of the new loans was in arrears. About 6.5%, or US$3.3 million equivalent, of the
principal of AIDB loans in other sectors was also in arrears, and the proportion of affected loans was
43%. A plan to improve AIDB financial condition was discussed and agreed upon with IDA. The
plan included the rescheduling of loans, recovery of outstanding credit, writing off some bad loans,
etc. The objective was, inter-alia, to lower the long-term debt-equity ratio from 7.7/1 to an agreed
4/1.
8.03   However, the poor conditions of the AIDB portfolio (particularly the credit to the agricultural
sector which comprises some 80% of all lending) could not be reversed through sustainable
improvements during the life of the project. Because of large provisions necessitated by doubtful
investments and potential losses, AIDB incurred losses which gradually eroded its paid-in capital from
Birr 100 million to Birr 83 million as of December 1983.
8.04   The need to expeditiously address the portfolio problems was constantly felt by AIDB
management and stressed by all IDA supervision missions. In January 1984 IDA suggested the



-8 -
writing-off, with possible Government compensation, of certain bad loans which included old
agricultural loans (Birr 20.5 million), loans to inactive coops (Birr 4.6 million), AIMS (Birr 15.2
million), old industrial loans (Birr 11.5 million), loans to private enterprises (Birr 0.6 million), and
loans to the National Transport Corporation (NATRACOR), a major defaulter experiencing financial
difficulties.
8.05   An Action Program to strengthen AIDB's financial condition was requested by IDA during
the Bank/Fund annual meeting in September 1984. However agreed remedial actions were difficult
to implement, mainly because general difficulties in state finances made it difficult absorb some of
AIDB's bad loans to the public sector. Some remedial measures were taken (writing-off of some
loans, transfer to the Government of foreign exchange risk for some hard currency borrowing, etc.)
the situation did not improve significantly. Between June 1987 and June 1988, arrears in the non-
state farm portfolio increased by 119% and, at the Government's request, AIDB exceeded its lending
exposure (debt/equity) limit of 20%. The IDA supervision mission in September 1988 reported that
AIDB's condition continued to be aggravated by further deterioration in its non-state farm loan
portfolio, ineffective supervision of its investment projects, and inadequate debt collection. After
1988, IDA supervision of the project was sporadic reflecting Ethiopia's difficult security and
economic situation. At the time of project closing, AIDB was still struggling to improve its portfolio
and overall financial condition.
9 - AUDITS
9.01   Shortcomings in the quality of audit reports were detected at the very beginning of project
implementation (for instance the audits for the period ended June 30, 1982 were found to be
unsatisfactory). The situation improved considerably in the following years, and the audit reports
were satisfactory both in term of quality and punctuality by the end of the project.
10 - PROJECT RESULTS
Attainment of Objectives
10.01 On the whole, the Project was reasonably successful in achieving its objectives. It achieved
transfer of financial resources and technical expertise to Ethiopia. In addition to the direct benefits
discussed below, their were considerable indirect benefits. Central among these was the transfer of
the risk associated with the State Farm portfolio from AIDB to the Government (brought about by
pressure from IDA supervision missions) and the current dialogue within the Government to increase
AIDB's autonomy.
10.02 The main project objective of expanding and modernizing the capacity of the manufacturing
sector was achieved. In the medium and large scale industrial subsector, the Credit financed a broad
range of enterprises in areas such as printing, agro-industry, beverages, textiles, exercise books,
industrial gases and tire retreading. In the small industry subsector, the line of credit financed
bakeries, carpentry shops, tailors, shoe factories, furniture, cosmetics, mechanical workshops, etc.
AIDB judged this component to be small (compared with credit demand) but it did stimulate a lot of
entrepreneurial activity. The component to support the construction industry financed about 8 to 10
contractors. In general, these sub-projects were implemented and completed in a timely manner.
Indications are that their impact has been positive. Their sustained operation, both from production



-9-
and financial points of view, has been difficult and sporadic. The enterprises were (and continue to
be) severely constrained by the country's extreme dependence on imported raw materials and the
shortage of foreign exchange. The project successfully provided for capacity expansion but the
working capital (particularly the foreign component) was not forthcoming. As a result, several of
the enterprises financed are operating at low capacity utilization rates and are in default on their loans
from AIDB.
10.03 On the institutional side, AIDB project appraisal capacity was improved considerably through
the training and technical assistance provided by the project. The "Mini-Board" created within NBE
to approve loans under the project functioned well. The Industrial Department was strengthened by
hiring 8 additional qualified and experienced bank officers.  AIDB project supervision and
implementation remained weak through the project. The Implementation Section has recently (1992)
been upgraded into a Department and is being strengthened.
10.04 The fragility in AIDB's financial condition persisted through the life of the project and
continues at the present time. The transfer to the central Government of the risk associated with the
State Farm portfolio in 1988 brought AIDB's long-term debt to equity ratio below 4:1 targeted at the
time of appraisal. This ratio could not be sustained and prevented AIDB from strengthening its role
as the main lending institution to productive sectors. Lack of managerial and financial autonomy,
and the general weakness of Ethiopia's financial sector, contributed to AIDB's inability to consolidate
its financial condition on a sustainable basis.
11 - BANK PERFORMANCE
11.01 The Bank performance was satisfactory. The Supervision Teams performed in a professional,
responsive and dedicated manner. They were particularly effective in assisting the AIDB in the
evaluation of sub-project proposals, a time-consuming exercise which contributed greatly to the
project's overall success. Assistance was provided with continuity and in a detailed and timely
manner. Political instability in the last two years of project implementation resulted in a decline in
supervision intensity.
11.02 Regarding the dialogue on financial sector issues, the Bank had to wait until 1988 for its
periodic remonstrations (under this and other parallel projects) to lead to in-depth sector work aimed
at reforming the financial sector.
12 - BORROWER PERFORMANCE
12.01 The AIDB, particularly its Industrial Department, performed remarkably well in improving
its internal capabilities in sub-project assessment and monitoring. It undertook significant changes
to its structure, which improved its operational efficiency. Staff training was undertaken in a timely
manner and effective internal training programs were instituted resulting in enhanced staff
performance from an early stage of project implementation.
12.02 The AIDB management was however, and understandably, unable to undertake the massive
financial restructuring that was needed. Key issues in this area exceeded AIDB statutes and capacity
of intervention. The fundamental issues had more to do with sectoral policy and could not be tackled
at the project level.



- 10-
13 - LESSONS LEARNED
13.01 At the project level, the key lesson learnt is the need to address longer-term, working capital
requirements for foreign exchange in projects aimed at expanding manufacturing capacity. This is
particularly true for import-substitution oriented industries but also applies wherever balance of
payment difficulties exist.
13.02 On the policy and institutional levels, improvements in the performance of Government-
owned institutions is not sustainable if the "enabling environment" declines or collapses (as it did in
Ethiopia); particularly adverse were Government interferences in AIDB management and operations.
A constituency for transparent and legally appropriate relationships between Government and
Government-owned corporations has to be in place to permit operational autonomy. When the Bank
fully appreciated the extent of these issues it rightly sought ways to raise them with the Government
as a part of its sectoral policy dialogue.
