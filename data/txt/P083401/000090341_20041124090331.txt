A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Country andsector issues

The social, humancapital andincomeindicators inMalawi are amongthe poorest inthe world,
with aper capita GDPofUS$170 and about 55 percent ofthe populationlivingbelow the
national poverty line. Despite averageper capita GDP growthrates of 3.7% between 1990-2001,
Malawi still ranks 163rdofthe 173 countries included inthe HumanDevelopment Index (UNDP
2001).

Poor health indicators but someprogress: The health status indicators inMalawi havebeen
viewed as extremely poor, particularly giventhe apparenthigher levels ofhealthexpendituresin
Malawi compared to its neighboring countries. Butthe picture is, infact, morenuanced. Life
expectancyhasinthe past few years declined to 39 years, mainly as a result ofthe impact ofthe
HIV/AIDSepidemic. Itis estimated that 49% ofchildren underthe age offive years maybe
clinicallymalnourished or stunted(NSO, 2001), primarily due to the recent droughts inthe
country. Infantmortality andchildmortality remainhighat 104and 189per 1000 livebirths,
respectively, while the matemal mortalityrate has been estimated at 1120deaths per 100,000
livebirths (2000). Onthe other hand, Malawihas donewell inimprovingthe overall coverage
andthe deliveryof some keyhealth services, such as child immunization, Directly-Observed
Treatment (DOTS) for tuberculosis, andinsecticide treatedbed-nets(ITNs) for malaria.
Malawi's health indicators are now broadlycomparable to its neighbors, with a high
concentrationo fmorbidity andmortality inthe 1-5 year age group for which workable technical
solutions, preventive andlor curative, are available.

Systemicproblems: Achieving the healthMillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) remains a
major challenge for Malawi, particularlygiven the poor macroeconomic environment with
increasinglevels ofpoverty, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, andthe critical shortage o fhuman
resourcesinthe health sector (vacancies inestablishedgovernment posts are up to 50% at some
govemment, religious missionandNGO-runinstitutions). The difficulty inachieving the MDG
goals i s compoundedbythe highrates o f fertility andunder-nutrition, poor supply and access to
pharmaceuticals, andthe fragmented health care delivery system. Access to health services
remains modest with only 54% o fthe ruralpopulation (compared to the richer urbanpopulation,
which has 84% access) havingaccess to formal health services within a 5-kilometer radius,
significant regional variations, only 10%ofthe health care facilities having the services and staff
necessaryto deliver the EssentialHealthPackage(Em), andpoor client perceptions ofthe
public health care delivery systems. Paradoxically, the use ofhealthservices deliveredbythe
public andnon-profit private sector remains high.

A keychallenge for the Ministryo fHealth(MOH), therefore, is to strengthen the performance of
the district health systems andto develop integratedhealthprograms to deliver the EHP,
particularly giventhe government's intentionof decentralizing the provisionofpublic services.
At the same time, the stewardship capacity at the central levelneeds to be enhancedso that the
M O Hcan reliably formulate andreview policies, coordinate implementation andprovidesupport
to the district health management teams. Despite these manychallenges, however, the successes




                                                 7

noted above suggest that Malawihasthe potential, with appropriate financial andtechnical
support from its intemational partners, to makeprogresstowards attaining the MDGs.

Significant client commitment: In1995, the Government ofMalawi(GOM), supportedby its
partners, initiated a MediumTerm HealthExpenditure Framework (MTEF), which was
instrumental inincreasingthe annual governmenthealth expenditures from 6-9% inthe 1990sto
ahigh 12-15% by2001. Malawi also receivedHeavily IndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC) funds
that are inpart beingchanneledto the healthsector. The MalawiNationalHealthPlan(1999-
2004), the Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper (PRSP) (PRSP, 2002), andthe recently published
six-year Program o fWork (POW),2003-2009) o fthe M O Hcollectivelyprovide a convincing
framework for targeting an essentialhealthpackage o f services to the poor The Essential Health
Package (EHP) guides the sectoralpriorities at all levels, and also tries to promote an integrated
approach as opposedto the existing independentvertical diseasecontrol programs Improved
access to the EHPi s consideredkeyto the improvement o fthe "health status ofMalawians by
reducingthe incidence o fillness andoccurrenceofpremature deaths inthe population," thereby
contributing to "the achievementof sustainablepovertyreduction through the enhancementof
human capital development'' (PRSP, 2002).

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

Client initiatives in sector: Recognizing the recent move to strengthenthe MOH's stewardship
role, while devolvingresponsibility for the managementofhealthprograms to the elected
district-level authorities, andinorder to promote greater cohesion inthe health sector, harmonize
donor support, andensure amore targeted andequitable delivery o fhealth services, MOHis
developing a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) inhealth. The six-year POWfor the proposed
SWAp, preparedthrough a consultative process, hasreceived enthusiastic support from key
domestic andintemational stakeholders. The consultative approach adoptedbythe M O H in
designingthe SWAPpresents anopportunity for broad-basedownership andpartnershipinthe
implementation ofthe EHP.

The Local Government Act (CAP 22.01) provides the necessarylegal framework for the
decentralizationpolicy, which will facilitate the participationofthe poor inhealthplanningand
decision-making through existing democratic structures. Over the years, GOMhas also
strengthenedits partnership with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), most importantlyby
the recent signingof a Memorandum o fUnderstanding(MOU) with the Christian Health
Association o fMalawi (CHAM), which provides over 25% o f all health servicesinMalawi. The
signingofthis MOU, which hasbeen strongly endorsedbythe collaboratingpartners, offers a
genuineopportunity for the enhancementofcollaborative efforts aimed at increasingaccess to
the EHP bythe poor, andprovides a basis for objective resource allocation to non-govemment
providerso fhealth. Furthermore, the introductiono f service-agreements intra-and extra-district
for the provision ofthe EHP to underserved areas should helpinincreasing access to the EHP.
Finally, the resourceallocation fomula now inplace i s a step inthe right directiontowards
adopting a "needs-based" approachto health care provision, as it takes into consideration the
population, existing infrastructure, andpoverty levels inthe various districts inMalawi.

Requestfor IDA Assistance: To finance the POW,GOMhas sought assistancefrom its
development partners, including IDA, andhas already received initial support from the major


                                                  8

donors -DfID andthe Kingdomo fNorway - with the expectation of further commitments from
the African Development Bank (AfDB) and other bilateral andmultilateraldonors. Also, there
hasbeen a strong demandfrom the GOM andother developmentpartners for policy advice and
analytical support from the Bank.

IDA's comparative advantage: TheBankhasbeen a strong supporter of SWAPSinthe health
sector ina substantial numberofAfrican andAsian countries with generally encouraging results.
The Bankhas also been a keydrivingforce behindthe PRSP. With the only previous Bank
healthproject having closedin2000, awell-implemented LILfor Population and Family
Planning(Pop/FP) havingclosed onDecember 31,2003, anda limitedhealthpresenceinthe
country office (which has only beenremediedvery recently), IDA's contribution to the sector
dialogue inMalawi hasbeen limited. Since work hasbeen ongoing on the SWAP for 2-3 years,
IDA is also a late entrant inthe SWAPdiscussions. Inorder to enhancethe development impact,
itwouldbe appropriate for the Bankto provide technical input andhelpbridgethe financinggap
inthe proposedhealthSWAp. TheGOMandthepartnerswouldstronglysupport suchan
initiative.

Needfor continuing support: It should benoted, though, that the proposed IDA grant o fUS$15
million over three years, while demonstrating the Bank's support for the SWAP(that could
potentially also leverage other funds), i s considerably smaller thanthe amounts indicated by
DfID($60million) andthe KingdomofNorway($25-30 million), andleaves asignificant
financing gap inthe sector. Basedon the sectoralperformance, additional support to the sector
couldbe consideredinthe future.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

Povertyfocus: Delivery o fthe EHPto eachcitizen i s at the core ofthe Government o fMalawi's
health strategy andtherefore ofthe SWAp.Consistent with internationalbest practice, the EHP
targets the most important health problems ofthe poor. It fits within the policy and strategy
framework contained inthe NationalHealthPlan, the "Vision 2020" document, andthe Malawi
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Importantly, while the objectives of these policy
documents are relativelybroad, they do includethe intentionto adapt the MOH's role to that of
"steward" o fthe sector rather thandirect service provider, inthe context of decentralization.

Efficient and equitable access: The design o fthe EHP as both a rationing andtargeting strategy
for health interventions provides an opportunity for the efficient and equitable utilizationof
healthresources. Furthermore,it i s possible to identifyapoverty-focused hierarchy of objectives
inthe nationalpolicyand strategies. Thus, improved access to, and quantity, quality and cost-
efectiveness of EHP-related services contributes to improved health statusfor all Malawians,
which inturn supports sustainable reduction inpoverty -where the italics are national
objectives as expressedinGOM's ownwording. This structure i s explicitly focused onpoverty
reduction and equity.

Relevance to objectives of CAS,Bank HNP strategy, and Africa HNPStrategic Priorities: The
Bank's 2003 Malawi CountryAssistance Strategy (CAS), buildingon the PRSP, makes
improved health status inMalawi a priority for poverty reduction. The CAS identifiedthe need



                                                  9

for renewedengagemento fthe Bank inthe health sector andprovided for a US$15 million IDA
grant to support anewhealthproject, supportedbyamodest allocation for analytical work. The
project, as describedbelow, i s also inconformity with the Bank's Health, Nutritionand
Population (HNP) strategy andthe HNP Strategic Priorities outlinedby the African region.


B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The proposedinstrument i s a Sector Investment andMaintenance (SIM) Grant. The three-year
US$ 15 million grant shall support the MOH's 6-Year POWfor the proposed health SWAP
through time-slice financing, rather thanearmark particular activities or inputs. As such, as
describedinthe next section, the objectives and outcomes of the IDAMalawi HealthSector
Support project (HSSP) will bethe same as those for the GOM's health sector program, although
inorderto focusproject supervision, attentionwillbedirectedtowardscertainkeyaspectsofthe
government's program. IDA financing for the SWAPshall be pooledwith the contributions
from Dm>, the Kingdom ofNorway, other potential donors, as well as GOM funds.

2. Programobjective

The long-term objective o fthe sectoral program (whichis beingsupportedby the World Bank,
among others), as statedinthe POW,i s to establish- through ahealth sector-wide approach- a
healthdelivery system responsive to the needs o fthe people o fMalawi, by improving the
effectiveness andefficiency o fhealth services, andprovidinga minimumpackageof essential
health services - the EHP - targeted at the poor, women andchildren. The GOM's program does
not envisage aradicalreform ofthe sector (although it has elements ofreform). Instead, the
focus o fthe EHP will be on increasingthe efficiency, quality andequity o fhealth services in
Malawi.

MOH stewardship with decentralized implementation: The Government hasinhandor is
planningaseries ofpolicy, organizational andmanagementchangesto createcapacity for
implementing the EHP. These changes are consistentwith the policy of decentralizing
responsibility for health andother services to district level. The Ministryo fHealthwill retain
responsibility for health policy, norm-setting, central hospitals, centrally-organized support
services, monitoring, and coordination ofpartners at national level. Considering the limited
existing capacitiesat district levels, the proposed decentralization o fhealth services will be
phased-in, andwill buildon the current experienceswith the health budgetary enhancement to
districts supportedbythe Kingdom o fNorway. Inthis context, Zonal centerswill be set upto
provide support supervision andtechnical assistanceto the districts, while Central Hospitals will
beimprovedto assure effective referrals. The District Assemblies will coordinate withhealth
providers outside government, such as member organizations ofthe Christian HealthAssociation
ofMalawi. Community participation, ownership andresponsibility for health outcomes at
householdlevel is to be emphasizedthrough IEC interventions, use of communityhealthworkers
(CHWs), andincollaboration with on going community-based initiatives such as MASAF.
Finally,priority attention shall begivento the emergencyplanfor ensuringcriticalhuman



                                                  10

resources for the health sector, as well as to improving access to essential drugs and supplies
through streamlinedprocurement and logistical systems.

Program Costs: The six-year POWfor the SWAP has been costed at US$735 million. The three
stage process that M O H has followed indeveloping the POW- (i)        identifying`Ideal' resource
requirements, (ii)  constraints analysis and (iii)prioritizing within estimated financial resources -
i s logical and transparent andrepresents a sound basis for developing a SWAP. There i s
uncertainty at present as to the level o f financial resources likely to be available from both
Government and donors to finance the health sector over the medium term, because o f the
unstable macroeconomic situation andthe uncertainty surrounding the economic reform
program. This uncertainty is handledwell inthe POWby developing six alternative financing
scenarios and by recognizingthat the financial projections (and hence the POW)will require
updating every 2-3 years inthe light o f changing circumstances.

3. Project development objective and key indicators

Development Objective: As noted, the overall objective o f the government's SWAP program for
the sector i s to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and equity o fthe essential healthcare
delivery system inMalawi. Within this general context, three key aspects o f the sector standout
 as requiring particular attention ifthe SWAP i s to succeed. These are: a) humanresources,
where there i s a danger of the human resource situation slipping into an emergency crisis if
 substantial steps are not taken, b) ensuring the provision o fthe essential package o f services -
the minimumrequired throughout the country, and c) strengtheningthe support and referral
                         -
 systems relevant to this package o f services.

 While IDA'Scontribution will be to the entire SWAPprogram, given its modest size inrelation
 to the total program, it will not be possible to separately identify the expected effect o f IDA'S
 contribution. While the country's weak implementationcapacity i s recognized, as i s the fact that
 a number o f factors beyond the project's control can potentially affect the program performance
 (including but not limitedto the macroeconomic situation, civil service reform, and
 decentralization), there was a consensus inthe project team that it would be inappropriate for the
 Bank to focus exclusively on and/or "earmark" a narrow set o fprogrammatic activities. Such a
 narrow focus could lead, potentially, to a successful implementationo f these activities, but
 overall programmatic failure. However, inorder to focus project monitoring and supervision, the
 project's development objectives will emphasize -- albeit not exclusively -- the three central
 aspects noted above (project outputs). It i s anticipated that appropriate attentionto these aspects
 will leadto the realizationo fthe longer-term SWAPgoals (program outcomes).

 The development objective o fthe HSSP is, therefore, to contribute to the overall aims o fthe
  government's SWAP program and within that to ensure that the minimumessential package o f
 health services i s provided throughout the country at facility and community levels, and that the
  decline inthe health sector humanresources position i s arrested and reversed. Inaddition,
 recognizingthat the Bank i s ajunior partner interms o f the overall financing o f the SWAP, the
 primary value-added o f the Bank will be a continuous engagement inthe effective
  implementationo f the sector program.




                                                    11

Principal outputs and outcomes: Theprincipaloutputs expectedare: (a) Improvedavailability
o fquality health care andEHP for the poor and vulnerable populations; (b) Improvedhuman
resources, especially skilledpersonnel; (c) Strengthenedhealth systems through equitable health
financing, increasedhumanresources, reliable pharmaceutical andsupplies logistics and
effective monitoringand evaluation; (d) Enhancedcapacity ofMOHfor stewardshipandpolicy
development; (e) Strengthened District HealthManagement systems for planning, budgetingand
deliveryof qualityhealth services; and(f) Community participation inthe deliveryof essential
health interventions.

It i s anticipated that these outputs would contribute to the ultimate goal o fthe health sector in
Malawi, which is to address the three MDGsofreducing childmortality, improvingmatemal
health and - linkingwith MASAF- contribute to the reduction ofpovertybyprotecting the
poorest andthe vulnerable from economic loss due to illhealth and disability. The project would
also contribute to the achievementof a fourth MDGs- that ofcombating HIV/AIDS- by
workinginconcert withthe Bank's MAP project grant (P073821) andrelated initiatives, such as
the support beingprovidedby the GlobalFund.

Agreeduponoutcome indicators for assessing the long-term impact ofthe HSSP are as follows
(to bemeasuredinaggregateanddisaggregatedby income, gender and geography):


0    InfantMortalityRate (IMR)
0    MaternalMortality Ratio (MMR)
0     Contraceptive PrevalenceRate/Total FertilityRate (CPWTFR)
0    PrevalenceofHIV inAnte-Natal Clinic Clients andamongthe youth
0     %oflow birthweight (LBW) newborns

The following output indicators are proposed to monitor the Bankproject components:

e     Overall: Proportion o f GOMbudget allocated toheceived bythe health sector at the national
      anddistrict levels; Trends inper capitagovernment allocations to the health sector; % of
      health facilities with abilityto effectively provideEHP; Proportion ofpopulationwithin easy

4. Project components

The HSSP is expectedto achievethe stateddevelopment objective over the next three years and,
basedonthe foregoing, would strategically have three components, exclusively drawn from the



                                                     12

POW': (a) Supportextension of qualityhealthcare coverage throughdeliveryof EHP; (b)
Supporthumanresourcedevelopmentandmanagement;and(c) Strengthenhealthsector
support andreferral systems (see details inAnnex 4). Inorder to maximizeits impact, every
effort will also be made to strengthen the linkages ofthe HSSP (andthe broader SWAP)with the
ongoing Bank-supportedHIV/AIDS program (through the Malawi MAP) andMASAFproject.

Duringthe first year ofthe HSSP, a gradualbuildupofthejoint POWis expectedandthe usual
problems oftransition envisaged as the EHP concept is rolled out. Year two would beusedto
remedyany deficiencies and shortcomings observedduringthe first year leadingto the all
important Mid-termreview (MTR). The recommendations o fthe MTR, which shall include
assessment o fthe progress againstperfonnance indicators, wouldbeusedto consolidate the
gains and ensure that the project i s on course duringthe secondhalf o f its life.

ComponentI Delivery ofthe EHP: The objective o fthis component i s to improve the health
                -
status o fthe Malawianpopulation by increasing access to quality essentialhealth services. The
mainmechanism for delivering quality carewould be bymakingthe already-defined EHP
accessibleto all, but especially inthe most rural and disadvantageddistricts andto the poorest
andvulnerable populations. The componentwould support communitysensitizationand
mobilization as well as establishmentof standards andpackages of care to be deliveredat each
level -community, health center, district and central hospitals. Inaddition, the component will
also support in-service update ofhealthworker andmanagementskills as a way of improving
staffperformance and strengthening serviceprovision. Efficient logistics and sustained
availability ofpharmaceuticals, medical andlaboratory equipment and supplies, so critical for
effective delivery o f the EHPwill also be supportedbythis component. The EHP will be
introduced inanincremental mannerby adapting and strengtheningexisting services to co-opt
the EHP concept. It i s understood that infrastructural improvement(inthe form ofrehabilitation,
refurbishment, etc.) will beneeded to ensure that all health facilities can support the delivery o f
the EHP; however, it is not the intentionofthis component to rapidly expand the infrastructure
throughthe construction ofnew freestandinghealth facilities. Instead, the emphasiswill be on
balancing infrastructural development with ensuringthe availability of, inter alia, adequatestaff,
equipment andsupplies.

Component2 Human Resources Developmentand Management: The major thrust ofthis
                -
component, inthe short term, i s on increasing the number o f staffavailable through continuation
ofthe six-year emergencytrainingplan, aconcerted recruitment campaign, financing andthen
filling current vacancies, the useofvolunteers andcontract staff and other stop-gap staffing
strategies. The component will look comprehensively at the government and the NGOsectors.
Greater attraction andretention of staffwill be achievedby ensuringsalaries are paidpromptly
andinfull andby increasing the overallremuneration package, though interimmeasuresmaybe
required. Inaddition, effective implementationofthe existing measuresfor effective HR
managementwill be ensured. Personnelpolicies willbereviewedto improveworking
conditions. Staffwill beusedmore effectively bymatchingposts to workload, developing
performance managementsystems andby streamlining the provisionof in-service training.


1The six programs o f the six-year POW,which are largely focused on inputs, have beenre-aggregated to a different
presentation which links inputs more closely to the activities, Le. the delivery o fthe essential healthpackage, human
resources development, and support systems. This re-aggregation does not affect the integrity o f the POW.

Support systems will beimproved includingHRinformationsystems, HRplanning (including
coordination with training institutes), and a review ofthe current structures managingthe HR
systems. Technical assistance will beneededto support the strengtheningo f the HR systems.
Longer-term HumanResources (HR)strategiesinclude the developmentof improvedcareer
structures, andimprovingrecruitment anddeployment systems.

Component3 Health Sector Support and Referral Systems: The objective of this component
              -
i s to improvethe effectiveness and efficiency o fboththe health system and the referralnetwork
to support deliveryo fthe EHP. Itwill be divided into two subcomponents: (a) Support for
central operations and, (b) Support to district operations. Greater emphasiswill be placed on
support to operations at district andlower levels.

The sub-component for central operationswill strengtheninstitutionalprocessesaimed at
enhancing central support to implementthe SWAP indelivery ofthe EHP and for the
decentralization ofthe health sector. The aim is to put inplace the policies, coordination and
regulatory frameworks, organizational structures, procurement and financial instruments,
trainingprograms, andinformation, monitoring and evaluation systems that would enable the
MOHto effectivelystewardthe POW. The central operationswould focus onmanagingthe
process of decentralization andbe geared towards effective support ofthe devolved district
health system. Specific output areas for the subcomponent include: (i) andplanning
                                                                          Policies
systems to support EHP; (ii) financing and financial management systems; (iii)
                              Health
Procurement policy andlogisticalsystem for drugs, equipment andsupplies; (iv) Equitable
distributionof financial andhumanresources; (v) Development of standardsandquality
assurancesystems; (vi) Supervision, including Zonal support; and(vii) Healthinformation
systems for monitoringand evaluation.

The sub-component on district operations inthe devolvedhealth systemwill strengthen
coordination andplanningto ensure uninterruptedavailability andmaintenanceof adequate
financial, material andhumanresourcesto deliver effectivelythe EHP inthe districts for both
MOHandNGOservices. Specific output areas include: (i)         orientation of staff andother
stakeholderson SWAP andthe concept of EHP; (ii) preparation ofhighquality District
                                                      Timely
Implementation Plans(DIPS); (iii)    Financial management; (iv) Procurement, storage and
distributionof adequate drugs equipmentand supplies; (v) Effective communication andreferral
framework; (vi) Effective execution o fother routine operations by DHMTs; (vii) Strengthening
communityparticipation anddelivery ofEHP, includingintersectoral linkages; (viii) Effective
linkages with MASAF; and (ix) Quality technical advice to District Assemblies.

5. Lessonslearned and reflected inthe project design

The following lessonsrelevantto Malawi, the HNP sector ingeneral, andthe HNP sector in
Malawi inparticular, havebeen carefully considered indesigningthe Malawi HSSP.

Malawi Lessons: ICRs for recent Bank-supported projects inMalawi have emphasizedthe            ,
importance o frealistic objectives with greater specificity and focus, which canbe translated into
operational andmonitorable terms. Inthe same vein, it hasbeenrecognized that effective
monitoringand evaluation i s keyto good programmatic implementation. The need for project



                                                  14

design to be compatible with implementation capacity andpay adequate attention to "software"
activities has also been stressed.

HNPLessons: Experience fromHNP projects indevelopingcountries, andparticularly those in
Sub-Saharan Afiica, shows that multiple discrete projects lead to the fragmentation o f services,
preclude government ownership, andimpose anunduemanagement burden on governments.
Fungibilityo fresources also implies that, when donors focus on financing cost-effective
interventions (e.g., primaryhealthcare), government resources can sometimes be redirected
towards less cost-effective interventions. A more comprehensive strategy approach, that i s based
on a government-led strategy andprogram, focused on buildinglocal capacities, andfirmly
rooted inan agreed-upon financing framework should be considered. Ithas also been recognized
that for optimal results, inthe health sector, governments need to focus increasinglyon financing
and stewardship, while encouraging greater private sector participation inservice delivery.

Malawi HNPLessons: Significant lessons from Malawi HNP work are that: (a) infrastructure
expansion needs to be synchronized with staffing and supplies; (b) community driven initiatives
can significantly improve certainhealthrelated behaviors at the household level, such as the use
o f contraceptives; and (c) the absence o f anIDA technical presence inthe field has constrained
the policy dialogue with the GOM andother partners.

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

With the need for IDA to helpMalawi achieve the MDGsthrough its financial and analytical
contributions, the "no project" altemative is not viable. This i s particularly so given the high
levels o f child andmaternal mortality rates, the advancingAIDS epidemic, andthe burden o f
disease due to infectious diseases like TB andmalaria. The progress made bythe GOMduring
the past two years, working closely with its development partners, inpreparing an essential
healthpackage, and a program o fwork for its implementation, provides a unique opportunity for
the Bankto participate ina collaborative effort aimed at improving health outcomes inMalawi.
Another altemative is a `stand alone' investment. This, however, is inconsistent with the
regional strategy, which recognizes the benefits o fprogrammatic approaches. Experiencein
Malawi also indicates that it is difficult to achieve sustainable policy reforms through modest
sized stand-alone projects.

The proposedproject design is based on the successful experiences inthe region o f using a
cohesive sector wide program approach with annualplans o f action supported by all major
development partners. On instruments, anAdaptable Program Lending (APL)couldbe an
alternative, but is probably premature given the status o fthe sectoral reform as well as the
broader macroeconomic environment. An Sector Investment andMaintenance grant is,
therefore, proposed.


C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnership arrangements




                                                   15

IDA,andthe two other development partners (DfIDandthe Kingdomo fNorway) who have
committedto contributing to a common pool, haveworked under Government o f Malawi
leadership to negotiate and agree on a Memorandum o fUnderstanding (MOU) to govern their
partnership within the SWAP. This MOUwas formally signed by the pooling partners on
October 29,2004. Certain other partners are also expected to join the financing pool inthe near
future. The MOUrefers to the POW,overall resource envelope, financing arrangements,
coordination andmonitoring arrangements includingjoint annual reviews, and a code o f conduct
for partners. Other donors, who will also signthe MOU, will continue to provide earmarked
support, butwithin the confines o fthe POWfor the SWAP (see details below).

The GOM andthe pooling partners have agreed on a realistic pace for capacity buildingand
institutional change and on a patterno f disbursement linked to progress. This has given the
government confidence about donor fimding commitments, and given the funders confidence
that spending will beusedfor the purposes andwithin the timetable agreed. The patterno f
disbursement is linkedto milestones to be agreed as part o fthe consultation process. Examples
o f milestones include progress infinancial and humanresource management systems; human
resource development; appropriate arrangements for decentralization; civil society's role in
monitoring health care delivery; service provision; anddevelopment o fpublic-private
partnerships. These milestones will be incorporatedina realistic timetable inthe Annual
ImplementationPlans.

The indicative approximate financing amounts for the health SWAP from the three agencies
pooling funds are currently expected to be: DfID40 millionpounds grant; the Kingdom o f
Norway 42 millionU S dollars grant (currently 23 millionU S dollars inprojects and vertical
programs, and 19million U S dollars to the pooled funds); andIDA 15 millionU S dollars grant.
While IDAwill finance the SWAP over a three year period, other agencies will finance it over
the 5-6 years implementationperiod. IDAwill also reimburse retroactively its share o fthe
eligible SWAP expenditures beginningfrom October 29,2004, as soonas the project is effective.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

The Principal Secretary MOHis overall responsible for SWAP implementation including the
outputs andquality assurance. To guide and advise him, a detailed `governance' structure for the
SWAP has been established. This structure builds upon andmodifies arrangements for
ministerial anddonor coordination that were already operational. Details are includedinthe
MOU, but the linemanagement structures include a Top Management Committee (Ministerial
level), a Senior Management Committee (Department Director level) -both serviced by the
SWAP Secretariat - andDepartmental Meetings. Onthe advisory side, there i s a Health Sector
Review Group (the main donor/govemment group) with sub-groups on selected key topics.

Withinthe MOHandCHAM, day-to-day implementationofthe SWAP funded activitieswill be
implementedby the responsible subject/technical departments andunits following the agreed
detailed annual work plans. To ensure full ownership andcapacity buildingwithinthe MOH, no
project implementationunit will be established. A three person SWAP Secretariat is being
established, that will deal mainly with the donors, monitoring and evaluation, and facilitate the
implementation o f the SWAP governance structure. The head o f the SWAP Secretariat reports to



                                                 16

the Director o f Planningandthe PlanningDepartment will continue to take the lead inthe
substantiveaspects ofthe SWAp, as theyhave donethroughout the preparationprocess. The
Director ofPlanning is of courseresponsible for coordination with senior staff and especially the
ChiefTechnical Adviser, DepartmentHeads, andwith CHAM.

The mainrisks identifiedinaprocurement`capacity assessment undertakenby IDA are
unfamiliaritywithprocurement procedures ofmultilateralfinancial institutions, inadequate
procurement systems andunreliable quantification ofrequirements for health sector goods.
Giventheweak systems and capacities, the large amount of funds involvedinthe SWAp, the
complications introduced bythe involvement o fNGOs inprogram implementation, and the
challenges o fpoolingfunds havebeen identifiedas critical risks for effective financial
managementandinternal control. To promote timelyimplementation, long-term technical
assistanceinthe key areas of financial managementandprocurement i s beingimplemented.
Procurement o f goods, works and services will be the responsibility ofthe Head ofthe (to be
established) MOHProcurementUnit,working closely with the (to berecruited) Procurement
Agent/Adviser, the Director ofFinance andDirector ofPlanning. The Director ofFinance will
beresponsible for all financial management and accounting matters under the SWAP(Further
details on financial managementandprocurement are giveninAnnexes 7 and 8).

At present, the MOHoperatesa centralized managementsystem. The four Central Hospitals and
District HealthTeams (including the District Hospitals) are enjoying anincreasing level of
autonomy, but still have only limited administrative and financial powers. It is government
policy that ministries decentralize. The M O H is inthe process of devolvingthe managementof
Health Centers inthe maincities to the city councils. MOH's plani s to prepare for full phased
devolution to the District Assemblies over the coming severalyears. Manymanagerial,
administrative, political, reporting and communications issues have yet to be addressed-butthe
SWAPwill beinstrumental infacilitatingthis process. Beneficiary consultation and
involvement will, of course, becomemore systematic. Devolutionto districts will be amajor
change inthe way inwhichthe SWAPis implemented;it will be a focus, among other issues, o f
the annual review process.

The SWAPprovidesanimportant vehicle for developing national implementation systems and
capacity. The establishment and expansion o f common implementation systems i s animportant
feature o fthe SWAp, bothto buildcapacity andto reducewaste onparallel systems and
procedures. It i s expectedthat all major donors to the health sector will participate inthe SWAp,
thus offeringthe opportunity for increasedcooperation. Ultimately, itishopedthat this will
facilitate andencourage all donors to move towards a common set of implementation procedures
-andthenceprogramsupport-for thegovernment's totalhealthprogram. Comparedwith
neighboring countries, there are relatively few donors actively involvedinthe health sector,
which will simplifythis process. However, this also makes the sector vulnerable to the very
frequent changes inindividualdonor healthrepresentatives. This has slowedpreparationand
remains a risk to effective implementation.

SWAPfinancing originates from two groups o f sources. Thosepartnerswho are able to pool
funds (DfD, the KingdomofNorway andIDA-together with the goveimnent ofcourse) and
those partners who are not. The latter group will finance health sector activities underthe SWAP

umbrella, but typically usingproject modalities. The pooling(or basket) partnerswill provide
funds to acommon accountthat isreplenishedquarterlf. Thejoint disbursementmethods,
financial management, reporting, procurement, auditing, etc. are formalized inthe detailed
Memorandum o fUnderstandingthat hasbeen signedby the poolingpartners. Arrangementsfor
the non-pooling partners andthe poolingpartners are described somewhat separately inthe
Memorandum o fUnderstanding(Parts A andBrespectively).

Ajoint reviewwill beheldannually inSeptember. Thiswill beamajor event, the mainannual
programreview and will cover overall progressduringthe precedingyear, expenditureand
audits, procurement progress-andimplementation, procurement andother plansfor the coming
year (including the link to the Mid-TermExpenditure Framework[MTEF]). Poolingpartners
will also agreeontheir allocations to the pool for the coming year. A smaller reviewwill take
place inthe off-six months, inFebruary,which will focus more on technical and service related
issues.

3. Monitoringandevaluation of outcomes/results

Monitoringand evaluation (M&E) i s crucial for both day-to-day management of the SWAPand
for the six monthlyand annualreviews. The agreedcore set of 42 indicators are central to this
process. A reliable system that produces data o f a consistent acceptable quality underlies the
process. Work i s ongoing to refine the indicators to ensure that they linkclosely to the POW,that
they are measurableand sensitive at least annually, andthat baseline values andtargets for
achievements(wherever possible sub-dividedto identifythe poor, disadvantagedgroups and
districts, etc.) are specified. This work is expectedto be completed, discussedwith the
cooperating partners and finalized bymid-November2004. While information on inputs is
important, as the SWAP evolves the focus will quickly shifi to outputs andresults.

TheHealthSector Review Group will monitor the performance ofthe sector usingthe defined
indicators, which will providethe basis for the Annual Sector ReviewMeeting.

The SWAPSecretariatwill facilitate the productionof aHealthSector Annual Report on
activities underthe agreedPOW,which will provide the basis for the Annual Sector Review
Meeting. The report will consolidate the financial, procurement, activities, and outputs o fthe
previous year.

At the central level, the HealthSectorAnnualReport, the SWAP governancestructure ofhigh
level committees, annual reports from eachdistrict, and at the macro level the reviews of the
sectoral parts ofthe MTEF andthe PERs together provide a framework for assessing
performance. At the district level, a standardset of indicators hasbeen agreed, and the districts
will report quarterly.

Despite recentprogress, the HealthManagement Information System (andassociated surveys,
etc.) is not yet capableo fprovidingthe neededinformationreliablyand on scheduleand
monitoring generally remains weak. To strengthenthe existing system, long-term technical


  DFIDandthe KingdomofNorway willputthe majority oftheir fundsfor the poolbut, inaddition, continue to
finance a limited number o fprojects.

assistancewill be recruited. The assistance will be intwo mainparts: (a) ensuringthat the
HealthInformationSystem i s fblly operational andmaintained as such (located inthe Health
InformationUnit); and(b) establishing and maintaining the annual/semi-annualreviewprocesses
at central anddistrict levels, establishing a capacity for commissioning operational research,
ensuringthat major surveys (e.g., the DHS, the Census andthe Malawi Core Welfare Indicator
Questionnaire - CWIQ - Survey) provide data usefbl for SWAPmonitoring, andintroducing
greater involvement by communities inmonitoringhealth services (located inthe SWAP
Secretariat) .

All the stakeholderscommittedto supporting the healthSWAp will supplyrelevant information
to the SWAPSecretariatfor effective monitoringo fperformance.

4. Sustainability

Sustainability o fthe proposedhealth SWAPneeds to viewed from aprogrammatic and a
financial perspective.

ProgrammaticSustainability

Changefrom project approach to a sector-wide approach: Promotinga sector-wide approach
inthe planningandfinancing ofthe sectorsignalsboththe government's anddonors' willingness
to do away with the fragmented approachprevalent underthe traditional projects, whichhas
been shownto distort sector allocation priorities and also to beunsustainable inthe long run.

Focusing on government capacity: Rather thancreating temporary, separatemanagement
entities (such as a PIU) which employ parallel systems, procedures and staff, the SWAPalso
focuses attention on developing and strengthening government systems andprocedures
(planning, budgeting, financial management, procurement), andcivil service capacity.

Budgetary reform, prioritization and rationalization: The Program supportsthe budgetary
reform initiatives underthe Medium-TermExpenditure Framework (MTEF). Extemalresources
for the health sector, most o fwhich were extra-budgetary, have been increasingly incorporated in
the MTEF to help clarify the realresourceenvelope for the sector. Reform initiatives supported
undertheProject andProgramare intendedto enhancefiscalpredictabilityandsustainability, as
well as allocation efficiencyinthe healthsector. The sustainability ofinvestmentcosts
(typically financed by donors) can also bebetter assessedunderthe SWAP.

FinancialSustainability

Sustainability of government spending: The sustainability ofPOWexpenditures and, more
directly, ofM O H expenditures, canbest be analyzed inthe context ofthe sustainability o f
overall government spending. As discussedindetail inAnnex 9, the Government succeededin
protecting expenditures inhealth over the past six years (FY97/98 to FY02/03), with a dramatic
rise inthe share o fM O H to total government spendingoccurringin2001. M O H expenditures
were also protected from erosion due to inflationandpopulationgrowth. Thus, real per capita




                                                  19

MOHspending(at constant 1995prices) rose from MK60 inFY97/98 to MK85 inFY01/02. (In
current terms, these are equivalent to MK103 andMK423, respectively.)

Althoughthe MOH's share of government spendinghasbeen increasing, it still falls short
relative to need, andrelative to the 15percent allocation to health that African Governments
committed themselves to meet inthe OAU Summit inApril 2001 inAbuja, Nigeria. The 15
percent target for adequateandsustainable government financing for healthwould bewithin
Malawi's ability to meet ifnot for the heavyload of "nondiscretionary" or "unallocable''
expenditures that the government needs to set aside, mainly to pay off its large domestic debt.
Nondiscretionary expenditureshave balloonedinrecent years, accounting for around23.5
percent inFYO1/02, or an average share o f 20.6 percent from FY97/98 to FY01/02. Becauseof
this burden, further expansioningovernment allocation to the M O H and other social sectors has
been constrained. Thus, ifthe GOM adopts a strategy o fbringingdomestic borrowings down,
significantlymore domestic resourcescouldbemade available for health. Onthe other hand, if
it fails inthis area, government discretionary expenditures (including health) couldbe fin-ther
squeezed, reducing the sustainability o fthe POW.

Fiscal decentralizationand the sustainabilityof PoWinvestments: Itis unclear to what extent
the POWexpenditures canbe sustained at the district levelwhenprimaryhealth services are
eventually devolved to localauthorities. The challengesduringthis period o ftransition, and the
proposed approach for dealing with them, are: (a) To ensure that localauthorities devote as
much (or more) resourcesto priority healthinterventions as the current POW. One approachthat
a number o fdevolved countries have employed to solve this problemi s to establish categorical
or conditional grants that specify priority activities to be funded. This has its pros andcons, but
it ensures that inthe short-term, POWactivities are adequatelyfunded; b) To ensure that fiscal
transfers to districts are made on an equitable basis, i.e., that no district will be madeworse off
than itwas before the devolution. This requiresthat the existing district allocation formulabe
reformulated to take account o fthe resourcerequirements o f assets andpersonnel actually
transferred, andhealthneedsthat were previously not captured inthe "incremental budgeting"
practice.

Sustainabilityof referral services and hospitaljlnancing: Although no final decisions have
beenmade, discussionswith MOHpolicymakers revealed the following: (a) their interest in
pursuingsocial healthinsuranceas onemechanism for providingmuch-neededfinancing for
catastrophic andreferral health services, (b) the recent issuanceo f apolicy makingall inpatient
hospitalization andoutpatient consultations at central hospitals subject to fees, and (c) ongoing
technical assistancebeing providedto assist inmakingthe four central hospitals become
autonomous.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic andfinancial analyses

The Malawi HSSP is designed inthe context o f a medium-term (2004/05 to 20091'10) POW
supporting the MOH's sector-wide approach, incooperation with its development partners.
SWAP pooled funding is being supported by a group o f donors including DfJD, the Kingdomo f
Norway and IDA. By its nature, the pooled fundingarrangement will beplannedandmanaged
closely withthe budgetary resources coming from the Government o fMalawi. Thus, the
economic andfinancial analysis o fHSSP i s made inthe context o fthe POWandthe feasibility o f
the POWbeing funded under the government's annual budget framework.

The economic analysis o fthe HSSP, and o fthe POWo fwhich it is a part, shows that it provides
a reasonable basis for supporting priority health interventions inMalawi. There are strong
economic justifications for the project, including the need to increase significantly investments in
healthto arrest the deteriorated state o fhealth services and improve the quality o f services, and
thereby alleviatepoverty by reducinghousehold costs associatedwith getting sick. On fiscal
grounds, the pooled funding modality is a sensible approach inreducingmanagement burden
arising from traditional multiple donor projects; reducingthe budgetary distortion causedby off-
budget expenditures; andimprovingallocative efficiency by focusing andtightening the budget


                                                  22

around the deliveryo fthe essentialhealthpackage (EHP). Severalproject scenarioswere
considered bythe project preparationteam; the conclusion i s that the blendof interventions and
proposedPOWmechanismsrepresent a reasonableandcost-effective approachto financing the
sector program. The analysis ofproject benefits concludesthat giventhe sorry state ofhealth
services inMalawi, andthe POW'Sfocus on EHPwhich has the potential o f averting a large
proportiono fthe disease burdenamongthe poor, the project i s expectedto have apositive
impact onpoverty alleviation.

The financial analysis ofthe project examined the costing, resourceallocationpattern, overall
financing, and sustainability ofthe POW. Theproject team notedthat the three-stageprocessthat
MOHfollowedinrefiningthe POW-identifyingideal resourcerequirements, constraints
analysis, andprioritizationwithin the estimatedlikely resource envelop -is logical and
transparent andrepresents a soundbasis for developing the SWAP. The POWcosting exercise
was foundto be generally soundexcept for a few keyissuesthat need to be dealt with further.
Moreover, the POWresource allocationbetween central andperipheral areas andbetween capital
andrecurrent costs appears to bereasonable. Finally, the POWfinancingrequirement for the
government i s withinits forecast resourceenvelop over the periodFY04/05 to FY09/10,
conditional uponthe Government maintaining the current shareofM O Hto total government
expenditures(13.5 percent; ideal at 15.0 percent), andassumingthe Malawian economy grows at
a modest rate o f 1percent. Thus, over the medium-term, the POWappears consistent with the
country's macroeconomic and fiscal framework. The keyproblematic area i s the financing gap
inpooledfunding. Althoughthe totalresourceenvelop for development assistanceinMalawi
over the next three years far exceedsthe resourcerequirementofthe POWfor donors, a large part
o f extemal assistanceremains off-budget, reducing the probability o ftheir beingconverted into
pooled funds.

2. Technical

The overallprogradproject design buildsuponthe identifiedhealth sector needs ofthe country,
the lessonslearned from previous projects and from other countries, andthe researchand
analysis undertaken onhealthsystems, service delivery, medical andpublic health interventions,
householdcommunitybehaviors and attitudes, and sector wide approaches. Itrespondsto the
leading causes o fmorbidity andmortalityinMalawi. The healthpolicy and strategies are
broadly inlinewith current internationalthinking and conform to international standards for pro-
poor essentialhealth care. Specifically, the design aims at accelerating the achievement ofthe
MDGsinMalawiby ocusingonthe three key areas -delivery ofthe EHP, humanresources
development andmanagement, andhealth sector support andreferral systems.

Thepriority interventions identifiedinthe EHPbythe MOHhavereceived intensive support
from bothlocal andinternationalpartners. Malawihas also beenarecipient of assistancefrom
several global initiatives - including the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization(GAVI),
RollBackMalaria, IntegratedManagement ofChildhoodIllness (IMCI), Stop TB andthe Global
Fundfor Malaria, AIDS andTuberculosis.

While Malawi has done well inimproving the overall coverage andthe delivery o f some key
health services, the provisiono f qualityhealthservices i s constrainedby dilapidated
infrastructure, shortage o f skilled staff, and limited managementcapacity. Overall, Malawi's


                                                    23

health statistics show an overwhelming needfor strengtheningthe health service, inaddition to
improvingother factors inpeople's lives that affect their health status (see Annex 1).

The project supportsthe 6-year ProgramofWork ofthe MOH, which inturnis basedonthe
MalawiNationalHealthPlanandthe Vision 2020 document. Grounded inthe Malawi Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS), the POWhasbeen endorsedby all the partners inMalawi. The POW
provides abasis for harmonization ofthe activities andwork plansof the various departments
within the MOH. ThePOWshowshow MOHactivities are, andwill be organized onaphase-in
basis for the coming six years. The POWalso describesthe roles andresponsibilities of
institutions at all levels ofthe health care systeminMalawi. Inshort, the districts are expected
to focus on quality service deliverywithin the context o fcomprehensive district healthplanning.
Onthe other hand, the MOHshall assure availabilityof supervisory/technical support to the
districts, andberesponsible for the development ofnecessarypolicies and a regulatory
framework, tracking policy implementation, monitoringandquality control.

3. Fiduciary

Malawi is inthe process ofprocurement reforms. The Public Procurement Act 2003 (No. 8,
2003) was passedbyParliament inMay andbecame effective inAugust, 2003. The main
considerations guidingthe provisions inthe Act are transparency, efficiency andeconomy;
accountability; fair opportunity to all bidders; prevention o f fraud, corruption and other
malpractices; andto promote local capacity. The final version o fthe Public Procurement Act i s
assessedas a good UnitedNations Commission on International Trade law (UNICTRAL) based
procurementlaw The Act will be supplementedbyregulations, desk instructions andstandard
tender and other procurement documents. The final version o fthe regulations and desk
instructions were sent to the Office ofthe President for approval inlate March2004 and
approved inAugust, 2004. The StandardTender Documents are yet to beprepared. The Act
defines methods o fprocurementandconditions for their use; the mainprinciples andprocedures
for methods ofprocurement; the establishmentofthe Office o fDirector o fPublic Procurement
with oversight for public procurement; the establishmentofInternal Procurement Committees
(IPCs) ineachMinistry, Departmentand Parastatal; andreview procedures. The Director ofthe
Office o fPublic Procurement was appointed inFebruary2004. The Act i s generally consistent
with goodpublicprocurementpractice andincludesprovisions for: (i)          effective andwide
advertising o fupcoming procurement opportunities; (ii) opening o fbids; (iii)
                                                          public                        pre-
disclosure o f all relevant information includingtransparent andclear bid evaluation andcontract
awardprocedures; (iv) clear accountabilities for decision making; and (v) an enforceableright of
review for bidderswhenpublic entities breachthe rules. The draft CountryProcurement
Assessment Review (CPAR) was distributedto Government andother Development Partnersin
March 2003. The action plans o fthe CPAR were agreedwith government inJune 2004. The
key actionofthe CPAR, the implementation ofthePublic Procurement Act, establishment and
operationalization o fthe Public Procurement Institutions (Office o fthe Director o fPublic
Procurement, Internal Procurement Committees, Specialized ProcurementUnits)are part o fthe
triggers for the Fiscal Management Program andAccelerating GrowthProgramProject which
was approvedbythe BoardinApril 2004.




                                                  24

A procurement capacity assessment that was carriedout for MOHandCMS indicated ahighrisk
ratingfor the program andactionshavebeenproposedto mitigate the identifiedrisks. The main
risks identified are unfamiliaritywith procurement proceduresofmultilateralfinancial
institutions, weak procurement systems andunreliable quantification ofrequirements for health
sector goods. The actions plannedto address the deficiencies are includedinthe program
activities andinclude (i) intensive training ofmembersofthe PC, M O H and CMS procurement
focal persons, Accounting Staff, InternalAudit Staff, andMedicalBuyingCommittee inthe
application o fthe public procurement procedures-this trainingwill complement the nationwide
training effort to be launched as part ofthe operationalization ofthe Public ProcurementAct; (ii)
hiringofaprocurement advisor to mentorkeyMOHstaffandto assist inprocurement for the
initialperiod ofthe project; (iii) of standardprocessing times; (iv) establishmentof
                                  setting
semiannualreporting requirements; (v) establishmento f a contract performance support system;
(vi) institutionalization of annual independentprocurement audits; (vii) annualreviewo fprior
reviewthresholds basedon findingofthe procurement audits; (viii) use ofBank SBD's and other
standardprocurement documentsuntilNational StandardProcurementDocuments acceptableto
the Bankhavebeen developed and (viii) enforcement o fremedies ifGovernment does not take
appropriate sanctions against officials who flout the agreedprocedures. Work has startedon
some ofthese activities, includingstaff training.

Similarly, a financial managementcapacity assessment undertakenby the Bankrevealed that the
financial management systems ingovernment are generally weak, andthat the capacity i s low.
Managing funds o f the magnitude ofthe SWAPas envisagedwill, therefore, require due
diligence to ensure the smooth implementation ofthe program. The financial management
capacity inlocal assembliesanddistrict hospitals, which will beresponsible for handling funds
for disbursement to beneficiaries i s low. It is expectedthat the NationalLocal Government
Finance Committee (NLGFC) will be involvedinfunds usagemonitoringat district levelto
ensure maximumaccountability. The involvement o fNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
andCHAM units inthe implementationofthe program will bringservices closer to the rural
poor, while beingaccompaniedby sizeable financial managementchallenges.

Issues ofpooling funds for basket donors also bringconsiderable challenges to implementation
inaweak environment for intemalcontrol. An actionplanhasbeendevelopedthat iffollowed
diligently should help address the critical issues observedduringthe assessment. The funds will
flow to all the cost centers largelyusingthe government's existingsystems. MOHwill havethe
responsibilityo f collatinginformation from all the cost centers andgenerating financial
monitoringreports (FMRs) on a quarterly basis. The audit for the program will be conductedby
a firm of chartered accountantsunderthe overall control o fNational Audit Office (NAO).
Overall, giventhe demonstratedwillingness o fthe MOH, supportedby its partners, to rectify the
issues identifiedinthe assessment, the SWAPi s expectedto proceed smoothly. Any glitches
that may develop inthe future are expectedto be ironedout through aprocessof consultation
andpartnershipamong all relevant stakeholders.

social development outcomes (see details inAnnex 10).

Keysocial issuesrelevant to project objectives are: (a) vulnerability; (b) gender equity; (c) links
between health outcomes andpoverty; (d) socio-economic impact o fHIV/AIDS; and(e) user
participationinhealthplanning, decision making, accountability and monitoring.

Basedon the above five key issues, plannedsocial development outcomes are: (a) equity,
including gender equity, inaccess to andquality o fhealth services, andinhealth outcomes; (b)
effective collaboration of government andcivil society inthe delivery o fhealth services; and(c)
accountability ofhealth services to citizens, anduser perceptions reflectedthrough participatory
monitoringandevaluation ofhealth services. Withregardto institutionalarrangementsto ensure
that the SWAPachievesthe above listed social development outcomes, the POWcommits to
institutionalreform andstrengtheningo fsystems at Central andDistrict levels, and also ofnon-
MOHinstitutions, suchas nationalNGOs, CSOs andcommunity levelcommittees. While such
capacity buildingshould contribute to the SWAPachieving its social development outcomes, it i s
important to ensure that commitments outside the M O H structure are adequatelyresourced, their
role and hctions are clear andmainstreamed, andthat participation ofnon-MOH stakeholders
andstructuresispart ofthe SWAP'Saccountability mechanism, andnot limitedto passive
participation.

Relevant stakeholders ofthe SWAp include MOH, private and public service providers,
development partners (donors), parliamentarycommittees (intheir oversight role), district
officials (health management teams), village healthcommittees (VHCs), civil society
representatives(non-service providers) andpoor people. A participatory approachwould be
followed to ensure that all categorieso f above listed stakeholdersare involved during
preparation andimplementation of SWAp.

Duringthepreparationphaseofthe SWAp, incollaborationwiththe MOH, informationwas
sharedand consultations were carried out with other stakeholdersthrough a one day stakeholder
workshop (September2003), and a series o fparticipatory studies, namely: (i)   Malawi: Poverty
Reduction Strategy; (ii) Malawi: InterimPoverty Reduction Strategy; and (iii) Sector
                                                                               Health
Wide Approach Situational Analysis. Duringimplementation ofthe SWAp, incollaboration
withthe MOH, participation of other stakeholderswillbe facilitatedbyperiodic stakeholder
workshops andother participatory mechanisms such as beneficiary impact assessments to share
information and support consultative processes

5. Environment

Potential environmental concerns are limited to two areas: (a) the management o fmedical
waste; and (b) potential environmental and social impacts dueto the construction and
rehabilitation o fhealth care facilities.

Ithasbeen agreedwith the GOMthat anEnvironmental andSocial Management Framework
(ESMF) and aResettlementPolicyFramework(RPF) wouldbebest suitedto identify and


                                                 26

mitigate potential impacts o fthe SWAP, includingthe contribution beingmade throughthe
HSSP, becausethe exact number and locations ofthe new healthcenters are not known at this
time. The ESMF constitutes anenvironmental andsocial screeningprocesswhichwillbe
implementedat the timethe construction andrehabilitation activities are planned. The ESMF
includes the Malawi's Medical Waste Management Plan as an annex to ensurethat the
appropriate measuresinthis regardare taken at the new andrehabilitated health centers. To
address potential social impacts such as loss of livelihoods, loss of access to economic assets or
relocation due to landacquisition, a ResettlementPolicyFramework (RPF) hasbeenprepared.
The draft ESMF andthe draft RPFwere disclosedinMalawi on June 10,2004, andat heBank's
Infoshop on June 15,2004. The final safeguarddocuments were disclosed inMalawi on October
27,2004, andat the Bank's Infoshop onNovember 4,2004, replacing the drafts disclosed earlier.

centers andthe generation o fmedical wastes at these facilities. Potential environmental impacts
are likelyto include soil erosion, soil and water pollutionor loss o fvegetation, while social
impacts may include loss o f landand/or livelihoods due to construction activities as well as the
potential spreadofHIV/AIDS dueto unsanitary disposal of medical waste. To address potential
 future impacts, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) andResettlement
PolicyFramework (RPF)havebeenpreparedanddisclosed by the Recipient. The ESMF
includes the Malawi's MedicalWaste Management Planas anattachment to ensure that medical
waste is managedsafely underthe proposedproject.

 7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

No policy exceptions are sought. The project, which supports the health sector SWAP inMalawi,
 meets the regionalcriteria for readiness for implementation.Specifically, a formal agreementhas
beenreached(through anMOU) betweenthe GoM and all domestic andinternational
 stakeholders supporting the SWAPon the program ofwork. The financing for the programof

                                MALAWI: HealthSector SupportProject

The Malawi HSSP i s designed inthe context o f a medium-term (2004/05 to 2009/10) Joint POW
supportingthe MOH's sector-wide approach (SWAP), incooperation with its development
partners, including the Dm>, the Kingdom ofNorway and IDA. This description o fthe HSSP is
made inthe context of, andbased on, the six components o fthe POW. The HSSP i s also ledby
the vision o f the MOH o f developing a health delivery system capable o fpromoting health,
preventing, reducing and curing disease, protecting life, reducingthe occurrence o fpremature
death and fostering the general well-being and increasedproductivity o f the population.

Background and Rationale

The goal ofthe health sector inMalawi, inthe context o fthe PRSP i s "To raise the level of
health status o f all Malawians by reducingthe incidence o fillness andoccurrence o fpremature
deaths inthe population". It is evident though that despite concerted efforts and increased
investment byboth the government, donors andthe private sector, health indicators inMalawi
remain poor across the board. This view is supported by the trends inboth mortality andother
intermediatehealth outcomes. Inthe last decade alone, life expectancy inMalawi has declined
to 39 years due to, among other factors, the HIV/AIDS epidemic andthe heavy burdeno fother
diseases. Maternal mortalityhas almost doubled from 620 one decade ago to 1,120 deaths per
100,000 livebirths in2000. Infantandchild mortalityrates remainhigh, at 104and 189per
1000livebirthsrespectively, with chronic malnutrition as anever increasing problem.
According to recent estimates, approximately 50% o f children under five are either stunted or
clinically malnourishedwhile a significant proportion o fpregnant women are anemic.

What i s undisputable from the foregoing, is that Malawi i s unlikelyto meet its own health targets
set inthe FourthNationalHealthPlan (2000-2004) and, even less likely, the MDGsin2015.

The major proximate causes o fmorbidity andmortalityinMalawi are largelypreventable. They
include traditional infections such as malaria (which accounts for 30% o f outpatient visits), acute
respiratory infections and acute diarrheal diseases inbothchildren and adults. And, as another
consequence o fthe HIV epidemic, there hasbeen a five fold increaseinTuberculosis, that has
rapidly riseninrank as a cause of chronic illhealth and death. Today, there are up to one million
personsinfected with HIV inMalawi, ten percent are childrenbelow the age of 15 years. And
HN/AIDS related conditions account for over 40% of all inpatient admissions, further stretching
the country's meagerhealth resources. Other major causes o fhighmorbidity andmortality are
malnutrition andconditions related to poor reproductive health as well as complications of
pregnancy and childbirth.

Distalfactors play a major role inthe poor health outcomesinMalawi. They include poverty,
ignorance/low educational attainments, restricted geographical coverage andunsatisfactory
qualityofhealth services. The poor macroeconomic environment inMalawi has raise inpoverty
levels to 65% in2002. Increasedpoverty creates financial barriers to heathcare andincreases
inequities inaccess to services. This i s important inMalawi, where 20% o fthe total healthcost
inthehealthsector are from out ofpocket expendituresand30% ofhealthfacilities inMalawi
belongto NGOs that chargeuser fees at point of service delivery. Such inequities are worsened
bythe unevendistribution ofhealthfacilities andthe qualityofservicesrendered. Forty-six
percent o fthe ruralpopulationlive beyond 5 kmo f a formal health facility. The proportion
drops to 26% whenthe urbanpopulation i s included. The recent JICA study confirmed that
significant geographical variations exist inbothqualityand access to healthcare by district. Out
of the 617health facilities inMalawi, only 10%satisfied the requirements for deliveringthe EHP
onthe basis o favailability of services andstaffing levels. Shortage o f skilledhealthpersonnel is
a bigissue inMalawi andhashad a devastating effect onbothcoverage andquality o fhealth
services. Oncurrent estimates, up to 50% of establishedinstitutionalpostsremain vacant, more
so inruralandpoor districts. Iti s important to acknowledge that although modem medicine i s
highlyregardedinMalawi, traditional medicine is still widelypracticedandcontinues to play a
 significant role inthe lives of a largeportionofthe population.

 The formalhealth system inMalawi consistsofdispensaries, health centers, district andcentral
 hospitals. Healthcare is organized from the grassrootslevelwhere services are providedthrough
 anetwork o f community healthworkers such as communitybaseddevelopment assistants
 (CBDAs), traditional birthassistants (TBAs) and other volunteers. Inaddition to these non-
 salaried providers at this levelare Health Surveillance Assistants who are onthe government



                                                              30

payroll. The various levels o fhealthcare are linked through a referral system based on
increasing capacity to manage complex healthconditions at each level. All this i s based on the
district health concept which will be strengthened bythe new government policy on
Decentralization(GOM, NDP, 1998). For the health sector, this will involve devolutiono f
service delivery to District Assemblies andthe MOHretaining responsibilities o f stewardship
such as policy formulation and enforcement, regulation, standards, trainingexternal relations and
donor coordination.

There is a mix o fpublic and private participationinthe provision o fheath care inMalawi. The
public, through the MOH, is the largest provider (70%), followed bynot-for-profit NGOs,
mostly religious/mission, that account for up to 25% o f facilities. The private for-profit sector is
not stronginMalawi and, apart from one bighospital inBlantyre, theyprovidemostly individual
outpatient services. The capacity o f all institutions to deliver health services has been greatly
reduced by shortages o f staff, and lack o f essential drugs, medical diagnostic equipment and
surgical supplies on a sustained basis. It i s accepted that reforms o fthe Central Medical Stores
(CMS) will be needed to provide abasis for improvedprocurement and availability o f drugs and
supplies. The recently completedEHPEssential Drugs and Supplies List is to be usedto
facilitate procurement o fwhat i s needed for the EHP.

The fourth National HealthPlan(NHP), 1999-2004, laid out the key elements o f a sound health
delivery system andprovided explicit overview o fhealth policies, and set clear objectives,
targets and strategies. The purposes o fthe planwere:

0    To guide the allocation o fnationalresources inthe pursuit andachievement of equitable
     access to quality health care services,
0    To develop and articulate national health ,andhealth relatedpolicies to guide nationalhealth
     development over the planperiod ad,
0    To provide basis for a coordinated andholistic approach to the identification, action planning
     andprioritization ofinterventionsto addressmajor healthproblems.

While some progress has been achieved inthe implementation o fthe 4thNHP, it is clear that
muchwork remains to be done, to bothto achieve the targets ofthe planperiod 1999-2004 and
to place Malawi firmly on the path to achieving the MDGs. It is against this background andthe
need for a more comprehensive, sector-wide response that the EHP concept i s being introduced
 andthe POWdeveloped. The objective o fthe EHPis to improve allocative efficiency inservice
 delivery, ensure universal coverage andprovide cost effective interventions to control the main
 causes o f disease burden inMalawi. The EHP consists o f a cluster of cost effective interventions
 delivered as a packageto reduce transaction costs to boththe patient andthe provider. The
 eleven interventions included are: (i)  Prevention andtreatment o fvaccine preventable diseases;
 (ii) preventionandtreatment;(iii)
     Malaria                                   Reproductive health, including maternalhealth and
 familyplanning; (iv) Prevention andcontrol o fTB; (v) Preventionand treatment of
 Schistosomiasis; (vi) Management o fAcute respiratory Infections; (vii) Prevention and
 treatment o f acute diarrheal diseases; (viii) Prevention andmanagement o f STDs and
 HIV/AIDS; (ix) Prevention and management ofmalnutrition; (x) Management of eye, ear and
 skin infections; and (xi) Treatment o f common injuries. These interventions canbe delivered in
 the same facility, bythe same multi-skilled healthworker using the same level oftechnological
 sophistication. Efficient delivery o fthe EHP requires an able supportive system, including


                                                   31

adequatebudgeting, capacity enhancement, drugs and supplies, laboratory services, community
mobilizationand appropriate monitoring.

The delivery ofthe EHP forms the basis ofthe Joint Program ofWork (Pow). The POWis
effectively equivalent o fthe HNP 2004-2010, but it was not titled as such so that it could be used
as a strategic framework for activity basedhealth sector planningandoperations. The POW
differs from the HNP inother ways too. HNP objectives andactivities were very broad andnot
specific enough and the analysis o fresources and activities were not as detailed. Inaddition, the
POWis a derivative ofthe SWAPDesignreport which hadidentifiedsevenkeycomponents,
namely institutionalcapacity, essentialhealth care delivery, humanresource development
resourcemobilization and allocation, financial management, procurement andhealth
managementandinformation systems as the mainproblemareas inthe health sector inMalawi.
ThePOWwas developedaroundthese seven components, finally reducedto six andform the
basis o f the proposedHSSP.

Strategic Framework

The proposedHSSP aims to support the government's effort to put inplace a health delivery
system responsive to the prevailingneedsbyproviding anEssential HealthPackage(EHP) to the
populationofMalawi, with emphasis onreaching the poor, women and children. The
framework therefore strategically focuses on delivery o fhealth services which primarilytakes
place at the district levelandbelow, improving availability andquality ofhumanresources and
providingthe necessary policy framework, adequateresourcesto strengthenthe healthsystem
and improve its resilience inundertakingtasks defined. Inthis context, Zonal centerswill beset
upto providesupport supervision andtechnical assistanceto the districts while Central Hospitals
will beimprovedto assure effective referrals. Communityparticipation, ownership and
responsibility for health outcomes at household level i s to be emphasizedthrough IEC
interventions, use o f CHWs andincollaboration with ongoing community basedinitiatives such
as MASAF. Theprincipal outcomes expectedfrom this framework are:

         (i)     Improvedaccess to quality health care andEHP for the poor andvulnerable
                     populations;
         (ii)    Improvedhuman resources, especially skilledpersonnel;
         (iii)   Strengthenedhealth systemsthrough equitable health financing, increasedhuman
                     resources, reliable pharmaceutical and supplies logistics andeffective
                     monitoring and evaluation;
         (iv)    Enhancedcapacity ofM O H for stewardshipandpolicy development;
         (iv)    StrengthenedDistrict HealthManagementsystems for planning, budgetingand
                      delivery of quality health services.
         (v)     Fullcommunity participation inplanninganddeliveryofessentialhealth
                     interventions.
It is anticipatedthat these outcomeswouldcontribute to the ultimate goal o fthe health sector in
Malawi, which is to addressthe three MDGsofreducing childmortality, improvingmaternal
health and, linkingwith MASAF, contribute to the eradication ofpovertybyprotecting the
poorest andthe vulnerable from economic loss due to illhealth anddisability. The project would
also contribute to the achievement o f at least four MDGs, includingthat on HIV/AIDS,working
inconcertwiththe Bank's MAPproject andrelatedinitiatives suchasthe GlobalFund.

                         Annex 3: Results Framework and Monitoring
                          MALAWI: HealthSector Support Project

Sector performance will bemonitored andassessed against specific milestones andtargets set for
the implementation ofthe whole POW. Since the HSSP i s providingbudgetsupport through a
common basket to the SWAP, every effort hasbeenmadeto discourageindividualdonors from
imposingtheir own indicators andtargets. Programmonitoringwill therefore be centrally
coordinatedbythe SWAP Secretariat inthe Planning Department ofthe MOH. Service delivery
on the other hand,will bemonitoredbytechnical departments inclose collaboration with the
Secretariat. They will focus onbothprocess indicators andoutputs, especially inthe earlypart
o fHSSP, hopingto focus on outcomes inthe latter part ofthe POWwhich will coincide with
HSSPII. Iti s important to note that Malawihas already put inplace arelativelyvigorous Health
InformationManagement System andhas developed tools, guidelines and an agreed list of 110
indicators which includethe 43 SWAPspecific indicators outlined inthe POW(Table 3).

Inview ofthe aforesaid, theHSSPmonitoringandevaluation frame work doesnotintendto
reinventthe wheel andhaspicked core indicators from the POWlist, infull consultationwith
Senior Technical staff from the Ministryand discussedwith other SWAPpartners. The choice of
indicators i s basedonthe realizationthat: (i)the Bank i s not the major donor to the SWAPand,
(ii) HSSPwillrunforthreeyearswhichisonlyhalfthetotallifeofthecurrentPOW.These
    the
two considerationswere taken into account inthe selectingo fbothoutcome andoutput
indicators were therefore, while makingsure that they were measurableandappropriate
surrogates o fprogressdirectly or indirectly attributable to the Banks contribution. The selected
indicators o fthe HSSP are giveninthe table below.

TheBankwill conduct semi annual support missions, one ofwhich will coincide withthe
Annual Joint review. The Annual Joint Reviewwill be ledbythe MOH and include all the
stakeholdersinthe sector:- Secretary for Health(Chair); All Directors andProject Managers;
Bilateral andmultilateraldevelopment partners; Representatives-College ofMedicine, National
Statistics Office, Ministry ofEconomic Planning & Development, Ministryo fFinance, Local
Government Department, NationalAIDS Commission; RepresentativesofNGOs including
CHAM. The Annual Joint Review Processwill be coordinatedby the SWAPSecretariat. Each
stakeholder i s expectedto preparereports on the POWinputs, processes and outputs of each of
their organizations or departmentscovering the annualplanperiod. The reportswill cover all
agreedindicators disaggregatedappropriately. The SWAp Secretariatwill receive the reports
from all membersinample time to compile into a single sector report for discussion at the
annual Joint Reviewmeeting.

Performance indicators directly linkedto the MDGs: The long-term goal ofthe HSSP i s to
place Malawi firmly on the road to attaining the MDGs. Therefore, every effort willbemade to
ensurethat the MDGfocus i s not blurred. Itis, however, importantto note that while the goals
may not be attainable duringthe life o fthis project, their inspirational value shouldnot be
underestimated. Inthis context, the expectations ofthe HSSP should berealistic, taking into
account the annual allocation ofthis investment (US$SM) versus the estimated annual cost o f
EHP (US$100M) andthe total needs for the health sector inMalawi which are muchbigger.
This consideration notwithstanding,four of the MDGs are particularlyrelevant to the HSSP:

(i)ReduceExtremePovertVandHunper:

Target: By 2010, protect the poorest from financial loss due to illhealth; improve food security
andnutrition.

Indicators: Proportion ofpopulation accessing free EHP (by quintile/district); Trends inper
capita government allocation to the health sector; proportionofbudgetaryallocation to health
centers; prevalence ofU-5stunting and % LBW newboms.

(ii)ReduceChildMortality:

Target: by2010, reducechildmortality byone third.

Indicators: % LBW newboms; % fully immunized at lyear


(iii)ImproveMaternalHealth:

Target: by2010, reduceby25% the MMR.

Indicators: %births attendedby skilled attendant, '?LO facilities without 7-day stock out o f
essentialEHP drugs/commodities (including FP); '?LO facilities offering emergency obstetric care
(EmOC); %health centers with minimum staffing norms;

(iv) Arresneduce HIV/IDS prevalence in pregnant women and vouth:

Target: by 2010, reverseHIVtrends and reduceprevalenceby 25% inpregnancy.

Indicators: antenatalHIVprevalence; % increaseinPMTCT programs andVCT; # infected on
ARVs; TB curerates

Pro-poor Performance Indicators supportive of the MDGs are the following:

(a) Improvedstewardshiprole ofthe M O H and successfulo fdecentralization o fthe sector (%
GOMallocation to the health sector; proportionofbudgetallocation to districts andhealth
centers; % facilities supervisedregularlyby DHMTs).
(b) Increasedgeographical andphysicalaccessibility ofEHP (% facilities with ability to
effectively provide EHPO; proportiono fpopulationwithin easy reach of EHP).
(c) Improvedhumanresource situation andavailability of essentialinputs (comprehensive HRM
plan; annualtraining output for skilledstaffandHSAs; %new graduatesfrom training colleges
employed inthe health sector inMalawi; % facilities without stock outs).
(d) Increasedutilizationof servicesbythe poorandstronger community satisfaction, ownership
andparticipation inhealthactivities (% institutionalbirths;numberofVHCs establishedand
functioning)

                              Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
                            MALAWI: HealthSector Support Project

This Annex provides the detailed project description ofthe Malawi Health Sector Support
Project (HSSP).

Development Objective and Project Components

The development objective ofthe HSSP is to improve effectiveness, efficiency and equity in
the delivery of essential healthy services in Malawi.

The proposed HSSPwould achievethe stateddevelopment objective over the next six years and,
basedon the foregoing, would strategically have three components, exclusively drawn from the
joint Programo f Work:

        (a)   Support extension of quality health care coverage through delivery of EHP,
        (b) Support humanresource development andmanagement, and
        (c)  Strengthen health support and referralsystems.

As already stated, the choice ofthe three componentsis strategic sincethey cover the core
deficiencies diagnosedbythe SWAPdesign analysis andthey are also congruent with the POW.
Duringthe first year ofthe HSSP, agradualbuildupandofthejoint POWis expected. The
usualproblems oftransition are also envisagedas the EHP concept is rolled out. Year two
would beusedto remedy any deficiencies and shortcomings observed duringthe first year
leadingto the all important Mid-termreview. The recommendations ofthe MTR, which shall
include assessment of the progressagainst performance indicators, would be usedto consolidate
the gains and ensure that the project i s on course duringthe secondhalfo f its life.

Component 1: Support extension of quality health care to deliver EHP. The objective of
this component i s to improvehealth status ofMalawians by increasing coverage and access to
quality services. The mainmechanismfor deliveringquality care would bebymakingthe
already definedEHP accessibleto all, with special attention to the most rural and disadvantaged
districts andto the poorest andvulnerable populations. The component would support
community sensitization and mobilization as well as establishment of standardsandpackages of
careto be delivered at each level-community, health center, district and central hospitals. In
addition, the component will also support in-service update o fhealthworker and management
skills inorder to improve staffperformance and strengthen service provision. Efficient logistics
andsustainedavailability ofpharmaceuticals,medicalandlaboratory equipment andsupplies, so
critical for effective delivery o fthe EHP, will also be supportedbythis component. The EHP
will beintroduced inanincremental mannerby adapting and strengthening existingservicesto
co-opt the EHP concept. It is understood that some infrastructural improvement will beneeded
to ensure that all health facilities can supportthe delivery o fthe EHP. It is not the intentionof
this componentto spendheavily on this aspect and will bemanagedthrough fine balancing o f
the pace of infrastructural development with availability of staff andother considerations.

Component 2: Support human resource development and management3 The objective o f
this componentis to alleviate the severe shortageofhumanresourcesdueto inadequatecapacity
oftraining institutions andinability o fthe sector to retain staffrequired to deliverthe EHP.
Vacancy rate among "skilled" healthworkers inthe M O HinFY02/03 reached57.8 percent,
being most severe inthe senior andmiddlelevelcadres(74.4 percent and 67.1 percent,
respectively). In2004, it i s estimatedthat 64 percent of all MOHnursingposts, 27 ofthe
clinical officers' posts, and53 percent ofthe medical assistants' posts are vacant. Inresponse,
the MOHis already implementing the Six-Year Emergency Pre-Service TrainingPlan, which
will be supportedbythis component. Inlinewiththis strategy, the component would support the
planto fillhumanresourcevacancies in the sector, strengthenthe ability o fthe sectorto retain
staffinbothpublic and CHAM institutions and integrate in-service training ofhealthworkers to
replace the current `program focused' approach. The component would pay special attention to
addressingthe perennial problem ofinequitablegeographical distribution o fhealthworkers, as a
way of ensuring effective delivery of EHP indisadvantagedrural districts. The component
would also work with the MAPproject to mitigate the impact ofHIV amonghealthworkers.
ARVs wouldbemade available to healthworkers to prolonglife andreduce absenteeism among
the infected. The component will also work closely with MASAFto improve delivery ofEHP at
community level through coordinated training of CHWs andHSAs.

Component 3: Strengthen health support and referral systems:                  The objective of this
component is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of both the health system and the
referral network to support delivery of the EHP. It will be divided into two subcomponents: (i)
Support for central operations and, (ii)Support to district operations. Greater emphasis will
beplacedon support to operations at district andlower levels.

Sub-component 3.1:Support for Central ODerations: This sub-componentwould strengthen
institutionalprocesses aimed at enhancingcentral support to implementation the SWAp inthe
deliveryofthe EHP andthe decentralization ofthe health sector The aimis to putinplace
policies, coordination andregulatory frameworks, organizational structures, procurement and
financial instruments, trainingprograms, information andmonitoring andevaluation systems-
that would enablethe M O Hto effectively steward the POW. The central operations would focus
on managing the processof decentralization andbe geared towards effective support o fthe
devolved district health system. Specific output areas for the subcomponentinclude: Policies
andplanningsystems to support EHP;Healthfinancing andfinancial managementsystems;
Procurement policy andlogisticalsystem for drugs, equipment and supplies; Equitable
distributionof financial andhumanresources; Developmentof standards andquality assurance
systems; Cross-cutting issues; Support supervision, includingZonal support; Healthinformation
systems for monitoring andevaluation.

Sub-component 3.2: Support for District operations: The objective ofthis sub-component in
the devolvedhealth system is to strengthencoordination andplanningto ensure uninterrupted
availability andmaintenance of adequate financial, material andhumanresourcesto effectively
deliver the EHP inthe districts and for bothM O H andNGO services. Specific out put areas
include: Orientation of staffandother stakeholderson SWAPandthe concept o fEHP; Timely
preparationofhighquality District Implementation Plans (DIPS); Financial management;

Procurement, storage and distribution o f adequate drugs equipment and supplies; Effective
communication andreferral framework; Effective execution o f other routine operations by
DHMTs; Strengthening community participation and delivery o f EHP, including intersectoral
linkages; Effective linkages with M A S A F and qualitytechnical advice to District Assemblies.

Implementation Challenges

HSSP is based on SWAP principles, and i s in the spirit o f the PRSP. It derives exclusively from
the POWwhich i s a joint strategy for providing the Essential Health Package as a form o f
rationed care targeted at the poor and most vulnerable. The institutional arrangements for the
implementation o f the POWrevolve around effective collaboration o f various stakeholders in
supporting a single health agenda. This may well be realized through the MOU. But even then,
the following practical implementationschallenges are bound to emerge:


     0   Mobilization o f adequate resource envelop from the government, development partners,
           NGOs andthe private sector to facilitate the implementationo fthe POW.
     0   Allocation o fresources inan equitable manner andutilize them inthe most efficient and
           effective manner.
     0   Translation o f the POWinto implementable activities with set targets at every level cal
           level.
     0   Puttinginplacethe necessarycapacity andinstitutional arrangements inthe context o f
           a decentralized health system.
     0   Providing adequate support to the DHMTto plan, budget andimplement the DIPS.
     0   Developing appropriate modalities for the flow o f resources to where they are required
           most, the point o fbenefit by the community.
     0   Developing andmaintaining an effective monitoring and evaluation framework.

For the HSSP to succeed itmust invest time and effort inensuring that the partnershipworks and
every stakeholder adheres to the POW,even though at times patience may be put to test.

                            Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements

                           MALAWI: HealthSector SupportProject

This is the first SWAP inthe health sectorinMalawi; itwill be ledbythe MinistryofHealth.
Direct implementation experience of SWAps inthe health sector i s limited, but the
implementation arrangementshave been designed drawing on experience from health SWAps in
neighboring countries withmore mature programs (especially Tanzania, Zambia and
Mozambique), from other sectors inMalawi e.g., education and agriculture, andthe Malawi
HIV/AIDSprogram. The SWAP encompassesthewhole ofthe healthsector, includingthe
extensive CHAMprogramwhose activities are well dovetailed with the mainstreamM O H
program. Other thanfor oversight purposes and small grant programs, it excludes the private
commercial sub-sector (which is very small), andthe smaller NGOs.

While the MOHhas no direct experienceof SWAps, it has for many years beenmanaging and
coordinating its ownprograms together with those of awide rangeof donors. Its overall general
implementation experienceis therefore substantial. The M O Hi s regardedwithinMalawi as
among the strongest andbest managedministries inthe country, bothcentrally and at the district
level. CHAM ?&BLMi s an independentumbrellabody with its member church organizations
againhaving a good track recordbothof service delivery ando f coordinating with the MOH.
Approximately one year ago, the MOHandCHAM formalized their relationship through a
detailed Memorandum ofUnderstanding. MOHand CHAMtogether provide a goodbasefor
implementingthe SWAP.

Thisnotwithstanding, as discussed extensively elsewhere, substantial deficiencies andchallenges
remain. Onepart of the responseto this, which i s somewhat unusual, is that the MOHhas
introduced apolicy as part ofthe SWAPpreparation process of encouraging long-term
implementation orientated technical assistanceanddiscouraging short-term advisory technical
assistance. To promote timely implementation, longterm technical assistanceinthe key areas o f
financial management, monitoring andevaluation, andprocurement andis beingrecruited.

ThePrincipalSecretaryMOHis overall responsible for SWAPimplementationincludingthe
outputs andquality assurance. To guide and advisehimadetailed `governance' structure for the
SWAPhasbeenestablished. This structurebuildsuponandmodifies arrangementsfor
ministerial anddonor coordination that were already operational. Details are included inthe
MOU, but the line managementstructuresincludea Top Management Committee, a Senior
Management Committee -both chairedby the Principal Secretary for Health and serviced bythe
SWAPSecretariat-andDepartmentalMeetings. Onthe advisory side, there is aHealthSector
Review Group (the main donor/govemment group) with sub-groups on selectedkeytopics.

Within the MOHandCHAM, day-to-day implementation ofthe SWAPfundedactivities will be
implemented bythe responsible subjectltechnical departments and units followingthe agreed
detailed annualwork plans. To ensure full ownership andcapacity buildingwithinthe MOH, no
project implementation unitwill be established. A three person SWAP Secretariatis being
established, that will deal mainlywith the donors, monitoringand evaluation, and facilitate the
implementation o fthe SWAPgovemance structure. The head o f the SWAPSecretariatreports to

the Directoro f Planningand the PlanningDepartmentwill continue to take the lead inthe
substantiveaspects o fthe SWAp, as they have done throughout the preparation process. The
Director ofPlanning i s of course responsible for coordination with senior staff and especially the
ChiefTechnical Adviser, DepartmentHeads, and with CHAM. Procurement of goods, works
andserviceswill bethe responsibility ofthe Headofthe (to be established) MOHProcurement
Unit,working closely withthe (toberecruited) ProcurementAgent/Adviser, theDirectorof
Finance andDirector of Planning. The Director ofFinancewill beresponsible for all financial
management and accounting matters under the SWAp. Further details on procurement and
financial management are giveninAnnexes 7 and 8.

At present, the MOHoperates acentralized managementsystem, butwiththe four Central
Hospitals enjoying an increasinglevelof autonomy, andthe District HealthTeams (including the
District Hospitals) that have only limited administrative and financial powers. It i s government
policy that ministries decentralize. The M O Hrecently devolved the managementofHealth
Centersinthe maincities to the city councils. MOH's planis to prepare for full phased
devolution to the DistrictAssemblies over the comingseveral years. Manymanagerial,
administrative, political, reporting andcommunications issueshaveyet to be addressed-but the
SWAPwillbeinstrumental infacilitatingthis process. Beneficiary consultation and
involvement will, of course, become more systematic. Devolutionto districts will be amajor
change inthe way inwhich the SWAPis implemented; it will be a major focus ofthe annual
reviewprocess.

The SWAP provides animportantvehicle for developing national implementation systems and
capacity. The establishment and expansionof common implementation systems i s animportant
feature of the SWAp, bothto buildcapacity andto reduce waste on parallelsystems and
procedures. Iti s expectedthat all major donors to the health sector will participate inthe SWAp,
thusofferingthe opportunity for increasedcooperation. Ultimately, itishopedthat this will
facilitate andencourage all donors to move towards a common set of implementation procedures
-andthenceprogramsupport-forthegovernment'stotalhealthprogram. Comparedwith
neighboring countries, there are relatively few donors actively involvedinthe healthsector,
whichwill simplifythis process. However, this also makes the sector vulnerable to the very
frequent changes inindividual donor healthrepresentatives. This has slowedpreparation and
remains arisk to effective implementation.

SWAPfinancing originates from two groups of sources. Thosepartners able to pool funds
(DFID,the KingdomofNorway, AfDB andIDA-togetherwiththe government ofcourse) and
those partners who are not (which include USAID, JICA, and some o fthe UNagencies). The
latter group will finance health sector activities underthe SWAp umbrella, but typically using
project modalities. Thepooling(or basket) partners will provide funds to a common account that
i s replenished quarterly". The joint disbursementmethods, financial management, reporting,
procurement, auditing, etc., are formalized ina detailed Memorandum ofUnderstanding,which
all parties have signed. Arrangements for the non-pooling partners andthe poolingpartners are
describedsomewhat separatelyinthe Memorandum ofUnderstanding (Parts A andB
respectively).

  DFIDandthe KingdomofNorwaywillputthe majority oftheir funds for the poolbut, inaddition, continue to
finance a limited number o fprojects.

Summaryof FinancialManagementCapacityAssessment

Using"Fiduciary Arrangements for Sectonvide Approaches (SWAPS):InterimGuidelinesto
Staff' issuedbythe World Bank on November 22,2002 ,it was concluded that the programwill
beimplementedinahighrisk environment. This conclusion is derivedfrom low capacity for
implementation at MOHheadquarter and district level. Thepresenceof a significant level o f
arrears at district level is another potential risk to SWAP funds since funds are fungible5. Owing
to a multiplicity of actors some o fwhich will operate at community anddistrict level, one ofthe
obvious potential risks is the lack of accountability at national, district andother lower levels o f
implementation o fthe SWAPactivities. Another risk for the SWAPis the absence o f formulae
for dividingthe funds flowing to adistrict between district hospitals andCHAMunits for the
implementation ofthe Essential HealthPackage(EHP) which i s the basis o fthe SWAP. The risk
arises from the fact that funds for implementationo fhealth activities at district levelgo into a
District HealthOfficers account-which is like apool account for all health activities for the
district. H e decidesthe amount ofresourcesto go to CHAM units inthe district andgovernment
hospitals. Ina situation where the funding i s less than the budget, the DHOuses his discretion in
determining what amounts should go to district and CHAM units.

At national level, the 2003 Country Financial AccountabilityAssessments(CFAA) andthe 2001
Public Expenditure Review (PER) outline problems ofbudget execution inensuringthat the
allocated resources areutilized efficiently for the intendedpurposes andinobtaining comfort
that value for money has been achieved. Inadequatelinkage betweenpolicies andbudget
processeshave made it impossible to measureoutputs from activities where resourceshave been
utilized. Lack o f compliance with establishedfinancial regulationshave renderedineffective all
forms ofinternal controlinthe public sector makingthe existing systems even weaker.

Financialmanagementsystems ingovernment are generally weak andcapacity i s low.
Managingfunds ofthe magnitude ofthe SWAPas envisagedwill require tact anddiligence to
ensure the program is implementedwith few problems. CHAM units which will receive funds
from the program have low capacity despite havingrigorous monitoringmechanisms for usage.

The financial managementcapacity inlocalassembliesanddistrict hospitalswhichwill be
responsible for handlingfunds for disbursementto beneficiaries is low. The National Local
Government Finance Committee (NLGFC) willbeinvolvedinfunds usagemonitoringat district
level to ensure maximumaccountability. The GlobalFundis working on a strategy to employ or
engagetwo enforcement officers per district to ensurethat the prescribed financial systems
procedures are operated as prescribed. This will enhance capacity through policingandensuring
that people know andunderstandwhat they are supposedto do. The involvementofNon
Government Organizations (NGOs) is anotherrisk interms oftheir lack accountability.

 Arrears at district levelhave arisen from insufficiency o f grant funds from government to districts for the
implementation o f district health activities..As such, a number of suppliers at district level o f food items to
hospitals, water,electricity, cost of local medicines have beenunpaid for quite sometime. Owing to pressure to pay
off such suppliers, the SWAP funds may be utilized for payingthem off.

While preliminarydetails on funds flow relating to pooled funding have so far been determined,
itis likelythat they willbringconsiderablechallengesto implementationinaweak environment
for internal control whose capacity is verymuch depleted. Inview o f such challenges, an action
planhasbeendevelopedwhich includes engagementofanumberofbodies plusaresident long
term financial managementadvisor to supervise the execution of accounting functions ofthe
ministry. The actionplanbelow outlines someofthe keyactionsto beundertakenbythe
MinistryofHealth.

Action Planto MitigateAgainstthe risksidentified

The following actions shouldbetaken:

        Reducevacancy rates ininternal audit to less thantwenty percent-by September30,
        2005.
        Draw up a program o f filling invacant positions at district level. Furtherwork with
        MASAF andthe decentralization secretariatto develop a capacity buildingprogram for
        districts to be fundedby government andbilateral donors-June 30,2005.
        Take debt stock for eachdistrict anddecidethe modalityofbuying it back or payingit
        off - December 31,2004

        implementation-by December 31,2004
        Fillup fiftypercent ofthe vacancies for intemalaudit byJune 30,2005.


InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

Themainimplementor ofthe Programofwork developedbythe sector is the MinistryofHealth.
Other implementersofthe program will be ChristianHospitalAssociation inMalawi (CHAM)
units, Nongovernmental orgahizations (NGOs), and district hospitals. Within the M O H day-to-
day implementationof the SWAPfunded activities will be implemented bythe responsible
subject/technical departments andunits at headquarterand district level following the agreed
detailed annualwork plans.

ThePrincipal Secretary of M O His the overallresponsible officer for SWAP implementation
includingthe outputs and quality assurance. The linemanagement structures include a Top
Management Committee, a Senior Management Committee -bothchaired by the Principal
Secretary for Healthand servicedby the SWAPSecretariat-andDepartmental Meetings. On
the advisory side, there is aHealth Sector Review Group (the maindonor/govemment group)
with sub-groups on selectedkey topics.

To ensure full ownership and capacity buildingwithin the MOH, no project implementationunit
will be established. A three personSWAP Secretariatis beingestablished, that will dealmainly
withthe donors, monitoringandevaluation, andfaditate the implementation o fthe SWAP
governance structure. The head of the SWAPSecretariatreports to the Director o fPlanning who
will continue to take the leadinthe substantiveaspects ofthe SWAPimplementation. The

Director of Finance will beresponsiblefor all financial management andaccounting matters
underthe SWAP.

BudgetaryandAccountingSystem

The Budget structure for the government ofMalawi is dividedinto recurrent anddevelopment.
The budgeti s operatedon a cashbudget system. Guidance for its formulation is currently
governed bythe Public Finance ManagementAct (No. 7, 2003), assisted by Treasury circulars.
The Act stipulates various accounting requirements from government entities which are vote
centers and government managedprojects ingeneral. The instructions define reporting
requirements, responsibilities andlevelof authority within eachMinistry andthe types o fbooks
to bemaintained for purposes of accountability relatingto budget implementation. The Treasury
instructions andcirculars require all government ministries to submit monthlyexpenditure
returns which are usedas atool for monitoringbudget execution. The report outlines
expenditures incurred duringthe month, against budget, variance from budget ,commitments
made andcashbalances intheir holding accounts at the Reserve Banko fMalawi at the endo f
suchmonths.

The recurrent budget preparationcycle formally beginswhenthe Ministryo fFinance issues a
Treasury circular advising ministries to start preparing their budgets. Overallthemes and
priorities for the budgetare communicated inthis and subsequent Treasury circulars. Budgets
are revised, aggregatedandmergedinto one document, and final adjustments are madebefore
presentation to Parliament.

The development budgetis a summary of investment expenditures, comprisingmostlyof capital
andsupporting operating costs. Itaccountsfor closeto forty percent ofnationalbudget. Most of
development budgetinMalawii s donor funded.

Thepreparation ofindividualministrybudgetsis supposedto bedone through Activity Based
Budgeting(ABB). ABB was introduced as part ofthe MTEFreforms inorder to facilitate the
implementation ofprioritizationbythe MTEFprocess and to enable improvedmonitoring o f
expenditure. ABB is intended to reflect the new output focus o fpublic expenditure management.
Inaddition, ABB allows for abottom-up approachto budgetingsinceindividualactivitybased
budgetsare preparedbycost center managers.

The draft budgetdocument is sent to Parliament for further review, approval andthe passing of
the AppropriationAct authorizing government to draw funds from the ConsolidatedFund.
Treasury consolidates and draws up the approved budget. The Minister of Finance issues a
General Warrant authorizing the Controlling Officers to incur expenditureon the approved
budgets. Ifpassingofthe Appropriation Act is delayed byParliament, the Minister ofFinance is
allowed to issue a Special Warrant authorizing Controlling officers to incur limited expenditure
on their budgetsup to three months subject to the passing o fthe AppropriationAct. When the
Appropriation Act i s passed, a General Warrant supersedes the Special Warrant.

The basis of accounting within the government of Malawi is cash. The SWAP will use
government systemswhich are currently beingcomputerized under the IntegratedFinancial



                                                 51

Management System(IFM1S). This IFMIShasbeen rolledout to the Ministryof Healthandwas
expectedto be fully operational bythe endofthe first quarter o f 2005. This hasnot yet
happenedowingto teethingproblems ofthe system. As such, the prescribedmanual systemof
usingvote ledgersfor recordingtransactionsofthe SWAPwill beutilizedtill IFMISsystem is
fully operational andfunctional withinthe Ministry ofHealth. The MOHhas atotal staff
compliment o f forty six staffwho will adequatelyoperatethe manual systemunder the
supervision o fthe longterm consultant. The districts would also be usingthe manual system
where they also operatevote ledgers for recording all transactionsrelatedto the program.The
systemwill use CODA financials software which has five modules. These arebudget,
procurement, commitment, payment andcheck writer modules. Overall, CODA Financials is
such that it restricts usageto the users, and usageis dependenton entering correct passwords.
Security level features ofthe software specifies various security levels which various security
groups can access to post to eachaccounting period. Eachsecurity group can display a grid,
which enables a user to set current periodand security level for eachperiodineach financial
year.

These modules have anumber of major controls as follows: Inthe budgetmodule, no payment
canbemade ifnot budgeted for. Each spendingunit cannot overspend. All virement has to be
authorizedbythe Ministry o fFinance within items. Inthe commitment module, a commitment
can only be done ifthere are funds available. As soon as this is done, the commitment shouldbe
recorded andupdated for any transaction. Inthe payment module, authorization should first be
obtained before it is made. Matchingo finvoices against deliveryo f goods andLocalpurchase
orders i s amustbefore makingapayment.

Within a chequepayment module, authorization must first be obtainedbeforepayment is made.
Signatories are segmented. Above MK100,OOO signaturesofthe Accountant General are sought.
Documents submittedare checkedbefore a chequeis finally issued. Thepayment module
requires one to enter a usemame andpasswordto log on. Only users who have the capability to
pay andprocesschequescan logonthe module. After the chequehasbeenprintedthe
supervisor hasto post the transaction to the cashbook. Oncethe chequehas beenprinted, it
cannot be reprintedwithout the supervisor authorizing it again. The funding system involves the
allocation o f spendinglimits on eachbank account on the basis ofwhich ministries and
departmentsshall draw cheques. Thetotal amount drawn shall not exceedthe authorized
funding/CCA limits.

Inthe procurement module, for transaction to beprocessed, ithasto go throughthe procurement
module. For the processing to happen, they have to enter their password into the system. Inthe
procurement module, the requisition entry clerk prepares an Internalpurchaserequisitiono fthe
requisition, which has to be authorizedby supervisor. After authority, the supervisor raises an
LPO that goes to the requisitionentry clerk. The requisition entry clerk produces a goods
receivednote before matching the invoice. The invoice matchedbythe requisitionentry clerk
has to be authorized bythe supervisor before it i s posted for payment. When raising anLPO,
specification of an element combination. Any element combination not found inFUNDINGwill
berejectedbythe system when closingthe document. WhenpreparinganIPRyou specify the
supplier andthe items. Ifthe supplier is not found inthe systemthe one cannot proceedwith the
transaction. All suppliers inthe databaseare createdcentrally at the Accountant General's

department. The suppliers inthe system are also linked to the items they are supposed to supply.
When funds on a particular budget item are not available, the system rejects any transaction on
that particular budget item.

The cashbookmaintenance system ensures that at the endof each day, the operatingaccounts
must be resolvedto show a zero balance. This involves posting the cash equivalent of checks
written from the holding account to the operating account.

Government o fMalawi (GOM) will open a Foreign Exchange (FOREX) Account with Reserve
BankofMalawi. Allthe pooledDonorPartners@Ps) will deposit all their quarterly
contribution as per agreedannualprogram ofwork inthat bank account inan agreedproportion
each quarter. Transfers from this account will bemade on amonthlybasis inproportionto the
amount requiredto finance the programofwork throughthe Ministryof Finance on advice from
the MinistryofHealthinto aMalawi Kwachaaccount. The deposit for the first quarter will be
made on the basis ofthe funds requirement for the first six months. All the subsequenttransfers
on a quarterlybasiswill bemade onthe basis ofFinancial MonitoringReports (FMRs).

GOMwill withdraw from this FOREX accountto a Malawi KwachaHolding account on a
monthlybasis-basedonthe funds requirement for agivenmonth. GOM's share ofthe pool
expenditure will bemade directly to this account also on amonthlybasis.

This holdingaccountwill thenbeusedfor makingpayments to CHAM account on advice from
the Ministryo fHealth. These funds will be disbursedto CHAM unit accounts for the
implementation o ftraining courses for healthpersonnel-especially nursesandmedical assistants.
Fundsmeantfor the implementationof the EssentialHealthPackagecomingout ofthe SWAP
will bedisbursedfrom this account into adesignatedaccountmanagedbythe DistrictHealth
Officer (DHO) at eachdistrict level. The DHO will, usingan agreedformulae andbasedon an
agreedwork program, determine how mucho fthe resources shouldbepaidto govemment
hospitals andCHAM units for the implementation o fthe EHP. The same holdingaccount will
be usedto pay to CHAM funds meant for top up o f salaries for personnel working inCHAM
units through out the country.

Fundsfrom discretepartnerswill flow intothe ReserveBankofMalawiwhere a separate
holdingaccountwill be openedfor eachdonor. The foreign currency disbursedwill be
converted into local currency at this point at a rate o f exchangeruling on the day o ftransfer. The
holding account is atransit account at the Reserve Bank of Malawi establishedto regulate the
flow of funds into the operating account maintained bythe Ministry ofHealthfor the SWAp.

Fundsto NGOswillbepaidfrom the holdingaccount into designatedaccountsopenedbyNGOs
for purposes of implementing the SWAPactivities. Specific criteria for disbursingto anNGO
are beingdevelop which will guide disbursementsto such institutions. NGOs are supposedto
have aplano f activities that fit into the EHP line o f activities, should have an accountant and
two years audited accountsto participate inthis SWAp.

Accountability of disbursedfunds

Owingto anumber o fplayers participating inthe program, the M O Hhas devisedrobust means
of ensuringaccountability at eachlevel of implementation to safeguardthe funds fiom misuse
andensure that funds are targetedtowards proper usageandachievement o fits intendedgoals.
At national level, external auditors will becarrying out abi-annual audits. Quarterly financial
reports will beproduced for purposeso f accountability and disbursements. At district level,
district hospitals, CHAM units andNGOs will beproducing monthly financial reports coupled
withphysical/output reports to be consolidated at the SWAP secretariatethroughthe Directorof
Finance at the Ministry o fHealth. Further criteria for involvement o f NGOsto weed out brief

case ones hasbeendevised. For anNGO to participate inthe SWAP,it must show that it
belongsto the Congress ofNongovernmental organizations inMalawi (CONGOMA) andbe
registered with the NGOBoardo fMalawi. Inaddition, it should have an accountant and an
intemalauditor inplace and fmally have beenaudited for the last two fiscal years to
demonstrate its own levelof accountability. EachNGO shall sign a separateM O Uwith the
MinistryofHealthWithinwhich specific financial managementaccountability tenetswillbe
spelt out. All CHAM units willbe allowed to participate inthe SWAP owingto their vast
coverage inproviding medical services inMalawi. They will be requiredto have an accountant
inpositionasprovidedfor intheir CHAMFinancialregulationsmanual,be auditedannually (if
any backlogof audits-be upto date), submitmonthly reports to CHAM secretariat for
consolidation, and demonstratethat the units are able to submit liquidationreportsevery month.
Inaddition, eachCHAMunitshall ensurethat it abidesbyrequirements ofarticle Eighton
financial accountability o f funds as provided for inthe Memorandum o fUnderstandingbetween
the Government o fMalawi andCHAM. Inaddition to this, eachunit shall operatewithin the
fiduciary confines of a separateM O Uto be signedbetweenthe Ministry of HealthandCHAM

Accountabilities for districthospitals andrelated capacity buildingprogram are beingfurther
developedto ensuremaximumaccountability.

InternalAudit

The MOHhas an internal audit function whose mainobjective is to assist management improve
the level of intemalcontrol inthe ministry. The capacity of the unit was assessed and found to
be inadequate. More staffneedto be employedto fillthe more than 80% vacancy rate init and
perform its program on arisk basedapproach. The governments Central internal audit unit i s in
the processo frecruitingmore internal auditors for the Ministry o fHealth and other government
departments andministries.

ManagementinformationSystems

The MinistryofHealthhasjust establishedanintegrated Healthmanagementinformation
system(HMIS) designedto provideprogrammanagersandstaffwithreports onhow well each
program is functioning andto alert the service providers andprogram managersto take timely
necessarycorrective actions. MOHis inthe process o f computerizing its accounting systems
through the IFMIS. It is hopedthat there will be an interface between the H M I S andIFMISto
help synchronize the piecesofinformation.

FinancialReportingFormats

The program will prepare andproduce quarterlyFinancial MonitoringReports ( F M R s ) which
will beconsolidated for the programsbi-annual reviewmeetings. Thesereports will comprise a
financial, output monitoring andprocurement reports. These reports will provide informationon
the progressofthe programinterms of financial activity, key output measuresandprocurement
for the relevant period. As for the financial reports, they shall include statement showingfor the
period andcumulatively cashreceipts by sources andexpenditures bymain expenditures
classification, beginningand endingcashbalancesofthe program; and supporting schedules



                                                 56

comparing actual andplannedexpenditures. The reporting line items inthe FMRswill follow
the programs chart of accounts. The chart of accounts usednow by government will have to be
revised to further reflect activities o fthe SWAp. The cumulative FMRsover the project year
will be consolidated andusedas the programs financial statements. This will result inamore
cost effective reporting.

As for outputreports, the programwill include anarrative write up andoutput indicators linking
financial informationwith activity indicators andhighlight issues that require attention. In
procurement reports underthe FMRs, such reports will provide informationon the procurement
of goods, pharmaceuticals, drugs. Draftreporting formats for CHAMDistrict hospitals, NGOs
andother players are underdesignto ensure consistency andcomprehensivenature ofreports.

The currency ofthe FMRswillbethe MalawiKwachawith the equivalent indollars as aparallel
column. This will becomebeneficial since the books of accounts for the program will bekept in
Kwacha, those of the special account will be indollars which will give rise to issues of
translation. The FMRpreparationand submission will be done on a quarterlybasis. These
FMRswillbeusedas abasisofdisbursements. Thereports will besubmittedto the Task Team
Leader within 45 days o f the reportingperiod. IfsuchFMRs are not providedtimely, the Task
Team Leader will follow this up with the SWAPsecretariateto determine the reasonfor the
delay andplanneddate for submission. Late submissionmay result inthe application of legal
remedies for noncompliance.

While the Financial Monitoring Reports have beendrafted bythe MinistryofHealth, they are
currently inthe process o freviewbefore negotiation starts onNovember 1,2004. Theywill be
reviewedbefore negotiation andwill be attachedto the MOUas anannex after review.

Counterpartcontribution

Counterpart contribution has beenaprobleminMalawi portfolio inthe past five years. Whilst a
draft note hasbeenprepared on financingparameterswithin the Bank's policy andguidelines on
expenditureeligibilitypaper for Malawi, it is expected that its outcome will ensure that the
Government ofMalawi plays its part inensuringthat adequatemonthlycashreleasesare made to
meet the counterpart contribution aspects o fthe program. Further, the passage of the Eligibility
ExpenditurePaper, which gives flexibility to what canbe financedbythe World Bank,it is
expectedthat the policy shall be applicable to the IDA financing for this program which may
reducethe level of counterpart contribution required.

Audit Arrangements

Audit ofPublic Enterpriseswhich include governmentministries, programs andprojects is the
responsibility o fthe NationalAudit Office inMalawi as articulated inthe Constitution o fthe
republic andthe Public FinanceManagement Act. TheNational audit office uses International
Organization of SupremeAudit Institutions (INTOSAI) standardswhen carryingout its audits.
Annual and semi-annual audits ofthe SWAP programwill be carried out by aprivate auditor
acceptable to all cooperating partners participating inthe SWAp. The draft terms ofreference
for carryingout the two types of audits have been done and agreedwith the government o f



                                                 57

Malawi officials. The annual audit will assesswhether: (a) the informationinfinancial
statementsi s fairly presentedfor the specifiedperiodandcumulatively, (b) reported
disbursements were made inaccordancewith the Credit Agreement and (c) determine whether
expenditures as reported are appropriately supportedby adequatedocumentationrelating to
expenditures.

Owing to the numberof componentsandthe number ofplayers, it shall be arequirementthat
separatesemi-annual audits becarried out for purposes of checking on internal control,
compliance withfinancial covenants, operation of special accounts for the discretepartners, pool
account into which basket donors will deposit their contributions to the program, efficiency and
effectiveness ofmanagementinachievementofthe objectives ofprogram, budgetarycontrol
systems andperformance ofthe managementofthe finance, accounting and anevaluation of
how the several cost centers are managing finances and exercising requisite internal controls

                           MALAWI: HealthSector SupportProject

A. Malawi's ProcurementEnvironment

1.     Malawi is intheprocesso fprocurement reforms. A PublicProcurement Act was passed
byParliamentandbecameeffective inAugust, 2003. Themainconsiderationsguidingthe
provisions inthe Act are transparency, efficiency and economy; accountability; fair opportunity
to all bidders; prevention of fraud, corruption and other malpractices; andto promote local
capacity. The final version ofthe Public Procurement Act is assessed as a good UNICTRAL-
basedprocurement law. The Act will be supplementedbyregulations, desk manuals and
standardtender and other procurement documents. The final version ofthe regulations was
signed for promulgation bythe minister responsible for Public Procurement andcopies are being
printedso that they are available for usebyprocuringentities. The StandardTender Documents
are yet to beprepared. The Act defines methods ofprocurement andconditions for their use; the
mainprinciples andprocedures for methods o fprocurement; the establishment ofthe Office of
Director ofPublic Procurementwith oversight for public procurement; the establishment of
IntemalProcurement Committees (IPCs) ineachMinistry, DepartmentandParastatal; and
review procedures. The Director ofthe Office o fPublic Procurementwas appointed inMarch
2004. The Act i s generally consistentwith good public procurement practice and includes
provisions for: (i) effective andwide advertising of upcoming procurement opportunities; (ii)
public opening o fbids; (iii)pre-disclosure o f all relevant informationincludingtransparent and
clear bidevaluation andcontract awardprocedures; (iv) clear accountabilities for decision
making; and(v) an enforceablerightofreviewfor bidderswhenpublic entities breachthe rules.
The final CPAR was submittedto Government inJune 2004. The actionplans o fthe CPAR
were agreedwith government duringthe May 2004 CPAR missionandworkshop. The key
action o fthe CPAR, the implementation o fthe Public Procurement Act, establishment and
operationalization o fthe Public Procurement Institutions (Office o fthe Director o fPublic
Procurement, Internal Procurement Committees, Specialized Procurement Units)are part ofthe
triggers for the FiscalManagement Program andAccelerating GrowthProgramProject, which
was approvedby the BoardinApril 2004.

procedurebut not as criteria for bidding. With the exception of complex informationsystems,
the meritpoint system shall not be usedas the basis ofbidevaluation. "Bracketing" or rejection
ofbids outside a range or "bracket" ofbidvalues shall not bepermitted. The organization
(responsibilities) for executing the procurement hnction, general guidance, procurement
methodsandprocedures, procurement monitoringreport formats, standardservice standards etc.
will beincluded as partofthe Project's procurement manual.

3.      The general description ofvarious items under different expenditure category are
describedbelow. For eachcontract to be financed by the Credit, the different procurement
methods or consultants selection methods, the needfor pre-qualification, estimatedcosts, prior
reviewrequirements, andtime frame are agreedbetweenthe Borrower andthe Bankproject
team inthe Procurement Plan. The procurement planwill beupdated at least annually or as
requiredto reflectthe actual Project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional
capacity.

4.      Procurement of Works: Works procured under this Project, would include: civil works
construction andmaintenanceworks for health infrastructure. The Bank's StandardBidding
Documents (SBD)will beused for all International Competitive Bidding(ICB). For NCB, until
national standardbiddingdocuments satisfactory to the Bank are developed, Bank's Standard
BiddingDocuments (SBD), withmodifications as appropriate ,shall beused. Contracts, which
meet the requirements o fparagraph 3.17 ofthe Procurement Guidelines, may beprocuredusing
CommunityParticipatioflorce Account. The detailed procedureswhenusingcommunity
participation will inaccordancewith the MASAFManual andwill be agreedwith the
Collaborating Partners.

5.     Procurement of Goods: Goodsprocured underthis Project would include: Procurement
ofhealth goods(drugs, medicine, medical andlaboratory equipment, vehicles, furniture, office
equipment andsupplies etc. The Bank's StandardBiddingDocuments (SBD) will be usedfor all
International Competitive Bidding(ICB). ForNCB, untilnational standardbiddingdocuments
satisfactory to the Bank are developed, Bank's StandardBiddingDocuments (SBD),with
modifications as appropriate ,shall beused. HIV/AIDS drugs andrelated supplies specific
procurement methods will follow procurementmethods identifiedinthe procurementplan
which will bereviewedby the Project Team/ Collaborating Partners. The specific procurement
methods to be identifiedinthe Procurement Planwill be chosentaking into considerationthe
marketsituation of eachproduct, the nature ofthe medicines andmedicalsupplies andthe
critical dates for delivery. The figure at the end ofthis annex summarizesthe considerations to
be made inselecting appropriate procurement methods for HIV/AIDsdrugs andrelated supplies.
ARVs, HIVTest Kits, Specialized Drugs, software, spare partsandaccessorieswhich are of
proprietary nature may with IDA concurrence, beprocured under contracts negotiated directly
with the manufacturers/suppliers or their authorizedagents.

6.   Procurement of non-consulting services: these include Security, cleaning, sanitation,
landscaping services etc.

7.    Selection of consultants:.Some o f the consultant services requiredinclude studies, works

                                                 61

Bank's StandardRequest for Proposals(SRFP) wouldbeusedfor all consulting assignments
estimatedto cost more thanUSD100,000. For assignment less thanUSD100,000 until
acceptablenational StandardRequest for Proposal documents are developed, Bank's Standard
Request for Proposal documents will beused. Short lists of consulting services estimatedto cost
less than $100,000 equivalent per contract maybe composed entirely of national consultants in
accordancewiththe provisions o fParagraph2.7 ofthe Consultant Guidelines.

8.    Operationalcosts:which wouldbefinanced bythe Project would beprocuredusingthe
implementingagency's administrativeprocedures.

9.    TheMinistry ofHealth(MOH) should ensure that eachtime they are usingthe most current
version ofthe appropriate SBD or SRFP and standardforms of evaluation. Less competitive
biddingandselectionproceduresshouldnotbeusedas anexpedient to by-passmore competitive
methods and fractioning o f largeprocurementsinto smaller ones shouldnot be done solely to
allow the use o fless competitive methodsor to avoid IDAreview.

 B. Procurementmethods

    10. Contracts for civil works estimatedto cost individuallyUSD 1million or more will be
          procuredusingICB procedures. Works estimatedto cost betweenUSD 50,000 and
          USD1millionequivalent percontract; shallbeprocuredusingNCBprocedures. Very
          small contracts estimatedto cost less thanUSD 50,000 equivalent maybeprocured by
          way of soliciting quotations throughwritteninvitationsfrom not less thanthree
          qualified contractors. To the extent possible, goods(exc1udingmedical equipment) that
          couldbeprocured from one supplierwould be grouped into contract packages, and
          packages estimatedto cost the equivalento fUSD250,000 or more wouldbeprocured
          underICBprocedures. Procurement of goods(exc1udingmedical equipment) packages
          estimatedto cost morethanUSD30,000 but less than USD250,000 would beprocured
          usingNCBprocedures. Forprocurement ofmedicalequipment ICBwill be applicable
          to equipment estimated to cost the equivalent o fUSD150,OOO or more. Medical
          equipmentestimatedto cost morethanUSD30,OOO butlessthanUSD150,OOO shall be
          procured usingNCB procedures. Goods (including medical equipment)packages
          estimatedto cost less thanUSD 30,000 wouldbeprocured by shopping on the basis of
          comparison of quotations fkom at least three eligible andqualified suppliers. Requests
          for such quotations will include a clear description andquantityo fthe goods, as well as
          requirements for deliverytime andpoint of delivery. The procurement method
          thresholds do not apply to HIV/AIDSMedicines andrelated supplies. For these items
          the specific procurement methodswill follow the HIUAIDSMedicines and Related
          Supplies: Contemporaiy Context and Procurement: - Technical GuideFebruary 2004
          andwill beidentifiedinthe procurement planwhich willbereviewedbythe
          Collaborating partners.


 11. ARVs, HIVTest Kits, Specialized Drugs, software, spare parts andaccessorieswhich are
ofproprietary nature may with IDA concurrence, beprocured under contracts negotiateddirectly
with the manufacturers/suppliers or their authorizedagents.

consultants as well as workshops and group discussions. As arule, consulting firms for all
assignmentsestimatedto cost the equivalent o fUSD 100,000 or more will be selectedthough
Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) methodology. Alternatively, SelectionUnder a Fixed
Budget(SFB) or Least-Cost Selection (LCS) proceduresmaybeusedprovidedthe assignment
meets the requirements ofparagraph3.5 inthe case o f SFB andparagraph 3.6 inthe case of
LCS. Assignments estimatedto cost the equivalent ofUSD 100,000 or more wouldbe
advertised for EO1inDevelopment Business (UNDB),inDgMarketand inat least one
newspapero fwide national circulation. Inaddition, EO1for specialized assignmentsmaybe
advertised inan intemational newspaper or magazine. The shortlist o f firms for assignments
estimatedto cost less thanUSD 100,000 maybe made up entirely ofnational consultants ifat
least three qualified firms are available at competitive costs inMalawi. However, foreign
consultantswho wish to participate shouldnotbe excluded fiom consideration. Consultant
services estimatedto cost less thanthe equivalent o fUSD 50,000 may be contracted by
comparing the consultants' qualifications. Auditors wouldbe selectedusingLCS procedures. In
case o f assignmentsrequiringindividual consultants, the selection will follow the procedures
stipulated inSectionV ofthe Consultants Guidelines.

C. Assessment of the Agency's capacityto implementprocurement

15.    A procurement Capacity Assessment ofMOHandCMS was carried out inDecember
2003. The M O Hhashadsome experienceinmanagingprocurement inoperations financedby
bilaterals including DFIDandthe Kingdomo fNorway andmultilaterals including AfDB and
IDA. However, underthese operations, theprocurement function was carried out mainlyby
consultants andthere i s very little institutionalmemoryremaininginMOH. The summary
assessment shows a "Highrisk" for the project mainly becauseMOHis still setting up and
staffing the Specialized ProcurementUnitandthey are still inthe processo frecruitinga long
term procurement consultant to assist the ministrywith training on newpublic procurement
system andbuildingthe procurement capacity through out the ministry. Procurement Post
Reviews (PPRs) will be carried out annually by Bank Staff and/or independentauditors and
basedon the findings ofthe reviews, the prior review thresholds will bereviewed. The main
risks identifiedare: (i) unfamiliaritywith goodpublicprocurement practice; (ii)  inadequate
procurement capacity; (iii)  poor supplychain management; (iv) inadequateprocurement
planningandmonitoring; (v)poorrecordmanagement; (vi) weak contract management; (vii)
poor commitment control;(vi) delays inprocessing procurement andpayments; (vii) poor attitude


                                                  63

of officials; (viii) poor public perceptiono fthe Ministry,and (ix) lack of standardtender and
other procurement documents and (x) weak oversight andenforcement. The actionsplannedto
address the deficiencies are included inthe program activities andinclude the following: (i)
procurement training (including, as appropriate to the staff, inprocurement o fhealth sector
goods, selection o fconsultants, procurement planning, procurement records management) o f
membersofthe IPC, MOHandCMS procurement focal persons, internal audit staff, and
MedicalBuyingCommittee) -this training will complement the nationwide training effort to be
launched as part ofthe operationalization o fthe PublicProcurement Act and is a continuous
processthat should start immediately to enhance procurement capacity inthe sector; (ii)   Priorto
Boardapproval-hiringofaprocurement advisor or procurement agent to providesupport inthe
execution o fthe procurement function. TOR should include preparation o f a proceduresmanual
andmentoringkeyMOHandCMS: (iii)            establishment o f semiannualreporting requirements;
(iv) establishmentofacontract performance support system; (v) institutionalization of annual
independentprocurement audits; (vi) use ofBank SBD's andother standardprocurement
documentstill National StandardProcurementDocuments acceptableto the Bankhavebeen
developed and (vii) enforcement ofremediesifGovernment does not take appropriate sanctions
against officials who flout the agreedprocedures.

16.     A programworkshop shouldbeheldat the beginning ofthe program for key staff of
M O H SPU, CMS, District HealthOfficials, IPCs, MBC, PMPB andNDQCL. Theprogram
workshop will include sessionson BankPublic procurement. The focus will be to orient key
staffon the principles o f good public procurement practice and to discuss the procurement
arrangementsunderthe program. The project also includes funding for key staffinMOHto
attendBank supportedregional procurement training inESAMIor GIMPA and specialized
traininginthe procurement ofhealth sector goodsthat was already attendedby 5 membersof
M O H staff inJune 2004. Other areas of training supportedunder the project include contract
management, recordkeeping andproject management. The formation of a M O H SPUi s already
underway.

D. ProcurementImplementationArrangements

17.      See the InstitutionalResponsibilities for Implementation inAnnex 6. As arule,
procurement will bethe responsibility o fMOH. However, M O Hhas the option ofhiringa
procurement agent or advisor to provide support inprocurement. The project provides financing
for supporting the Government ofMalawi's HealthSectorprogramunder a SWAP,with GOM
andDevelopment Partners(including DFID,the KingdomofNorway, IDA andAfDB) making
contributions through pooledfunds towards financing the cost ofthe program. Other donors
who are not part o fthe poolingwill continue to provide financial support through earmarked
funds. GOM andthe Developmentpartners will agree on an annual ProgramofWork (POW)
andProcurementPlan(PP); andthe use ofcommonprocurement, review andreporting
procedures

E. ProcurementPlans

                          Annex 9: Economic andFinancialAnalysis


                          MALAWI: HealthSector SupportProject

This Annex provides the economic andfinancial analysisofthe Malawi HealthSector Support
Project (HSSP). The Malawi HSSP i s designedinthe context o f amedium-term (2004/05 to
2009/10) Programo fWork (POW) supporting the MinistryofHealth (M0H)'ssector-wide
approach (SWAp), incooperation with its development partners. The SWAPpooled funding i s
beingsupportedbya group ofdonors includingthe U.K.'sDepartment for International
Development (DfD), the NorwegianAgency for Development along with the Swedish
Intemational Development Agency (the KingdomofNorway) andIDA. By its nature, the
pooled hdingarrangement will beplannedandmanagedclosely with the budgetaryresources
coming from the Government ofMalawi. Thus, the economic andfinancial analysis ofHSSP i s
made inthe context ofthe POW,andthe feasibility ofthe POWbeingfundedunderthe
government's annualbudget framework.

The economic analysis ofthe HSSP andofthe POWofwhich it is apart shows that itprovides a
reasonablebasis for supporting priorityhealth interventions inMalawi. There are strong
economic justifications for the project, includingthe needto significantly increaseinvestments in
healthto arrest the deteriorated state ofhealth services andimprove the quality of services, and
therebyalleviate povertybyreducinghousehold costs associatedwith gettingsick. On fiscal
grounds, the pooledfunding modality is a sensibleapproachinreducing managementburden
arisingfrom traditional multipledonor projects; reducing the budgetarydistortion causedbyoff-
budget expenditures; andimprovingallocative efficiency by focusing andtighteningthe budget
around the deliveryofthe essentialhealthpackage(EHP). Severalproject scenarioswere
consideredby the project preparationteam; the conclusioni s that the blend of interventions and
proposed POWmechanismsrepresent areasonable andcost-effective approachto financing the
sector program. The analysis o fproject benefits concludes that giventhe sorry state ofhealth
services inMalawi, andthe POW'Sfocus on EHP, which has the potentialof averting a large
proportionofthe diseaseburdenamong the poor, the project i s expectedto have apositive
impact onpoverty alleviation.

The financial analysis ofthe project examined the costing, resourceallocation pattern, overall
financing, and sustainability o fthe POW.Theproject team notedthat the three-stageprocessthat
M O Hfollowed inrefiningthe POW-identifyingidealresourcerequirements, constraints
analysis, andprioritization within the estimatedlikely resource envelop -i s logical and
transparent andrepresents a soundbasis for developing the SWAp. The POWcosting exercise
was found to be generally soundexcept for a few keyissuesthat needto be dealt with further.
Moreover, the POWresourceallocation betweencentral andperipheral areas andbetween capital
andrecurrent costs appears to be reasonable. Finally, the POWfinancing requirement for the
governmentis withinits forecast resourceenvelop over the periodFY04/05 to FY09/10,
conditional uponthe Government maintainingthe current share o fMOHto total government
expenditures(13.5 percent; ideal at 15.O percent), and assuming the Malawian economy grows at
amodestrate of 1percent. Thus, over the medium-term, the POWappears consistent with the
country's macroeconomic and fiscal framework. The keyproblematic area i s the financinggap

inpooledfunding. Althoughthe total resourceenvelopfor development assistanceinMalawi
over the next three years far exceeds the resource requirement ofthe POWfor donors, the large
chunk o f external assistanceremainsoff-budget, reducing the probability of their being
converted into pooledfunds.

Economic Analysis of the HSSP

Project Context and Rationale

The economicjustification for project is madeonthe following four grounds: the needto reduce
poverty andimprovingequitythrough investment inhealth; the needto reducemanagement
burden arisingfrom a multiplicity o fprojectized donor activities; the needto reducebudgetary
distortioncausedbythe proliferationo f"off-budget" individualdonor activities; andthe needto
improve allocative efficiency and equity through focusing on the delivery of essentialhealth
package (EHP).

Rationale for reducing poverty and improving equity through investment inhealth.
Malawi i s one o fthe poorest countries inthe world, beingranked165thinterms ofhuman
development indicators. The health status indicators inMalawi are appalling and, even more
seriously, some o fthe key indicators such as matemal health, have deteriorated over the past few
years due to economic difficulties, a series ofnatural disasters (floods inthe late 1990s,
intermittent droughts inthe 2000s), the impoverishingeffect o fthe HIV/AIDS epidemic, and
continuing weaknessesinkeyhealth interventions. Accordingto the latest Malawi Demographic
andHealthSurvey (MDHS) 2000, the under-five mortalityrate is 189per 1,000 livebirths,the
worst inEastemand Southem Africa; andthe infant mortalityrate i s 104per 1,000, the second-
worst inthe region. Some 49.0 percent ofthe under-5children are stunted (height-for-age), 5.5
percent are wasted (weight-for-age), and25.4 percent are underweight. The maternal mortality
ratio has almost doubled from 576 per 100,000 livebirthsin 1995to 1,120 in2000 (although
model-based calculations byHill,et al, (2001)) show the matemal mortalityratio i s probably
lower thanthe MDHSfigure). Malawi is one o fthe ten countries worst ravagedbythe AIDS
epidemic, with as muchas 15 percent ofthe adult populationHlVpositive. The combined effect
ofthese is adrastic decline inthe life expectancy at birth, which is downto 38.5 years in2001.

Muchofthe increasing mortality and morbidity i s due to the deteriorated state ofhealth services
inthe country andthe collapsing humanresourcecapacity especially inthe government sector.
Vacancy rate among "skilled" healthworkers inthe M O HinFY02/03 reached 57.8 percent, with
vacancies most severe inthe senior andmiddlelevel cadres (74.4 percent and 67.1 percent,
respectively). In2004, it i s estimatedthat 64 percent of all M O Hnursingposts are vacant, 27 o f
the clinical officers' posts are vacant, and 53 percent o f the medical assistants' posts are vacant.
The exoduso fhealthworkers out o f civil service started inthe early 2000 andwas precipitated
largelybythe erosion of salaries, although there are other systemic underlyingcauses such as
poor working conditions, and lack o f drugs andmedicalsupplies to work with. Today, an entry-
level auxiliary nurse earns only US$40 insalary andbenefits per month; experiencednurses earn
US$74permonth). Doctors are also poorly paid: an entry-level specialist physicianearns only
US$52 insalaries andUS$118 inbenefits.

Shortageinhumanresources, drugs, andmedical supplies, andpoorly maintained facilities have
severely reduced access to good quality andreliable care. Results from the 2002 Malawi Core
Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) Survey (Table 2) show that only 18.6 percent o f
householdrespondentshadphysical access to ahealth facility (definedas within 30 minutes'
travel from one's house). Actual use ofhealth services amonghouseholdmemberswho got sick
i s even lower, at only 16.8 percent. Ofthose who diduse health services, only 12.0 percent
reportedbeingsatisfied. Although urbanhouseholdshavebetter access to a health facility than
ruralhouseholds, bothregisteredlow use andlow satisfaction of services.

The low accessibility, quality, andreliability ofhealth services inMalawi arise from a complex
set of factors, but an undeniable fact is the low level o fper capitahealthspending, both in
absoluteterms and relative to other countries inthe region. Inthe late 1990s, Malawi's per
capitahealth spending(inclusive o f government, donors, andhouseholds) was only E 4 8 9
(equivalent to US$12.40), much less thanZambia's US$20.60 andKenya's US$29.60, andfar
below world standards (the comparative figure for OECD countries duringtheperiod is
US$2,443). A major reasonfor Malawi's low per capita health spendinginthe hasbeenthe
unstable state ofthe economy, resulting inlower-than-required government allocation to health



                                                  72

which averaged only 6-8 percent o fthe total government budget inthe 1990s. Inthe early
2000s, the government didraise the share o fMOHexpenditures to total government spending to
10 and 11percent. However, as will be shownbelow under the sustainability analysis, the large
proportion o fthe budget that the government spends on unallocable expenditures mainly to pay
o f f domestic debt could hinder further increases ingovernment health spending.

Additional investments inthe health sector are clearly needed to makehealth services more
functional andresponsive to the needs o fMalawians. But even more critical, these investments
are neededto address the serious inequities inhealth status andaccess to services. By any
reckoning, the poorest Malawians have the worst mortality andmorbidity indicators, as shown in
Table 3. For instance, the mortality rates for infants andunder-five children among the poorest
households are 33.1 percent and46.8 percent higher, respectively, thanthose among the richest
households. Prevalence o fmalnutrition, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infection inchildren i s
also worse amongpoorer households. Although utilization o fhealth services i s generally fairer
thanhealth status indicators, medical attendance for key childillnesses as diarrhea and acute
respiratory infections is generally low across socioeconomic groups. Thus, there i s a need to
increase dramatically the utilization o f services overall, but with a particular focus onpoorer
households. As muchas poverty contributes to the poorer health status o fpoor households
(since they have poorer access to good quality services), their poorer health status also
contributes to the persistence o ftheir poverty (since being more prone to sickness, they have
much less opportunity andtime to get involved inproductive work).

Malawi's Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper (PRSP) clearly identifies investments to improve
health- incombination with education, social protection, andother related interventions -as a
keyelementsinreducing povertyandimprovingequity. This strategyis underpinnedby
extensive global researchshowing that sicknesstends to undulypenalizepoorer households, and
that liberating such households fi-omthe onerous burdenof disease (andits consequent financial
burden)couldmakethemparticipatemoreproductivelyineconomic undertakingsthat could lift
them out ofpoverty. The anti-poverty rationale of additionalhealthinvestments is also echoed
inIDA'Scountry assistancestrategyfor Malawi, the country assistancestrategiesofother donors
such as DFID, the Kingdom o fNorway andthe AfDB (who are all expectedto contribute to the
pooledfundingunderthe SWAP), as well as the mandateso fthe GlobalFundfor AIDS,
Tuberculosis andMalaria(GF-ATM). Giventhe near-collapsed state o fMalawi's health system,
however, it maybe too ambitious to expect immediate dramatic improvements inhealth status
over the life o fthe project. The moremodest aim of the project is to keep Malawi's health
infrastructure running, improve the support systems for service delivery includinghuman
resources, andover the long-term anticipate that these would positively impact on health status.

Rationale for reducing managementburden arising from a multiplicity of projectized
donor activities. Inresponse to the low level o fhealth spendinginthe 1990s, the number of
donors inMalawi has grown dramatically since the late 1990s, reaching a total o f 19 official
development assistance(ODA) partners inthe health sector by 2003 (Table 4). These donors
provided anaverage o fUS$66.5 million a year in 1994-97, increasing to US$75.7 million a year
in1998-2000, andthis is expectedto increaseWher to US$96.1 millionin2003-04. By2004,
the total donor commitments are expectedto be more thantwice the total recorded a decade
earlier. These flows exclude those coming from numerous nongovernmental organizations,
which also bringtheir own-generatedresources. Although the growth o f ODA funds and
private/NGO resource flows is apositive development for a country that needs such funds
desperately, the increasingmultiplicity of funding flows have engenderedmanagement
problems, Traditional donor projects are implementedvertically, often as "stand-alone"
operations, andtherefore incurring significant managementtime for boththe government and
donors. Ithasbecome increasingly difficult for the MOHto focus its energy on steering and
managingthe sector since muchof stafftime is beingtaken away to cater to aproliferationof
donor missions for project preparation, negotiation, supervision, and evaluation. (Assuminga
minimumof2 visits ayear, the 19donorswould necessitate38 missionsperyear, excluding
those madeby a flurry oftechnical-assistanceconsultants.) Theplethora o funharmonized
reporting, financial, and procurement systems engenderedby individualprojects addto the
managementburden. Iti s expectedthat pooledfundinginthe context o fthe SWAPPOWwill

ease this problems byreducing project preparation andsupervision, and eventually the
harmonization o f donor procedures.

Rationale for reducingbudgetary distortion causedby the proliferation of "off-budget"
individualdonor activities. Malawi had 34 healthprojects counted inthe donor survey of
2000; this number has surely risen inthe early 2000sinthe wake ofthe increasingnumberof
donors andtheir level o f commitments. Manyoftheseindividualprojects are "off-budget,"
which is aprobleminitself since it defeatsthe public-finance principle o fbudget
comprehensiveness,i.e., the needto account for all sources o f funds andhow they are used.
However, although they are technically "off-budget," they often require various support from the
government interms of counterpart fimds (explicit or implicit); managementtime for technical
guidance; travel costs for monitoring and supervision; andincertain cases, stafftime for service
delivery. Thus, there are "hidden" expenses incurred byoff-budget activities, and such costs
tendto distort budgetplanningandpreparation. Off-budget donor activities also insidiouslyruin
the transparencyandrationalityo f districtbudget allocation, since they hidethe actual level o f
resourcesthat a district may receive. Finally, off-budget capital expenditures couldbe
unsustainable, for these require recurrent-cost support inthe future, andunless suchrecurrent-
cost requirementsare known upfront, they couldnot bebudgeted for.

TheMOHhas adoptedSWAPas ameansto reducethese negative effects ofthe multiplicity of
"off-budget" donor funds. Althoughthe pooling of funds will initiallyinvolve only three donors
(see Table 5), it i s expectedthat other development partnerswill follow suit inthe future. In
addition, SWAPprinciples o ftransparency andjoint resourceplanningandprogrammingare
already havinga spill-over effect for currently off-budget activities, as i s the case with
coordination efforts going on among the Global Fundfor AIDS, Tuberculosis andMalaria,
IDA'SMultisectoral AIDS Project, andother similarlyprograms beingmanagedunderthe
NationalAIDS Council.

Rationale for improving allocativeefficiency and equity through focusingon the essential
health package (EHP). Untilrecently, the M O Hhasworked without an explicit prioritization
criteria and allocation mechanism. Annual budgetaryallocations have traditionallybeenmade
on the basis o fincremental budgeting,which inturn dependedon districts' existinghealth
infiastructure, staffing, and absorptive capacity rather thanon need. Inadvertently, this practice
often resulted inbetter-equipped,better-staffed, and sparselypopulated districts obtaining
comparatively bigger share of the annualbudgetary allocations. Thus, through most ofthe
199Os, the districts inthe northern regiontendedto have higherper capita health allocations than
those inthe central andsouthernregions. An analysis done by the MOH's Planning Unit (using
an alternative composite index givingequalweights for district population, poverty severity, and
required ORT fknding for infrastructure inplace) shows that employing the crude need-based
allocation revealedthat 17districts that were actually "overfunded" and 9 districts that were
"underfunded" in2000/01(Table 6).

The SWAPPOWexplicitly states the Government's desire to finance the deliveryofEHP
through pooledfunding. Pooledfunding for EHP is expectedto havetwo relatedbeneficial
effects onpublic finance practice inMalawi:

        (a) Onthe revenue side, poolingi s expectedto make planningmore comprehensive,
        transparent andrational incontrast to the current fragmented, non-transparentvertical
        financing of services. Iti s also hopedthat poolingwould makerevenuestreams more
        predictable, incontrast to the intermittent trickles ofresourcesthat central anddistrict
        governments get fromvertical financing;

        (b) Onthe expenditure side, the focus onEHPprovides aclearer objective oftargeting
        clients and services, incontrast to the current budgetingprocessthat does not have an
        explicit service-delivery focus. As will be shown below, the EHP addresses the disease
        burdenofthe larger majority ofthepopulation. Thus, focusing thebudgetaroundthe

        delivery o fEHP services, ineffect, makesthe patternofpublic spendingon health more
        equitable.

ProjectAlternatives andJustifiattionfor IDA Involvement

Theproject preparationteam consideredother options ofusingIDA project funds and concluded
that the combination of activities proposedunderthis project is preferredover other alternatives.
The following alternatives were considered: (a) "no project'' alternative; (b) healthversus non-
health investment; and(c) public versus private sector focus.

"Noproject" alternative. Giventhe fragile stateo fMalawi's public health system, the inferior
care that it currently producesandwhich couldbe addressedbythe project, andthe humantoll
that could be averted ifexisting health-caretechnologies were deployed and adequately funded,
the "no project" alternative is notjustifiable. Table 7 shows the potential number of annual child
deaths that couldbe avertedinMalawi ifcurrently available child-health interventions were
expandedandimproved, as will bethe case with the HSSP.

Health versus non-health investment. Improvedhealth status comes from a combination o f
factors includinghealth services, food security andnutrition, water and sanitation, housing
quality includingelectrification, roadltransport access especially to ahealth facility andother
sources ofhealth information, andlevel o f education especially ofwomen. Although methods
exist that calculate the likely contributions o f each ofthese interventions on overallhousehold
health status (hedonic pricingmodels, willingness-to-pay approaches, etc.), these have not been
applied inMalawi for lack of suitable data, especially among the poor. TheMalawi Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2003/04circumvents this problemby adopting ajudicious approach
o ftacklinghealth problems inanintegratedmanner. Thus, this healthproject i s expectedto
work closely withthe Malawi Social Action Fund(MASAF) which finances community
investments inhealth andhealth-related activities; the MultisectoralAIDS Project; food-security
relatedprograms; andwater and sanitation interventions. Inlinewith the priorities ofthe POW,
the HSSP's focus will be onthe strengtheningo fprimary/secondary health services, i.e., those
providedbydistrict hospitals andlower facilities.

Public versusprivate sectorfocus. Almost all the disease interventions proposed to be h d e d
underthe project dealwith public healthproblems (e.g., vaccination, managementofchildhood
illness, and infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and cholera), or
conditions the alleviationo fwhich most societies consider meritorious (i.e., complications
arisingfrom pregnancyandchildbirth, child andmaternal malnutrition). These are also the
diseases for which the Malawi Government has made global commitments to address under the
MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The "public goods" argument for government involvement in
these infective diseases are well established, i.e., becauseof their (negative) externalities, they
tendto beunder-provided bythe commercial market, which tends to cater only to individual
needs. Thus, there continues to be strongjustification for government sector involvement inthe
financing andprovisiono fthese public health services. However, it i s clear that the government
alone cannot addressall ofthese problems without the assistanceandcapacity ofprivate
partners. The POWclearly lays out the service-delivery role o fthe Christian Hospital
Association o fMalawi (CHAM) as apartnerthrough explicit Health Service Agreements
betweenthe government andgroups o f CHAM facilities. Arrangements are also beingmade
with community-based initiatives, i.e., through the Malawi Social ActionFund,so that critical
health services andcommodities canbeprovided incommunities onpartnershipwithM O H and
eventually with local governments. Malawi also has experiences withthe appropriate
application o fpublic (donor) subsidies through commercial social marketingo fbednets, oral
rehydration salts, contraceptives, and other healthgoods. Thus, the HSSP will use ablendo f
public, private nonprofit, andcommunity providers.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

Cost-effectiveness of specific health interventions to be supported. The health interventions
proposedto be fundedunderthe HSSP are all considered global "best-buys" (see Table 8). The
table below shows the percent o f disease burdenavertedbasedon global estimates &om low- and
middle-income countries. However, since Malawi i s at the lower endof low-income countries,
withfar worse diseaseburdeninall ofthese diseases, itis likelythat the percent ofdisease
burdenavertedis evenhigher thanthe above figures would indicate.

Cost-effectiveness ofPoW approaches. Given that the POWwas prepared interms o f inputs
andactivities, it is difficult to analyze the cost-effectiveness o fimplicit approaches and strategies
to achieve desired outcomes. Nevertheless, discussions with the MOHand key stakeholders
provide insights into how the Ministry envisions to carry out the POWthrusts. These are
analyzed inturn for their cost-effectiveness:

(a) Integratedversus vertical financing anddelivery o f EHP: Usingthe rationale o f cost-
effectiveness, the MOH aims to integrate more closely the health services currently being
delivered as vertical programs. This will pose a real challenge for the MOHas well as its
partners. Inthe first place, the more successful health interventions inMalawi interms o f
coverage or cure rates have been delivered through vertical programs, i.e., immunization,
tuberculosis, cholera, leprosy, and familyplanningandreproductive health. Inthe second place,
most financing for these activities are currently off-budget, and converting them into pooled
fundingover the short- or medium-termmaybetoo optimistic.

(b) Partnership with ChristianHospital Association o fMalawi (CHAM): Historically, the
government has given direct subvention to C H A M on aninformal basis through implicit
contracts. Through the POWprocess, the subventiongrants are being converted into explicit,
formalized health service agreements. Intheory andbased on Westem experiences where
management and legal structures exist for contract enforcement, explicit performance-based
contracts are more effective thanimplicit ones, but this remains to be seen ina country without
such sophisticated management andlegal structures.

(c) Humanresource recruitment anddeployment: To ease the emergency humanresource crisis,
the POWassumes that additional workers could be recruited expeditiously using civil-service
processes, rules andregulations. An alternative, probablymore cost-effective approach that
needs to be explored is to use a labor agent to recruit high-level, professional staffthrough time-
bound, performance-based contracts.

Project Benefits and BeneJiciaries

Project benefits. The project andthe POWthat it supports will yield three types o fbenefits:
First, the project i s oriented at providing direct benefits to Malawian households who will be
utilizing health service interventions under the HSSP. These are discussed ingreater detail inthe
next section. Second, the project will also support large-scale improvement inthe training, pay,
andbenefitpackage o fgovernment andCHAM healthworkers. These haveripple effects in
improving the welfare andhealth status o fworkers receivingthese upgraded packages. Thirdly,
the project will support systems strengthening (both "software" such as procurement, financial
management, healthplanning, andmonitoring and evaluation systems, as well as "hardware"
investments, such as communication and electrification of currently un-connected health
facilities) that are expected to yield efficiency gains inservice delivery, andthe disabilities that
such efficiency gains can avert.

Project beneficiaries and care-seeking. Potentialproject beneficiaries are patients going to
MOH andC H A M facilities for their essential health services. Basedonthe data providedbythe

M O HHealth andManagement InformationSystem(HMIS),it i s likely that project-funded

under-five children, assuming2.5 visits per child), 9.1 millionoutpatient department(OPD)

Inthe absenceofaMalawibenefit-incidence analysis ofpublic expendituresinhealth, it isnot
possible to determine exactly how the various socioeconomic groups will benefit from the POW
investments. However, the overly-narrow focus o fP o w investments on government andCHAM
facilities may undulyprejudice poor householdswho are increasingly usingprivate providers. In
Table 10, data from the 2002 CWIQ shows that even socioeconomic groups that are likely to be
poor (e.g., those inthe informalhubsistence sector, inthe agricultural sector, andhouseholds
with self-employed or unemployed heads) are goingto private ("enterprise") non-mission health
facilities andproviders for consultations. For instance, 16.9percent o f consultations amongthe
informalhubsistence sector are from private hospitals or clinics. Thus, althoughthe current
focus ofP o w investments on government andmissionfacilities is, by andlarge, correct, the
care-seekingpatternof segments o fthe poor populationwarrants exploration ofhow their needs
canbemet through financing of their care providedbythe private sector.

 Poverty and equity impact of theproject. The HSSP i s likely to have apositive impact on
 poverty and equity. Firstly,it focuses on the financing andprovisionofEHP that addresses the
  disease burdenthat i s preponderantlythose ofpoorer households. Secondly, the government's
  decisionto provide EHl?for free to all those seekingthese servicesinMOH facilities means the
  removal of amajor deterrent to care amongthe poor. Experience inUganda demonstratesthat
 removal of fees was followed by largeincreasesinclinic attendances especially among children
  andmothers. Needlessto say, there are other financial costs of accessingcare, includingtravel
  costs and opportunity costs of care-seekingthat the HSSP does not address. Thirdly, the
  expectedtransition to "need-based" district allocation formula should improvegeographic equity
  inthe distribution ofproject resources.

  FinancialAnalysis

  This section discussesthe macroeconomic context ofthe project; analyzes the POWinterms of
  costing, resource allocation, andresourceavailability and financing; examines the recurrent cost
  implications ofthe POWandthe likely fiscal impact ofproposedactivities; anddiscusseskey
  issues relatedto the POW'Ssustainability.


  Overall Macroeconomic Context

  The project is beingprepared inan environment ofpoor economic prospects andweak overall
  fiscal management. Since the mid-1 9 9 0 economic growth hasbeen low, sharply fluctuating,
                                              ~ ~
  andhasworsenedinrecent years with a sharp drop in2001. Since 2000, the economy has grown
  on averageby less than2 percent per year. Withthe populationgrowing by nearly2 percent
  annually, this hasmeant a sharp fall inper capita consumption (Table 11). The poor GDP
  performance hasbeen accompaniedby chronic food insecurity causedby successivebouts of
  droughts and flooding, an adverse external environment, andthe government's inabilityto
  reform agricultural marketingo fthe key staple (maize). Poor economic managementhas
  compoundedthese problems. Inrecent years, the government has incurredunsustainablefiscal
  deficits, forcing it to borrow from the domestic bankingsystem, andthus raisinginterest rates
  andraising inflation, crowding out the private sector, andinturndampeningpotential growth.


                                                  81

The government's inability to adhereto its own medium-termexpenditureframework (MTEF) to
stabilize the economy has also resulted inreduction of donor inflows inthe last three years.

                  Table 11. Key Macroeconomic and Fiscal Indicators, 2000-2003.




Source: World Bank economic database.

Despite the government's failure to adhere to its overall MTEFtargets, it has remainedstrongly
committed to pro-poor expenditures, specifically to health spending (Table 13). Thus, the
government nearlydoubled the M O H share oftotal discretionary andnondiscretionary
government spendingfi-om 6.9 percent inFY97/98 to 10.1percent inFY01/02(estimate) andto
11.2 percent inthe FY02/03 approvedbudget. For its part, the MOHhasbeenhighly disciplined
inits spendingpatternsandutilizationofprotectedpro-poor expenditures. FY02/03 pro-poor
expenditure figures show MOH's utilizationrate o f 103.5 percent, compared to 119.3 percent
overspending for Education and323.0 percent overspending for Agriculture.

Table 12 shows trends inM O H spendingallocation. The composition o f government recurrent
expenditures by inputs shows an alarming erosion o fthe proportiongoing to personal
emoluments, which accountedfor 41.2 percent inFY01/02 buthas gone down to 32.4 percent in
FY03/04. There is increasingrecognition that the share o fPEneeds to beraised, or at leased
reallocation should bemade among different levels ofhealth workers, to avert further erosion in
the morale of mid- and lower-level healthworkers. Morepositively, district-based health
services (secondary and primary care) have captured an increasing share o frecurrent health
budgetas the allocation to headquarterscostshas dropped. This trendbodeswell for the MOH's
goal o fprovidingmore resourcesto peripheral health services.

Analysis of PoW Costing,ResourceAllocation, and Financing

Analysis of PoW costing. The detailed, activity-basedunit-costing exercise employedinthe
POWprovides a reasonablebasis for calculating overall resourcerequirements. Frommost
indications, the assumptions usedinthe costing exercise were sound. However, costs are, by
their nature, endogenousandcannotbedivorced from the way thesecostswillbe financed. In
the same vein, costs will be affected by the way services will be delivered, e.g., whether ina
vertical or integrated fashion, or whether ina centralized or decentralized manner, or whether
theywill bedeliveredbythe funder (government) or contractedout to CHAM. Becauseofthese
factors, it may be necessary to review the realism ofthe resourcerequirements on a periodic
basis.

Four critical areas need to be lookedinto more closely as the POWprogresses towards
implementation: (a) Humanresource salary andbenefit adjustments-The POWassumptionsin
this area are rather arbitrary; better alternative assumptionsneedto be underpinnedby a thorough
assessment o flabor market conditions andremuneration o fthose doing similar work inthe NGO
andfor-profit sector, (b) Pharmaceutical costs - Thesewere derivedfrom apresumably
unreformed, currently inefficient drugprocurement anddistributionsystem. Efficiency savings
from amuchimproveddrugdistribution system could yieldlower costs, (c) Foreign exchange
costs andconversion factor -The POWdoes not distinguishlocal and foreign exchange cost
requirements, although there are significant items that will be imported, e.g., medical equipment,

part ofthe procurement plan.

Analysis of POWresourceallocation. The POWcalls for investmentstotalingUS$735.7
millionover aperiodofsix years, or anaverageofUS$122.6 millionperyear (Table 14). By
component, around 43.4 percent o ftotal POWresourceswill be devoted to the delivery ofthe
Em, 37.5 percent for humanresources,and 19.1 for systems strengthening. Most (80.9 percent)
of the resources will bedevotedto districts andlower-level facilities; only 19.1 percent will be
for central institutions (headquarters, central hospitals' support to district services, anda small
amount to maintainzonal offices). Inaddition, districts' share o ftotal POWresourceswill
gradually increase from 79.6 percent at the start o fthe POWto 81.1 percent towardsthe endof
the program.

A largeproportionofPow resourceswill beusedto support recurrent costs (92.7 percent);
capital expenditures will account for a modest7.3 percent, to beusedmainly to equip existing
facilities, to get them connectedto basic utilities (electricity, communications, andwater), andto
provide transport vehicles for referral. Capital expenditures are also anticipatedto decline
dramatically from 10.3 percent at the beginningo fthe POWto 4.6 percent towards the endo fthe
program. The above analysis shows that interms ofresource allocation, the POWprovides a
sound approachto the financing of essentialhealth services inMalawi.

Analysis of PoW financing and resource availabiliQ. The magnitude of domestic andexternal
resourcesrequiredto finance the POWraises issues about realism, the government's absorptive
capacity, andsustainability o f expenditure flows. The POWenvisagesajump ingovernment and
donor (including off-budget) health spendingfrom around US$80million at present, to US$90.3
millionwhen the programstarts inits first fiscal year (2004/05) andto US$147.9 million in
2009/10.

     Table 15 shows the resource requirements versus resource availability for boththe Government
     andexternaldevelopment assistanceover the periodo fthe POW.Theresource availability row
     for Government reports the results o ftwo very conservative scenarios constructed by the MOH
     for the likely availability o fgovernment funding, i.e., (a) 1percent annual GDP growth andno
     change inthe 2001MOH share to total government expenditures, and(b) 1percent annual GDP
     growth and 13.5 percent MOH share to total government expenditures. (No assumption is made
     about user fees andother extra-budgetary financing since EHP services will be provided free.)
     While the assumption about a 13.5 percent MOH sharemay have beenunrealistic inthe late
     1990s until2001when the actual share hovered around 6-8 percent, the Government
     dramatically increased the budget for MOH so that by 2001/02, it has reached 10.1 percent o f
     total government expenditures and is estimated to have increased to 11.2percent in2002/03.
     Thus, the 13.5 percent share assumption i s feasible, subject to an important caveat about the
     reduction of government domestic borrowing, which is squeezing all discretionary govemment
     expenditures inMalawi. (This issue is dealt with ingreater detail below under sustainability.)

,    The dramatic increase inMOHshare to total government spending starting in2001/02 means
     that ifthis trend continues, andifthe economy grows at a modest rate o f 1percent annually,
     there i s likely to be enough resources for the Government to meet its required contribution inthe
     POW. Infact, the government's contribution is comfortably withinthe GOMrequiredresource
     envelop throughout the forecast period. This implies that the POWunderestimated the expected
     contribution from the Government.

     Withregards external assistance, the above table shows that there continues to be insufficient
     pooled funds to support the POW. However, there i s a sizeable amount of unpooled funds whose

magnitude is more than enough to cover the POWresource requirements for external assistance.
The daunting challenge i s whether and howthese unpooled funds can be flexibly and speedily
reprogrammed to finance the external-assistance requirements of the POW.

Recurrent Cost Implications and Fiscal Impact of PoWExpenditures

Historically, because ofthe multiplicity ofnon-transparent off-budget, donor-funded activities,
Malawi has tended to overspend on capital expenditures andunderspend onrecurrent costs. As a
result, manyhealth facilities are understaffed and ill-supplied, and infrastructure andvehicles
are ill-maintained. Inmarked contrast to previous health plans, the POWtakes a cautious
approach to public investments. Thus, only 7.3 percent oftotal expenditures are capital costs,
andpooled-funding donors have committedthat no infrastructure construction andrehabilitation
will beundertaken inthe first three years ofthe POW.Moreover, the POWitselfalready
budgeted for the recurrent cost (maintenance) requirements o f capital investments, as shown in
Table 16.

         Table 16. POWCapital Investments and Recurrent CostProvisions, FY04/05-FY09/10




Source o fbasic data: Programo f Work (March 2004).

The key POWexpenditure item that will require considerable recurrent costs are the planned
recruitment and deployment of massive numbers of health workers, andthe salary top-ups and/or
added benefits of existing as well as new workers. Bynecessity, these personnel emoluments
have to be maintained. The emergency nature of the health-worker crisis raises critical issues
about how this major problem can be solved with minimal distortion of the healthbudget. One
possibility is to recruit top-echelon, professional health workers on time-bound, performance-
based contracts, as is already being implemented on a limited scale at MOH. Such an approach
frees the government from makinglong-term (life-time) commitments, as it does for civil
servants. Thus, the government could simply terminate the contracts once they are no longer
deemed necessary, or ifthe government does not have the resources to fund the contracts. From
discussions with key informants, it appears that there is a stable of health workers who left the
civil service andwho could be persuaded to come back andwork on short- or medium-term
"agency" basis. This flexible labor arrangement should be explored inthe implementationof the
POWnot only for its obviousperformance-enhancing features, but also because it could
minimize the recurrent costs associated with long-term civil-service employment.

Sustainability of MOH and PoWExpenditures

Overall sustainability analysis. The sustainability ofPow expenditures and, more directly, of
M O H expenditures, canbest be analyzedinthe context o fthe sustainability of overall
government spending. As has beendiscussed, the Government succeededinprotecting
expenditures inhealth over the past six years (FY97/98 to FY02/03), with a dramatic rise inthe
share of MOHto total government spendingoccurring in2001. M O H expenditureswere also
protected from erosion dueto inflation andpopulation growth. Thus, real per capita M O H
spending(at constant 1995prices) rose from MK60 inFY97/98 to MK85 inFYO1/02. (In
current terms, these are equivalent to MK103 andMK423, respectively.)

Although the MOH's shareto government spendinghasbeen increasing, it still falls short
relative to need, andrelative to the 15percent allocation to healththat Afr-ican Governments
committed themselves to meet inthe OAU Summit inApril 2001 inAbuja, Nigeria. The 15
percent target for adequate andsustainable government financing for healthwould bewithin
Malawi's ability to meet ifnot for the heavyload of "nondiscretionary" or "unallocable"
expendituresthat the government needs to set aside, mainly to payoffits large domestic debt.
Nondiscretionary expenditureshaveballooned inrecent years, accounting for around23.5
percent inFY01/02, or an average share of 20.6 percent from FY97/98 to FY01/02. Becauseof
this burden, W h e r expansioningovernment allocation to the MOH andother social sectors has
been constrained. Thus, ifthe GOMadopts a strategy o fbringingdomestic borrowings down,
significantly more domestic resourcescould bemade available for health. Onthe other hand, if
it fails inthis area, government discretionary expenditures (including health) couldbe further
squeezed, reducing the sustainability o fthe POW.

Fiscal decentralization and the sustainability of PoW investments. The POWi s silent onhow
POWexpenditures canbe sustained at the district levelwhenprimaryhealth services are
eventually devolved to local authorities. (Such serviceshave beendevolved to city authorities
effective January 1,2004.) The challengesduringthis period oftransition, and the proposed
approachfor dealing with them, are:

         (a)    To ensure that local authorities devote as much (ifnot more) resourcesto priority
                health interventions as the POWcurrently does. One approachthat anumber of
                devolved countries have employed to solve this problemi s to establish categorical
                or conditional grants that specify (priority) activities to be funded. This has its
                pros andcons, but it ensures that inthe short-term, POWactivities canbe
                adequately funded.

         (b)    To ensurethat fiscal transfers to districts are made on an equitable basis, i.e., that
                no district will bemade worse offthanit was before the devolution. This requires
                that the existing district allocation formulabe reformulated to take account of the
                resourcerequirements of assets andpersonnel actually transferred, andhealth
                needs that were previously not captured inthe "incremental budgeting" practice.

Sustainability of referral services and hospitalfinancing. The POWi s silent about this issue,
but discussionswithMOHpolicymakers revealed the following: (a) their interest inpursuing
social health insurance as one mechanismfor providing much-needed financing for catastrophic



                                                   87

andreferralhealth services, (b) the recent issuanceof apolicyto makingall inpatient
hospitalization andoutpatient consultations at central hospitals subject to fees, and (c) ongoing
technical assistancebeingprovidedto assistinmakingthe four central hospitalsbecome
autonomous.

                           MALAWI: Health Sector Support Project

OP 4.01 EnvironmentalAssessment: Itis uncertainat thistimewhether the project will fimd
the construction o fhealthcenters. However, infrastructure improvements, including
refurbishmentandrehabilitation o fhealthfacilities is proposed as part ofthe sector program.
Should construction take place, andifmajor infrastructural improvements are undertaken, the
potential environmental and social impacts are likely to include soil erosion, soil andwater
pollution, loss o fvegetation, loss of landor access to economic assets and livelihoods, andtraffic
accidents along the transport routes for constructionmaterials. Duringthe operationsofthese
health centers, safe medical waste managementwill beof critical importance to avoidthe spread
ofHIV/AIDS.

To ensure that potential impacts are identifiedandmitigated appropriately at the planningstage,
anEnvironmental andSocial Management Framework (ESMF) hasbeenpreparedbythe
Borrower outliningthe environmental andsocial screeningprocess to be carried out. The ESMF
also requires consultations with relevant stakeholders, includingpotentially affectedpersons, and
disclosure o fthe environmental and social screeningresults at the time the construction activities
are planned. Malawi's MedicalWaste Management Planis attachedto the ESMFto ensure that
medical waste i s managedsafely andthe relevantparts ofthis planare implemented underthe
proposed project.

OP4.12 Involuntary Resettlement: Inthe event that healthcenters are constructed,there is a
possibilitythat somepeople might be affected negativelythrough the loss of livelihoods and/or
land. To ensurethat such impacts are mitigatedproperly, aResettlementPolicy Framework
(RPF)hasbeenprepared. ThisRPFoutlines the principles andproceduresto be followed inthe
event that landacquisition occurs underthe project.

Other Social Issues

Summary of key social issues relevant to SWAPobjectives and planned social development
outcomes: Secondaryanalysis o f data from a rangeo f documentsprovidedinformationabout
key social issues relevant to project objectives. The documentswere: (i)   Malawi: Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (2002); (ii)   Malawi: InterimPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2000);
(iii)HealthSector Wide Approach ImplementationPaper; and(iv) Health Sector Wide Approach
Situational Analysis (2002). The following paragraphsprovide briefinformationonkey issues
andplannedsocial development outcomes.

Key social issuesrelevant to SWAPobjectives are: (a) vulnerability; (b) gender equity; (c) links
betweenhealthoutcomes andpoverty; (d) socio-economic impact ofHIV/AIDS; and(e) user
participation inhealthplanning, decision making, accountability andmonitoring.

Vulnerability: InMalawi, vulnerability i s strongly related to gender, widespread ofHIV/AIDS,
limitedaccess to land, widespread dependenceonmaize as a single food crop, annual cycles of
food insecurity (the `hungry season'), low education, poor health status, malnutrition, limited
off-farm employment andlack of access to credit. Vulnerable groups include: (i) living
                                                                                     People

                                                                            street
children under-five;(v) elderly, and female headedhouseholds; (vi) lactating andpregnant
mothers; (vii) people with disabilities; (viii) the unemployed andunderemployedinurbanareas;
(ix) the landconstrained inrural areas; and (x) casual laborers. Many ofthese groups overlap.

Gender: Gender exerts a strong influence on mortality andmorbidity inMalawi. Womentend
to have lower education, limitedaccess to productive resources, an even narrower rangeof
formal sector labor marketopportunities, andlower wage ratesthanmen. Furthermore, they are
weighed down by social, parental andmaritalobligations, which reduce their opportunities.
Gender inequalities, some arisingfrom the socio-cultural context, include women's lack of
controlover sexual relations, less access to food inthe household, andbeliefs andpractices that
limittimelyattendancefor delivery. Outcomesincludethe fact that femalesaged 14to 29 are 4
to 5 times more likely to be HIVpositive thanmales o fthe same age group; andhighmatemal
mortalityrates. Without effective meansto address gender inequality(bothwithin andoutside
the health SWAP), the ability o fthe SWAP to deliver better health outcomes for women will be
constrained. Levels of education inMalawi are generally low, particularly amongst women; the
female literacy rate i s 45 percent. Only 11.2% of adults above 25 years have achieved Std VIII.
Lack of secondaryandhigher education i s strongly correlatedwithbeingpoor, particularlyin
urbanareas. Thus, Malawi doesnotbenefit from the known synergybetweenwomen's
education andimprovinghealth.

Linksbetween health outcomes andpoverty: The extent ofpovertyis reflected initspoor
healthoutcomes. I11healthi s a major cause contributing to poverty andit exacerbatespoverty
through lost productivity o fthe personwho i s illandthe personsprovidingcare inthe
household, usually women. Life expectancy at birthhas droppedto 39 years in2000, with an
infantandunder-fivemortalityratesof 104and 189, andmatemalmortalityof 1,120deathsper
thousand livebirthsrespectively. Children inMalawi are generally malnourished with 49
percent o fchildren under the age of five are chronicallymalnourished or stunted. These
mortality andmalnutritionrates are linkedto indicators ofpoverty and also reflect major
contributing reasonssuch as, low levels ofmother's education, low quality o fcare provided
particularly at the periphery andtraditional beliefs andpractices that offer alternative to formal
health care. The reviews repeatedly indicates that withinthe formal health care system, the poor
andthevulnerable wait longer, receive fewer drugsandpaymore incomparisonto the wealthy.
Lack of drugs, shortage o f staff, poor motivation and attitudes o f staffmeanthat care maynot be
provided at the appropriate level. This results inpatients needingto makerepeatedvisits to
differentcareproviders, leadingto further impoverishment ofpatients andtheir families. The
majority of causes of illness anddeath are preventable, with 70% of in-patient deaths causeddue
to nutritional deficiencies, pneumonia, anemia, malaria andtuberculosis /AIDS.

Socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS: HIVIAIDS epidemic poses the leading cause of death in
the most productive age group o f 20-48 years, with five times higher prevalence among women
aged 15-24 thanthe male counterparts inthe same age group. TheNational AIDS Commission
data also indicate 800,000 adults andchildren are livingwith AIDS and an annualdeath o f
70,000. At the individuallevel, HIV/AIDScreates animpact specifically onthe poor and
vulnerable due to following reasons. People living inpovertyparticipate inlabor migration,
whichresults inbreakdownofmale and female relations, increasing likelihoodofmultiple



                                                   90

sexual partners or casual sexual partners andthus risk o f HIV infection. Inaddition, women in
poverty are often forced into highrisk sexual relationship while battering sex for subsistence.
Finally, poor people have limited access to information, including information on HIV/AIDS
issues to make informed choices about their sex and sexuality. This i s compounded by the fact
that they have poor access to education and are often illiterate to benefit from IEC campaigns.
At the household level, HIV/AIDS creates animpact where byresources are diminished due to
loss o f earnings o f person who i s ill(often the main breadwinner), costs o f accessing heath care,
other household members time used incaring for the sick person and other direct costs of death
(funeral expenses and loss of land). These often lead to inability to pay school fees limiting
future earning capacity o f the younger generation o f the household; andhuge demand on
remaining family members to care for the orphans. Increasingly the extended families are unable
to meet these demands, leaving orphansto fend for themselves or head households o ftheir
siblings, Inaddition, people fear diagnosis o f HIV/AIDS due to the social stigma attached to the
disease.

At the macro-level, the impact o fHIV/AIDS is felt inthe loss oflaborthroughillness anddeath.
Specifically, inthe agriculture sector, HIV/AIDS leaves small farms particularly vulnerable
leading to food insecurity. Inthe civil service, NGOs andthe private sector there i s loss in
productivity and increased costs caused by absenteeism due to illness or attendance at funerals,
medical bills, fimeral costs andpayment ofpremature death benefits. Withinthe health sector,
there i s evidence ofhigher death rates amongthe healthworkers. This leads to direct costs
relating from death ofthe staff, highattrition rates andincreasedworkload contributingtowards
reduced sector performance due to low morale amongst health workers because of the perceived
occupational risk ofHIV infection andinability to cure people with AIDS.

User participationinhealthplanning,decisionmaking,accountability andmonitoring: a
number of separate initiatives by government, donors andNGOs are already inplace to ensure
effective user participation. A challenge is to include these inthe SWAP. The Local
Government Act was passed in 1998 to provide the necessary legal framework for
decentralization, includingpeople's participation inhealthplanninganddecision-making
through local democratic structures. It is importantto stress that such structures shouldbe
important for accountability o f the health system to citizens, andnot limited to a passive role.
Listed community committees, through which people link to local health services, include: (i)
Village Health Committees (VHCs -the main committee); (ii) health andwater
                                                                  village
committees; (iii) health center committees (HCCs); (iv) home-based care committees; (v) village
A I D S committees; and (vi) SWAP management committees. While the degree to which these
have facilitated participation is yet to be evaluated, observation indicates that inmanyDistricts,
community level structures only function when facilitated by specific project support.
Elsewhere, VHCs may exist onpaper only.

GOMis strengthening its partnership withNGO service providers, as indicated bythe recent
signingofaMemorandum ofUnderstanding (MOU) with the ChristianHealthAssociation of
Malawi (CHAM), which provides over 35% of all health services inMalawi. However, it is
importantto distinguish betweenNGO service providers andthe representation o fthe interests of
service users. Issues of concern inGOMhospitals may also be of concern inCHAM facilities.
At local andnational level, civil society organizations that seek to representthe interests o fpoor



                                                   91

people inMalawi are emerging. However, for these to play arole insector accountability, they -
like community institutions -require support. For resource allocation to Districts, GOMhas
adopteda `needs bused'formula, takinginto consideration the population, existing infrastructure
andpovertylevels ineachdistrict. Some expandedDistrict HealthManagement Teams include
representationfrom NGO serviceproviders. However, the needs basedsystem does not
obviously include participatory planningat District level; and actual expenditure does not always
reflect Districtplansandbudgets.

Basedonthe above five key issues, plannedsocial development outcomes are: (a) equity,
including gender equity, inaccess to andquality o fhealth services, andinhealth outcomes; (b)
governmentandcivil society effectively collaborate onthe delivery ofhealthservices; and(c)
health services accountableto citizens anduser perceptions reflectedthrough participatory
monitoring andevaluation ofhealth services.

Participation of key stakeholders in the SWAp: A participatory approachwouldbe followed
to ensure involvement of stakeholders inall stages of SWAPcycle. SWAP preparation and
implementation should include use o fparticipatory techniquesinvolving stakeholdersthrough
informationsharing, consultation andcollaboration. Stakeholdersinclude MOH, private and
public serviceproviders, development partners (donors), parliamentary committees (intheir
oversight role), district officials (health managementteams), VHCs, civil society representatives
(non-service providers) andpoor people.

DuringSWAP preparation, incollaborationwiththe MOH, informationwas sharedand
consultations were carried out with other stakeholdersthrough one day stakeholder workshop
(September2003) onthe SWAPobjectives, approachandimplementationplan. Inaddition, the
stakeholders were consulted through the above listedseries ofparticipatory studies, namely the:
(i) PovertyReductionStrategy;(ii) InterimPovertyReductionStrategy; and
    Malawi:                                    Malawi:
(iii)HealthSector Wide Approach Situational Analysis

DuringimplementationofSWAp, incollaborationwiththe MOH, participationofother
stakeholders will be facilitated byperiodic stakeholderworkshops and other participatory
mechanisms such as beneficiaryimpact assessmentsto shareinformationand support
consultative processes. The beneficiary impact assessment, to be undertaken duringthe early
stages o fimplementationwill helpto develop anintegratedstrategy to address social impacts of
the proposed SWAPandto create a framework to incorporate participationo fvarious categories
o f stakeholders duringthe following stages o f SWAPcycle.

Consultationskollaboration with NGOs and CSOs: The secondary data review indicates,
that to date, NGOs andother civil society service organizations are involved inthe planningand
implementationof health sector reforms. It is envisagedthat such organizations will continue to
involveinthe implementation o fthe SWAP through sharinginformation, consultations and/or
collaboration To this end, the MOHhas committed to develop a Public Private Partnership
(PPP) policy inthe first year o f SWAPimplementation, andwill have within the SWAP
governance structure a PPP working group. Membershipwill consist of for profit andnot for
profit service providers, as well as wider civil society representatives.




                                                  92

Inaddition, thecivilsocietywillbeconsultedperiodicallythroughbeneficiaryimpact
assessments and SWAp will collaborate with the civil society to implement citizen score cards.
However, details on the roles of each category of stakeholderswithin the SWAP are yet to be
determined.

Institutional arrangements to ensure achievement of social development outcomes: The
POWcommits to Institutional ReformandStrengtheningof systems at center andDistrict, and
also o fnon-MOHinstitutions such as national NGOs and CSOs, andcommunity level
committees. While such capacity buildingshould contribute to the SWAPachieving its social
development outcomes, it i s important to ensure that commitments outside the M O Hstructure
are adequately resourced, their role andfunctions clear andmainstreamed, andthat participation
o fnon-MOH stakeholdersand structures i s part o fthe SWAP'Saccountability mechanism, and
not limitedto passiveparticipation.

Monitoring performance interms of social development outcomes: Capacity buildingof
MOH, district andvillagehealth committees, NGOs, civil society serviceproviders and
communityhealth committees will becarried out to enablethemto effectively collaborate with
the civil society groups (non-service providers) to ensure SWAPachieveits social development
outcomes.

Steps proposed to promote social sustainability of the SWAp: It i s envisagedthat investment
inthe capacity andfunctionofcitizen andcivil society participation at all levels from
community level committees, health centers, Districts, andat the center will be the keyto
promoting social sustainability of the SWAp. However, specific steps are yet to bedetermined.
