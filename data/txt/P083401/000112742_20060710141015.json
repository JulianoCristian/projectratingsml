The two specific objectives are:\n            a) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems strengthening\n            by design and implementation of a robust and sustainable\n            monitoring and evaluation system that provides regular\n            information and feedback to managers and policy makers to\n            improve results-based decision-making in the Malawi Health\n            Sector Wide Approach (SWAp); and b) augmentation of the\n            existing physical, financial, technical and human capacity\n            at all levels of the health system for monitoring and\n            evaluation of malaria and health services delivered through\n            the Health SWAp.  The additional financing will expand the\n            activities for two components of the HSSP, namely: (a)\n            ensuring the provision of the Essential Health Package\n            (EHP), through M&E systems strengthening, and (b)\n            strengthening of the support and referral systems, through\n            M&E capacity building.  Specifically, the Additional\n            Grant would improve management and decision-making and build\n            capacity for M&E in the National Malaria Control Program\n            (NMCP) and the Malawi Health SWAp"}, "docdt": "2006-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
