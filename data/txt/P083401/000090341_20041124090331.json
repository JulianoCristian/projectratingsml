The project has the following three components:\n            Component 1) will improve the health status o f the Malawian\n            population by increasing access to quality essential health\n            services. The main mechanism for delivering quality care\n            would be by making the already-defined Essential Health\n            Package (EHP) accessible to all, but especially in the most\n            rural and disadvantaged districts and to the poorest and\n            vulnerable populations. Component 2) will increase the\n            number o f staff available through continuation o f the\n            six-year emergency training plan, a concerted recruitment\n            campaign, financing and then filling current vacancies, the\n            use o f volunteers and contract staff and other stop-gap\n            staffing strategies. Component 3) will improve the\n            effectiveness and efficiency o f both the health system and\n            the referral network to support delivery o f the EHP. It\n            will be divided into two subcomponents: (a) Support for\n            central operations and, (b) Support to district operations.\n            Greater emphasis will be placed on support to operations at\n            district and lower levels."}, "docdt": "2004-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
