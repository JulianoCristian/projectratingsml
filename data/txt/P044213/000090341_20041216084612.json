This was in turn\n            aimed at supporting broad-based private sector growth. The\n            objective was to be accomplished by: (i) strengthening the\n            regulation, supervision and operations of deposit-taking\n            institutions; including the resolution and work-out of\n            problem banks; (ii) restructuring and privatization of\n            Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB); (iii) improving monetary\n            management and payment systems; and (iv) developing\n            insurance and contractual savings institutions, as well as\n            their oversight. The project never became effective because\n            two conditions of effectiveness were not fulfilled by the\n            Government, namely: (i) the approval of the credit by the\n            Uganda Parliament; and (ii) provision of a legal opinion\n            from the Attorney General confirming the validity of the\n            Development Credit Agreement (DCA). Despite strong\n            commitment to implement financial sector reforms by the\n            Ministry of Finance and Bank of Uganda, Parliament was\n            skeptical about the Government's plans to borrow money\n            for the second round of privatization of UCB as the initial\n            privatization to Westmont Land Asia in 1997 had proved\n            unsuccessful and a great cost to the country."}, "docdt": "2004-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
