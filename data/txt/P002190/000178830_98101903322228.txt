APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        As is true of most land-locked countries, effective access to
world markets is of primary importance to Rwanda. Located about 1,750 km
from the nearest port, Rwanda spends as much as 35% of its meagre export
earnings on transport costs for trade items.
ii.       Since independence, the main traffic routes for importe and ex-
ports have been through Uganda-Kenya and Burundi-Tanzania to the Indian
Ocean ports of Mombasa, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, respectively.
Of these routes, that to Mombasa is the more important; firat, because it
involves only one transshipment of traffic (between road and rail) and
second, because almost 50% of Rwanda's imports originate at points in
Uganda and Kenya lying on this route. Kampala, the capital of Uganda and
the main transshipment point on the route to Mombasa, has become a major
marketing center for Rwanda.
iii.      The proposed project provides for the construction of a paved
road from Kigali to Gatuna on the Uganda border, which, by connecting
more directly with the Uganda highway system than the existing trade route
via Kakitumba, will shorten the distance to Kampala and beyond by 73 km.
[t will also provide much better riding characteristics for local and
international road traffic. As a result, transport costs will be lowered
substantially for import and export traffic; this factor, combined with the
increased speed, convenience and safety of the new route will undoubtedly
generate addîtional traffic. The road construction project is estimated
to have an internal rate of return of 13%, on the basis of traffic diverted
from the existing link and normal growth.
iv.       The contract for construction of the road also providea for its
maintenance for a full year after construction is complete. This is to
ensure that the road is properly maintained, pending improvement of the
Government's maintenance service through implementation of maintenance
study recommendations (see para. vi).
v.        The project also includes the provision of a small amount of road
maintenance equipment to improve the effectiveness of mechanized mainte-
nance operations. Pending the reorganization of maintenance services, the
equipment will be allocated to a mechanized maintenance unit now deployed
on the existing road link from Kigali to Uganda via Kakitumba. This unit,
partially equipped through German aid, is efficiently managed and operated
by a four-man German technical assistance team. It comprises the only
mechanized maintenance unit in Rwanda at present.
vi.       Large-scale assistance to Rwanda's road construction and main-
tenance organization cannot be justified at present because of the poor
state of the organization and facilities available. A maintenance study
is needed to formulate a comprehensive program of rehabilitation and de-
velopment, including the provision of adequate local funds to meet the



- ii -
needs of an efficient maintenance service. The improvement of maintenance
facilities in Rwanda is vital to the proper upkeep of a major new paved
road link of international significance as provided under this project.
The UNDP is financing such a highway maintenance study, with the Bank as
Executing Agency. The Government has agreed to implement a higilway main-
tenance program, upon completion of the study and agreement with the As-
sociation on its recommendations.
vii.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$10.9 million
equivalent. The proposed credit of USS9.3 million equivalent represents
85% of the total cost of the project and covers the estimated foreign
exchange coats. The Government has confirmed that it will meet the local
costs, estimated at US$1.6 million equivalent. Belgium is making avail-
able US$600,000 equivalent to Rwanda as a contribution towards this local
cost financing.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$9.3
million equivalent.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Rwanda has asked the Association to help
finance a project consisting of;
(M) construction of a 79 km paved road between the capital,
Kigali, and Gatuna on the Uganda border, including (a)
preparation of bidding documents and supervision of
construction by consultants, and (b) provision for one
year's full maintenance of the project road by the con-
struction contractor; and
(ii) purchase of road maintenance equipment.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$10.9 million equivalent.
The Credit of US$9.3 million equivalent (85%) will cover the estimated
foreign exchange costs.
1.02      The road construction was first identified as a potential Bank
Group project in April 1966 when a PMEA mission visited Rwanda.  At that
time the European Development Fund (FED) was proposing a feasibility and
detailed engineering study of the Kigali-Gatuna road to be followed by
limited improvements. The Bank Group, believing there was a prima facie
case for total reconstruction of the road, proposed a common approach. As
a result the necessary studies were financed by FED, utilizing the services
of the Italian consultants, Electroconsult, on the understanding that the
Association would proceed with an appraisal thereafter. Electroconsult
completed its assignment in July 1969.
1.03      The project will provide a paved road, which will link Rwanda
and the Uganda highway system, replacing an existing earth track and re-
ducing by 73 km the road distance to Kampala, the market center and trans-
shipment point in Uganda for Rwanda imports and exports. It will there-
fore have a very favorable impact on transport costs related to Rwanda's
foreign trade. The project will al8o provide some road maintenance equip-
ment which will improve the effectiveness of mechanized road maintenance
operations.
1.04      Although, before independence, Rwanda was the partial recipient
of a 1957 Bank loan (165-BE) for a transport project in the Belgian Trust
Territory of Ruanda-Urundi, the proceeds were devoted entirely to expand-
ing the port of Bujumbura and to improvement of the Bujumbura-Muramvya
road, all in what is now Burundi. The proposed project will therefore be
the first Bank Group transport sector lending operation in Rwanda. However,
two earlier appraisal reports have been prepared for transport projects.



- 2 -
1.05      The first, initially prepared in the PMEA office in December
1967, consisted of a highway maintenance study, advisory services to the
Department of Roads and Bridges (DRB), the purchase of an emergency supply
of maintenance equipment and spare parts, and a serles of road feasibility
and detailed engineering studies. At the request of the Government this
report was drastically revised in October 1968 to delete the advisory
services and all but one of the road studies. A credit for this latter
proposed project was negotiated in November 1968 but the Government with-
drew its credit request in favor of a UNDP-financed study covering highway
maintenance and engineering of the Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road. The Plan of
Operation for this study was approved by the Government in April 1970.
The study is being carried out by the Italian consultants, Electro-
consult, with the Bank as Executing Agency.
1.06      This report is based on the economic and engineering studite of
Electroconsult and on the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. Chaix (engineer) and Brandreth (economist) who visited Rwanda in
December 1969. It was edited by Miss J. Murphy.
2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Rwanda, a land-locked country in east-central Africs about two-
thirds the size of Switzerland (23,640 km2), shares many of that country's
topographical features. With an average altitude of over 2,000 m, Rwanda
enjoys a tropical highland climate. Most of the arable land lies in the
mountainous western half of the country where rainfall is sufficient to
permit several crops per year to be grown. Further east, where the ter-
rain subsides into a rolling plateau, rainfall diminishes, the land is
less fertile, and the prevalence of the tsetse fly inhibits animal husban-
dry. As a result, the western mountain slopes are the most densely popu-
lated and there is little arable land which remains untilled.
2.02      The country suffered great social and political turmoil between
1959 and 1965, marked by internal tribal conflict and incursions by political
refugees sheltered in neighboring lands. This unrest intensified after 1962
when Belgium relinquished its trusteeship and Rwanda separated from Burundi
to become independent. This instability combined with a lack of experience
in government affairs led to a severe economic slump from which the country
did not start to recover until 1964. Rwanda is currentlv a one-partv repub-
lic with a relatively stable government and economic progress has been
moderately good in the last few years.
2.03      The population of Rwanda, growing at over 3% annually, currently
approximates 3.5 million, making it, with 148 inhabitants per km2, among
the most densely populated countries in Africa. The economy is primitive,
with subsistence agriculture the rule, and there are few population cen-
ters of consequence. The GDP per capita in 1968 was estimated at US$50,



- 3 -
of which over half consisted of food crops grown for subuistence consump-
tion. Commerce and industry are very limited and most manufactured gooda,
from cloth to machinery, as well as some food items, must be imported. Ex-
ports conslst almost exclusively of tin ore and coffee, supplemented by
pyrethrum and, more recently, by a growing volume of tea.
2.04      In 1968, imports, amounting to 75,000 tons, were 35% higher than
in 1966, representîng an annual growth of over 16%. Exports totalled about
17,000 tons in 1968 - up 29% from 1966 or 13.7% annually (Table 1). Prior
to independence, 25%-50% of overseas trade moved via Atlantic ports in
Congo (K) or Angola. In recent years all this trade has been diverted to
the Indian Ocean ports of Mombasa in Kenya and, less importantly, Dar es
Salaam in Tanzania. In 1967 and 1968, 92% of Rwanda's exporta and 85% of
imports moved over the route to Mombasa.
B.   The Transport System
(î) General
2.05      Road movements dominate transport in Rwanda for both internal
and external traffic. There are no railways, and while there is some water
transport on Lake Kivu, it is not of national significance. Scheduled air
transport in limited to international connections to all neighboring coun-
tries and Europe through Kigali airport which i equipped to handle modern
long-range jet aircraft.
2.06      The primary concern of the Government is with accesa to neighbor-
ing and overseas markets. The more productive northern area of the country
finds its natural outlet through Uganda, by road as far as Kampala, the
logical transshipment and local market point, and by rail from there to
Mombasa (see Map 1). Southern areas, with production centered in Butare
and Cyangugu, are closer to the Tanzanian outlet via Bujumbura in Burundi,
the Lake Tanganyika waterway to Kigama, and by rail from there to Dar es
Salaam. While this southern route is slightly shorter (1,750 km versus
1,800 km for the Mombasa route), there are two expensive and time-consuming
transshipients en route (road to water at Bujumbura and water to rail at
Kigoma) versus one transshipment (road to rail at Kampala) on the northern
route. Additionally, in the three years 1966 to 1968 inclusive, about 50%
of Rwanda's importe originated in Kampala or other intermediate stations
in Uganda and Kenya, chiefly refined oil producte, cement and salt. A
third route i under development, with German assistance, which will even-
tually link southeastern Rwanda by road with Tabora, Tanzania, and thence,
by rail, with Dar es Salaam. Thus, Rwanda ia endeavoring to maintain and
expands its options for port access, in an attempt to avoid situations en-
countered in the past in which, at one time or another, one or all of the
routes through Congo (K), Burundi and Uganda have been cut for political
reasons.



-4-
(ii) Highways
2.07      In spite of generally rugged terrain, Rwanda has a road system
which in relation to the area of the country, is more than three times as
extensive as that of its neighbors - Uganda or Kenya. Its 6,000 km of roada
consist of about 2,000 km of national routes and 4,000 km of tertiary local
roads. Almost the entire system consists of unengineered earth or gravel
roads on which standards of alignment and roadway width vary unpredictably,
and the classification relates chiefly to the allocation of responsibility
for maintenance and repair. The Ministry of Public Works and Energy is
reponsible for the national routes, while maintenance of the remaining
roads is undertaken by the local districts or communes. In practice, main-
tenance standards vary only slightly from one class of road to another.
Shortages of funda, competent staff, and equipment have reduced maintenance
operations, with few exceptions, to hand labor standards.  The Association
has been viewing the serious condition of maintenance services with concern
for two years and recommended a maintenance study leading to an improvement
program.  The UNDP is financing this study.
(iii) Transport Policy
2.08      Transport on the existing link between Kigali and Kampala is con-
trolled by the Agence Maritime Internationale, a subsidiary company of a
Belgian shipping line, which has been appointed by the Government to act
as forwarding and receiving agent and to contract for the road services re-
quired. Most of the transport is effected by Uganda road haulage firma
with only a few small local operators participating. Transport rates are
approved by the Government.
2.09      Several years ago, the Government created a public bus company
(Societe des Transports Publics) to operate inter-city passenger services.
In the past year, this organization has expanded considerably with Japanese
technical assistance, not only to extend its service to more communities
but also to introduce a bus service in Kigali proper. There are no other
organized passenger services in Rwanda - in fact, there are very few taxis
in Kigali and only one or two "bush" taxis in the countryside - in spite
of the fact that there are no restrictions applied to such services.
2.10      There are no regulations applicable to trucking services and no
restrictions to the importation of vehicles. A trade license is all that
is required to enter the transport business and, although provisions exist
for safety and economic regulations, none has been placed in force. Except
for the fact that capital is extremely scarce, it may be said that within
the local transport industry, conditions of virtually free competition ex-
ist.
2.11      Road user taxes of all types are very low, particularly since
April 1968 when the Governient cut many taxes in all fields. Import du-
ties on transport vehicles and parts range from 5% to 10%. Duties on
gasoline amount to RF 2 per liter   (US é 2)   which will be increased
to RF 4 per liter in the current year.  The diesel fuel duty in RF 2.5



per liter. There are no excise taxes on fuel and the price of diesel is
slightly lover than in neighboring Uganda. As a result, the Uganda
trucking firms handling Rwanda traffic arrange to purchase fuel in
Rwanda rather than at their home bases.
2.12      On the single paved route in the country, a 10 km stretch between
Kigali and the airport, a toll system has been introduced. The RF 50
(US$0.50) one way toll (for trucks) is calculated to be sufficient to
meet maintenance and amortization costs. There is, in effect, a road toll
on all international transport movements, since each time a truck or trailer
enters Rwanda, a tax of RF 1,000 (US$10) is payable (Table 2). Since
most of the important import-export traffic is handled by foreign vehicles,
this tax ensures a revenue contribution by carriers which might otherwise
escape taxation. It is likely, however, that most of this tax is ultimate-
ly paid by Kigali consumers in the form of a higher transport element in
the price of imported commodities. None of the foregoing revenues extracted
from road users is earmarked in any way for road construction, improvements
or maintenance. In 1967 and 1968, these revenues fell slightly short of
expenditures on road maintenance. In 1969, the shortfall was quite con-
siderable, as shown below:

1/   Road maintenance only, no construction undertaken.
Details of revenues and expenses are outlined in Tables 2 and 3 respective-
ly.
2.13      Since to be effective, any taxation policy of Rwanda mwut be cor-
related with that of neighboring countries, any increase in road user
charges should be carefully evaluated. As part of the UNDP-financed main-
tenance study, the consultants will look into the entire question of high-
way financing and will make specific recommendations as to the most effec-
tive way of charging road users (para. 3.11).

3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.   Road Traffic Characteristics
3.01      The vehicle fleet is small but has been growing extremely rapidly
lin recent years (see Table 4). Between 1965 and 1968, the number of private
cars increased 25% annually to reach a total of nearly 3,000 in 1968. Small
trucks and vans increased at an even faster annual rate (28%) exceeding 900
in 1968, while the number of large trucks increased from 400 to over 600 in
the period (over 13% per year). Figures for 1969 are not yet available but,
assuming these growth rates have continued, the total number of vehicles
currently exceeds 5,000. The vast majority of trucks carrying imports and
export traffic, however, are registered in Uganda. Typically, each of these
transport units consists of a 12-ton truck with a trailer capable of hauling
12-18 tons.
3.02      Traffic volumes are light throughout the country.  Less than 100
km of road handle 100 vpd.  The most heavily travelled routes include Kigali-
Gitarama-Butare (136 km), Ruhengeri-Gisenyi (68 km), Kigali-Ruhengeri (116
km), the Cyangugu-Burundi frontier road (47 km), and the Kigali-Kakitumba
road (208 km), currently carrying the Uganda traffic which will be diverted
to the proposed project road.
B.   Highway Administration
3.03      The DRB, a department of the Ministry of Public Works and Energy,
is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the national high-
way system. The organizational structure of the DRB is not clearly defined
but, in general, construction work is undertaken by one central office,
while maintenance functions are divided between the main Kigali office,
which retains control of mechanical equipment, allocating it according to
need, and 10 prefectural offices which employ hand labor on daily main-
tenance work. This structure is patterned on pre-independence procedures
which, at that time, provided Rwanda with a well maintained road network
on a modest budget. In recent years the growth in traffic, the lack of
budgetary resources, and the shortage of trained staff have resulted in
serious deterioration in technical and operational standards vith an in-
evitably adverse effect on the road system. At the present time, both the
construction and maintenance functions of the DRB are in the charge of for-
eign experts, although the DRB itself is headed by a national.
C.   Engineering and Construction
3.04      No road construction of importance has been undertaken in recent
years except for 10 km of paving near Kigali. Construction work by the
DRB has been confined, of late, to a few minor structures. The DRB has
also supervised the detailed engineering for the Kigali-Gatuna road fi-
nanced by FED and for a bridge on the road to Tanzania, at Rusumo, financed
by German aid. The major role in this work vas performed by foreign staff
provided under German technical assistance.



-7-
D. Maintenance Services
3.05      The maintenance service is run by two Belgians, an engineer
and a mechanic. The staff at their disposal has little or no technical
training, and, at the prefectural level, the educational potential, even
of senior staff, is frequently hampered by the lack of any language know-
ledge beyond the local dialect. This is one reason why mechanical equip-
ment i not allotted to the prefectures but is maintained under the super-
vision of headquarters. Another reason is because modern equipment in
good working order is in extremely short supply and, consequently, is not
available for regular assignment. The exception to this situation is one
maintenance unit recently equipped through aid provided by the Federal Re-
public of Germany. The unit, supervised and maintained by four foreign
technicians, operates efficiently, concentrating its efforts on the main
roads, especially the Kigali-Kakitumba-Uganda road, which, although only
an unengineered dirt road, is presently the best link vith Uganda.
3.06      The road maintenance equipment owned by the DRB was inventoried
before the mission arrived in Rwanda. Of a total fleet of 114 units, only
about 10% (7 agricultural tractors, 1 loader and 3 trucks), financed by
German aid lesa than two years ago, is operational. About 70Z of the
fleet is more than 5 years old and currently inoperable. These unit. are
beyond economie repair and should be written off. The remaining 20X con-
sists of units 3 to 5 years old and mont of it is out of service.
3.07      Efficient maintenance and repair of equipment is practically
impossible under present circumatances.  Aside from the lack of funds for
staff and spare parts, the DRB has no maintenance workshops or servicing
facilities and very few tools. It has no qualified local mechanics on
its staff.
3.08      The Government has requested IDA financing for equipment and spare
parts. But under present conditions, merely supplying new equipment and
spare parts would not provide a solution to the problem of equipient short-
ages because of the inability of the DRB to make effective use of such mate-
rial. Pending corpletion of the maintenance study and subsequent reorgani-
zation of road maintenance services, the project will provide a limited
amount of equipment which could be efficiently and effectively utilized by
the mechanized maintenance unit described in para. 3.05 (see para. 4.07).
3.09      The development of an adequate national road maintenance organi-
zation would require not only capital investments but the provision of a
substantial amount of technical assistance at the vorking level and a pro-
graa for large-scale training of local staff. Since the DRB's road mainte-
nance resources cannot adequately cope vith the existing national road sys-
ten and certainly would not be able to maintain the projected Kigali-Gatuna
road, it iS imperative that stepa be taken to improve the maintenance fa-
cilities and to develop an effective maintenance program. The UNDP-financed
highvay maintenance study, expected to be completed early in 1971, vill pre-
pare such a program. Specifically, this study vill provide recoumendations

and maintenance equipment needs. During negotiations, the Government con-
firmed that it vill, upon receipt of the study, and after consultations on
its recommendation and agreement with the Association, implement a progra.
to improve highway maintenance. Assuming adequate financing is available,
such a program could probably start by mid-1972.
E.   RighwaY FinancinR
3.10      Over the past 4 years (1966-1969) total highway maintenance ex-
penditures have averaged about RF 55 million per year (approximately
US$550,000 equivalent) (see Table 3). Of this, about RF 25 million vas
devoted to DRB salaries and RF 26 million to materials, spare parts and
vehicle fuel. The remainder (about RF 4 million per year) vas allocated
to the maintenance of tertiary roads to be done by the local communities.
There has been no expenditure for road construction; only the improvement
and paving of the 10 km airport road has been undertaken, financed in its
entirety by German aid.
3.11      Maintenance funds are drawn from general budgetary allocations
and are related to overall fiscal policy rather than road maintenance
needs. Funds have been generally inadequate to meet basic requirements.
The UNDP-financed maintenance study will investigate the financial re-
quirements of the DRB, present and potential road user taxes, the changes
that are needed to meet expenditure requirements and the desirability of
and necessity for earmarking a portion of these revenues for road mainte-
nance services.
4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project consists of:
(1) construction of a 79 km paved road between Kigali and Gatuna
on the Uganda border, including (a) preparation of bidding
documents and supervision of construction by consultants,
and (b) provision for one year's full maintenance of the
project road by the construction contractor; and
(ii) purchase of road maintenance equipment.
B. Construction of the KiRali-Gatuna Road
4.02      The Kigali-Gatuna road vill link Kigali, the capital and main
commercial center, with the road/rail network in Uganda by which most of
Rwandese importe and exports are shipped. At present, only a 107 km, sea-
sonal dirt track existe between Kigali and Gatuna. Importe and exports be-
tween Kigali and Uganda utilize another, low-standard, earth road that
goes around the Muhazi lake to avoid mountainous areas north of Kigali, and
reaches the Uganda border at Kakitumba in the northeast of Rwanda, 208 km



from Kigali. This road has not been engineered and has design standards
which vary from section to section, but are consistently low. The roadway
width ranges from 4 to 6 m and earthworks are very limited. In some sec-
tions in flat terrain, there is no laterite surfacing whatsoever. With
insufficient drainage and scarcity of laterite surfacing, the road is barely
passable for heavy trucks during the rainy season and does not permit satis-
factory vehicle operation under the best of conditions. The present mainte-
nance effort (para. 3.05) is helping the situation slightly, but any real
improvement would require total reconstruction.
4.03      The proposed road will go straight north 79 km from Kigali to
join the Uganda road system at Gatuna on the border. It vill connect
with a gravel road to Kabale, the improvement of which is scheduled for
completion in 1971 with financing from Credit 164-UG. From Kabale to
Kampala the highway is paved. Compared to the existing link via Kakitumba,
the proposed road vlll reduce the distance for transport between Kigali
and Kampala, the capital of Uganda and the transshipment point for most of
Rwanda's imports and exports, by 73 km. On the first 12 km, the new road
will closely follow the alignment of the Kigali-Ruhengeri road, and re-
construction of this section will also benefit the traffic on that route.
Beyond this point the new road will replace a seasonal track which is not
currently passable by heavy trucks because of weak bridges and steep grades.
It will connect two valleys separated by a high ridge which vill be cross-
ed by a 26 km long section on which substantial earthworks and numerous re-
taining walls are required. Locally, the road vill serve the town of
Byumba, located on a short spur, and its populated countryside as vell as
an important tea plantation near Gatuna.
4.04      Electroconsult prepared detailed engineering for a two-lane gravel
road including soil survey, earthwork, drainage, and bridges of lesa than
10 m length. For the most part, the design selected by the consultants can
be adopted for a two-lane paved road (6 m carriageway and one meter shoulder
width). In cut sections, however, the adoption of the consultants' design
would have reduced the shoulder width to only 0.5 m. The Association and
the Government agreed to widen the roadway in cut sections to keep a 1 m
width shoulder, with the exception of a very mountainous 26 km stretch near
Byumba, where widening of the proposed roadway would lead to prohibitively
expensive additional earthwork. (See Table 5 for design standards.) These
modifications increase the earthwork construction costs by about 5% over
the consultants' estimate. They are justified since they will simplify
pavement construction and provide better operating conditions. Engineering
required by these modifications in design will be undertaken under the
project.
4.05      Detalled engineering of three small bridges on the project road
ranging in length from 14 to 30 m has not been undertaken. Similarly, pave-
ment design has yet to be done. This work, combined vith the changes in
roadway vidth mentioned in para 4.04, vill take approximately four montha



- 10 -
and will have to be completed before bidding documents can be prepared.
While it vould have been desirable to have this work finished for consider-
ation during negotiations of the proposed credit, it was not essential.
The appraisal estimate for road construction includes the cost of changing
the design standards and adding the bridges and paving work.
4.06      Because of the inadequacy of the current maintenance service in
Rwanda, it is advisable to provide for separate maintenance of the project
road for one full year after its completion. This vill ensure that the
road is properly maintained until, as a result of the maintenance improve-
ment program implemented on the basis of the maintenance study recommenda-
tions (see para. 3.09), the DRB is in a position to provide its own adequate
service. The construction contract for the project road provides for full
maintenance of the road for one year after its completion, in addition to
the normal contractor's obligation to repair faulty construction; financial
provision has been made for this in the credit.
C. Purchase of Road Maintenance Equipment
4.07      The project als  includes the purchase of aome equipment and a
vehicle to increase the efficiency of mechanized maintenance operations.
Pending reorganization of maintenance services, the equipment would be
allocated to the mechanized maintenance unit working on the most heavily
used roads, mainly the Kigali-Kakitumba road. The equipment (1 bulldozer,
1 grader and 1 dump truck) will speed up maintenance activities while the
light transport vehlcle will improve liaison with Kigali, the major source
of supply. (Table 6 gives additional details on this unit.) The mainte-
nance study will make recommendations for absorbing this equipment within
the framework of an overall maintenance facility at a later date.

4.09      The construction cost estimates are based on quantities derived
from the detailed engineering estimates for a gravel road and on unit
prices prepared by the consultants and reviewed by IDA. They include
assesements of coste related to the roadway width changes mentioned in
para. 4.04, as well as estimates, based on the consultants' preliminary
studies, of the cost of the three small bridges not yet deeigned. They
also provide for road paving costs based on recent Government studies,
reviewed by IDA. An allowance of 15% has been included for work which has
been engineered, and of 20% for work which has not yet been engineered
(paving, bridges and design revision) to cover possible increases in physical
quantities. A price escalation allowance of about 10% has been provided to
cover the two-year construction period.
4.10      The estimates for consulting services include the preparation of
bidding documents, including the completion of detailed engineering for
bridges, paving and revisions in design standards, and the supervision of
construction. They vere confirmed during credit negotiations, when a con-
tract between the consultants and the Government vas aleo negotiated. A
10% contingency allowance is included to cover possible price variations.
4.11      The cost of the limited quantity of highway maintenance equipment
to be included in the project is based on estimated C.I.F. costs Kigali.

E. Execution
(j) Construction of the Kigali-Gatuna Road
4.12      The DRB will be responsible for the execution of the project
and is capable of doing so with the assistance of consultants. The con-
sultants will prepare bidding documents, advise on the prequalification
of contracting firms, and aid in the assessment of bide, as well as com-
plete the engineering work described in paras. 4.04 and 4.05 and super-
vise construction. The Government has retained Electroconsult to carry
out this vork because of their intimate knowledge of the project. Signa-
ture of the consultants' contract is a condition for effectiveness of the
credit.
4.13      Bidding documents will be submitted to IDA for review prior to
issuance. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that construction
work will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. The Government also confirmed that
adequate right-of-way will be available to permit construction to begin
on schedule. The construction contract ij expected to be awarded early in
1971; works vill require about two years.
(ii) Purchase of Road Maintenance Equipment
4.14      The maintenance equipment will be procured on the basis of cou-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. This vas confirmed
by the Government during negotiations.  The consultants vill assist the DRB
in the preparation of bidding documents within four monthe of the consultants'
contract effectiveness date.  They vill be submitted to IDA for review to
ensure that they conforu vith its procedures.  The equipment procurement con-
tracte will be awarded on the basis of the lowest evaluated bide.  The equip-
ment will be delivered during late 1970 or early 1971.
4.15      The maintenance equipment will be specifically allocated to the
mechanized maintenace unit described in para. 3.05 pending its redeployment
under a suitable maintenance program (para. 4.07). During negotiations,
the Government confirmed this disposition of equipment and its inten-
tion to ensure the efficient use of this equipment by supplying adequate
fuel, staff, servicing and maintenance.
F. Financing and Disbursement
4.16      The Association will finance the foreign costs of the project.
During negotiations, the Governuent confirmed that it vill meet the local
coste, estimated at US$1.6 million equivalent. Belgium is aking available
US$600,000 equivalent to Rvanda as a contribution towards this local cost
financing.



- 13 -
4.17      Credit disbursements will be made on the following basis:
(i) 85% of expenditures on road construction which
represents the estimated foreigu exchange com-
ponent thereof;
(ii) actual foreign exchange expenditures on the
consultants' contract; and
(iii) 100% of the C.I.F. price (Kigali) of maintenance
equipment.
4.18      Any surplus remaining in the credit account upon completion of
the project would be cancelled. Assuming credit effectivenesa in late
1970, IDA diïbursements will be as follows:

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The development of the economy of Rwanda beyond the present sub-
sistence level depende on the expansion of trade: essential importe
ultimately paid for by increased exports. Transport costs are a critical
element in this expansion because the distance of Rwanda from the Indian
Ocean places it at a basic disadvantage with regard to the price of importa
and the competitive position of its basic exports, coffee and tin, in the
world market. In 1967, for example, transport costs of importe and exporte
equalled 23% of export earnings. In 1968, this figure rose to 26% and, in
the first nine months of 1969, to 35%. Any reduction in transport costs
offers immediate and tangible benefits to the economy.
5.02      Construction of the project road clearly offers such benefits.
The present route to Kampala, via Kakitumba, is made up of 235 km of un-
engineered earth and gravel road and 349 km of paved road for a total dis-
tance of 584 km. The new route via Gatuna will only be 511 km, of which
488 km vill be paved. Not only will the proposed Kigali-Gatuna road offer
vastly improved riding conditions, but it will shorten the distance to the
railhead at Kampala by 73 km.
5.03      In 1968, about 8,700 trucks (with and without trailers) passed
over the existing Uganda route via Kakitumba, together with 2,900 cars and
light vans. International traffic over this route is expected to grow at
the rate of 8% annually until 1973, the year wheu the proposed road vill
be opened to traffic. Foreign trade growth has averaged 16.5% per year in
the past and is forecast by the Ministry of Commerce for an 8X - 10Z growth



- 14 -
over the next five years. The vehicle fleet in RIwanda has increased 24%
annually for the past four years and la likely to continue to increase
rapidly. The 8% growth estimate is therefore considered to be conservative.
5.04      This growth rate would yield about 12,780 trucks and 4,260 cars
and light vehicles by 1973 or about 47 vpd, all of which will be diverted
to the proposed road. When combined with local traffic now using the ex-
isting track, total traffic over the new Kigali-Gatuna route will amount
to about 60-65 vpd. On the first 12 km north of Kigali, the road will
also service the Kigali-Ruhengeri traffic, which, by 1973, will average
about 115-120 vpd, yieldîng an overall total for this section of 175-185
vpd.
5.05      Vehicle operating cost savings in 1973 will total about US$980,000.
The basis for these savings may be found in Table 7, in which vehicle op-
erating expense levels for different road surfaces are outlined.
5.06      Construction of the project road will result in a shift in road
maintenance costs arising not only for the new mileage to be created but
also by the diversion of traffic flows. Maintenance costs on the 208-km
Kigali-Kakitumba road, for example, will fall drastically since traffic
will be reduced to local requirements. The new Kigali-Gatuna road, how-
ever, will have maintenance expenses considerably higher than the existing
earth track.
5.07      Taking into consideration both vehicle operating costs and net
maintenance expenditures, the internal rate of return for a paved road
over 20 years i  slightly over 13%, which is sufficient to justify its
construction. These calculations are based on a modest increase in traffic
of 5% annually to 1978 and 3% thereafter. No allowance has been made for
generated traffic (see Table 8).
5.08      While it is unusual to find paving justifiable at relative low
traffic levels, the high proportion of heavy vehicles (up to 30-ton loada),
combined with the mountainous terrain, steep grades and heavy rainfall in
the area of the project road, tend to favor a paved surface. While paved
road construction and maintenance costs are higher than those for a gravel
or laterite surface, they are not sufficiently s0 in this case to offset
vehicle operating costs savings accruing to the pavement. As a result,
the paved road rate of return is virtually identical with that of a gravel
road. While paving the road will add US$1.6 million equivalent to construc-
tion cost, this addition vill yield an internal rate of return of almost
12Z, which ls sufficient to justify its expenditure. There is little doubt
that the calculations leading to this conclusion include only minimum bene-
fits since no provision has been made for generated traffic which would be
very much higher on a paved road than on a gravel surface.
5.09      Not all sections of the road offer the same rate of return from
paving. The sections into which the road can logically be divided yield
economic returns ranging from 8%-23%, as follows:



- 15 -
Road Sections (Km)         Z Economic Return
(Kigali) PK  O - 12                 23Z
PK 12 - 34                  9X
PK 34 - 60                10.5%
PK 60 - 79 (Gatuna)         8Z
Total          12%
The firet and third sections, representing nearly half the total length
of the road, offer acceptable rates of return, while the second and
fourth sections are marginal in this respect. However, it would be im-
practical to pave only part of the road now, since paving would be essen-
tial by 1976 and another paving project, requiring the mobilization of con-
tracting forces a second time, would involve higher costs. Also, gravel
roads deteriorate rapidly unless adequately maintained. The establishaent
of a maintenance unit designed to maintain the gravel portions of this road
for only about four years would be a costly undertaking. Accordingly, in
view of the satisfactory return on the project, a paved road is proposed.
5.10      Improvement of maintenance services on the main national road
links would offer very substantial benefits and a maintenance improvement
program should, from an economic standpoint, be given the highest priority
among future highway projects. The UNDP-financed maintenance study will
defîne such a program. While complete renewal of the highway maintenance
fleet must await the outcome of this study, the maintenance equipment pro-
vided under the present project will be efficiently and effectively utilized
by the mechanized maintenance unit, and will favorably affect the maintenance
standard on the most important roads pending implementation of a highway
maintenance program.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiations, the Governtnent agreed to the follow-
ing major matters:
(a) upon receipt of the highway maintenance study,
and after consultations on its recommendations
and agreement with the Association, a program to
improve highway maintenance will be implemented
(para 3.09);
(b) the design standards for the project road will
be changed as proposed by the Association (para
4.04); and
(c) the equipment to be purchased under the project
will be specifically allocated to a mechanized
maintenance unit under the supervision of qualified



- 16 -
experts and will be adequately staffed, supplied
and serviced (para 4.15).
6.02      Signature of the consultants' contract is a condition for effec-
tiveness of the credit.
6.03      The project is a suitable basis for an IRA credit of US$9.3
million.
