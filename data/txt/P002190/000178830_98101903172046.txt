INTER1ATIO1\UL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECO114ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DLIECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPIENT CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF I>IANDA
FOR A HIGHNAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed credit, in an amount in various currencies equivalent to
US$9,300,000 to the Republic of Rwanda.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed credit would be the first Bank Group operation
in Rwanda. Before independence in 1962, Rwanda, together with neigh-
boring Burundi, formed part of the Belgian Trust Territory of Ruanda-
Urundi. In 1957, the Bank made a loan of $4.8 million to Ruanda-
Urundi, with the guarantee of Belgium, for a road and lake port project
located in Burundi. While the dissolution of the Trust Territory and
the simultaneous creation of two independent States did not affect the
Belgian guarantee, it did raise a question as to the respective obli-
gations under the loan of the former constituent parts of the Trust
Territory. This succession problem has not yet been settled. However,
pending such settlement, and without prejudice to the rights and
obligations of the various parties concerned, interest on and principal
of the loan are being paid by Burundi. The Bank's present holding of
this loan is $1.4 million.
3.        The proposed road construction project was identified in
1966 by staff of the Bankts Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa, and
was appraised in December 1969 after completion of a feasibility
and detailed engineering study financed by the European Development
Fund (FED). Negotiations for the proposed credit took place in
Washington from April 27 to May 1st. The delegation from Rwanda was
led by the Ambassador of Rwanda in Washington, Mr. Nkundabagenzi. The
other members were Mr. Rugigana, Secretary General of the Ministry of
Finance, Mr. Katabarwa, Secretary General of the Ministry of Public
Works and 1Mr. Mulindangabo, representing the Secretary of State for
Planning.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
4.        Borrower:          Republic of Rwanda
Amount:            Various currencies equivalent to
US$ 9,300,000
Purpose:           To finance th:. foreign exchange cost of



- 2 -
the construction, and maintenance for one
year after completion, of a paved road between
Kigali and Gatuna; the purchase of maintenance
equipment; consulting services and supervision
of construction.
Amortization:    In 50 years, including a 10-year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments of
1/2 of 1  from July 1, 1980 through January 1,
1990 and of 1 1/2% from July 1, 1990 through
January 1, 2020.
Service Charge:   3/4 of 1% per annum.
Rate of Return:   13% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
5.      A report on the project "Appraisal of a Highway Projeet" (PTR-49-'a)
is attached.  Rwanda depends on neighboring countries for access to the
sea. The northern parts of the country find their natural outlets
through Uganda and Kenya.  In 1967 and 1368, 92% of Rwiandese exports and
85F/; of imports r;-oved over the route to Kanpala (Uganda) and ilombasa
(Kenya).  The project, which has first priority in the Government's
highway program, will provide a paved road to link IKigali, the capital
of Rwanda, and the Uganda road system, replacing an existing earth track
and reducing by 73 km the road distance to Kampala, the market center
and transshipment point in Uganda for Rw^Jandese imports and exports. The
project road would join up wTith a gravel road from Gatuna to Kabale, the
irmprovement of which is scheduled for completion in 19>71 under Credit
No. 164-UG.
6.      The project is estimated to cost $10.9 million equivalent,
including local taxes and duties. The proposed credit would cover the
estimated foreign exchange cost, which is about 85`@ of the total cost.
The Governmient of Rwanda is responsible for meeting the local costs
estimated at $1.6 million, towards which the Belgian Government has
confirmed its willingness to contribute $600,000 equivalent.
7.     I.lith transport costs on imports and exports amounting to not
less than one third of export receipts, any reduction offers immediate
and tangible benefits to the economy. The reduction in route length
and in vehicle operating costs per km would result in an internal rate
of return for the project of over 13%, based on conservative estimates
of traffic growth.

8.        The project would be completed in about three and a half
years, including preparation of bidding documents, construction of
the road and maintenance by the construction contractor for one
year after cornpletion. The construction contract would be a-warded
on the basis of international competitive bidding.
9.        The Government has already selected the consultants, to
be financed under the proposed credit, for the preparation of bidding
documents, including the completion of devailed engineering for
bridges and paving, revision of design standards, and the supervision
of construction. Signature of the contract with the consultants would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
10.       Road maintenance in Rwanda is unsatisfactory, but prior to
negotiations with the Association on the proposed credit, the Govern-
ment had entered into an agreement with the UNDP for an engineering
and highway maintenance study for which the Bank is executing agency.
When this study is completed, the Government will consult with the
Association on its recommendations and in agreement with the Association
will implement a program to improve highway maintenance. The proposed
credit provides for the purchase of a small amount of road maintenance
equipment which would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank/IDA Guidelines. Pending the reorganization of
maintenance services, this equipment wTould be allocated to an existing
mechanized maintenance unit that is operating satisfactorily with
technical assistance from the Federal ReDublic of Germany. The Govern-
ment has confirmed its intention to ensure efficient use of the
equipment to be provided under the proposed credit by supplyirg
adequate fuel, staff, servicing, and maintenance.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUPIENT AND AUTHORITY
11.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Rwanda and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee
provided for in article V, section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement,
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
12.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms generally
to the pattern of agreements br projects of this type.
PART V - ECONOIVI
13.       A reoort on "The Economy of Rwanda" dated July 2, 1968
(l%o. AF-7&a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 12,
1968 (i68- 21).

14.       Rwanda is one of the poorest countries in Africa.  The coun-
try is small and the population of 3.5 million is concentrated in the
fertile areas where the population density is very high, sometimes
reaching 200 per square kilometer. The growth of population has
absorbed all the accessible land and more land can be brought into
cultivation only at considerable expense. Most of the population are
subsistence farmers, but coffee exports provide an importantnsource of
cash income.
15.       With so small an economic base, the Government of Rwanda has
found it impossible to raise enough revenue to cover even modest ex-
penditures on essential government services. It has had to cover its
deficits by borrowing from the Central Bank and this has reduced its
foreign exchange resources and led to balance of payments problems,
which have been accentuated by fluctuations in earnings from coffee.
Since 1966, the Government has entered into four stand-by agreements
with the IN1F. It is clear that a basic improvement in Rwanda's situ-
ation is likely to be slow and Rwanda will have to continue to depend
on outside aid for some tinme. In recent years almost all public
investment has been financed by foreign aid, mainly from Belgium and
the European Development Fund.
16.       Ewandats external debt is very small, but in view of its
per capita income of only about $50 and its very low savings capacity,
I consider that Rwanda is not creditwqorthy for loansfrom the Bank and
is eligible for IDA assistance.
17.       A basic data sheet is attached as an Annex.
PART VI - RECOIEvIElATION
18.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed Development Credit.
