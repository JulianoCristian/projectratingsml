impacts. Lessons suggest the\n            following success factors. The groundwork established by the\n            Energy Sector Management Programme (ESMAP), and the Public\n            Sector Reform Loan, supported this project's\n            objectives, implemented largely in parallel with the Energy\n            Sector Technical Assistance Loan. However, the extensive\n            preparation work, which included a relatively large number\n            of missions, was also instrumental in the identification of\n            those elements of reform which required greatest support,\n            and whose outcome will likely have the most lasting impact.\n            Moreover, the carefully planned core of responsibilities by\n            Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA) in the management of the\n            wholesale market, its Third Transmission Plan, as well as\n            its own development plan, contributed to the strong\n            ownership response, demonstrated throughout implementation.\n            Despite successes, shortcomings included the attacks to the\n            transmission infrastructure, a risk not identified during\n            preparation, which had disruptive effects on the\n            transmission system. Thus, recognition of the possibility of\n            politically-induced terrorism on infrastructure projects,\n            should be introduced into the appraisal process. In\n            addition, the use of funds, e.g., for technical assistance,\n            constitutes an important lending element, and should be\n            recognized during the negotiation process."}, "docdt": "2002-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
