Re:
Loan 3954-CO (Power Market Development Project)
                     Amendment – New Closing Date and Amortization Period
Dear Sir:
Please refer to (i) the Loan Agreement, dated March 26, 1996, between the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Interconexión 
Electrica S.A. “ESP” for Loan 3954-CO, as amended pursuant to your Letter of Request 
dated April 14, 1997, and our Letter of Acceptance dated June 11, 1997, and (ii) our  
discussions on the progress of the Project, in which you informed us that the Loan is 
being disbursed at a pace faster than originally foreseen and requested that the 
Closing Date be anticipated to October 15, 2001.
We agree with your request, and propose to amend the Loan Agreement as follows: 
(a) in Section 2.03, the date “October 15, 2001” replaces the date “December 31, 
2002”;
(b) the first paragraph of Part C of Schedule 3 is amended to read as follows:
“1. Subject to the provisions of this Part C, the Borrower shall repay 
each Disbursed 
Amount of the Loan in semiannual installments payable on 
each February 15 and August 
15, the first such installment to be payable 
on the seventh (7th) Interest Payment 
Date following the Rate Fixing Date for 
such Disbursed Amount, and the last such 
installment to be payable 
on: 
(a) the twelfth (12th) Interest Payment Date following the Rate Fixing 
Date for such 
Disbursed Amount, if such Disbursed Amount has been 
withdrawn before August 15, 1998.  
In such case, each installment shall be 
one-sixth (1/6) of such Disbursed Amount; and 
(b) the eighteenth (18th) Interest Payment Date following the Rate Fixing 
Date for 
such Disbursed Amount, if such Disbursed Amount has been withdrawn 
on or after August 
15, 1998.  In such case, each installment shall be 
one-twelfth (1/12) of such 
Disbursed Amount.” 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment to the Loan Agreement, 
by signing and dating the three counterparts of this letter in the space provided 
below, and have the Guarantor, the Republic of Colombia, to also confirm its agreement 
to such amendment.  This amendment will become effective upon receipt by the Bank, not 
later than December 31, 1998, of a counterpart of this letter, duly signed by the 
Borrower and the Guarantor.
Sincerely, 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
