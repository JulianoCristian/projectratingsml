moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, and both the Bank and\n            the borrower performance were moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some important project lessons learned were: (1) Targeting\n            goes well beyond ensuring that project benefits reach the\n            neediest. It is also a function of matching subprojects to\n            communities' financial, managerial and technical\n            capacity, and their knowledge of local conditions, in the\n            equation supporting approval. (2) Fomenting community demand\n            without commensurate capacity or resources to filter,\n            evaluate, approve and finance the resulting proposals serves\n            no useful purpose. In this case it was the outcome of\n            poorly-designed information campaigns and well-intentioned\n            councils without guidance on the financing likely to be\n            available in a given year. (3) The inclusion of\n            environmental subprojects implies a significant task in a\n            Community-driven Development (CDD) context of information\n            dissemination, technical assistance and awareness-building.\n            (4) The sourcing and quality of technical assistance is as\n            important as its financing and needs attention from the\n            earliest stages of project development. (5) Cross sector\n            integration/leveraging is a complex, challenging and\n            long-term process intended to maximize the\n            cost-effectiveness and impact of development/poverty\n            reduction programs and policies. (6) The Project\n            re-confirmed the longstanding lesson of CDD, that\n            beneficiary involvement throughout the subproject cycle is\n            essential for suitable, well-targeted and sustainable subprojects."}, "docdt": "2012-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
