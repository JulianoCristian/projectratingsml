                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         xThe project is an integral part of the Government of Sergipe's rural development with inclusion strategy. The project will (i) improve the rural poor's access to basic
                         socioeconomic infrastructure, (ii) raise incomes and capital assets through investments in productive activities and increased linkages between small producers and
                         markets, and (iii) strengthen the cross-sector integration of investments in rural areas through improved participatory planning and monitoring at the local, municipal
                         and State levels.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
