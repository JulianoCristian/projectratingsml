3.       The proposed reallocation would allow the Borrower to carry out the ongoing
activities of the project, in compliance with the Project Development Objective.

4.      Project Development Objective will not change and all key outcome indicators will
also remain unchanged, while measurement of one outcome indicator has been revised
downward, namely the total number of subprojects - from 1,000 to 500. This reduced target is
a function of the increased average subproject cost, which itself is a result of the US dollar
depreciation and higher average level of inflation for construction goods and services. Project
Design and Scope will not change.

5.       If you agree with the proposal above, please sign the attached Amendment to the
Borrower confirming (i) to change the Borrower’s representative from the Secretariat of
Planning to the Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development; (ii) to extend the Project
Closing Date from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012; (iii) to reallocate the Loan Proceeds
as set out in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement for the above-referenced project.
