"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Overall, the project was satisfactory,\n            and sustainability is likely. The main objective of\n            establishing a community-based forest management, was\n            accomplished through the empowerment of user groups, by\n            active training and extension programs, in particular,\n            through the transfer of forest resources management, to\n            these groups. The key lessons demonstrate that setting the\n            appropriate policies and legislation, was paramount, thus\n            the Bank has a constructive role to play in support of\n            policy changes, in the early stages of the project cycle.\n            However, whether government institutions' capacity, can\n            support large-scale programs in the long run, remains\n            questionable, as demand for further support increases,\n            competition may arise in the formation of new groups. This\n            could be strengthened through private sector involvement.\n            Emphasis on forest ecosystems restoration suggest a valued\n            environmental service to local users, for it reduces soil\n            erosion, and improves water availability. The project also\n            demonstrated that forest user groups, appropriately managed\n            their financial accounts, with community supervision,\n            strengthening ownership. It is further suggested, that\n            project design should incorporate mechanisms to ensure\n            coordination with parallel programs, as well as flexibility\n            to adjust project activities, as needed."}, "docdt": "1999-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
