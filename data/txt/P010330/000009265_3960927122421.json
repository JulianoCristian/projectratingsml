The\n            project will be implemented by the Ministry of Forests and\n            Soil Conservation (MFSC), Department of Forests (FD),\n            Department of Forests and Plant Research (DFPR), and User\n            Groups over a period of seven years. The project consists of\n            four components: (i) an institutional support component to\n            strengthen FD's organization to enable it to identify\n            and establish about 4,000 User Groups and transfer\n            management responsibility for some 400,000 ha of forest land\n            to them; (ii) a plantation establishment and management\n            component, under which at least 56,300 ha of forest will be\n            established, and about 18 million seedlings distributed to\n            farmers for private planting; (iii) a training and extension\n            component to communicate the Government's Community\n            Forestry policy to FD staff and the communities; and (iv) a\n            research component which will help DFPR to generate improved\n            silvicultural techniques to conserve and increase the\n            productivity of forest resources."}, "docdt": "1989-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
