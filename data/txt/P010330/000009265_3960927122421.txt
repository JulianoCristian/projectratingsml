MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A HILL COMKUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for SDR 23.5 million (USS30.5 million equiv-
alent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be issued on
standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity. It would help to finance forestry
sector investments, training and extension, research, and institutional devel-
opment to support the implementation of Nepal's Forestry Master Plan and
Forestry Sector Policy. The project would be cofinanced by grants of US$6.85
million equivalent from the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA),
and US$0.51 million equivalent from the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP).
2.       Background.  Forestry in Nepal accounts for about 62 of both GDP and
exports, and meets over 90S of rural energy needs. In the Hills, forests are
an integral part cf the farming system, providing fodder for livestock, leaf
litter, and fuelwood for household energy. Hill forests supply about 402 of
the feed for livestock, estimated at 3.8 million metric (m) tons annually.
Leaf litter is used for bedding which, mixed with animal dung, provides
compost, almost the only fertilizer and soil-improving input to crop produc-
tion in the Hills. Hill farmers use about 3.3 million m tons of fuelwood
annually. Annual consumption of fodder and fuelwood is projected to grow at
1.72 and 2.01, respectively, per year during 1990-2020s without the project,
deforestation is expected to accelerate. Population pressure and the
increased demand for arable land and forest products has reduced the forest
cover by about 27t in the past 15 years, while about 219,000 ha of forest have
been degraded as a result of overutilization. Both His Majesty's Government
(HMG)'s recent Forestry Master Plan and Forestry Sector Policy have the major
objective of meeting the basic needs of the people for forest products. These
production goals would largely be attained by decentralizing from the present
State control over forest resources towards enlisting the people's partici-
pation in forest development, management, and conservation.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project would complement
actions initiated under the earlier forestry sector projects, and would
support implementation of HKG's Forestry Master Plan and Forestry Sector
Policy through promoting active participation by local forest users in the
development of community forests. This would be achieved by entrusting res-
ponsibility for the protection and management of Hill forests which hill
farmers rely upon to sustain their livelihood to these forest users.
Successful examplee of effective local management exist all over Nepal. The
responsibilities of Forest Department (FD) staff will change significantly,
from protecting the forest resource to encouraging and facilitating local
communities to assume this role. Such a change requires substantial reorien-
tation of attitudes and functions on the part of implementing agencies to
ensure that meaningful solutions are found to redress protection and manage-
ment problems at the local level. Building on existing working relationships
with the implementing agencies, IDA's involvement and support will help to



ensure that these far-reaching changes are implemented efficiently and in a
timely manner.
4.       Project Obiectives.  The proposed project is designed to mobilize
people and resources in the Hill districts of Nepal towards establishing a
forest management system which would conserve and expand the forest resources
needed to sustain traditional farming systems and livelihood in the Hills. It
would support a policy and institutional development process aimed at:
(a) training FD extension staff to identify and assist farmers to organize
themselves into User Groups which would be established as legal entities with
rights of use over State-owned forest lands which they have traditionally
used; (b) provision of VD technical and financial assistance to enable User
Groups to protect, improve, and maintain existing forests, or establish
forests in degraded areas in the areas that they would manage; tc) improving
the supply of fuelwood, fodder, leaf litter, and timber; (d) rehabilitating
overutilized areass (e) improving the vegetative cover which ie essential for
conserving soil and regulating water regimes; and (f) protecting the
environment.
5.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project would be implemented over
a period of seven years by the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation
CMFSC) through its Training Division, FD, Department of Forest and Plant
Research (DFPR), and User Groups. The project includes the following com-
ponents: (a) an Institutional Support component to enable the acquisition of
land use maps and the rapid identification of the forest areas regularly
accessed by rural communities for community forestry development. About
400,000 ha of forested (PPF) areas would be handed over to local User Groups
for protection and management. For degraded forest areas (PP), User Groups
would be formed to replant, protect, and manage the forest resource; (b) a
Forest Resource Management component comprising (i) the production of some 117
million seedlings for establishing and maintaining comunity plantations, and
distribution to farmers for private planting--a nominal charge would be levied
on seedlings for the latter, and seedling uptake would be monitored as a basis
for pricing and longer-term privatization of seedling production; (ii) the
establishment, protection and maintenanc.. )f about 46,700 ha by User Groups
and about 9,600 ha by  ID; (iii) the management of forested areas, to assist
User Groups to revive about 400,000 ha of degraded forest under the Project;
and (iv) the management of plantations, previously established by ID, to be
handed over for management by User Groups. Financial support to the Groups
would be provided for the first three years only; (c) a TraininR and Extenrion
component comprising (i) local and overseas training for PD staff and local
officials, as well as commnity leaders through a series of Reorientation and
Extension workshops, study tours and technical courses to be held in Kat)mandu
and at five regional training centers; and (ii) maintenance of a continuous
field extension program to inform rural comunities about the objectives of
the Community Forestry program and the provisions under the Project, empha-
sizing the role of local User Groups in assuming management responsibility
over areas to be assigned to them. This component would be financed by a
grant from DANIDA; and td) a Research component comprising (i) silvicultural
research to supplement an ongoing research program to include additional
trials and observations on local silvopastoral practices, effective natural
forest management, and successful establishment and management of plantations,
including those of native species; and (ii) socio-economic research to



- 3 -
understand the deteminants of successful coumunity r4nagement of comon
propeLty including survey of previous community forestry experience, socio-
economic aspects of forest production utilization, studies to assess program
uptake, and other studies as may be required for the project.
6.       Project cost is estimated at US$45.39 million (April 1989 prices),
with a foreign exchange component of US$5.75 million (13X). This includes
investment costs of US$40.99 million (902) and incremental operating costs of
US$4.40 million (10X). IDA would finance US$30.55 million (67Z of total
costs), including US$30.45 million for investment cost (including User Group
formation and plantation establishment) and US$0.10 million for recurrent
costs. DANIDA and UNDP would cofinance US$6.85 and US$0.51 million -nder their
respective grants, the latter being part of a US$2.3 million project
(NEPl85/017). The project would be implemented in close coordination with
ongoing multilateral- and bilateral-assisted rnmmunity forestry programs in
Nepal. Retroactive financing of US$3.0 millimn would be provided to cover
expenditures incurred after October 31, 1988 for procurement of materials and
equipment, and to initiate plantation establishment to be financed under the
project. A financing plan and breakdown of costs are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in Nepal are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map, IBRD 21343R, is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7631b-NEP, dated May 10, 1989, is
being distributed separately.
7.       Agreed Actions.  HKG has agreed on the following actionst
(a) by December 31, 1989, (i) to procure maps and information for
detailed planning of field operations in all project Districts,
(ii) to appoint key staff, and (iii) to implement a travel and
field allowance policy satisfactory to IDA;
(b) to establish User Groups with agreed characteristics; to
disburse project funds to such Groups only against their proper
Certification and Operational Plans, and according to agreed
compensation rates; and to submit to IDA, at prescribed
intervals, certified and audited project accounts;
(c)  by December 31, 1991, to submit for IDA's coments, the results
of a study on seedling uptake and draft seedling pricing
policy, and to implement the agreed recommendation by June 30,
1992;
(d) by May 1, 1993, to conduct a coordinating Workshop to discuss
the Mid-Term Review Report to be prepared by MFSC;
(e) by December 31, 1989, to appoint key research and training
staff to MFSC, PD, and DFPR; and
(f) to finalize the Operational Guidelines (which specify the
membership, powers and functions of forest User Groups, and
procedures for transfer of forest lands to such Groups) in
agreement with IDA, and issue them as a condition of credit
effectiveness.

8.       Benefits.  The project would (a) conserve and stabilize a fragile
ecosystem; (b) increase fuelvood, fodder, and timber productions (c) Improve
FD's capability to plan resource allocation and work with local users to
manage, improve, and develop the forest resourcel and ld) alleviate poverty.
The economic rate of return of the project is estimated to be 36SZ.
9.       Environmental Impact and Benefits to Women.  Beyond the immediate
project benefits, the project would help reverse environmental degradation by
reforestation and improve existing forest and vegetative ground cover. These
actions would reduce erosion, sedimentation, and the severity of flash
flooding often attributed to removal of forest cover in the Hills. Providing
improved ac2ess to fuelvood and fodder to local users would also benefit
women, who spend increasingly long hours collecting these and other forest
products to provide for farm and family. Representation of rural women in
User Group committees would also ensure that management plans are designed
with these needs in mind. By allowing for a guaranteed supply of needed
products, the project would improve the living and working conditions of rural
women.
10.      Risks.  The main risks are that (a) FD staff may inadequately imple-
ment HMG's Community Forestry policy, although to mitigate this risk, MPSC
would issue clear procedures and instructions to its staff, und-'rtake an
intensive training and reorientation program, and create a strong monitcring
system to supervise the effort; (b) local communities and User Groups may be
slow in understanding the new policy or in assuming related responsibilities,
although extension activities and provision of incentives would minimize this
risk; and (c) local bureaucracies and User Groups may face conflict of inter-
est for the use and management of forest resources--this risk would be avoided
by clearly defining User Groups' role and functions, their benefits from par-
ticipation, and technical and financial support for their forestry development
activities. Measures to mitigate these risks and introduce necessary incen-
tives have been included in the project design and conditionalities as
required.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
