       INDIA — MAHARASHTRA WATER SECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
                              P084790
                         (LOAN NO. 4796-IN)

                                 Restructuring Paper


1. The Loan closing date for India, Maharashtra Water Sector Improvement Project,
   [Loan No 4796], P084790 will be extended from March 31, 2012 until March 28,
   2014 based on a formal request from the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry
   of Finance, Government of India.

2. Initially the project made a slow start on award of civil works contracts of canal
   rehabilitation/modernization and dam safety, as the main focus of the Government of
   Maharashtra (GoM) in the initial two years was on completion of key institutional
   and regulatory reform actions. The project is supporting a number of key policy,
   legal, institutional, regulatory and service delivery related water sector reform
   initiatives in Maharashtra. These include: (i) establishing a regulatory institution in
   the water sector, namely Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority
   (MWRRA), (ii) restructuring of the Water Resources Department (WRD), (iii)
   restructuring of the existing Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation
   (MKVDC) into a river basin agency, (iv) formation of Water Users Organizations
   (WUOs) in 236 irrigation schemes, (v) transfer of irrigation systems and irrigation
   services delivery management to WUOs in the said irrigation schemes on completion
   of rehabilitation/modernization works, and (vi) volumetric and bulk supply of
   irrigation water to WUOs as per their water entitlements in the said irrigation
   schemes. Project implementation at this stage is satisfactory. Except for the
   restructuring of MKVDC in to a river basin agency, all other institutional/regulatory
   reform actions have been completed; and linked to completion of canal
   rehabilitation/modernization works, irrigation system management has been
   transferred to 625 WUOs and water entitlements have been issued to 550 WUOs till
   date. Civil works contracts relating to canal rehabilitation/modernization in 236
   schemes and dam safety works in 277 dams have been awarded, and the loan amount
   is fully committed. Of the above 236 irrigation schemes, canal
   rehabilitation/modernization works in 136 schemes have been completed, and the
   works in an additional 38 schemes are at various stages of implementation and are
   scheduled to be completed by March 31, 2012. Thus, canal
   rehabilitation/modernization works are likely to be completed in 174 schemes (74
   percent) by the current project closing date of March 31, 2012. However, completion
   of the works in the remaining 62 schemes (26 percent) would spill beyond March 31,
   2012. Further, of the 277 dams, dam safety works in 159 dams have been completed,
   and works in an additional 63 dams are at various stages of implementation and are
   scheduled to be completed by March 31, 2012. Thus, dam safety works in 222 dams
   (80 percent) are likely to be completed by current project closing date of March 31,
                                            4
   2012. However, completion of the dam safety works in the remaining 55 dams (about
   20 percent) would spill beyond March 31, 2012. Activities under other components
   are also progressing well and have either been completed or are nearing completion.
   The disbursement under the project has reached about 67%. The left-over activities
   would be completed and the entire Loan amount utilized during the proposed project
   extension period of two years.

3. The proposed loan extension of two years would enable the GoM to complete: (i)
   ongoing dam safety works in all the 277 dams, and canal rehabilitation/modernization
   works in 234 of 236 (99%) irrigation schemes covered under the project; (ii) major
   irrigation sector reforms actions of irrigation management transfer and
   implementation of water entitlements to the WUOs in 234 completed schemes as
   these reforms are linked to the rehabilitation/modernization of irrigation schemes,
   (iii) restructuring of MKVDC in to a river basin agency and (iv) further consolidation
   and deepening of other completed/ongoing water sector reform initiatives besides
   helping achieve the project development objective fully.

4. This will be the first extension of the loan closing date.
