1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

        Maharashtra was the third most populous state in India, mostly agriculture dependent
and rural, with an estimated poverty rate exceeding 30 percent of the population. Poverty
rates were very high among cultivators and agricultural laborers (23% and 57%
respectively). The ultimate irrigation potential of the State was estimated at about 12.6
million hectare (m ha), with 8.5 m ha from surface water and 4.1 m ha from ground water
sources. As of June 2003, total irrigation potential created in the State was 5.8 m ha (surface:
3.9 m ha and ground water: 1.9 m ha), i.e., about 46% of the ultimate irrigation potential.
The total gross cropped area was about 22.39 m ha, of which only about 14.5% was
irrigated.

        In 2005, the water sector in Maharashtra faced many challenges. Competition for
water among different sectors had increased dramatically, giving rise to disputes and
conflicts. Of the total water used in the State, 80% went to irrigation, 12% for domestic
water supplies, 4% for industrial use, and the remainder for other uses. With a rapidly
growing urban population of about 41 million (42% of total), the long-term multi-sectoral
management of the State’s water resources was becoming critical. The quality of irrigation
service delivery was poor, with only 30% of water released at the head being delivered to
the end user, thus undermining the performance of irrigated agriculture. Planning and
management of water resources in the State was fragmented and un-coordinated. Limited
cost recovery in the irrigation sector contributed to inefficient on-farm use of irrigation
water, which added to the state’s fiscal burden. Large, state-guaranteed market borrowings
by the Irrigation Department Corporations (IDCs) were used to finance the construction of
storage infrastructure. Without completed distribution systems this infrastructure was not
generating any return.

         The project was designed to address the above issues, except the issue relating to
fiscal crisis due to large state-guaranteed borrowing by the IDCs. To meet the above-
mentioned water sector challenges a number of water sector policies and institutional and
regulatory reforms were initiated by GoM. As a part of the project preparation dialogue,
GoM adopted the Maharashtra State Water Policy in 2003, which set out a framework for
the development and management of water resources in the State in a multi-sectoral manner.
To address the issue of competing water demand, GoM established water sector regulatory
institutions and adopted enabling legislation, i.e., the Maharashtra Water Resources
Regulatory Act 2005. Maharashtra was the first Indian state to establish a water sector
regulator. MWRRA has, inter alia, been mandated to decide on the bulk water entitlement
for various sectors of water users and also to decide water tariffs in a transparent manner.
To promote efficient, equitable and sustainable irrigation service delivery through effective
involvement of Water User’s Associations (WUAs), and to reduce the canal irrigation
subsidies, GoM enacted the Maharashtra Management of Irrigation Systems by Farmers Act
(MMISF) in 2005. MMISF is the Act that provides bulk water supply as per water
entitlements under MWRRA and the eventual transfer of irrigation system management to
WUAs. GoM also initiated the restructuring of the Water Resources Department and IDCs
to ensure coordinated and holistic multi-sectoral planning, development and management of
state water resources in a basin context.


                                               1
        The Bank assisted the government in developing its long-term vision by providing
technical assistance (TA) and support through the Bank-Netherlands Water Partnership
Program (BNWPP). This TA helped GoM to strengthen its key water policy and provided
assistance with legislation for setting up the new MWRRA. Once GoM developed the
vision, and put in place the enabling policy and legislative environment, the rationale for
further direct Bank assistance through a project was sound.

        The project design supported the 2004 India Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
goals of: (i) accelerating rural growth through improving the value and quantum of
agricultural production; (ii) improving governance and service delivery through institutional
strengthening at state and local (farmer) levels; and (iii) providing adequate infrastructure
through investment in rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure. The
project was also consistent with the CAS’s strategic principle of applying selectivity and
focusing on activities which supported the Government of India’s development goals to
reduce poverty and ensure environmental sustainability. The project followed the Bank’s
guidelines for lending in the irrigation and drainage sector, and presented the Bank with a
unique opportunity to partner with a progressive and committed State government. If
successful, the project could influence development policy, improve management practices,
and help introduce similar water sector reforms in other Indian states.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

        The project development objectives were: (i) to strengthen the State's capacity for
multi-sectoral planning, development and sustainable management of the water resources;
and (ii) to improve irrigation service delivery and productivity of irrigated agriculture.

       Performance indicators were selected to measure the achievement of both aspects of
the development objective.

1.3       Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

          There were no formal revisions of the PDOs and Indicators.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

        It was estimated at appraisal that the project would directly benefit approximately
1.28 million people in 233,400 farm households (HHs). These include about 185,000 poor
individuals in 33,610 farm families, who were expected to be brought above the poverty
line.

        Other intended beneficiaries of the training and capacity building interventions were
identified as staff of various agencies including: Water Resources Department (WRD);
Irrigation institutions under the administrative umbrella of the WRD; Water and Land
Management Institute (WALMI); Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority
(MWRRA); and Maharashtra Krishna Valley Water Resources Corporation (MKVWRC). In
addition, farmer members of Water Users Association (WUAs) and selected officers within
the Agricultural Department (AD) were also expected to benefit.

1.5       Original Components

          The project had four components indicated below.

Component A: Water Sector Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building
(US$21.1 million)

        This component was designed to focus on institutional reforms in the water sector
with the objective of strengthening the State’s capacity for multi-sectoral planning,
development and management of the water resources on a river basin basis. It was to
support: (i) the establishment and operationalization of MWRRA; (ii) restructuring of the
existing MKVDC into MKVWRC as a river basin agency, and its capacity building; (iii)
restructuring and capacity building of WRD; (iv) capacity building of WALMI; and (v)
establishment of an integrated computerized information system (ICIS).


                                                3
Component B: Improving Irrigation Service Delivery and Management (US$321.35
million)

        This component focused on improving service delivery and productivity in irrigated
agriculture through improved irrigation system performance, effective participation of water
users in irrigation system management, increased cost recovery, implementation of water
entitlements, and improved agricultural support services delivery. It was designed to
support: (i) participatory rehabilitation and modernization of about 286 selected irrigation
schemes covering about 670,000 ha of cultural command area (CCA); (ii) enhancing the
safety of 291 dams supplying water to the project area; (iii) formation and capacity building
of WUAs in about 286 selected irrigation schemes; (iv) improved water management
practices and instruments, such as bulk supply and volumetric charging of water to WUAs in
6 selected irrigation schemes in the Krishna Basin; (v) strengthening of agriculture support
services in the project area; and (vi) implementation of social and environmental
management plans, consistent with the Social and Environmental Management Framework
(SEMF), that were to address project related social and environmental issues.

Component C: Innovative Pilots (US$4.80 Million).

        This component supported: (i) four pilots of user-centered aquifer level groundwater
management to develop and test approaches and practices; and (ii) four pilots supporting
two innovative models for agriculture in irrigated areas. The first entailed a private entity
hired by the WUA for technical support to promote commercial farming in the pilot area.
The second involved the formation of a joint venture company by the WUA and a private
entity under which farmers would be given a minimum return and a share of profits on
agreed terms.

Component D: Project Management (US$4.02 Million)

       This component supported: (i) the State level Project Preparation and Management
Unit (PPMU); (ii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E); and (iii) an information, education,
and communication campaign (IEC) to create awareness about project initiatives.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Assessment of contextual and background analysis

       The Bank conducted a background diagnostic, including a supplementary analysis on
public expenditure (PER) and fiscal impact (FI), to support project preparation and design.
This diagnostic was thorough and effective as it clarified the water sector issues faced by the

                                              4
State, actively engaged the Borrower at various stages in project identification and
preparation, and contributed to building trust. As a result, the understanding of relevant
national and state policies and higher level country and CAS objectives was broad-based,
sound and measured. This understanding and engagement provided a strong rationale for
continued Bank partnership, which had preceded MWSIP through TA provided by BNWPP.
This analytical foundation was valuable in steering the overall direction of project design
and management of sector reforms. The depth and quality of background analysis was
strong, and the level of preparation by GoM provided a solid foundation upon which the
project was designed.

2.1.2 Assessment of Project Design

        In view of the multitude of challenges, constraints and need for new approaches,
project design needed to be selective, measured and well sequenced. In the absence of the
requisite institutional mechanisms, capacity and skills for multi-sectoral coordination and
planning, there was an implicit risk that too much could be pushed too soon. In hindsight,
the overall project design was complex. It also lacked some clarity on the challenge of
restructuring MKVDC and the required political commitment to ensure that this moved
forward. The design of project implementation management arrangements, involving a
number of government agencies and partnerships with new WUOs and NGOs, compounded
by low initial capacity, caused problems in component/sub-component activity sequencing
and coordination. However, given the BNWPP support during project preparation, the
Bank’s experience with other similar project s in India and globally, and the level of
government commitment to bring about fundamental changes in the sector, there was
realism in formulating the project design and in the assessment of outcomes.

2.1.3 Safeguards

        The project was categorized as environmental Category A, safeguard screening
category S1, and triggered six Bank safeguard polices: (i) Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP 4.01); (ii) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12 and OD 4.30); (iii) Cultural
Property (OPN 11.03); (iv) Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20); (v) Safety of Dams (OP/BP
4.37); and (vi) Nutrient and Pest Management (OP 4.09). An Integrated Social and
Environmental Assessment (ISEA) was carried out as part of project appraisal which
identified the key social and environmental issues. From this assessment a Social and
Environmental Management Framework (SEMF) was developed which was applied by
project management staff. This maximized the positive impacts while taking appropriate
mitigating measures against adverse impacts to ensure compliance with Bank Safeguard
policies. The SEMF was comprehensive and included specific frameworks for: (i)
Resettlement and Rehabilitation; (ii) Tribal Development; (iii) Gender; (iv) Dam Safety; (v)
Pest and Nutrient Management; (vi) Cultural Property; and (vii) a Consultation Strategy.
The project EA was sent to the Bank’s InfoShop on December 31, 2004 , and the final
Integrated Safeguard Data Sheet (ISDS) was disclosed in the InfoShop on December 19,
2004.

2.1.4 Assessment of Government Commitment

       The high level of Government commitment to sector reforms was clear: (i) adoption
of the Maharashtra State Water Policy in 2003; (ii) enactment of the 2005 MWRRA Act;


                                             5
and (iii) enactment of the 2005 Maharashtra Management of Irrigation Systems of Farmers
(MMISF) Act. These Acts have since been implemented.

2.1.5 Assessment of Risk

        Four risks were identified at appraisal: (i) GoM commitment to the institutional
reforms; (ii) viability of participatory irrigation management; (iii) provision of counterpart
funding; and (iv) effective delivery of agricultural support services. Mitigation measures
identified at appraisal proved only partially effective. Counterpart funding was a persistent
problem and slowed implementation, particularly in the first half of the project. There was
also an under-estimation of the risks associated with the restructuring of MKVDC. Other
risks that emerged during project implementation and caused implementation delays were
associated with a design involving complex institutional reforms, the number of components
and sub-components, difficulty in coordinating the large number of implementing agencies,
and capacity constraints of the implementing agencies.

2.1.6 Quality at Entry

        The rationale for Bank involvement was strong and the PAD comprehensively
analyzed the background issues to justify the Bank intervention. The project PDO had two
distinctive elements, institutional development and improved irrigation services, and focused
on outcomes for which the project could reasonably be held accountable. The PDOs and
PDO indicators were designed to address issues identified in project preparation, e.g.,
improvement of service delivery and multi sector planning needs. Project activities were well
designed, as confirmed by the implementation of almost all project activities, albeit with an
extension of the loan closing date.

2.2 Implementation

        Strong Government commitment for public sector reforms was critical in driving the
project and underscoring longer term sustainability. Since the late 1990s Maharashtra has
been consistently proactive in introducing public sector reforms to improve state finances
and development impact. GoM has also actively engaged with the central government as
part of the wider reform agenda. Maharashtra’s water policy was the first State water sector
policy after the National Water Policy of 2002. This policy sustained project momentum and
helped to internalize policy reforms with decision makers. As a result, there have been
positive spill-overs, not only from the efforts of GoM leading up to the project, but also on
project outcomes that go beyond the project into State-wide and central government
planning and water sector reforms.

         Problems such as lack of counterpart funds and inadequate PPMU staff hindered
project activities during the first half of project implementation and progress was slow. At the
MTR (March 2009), the PDOs were still considered relevant, and no changes were required
either to the PDOs or to the overall project design. Within the overall target of 609,000 ha
for irrigation service improvement benefits however, and based on technical and economic
feasibility considerations/assessments, 54 schemes (3 medium & 51 minor) with a CCA of
40,557 ha were dropped and areas under three major schemes totaling 55,000 ha were
reduced; four new schemes totaling 95,557 ha were introduced in their place. At MTR, only
24% of the loan amount was disbursed, but this was expected to accelerate in FY2009/10.
Overall project implementation was assessed to be generally on track and planned activities

                                               6
under the project were expected to be completed within the project period, provided GoM
took decisive action on the agreed revised implementation schedule.

        The scale of Component C was significantly altered at the MTR by the deletion of one
groundwater pilot (C1) and the cancellation of all activities for the irrigated agriculture pilots
(C2). The original allocation of US$4.80 million was reduced to about US$2.00 million to
fund the remaining three groundwater pilots. These pilots were completed for US$1.05
million, well below the revised estimate of US2.00 million. The contracted cost of the main
civil works investment for the 116 groundwater recharge structures was considerably below
the appraised estimate because of the close involvement of each community. Further, water
meters for two of the three pilots could not be procured in time. (See annex 1 and 2 for more
details).

        All changes were endorsed by Bank management and were set out in the management
letter dated May 29, 2009 following the MTR.

        Activities on the irrigated agriculture pilots (C2: US$ 2.1 million) were dropped in
agreement with the Bank in April 2011 because of difficulties in finalizing MOUs and getting
all requirements in place. No expenditure was recorded for this activity. Similar initiatives are
now been undertaken under Bank-funded Maharashtra Agriculture Competitiveness Project.

        The Bank downgraded the ratings for IP and DO from satisfactory to moderately
satisfactory in May 2009 because key institutional reforms were still to be carried out and
legal covenants relating to the restructuring of MKVDC into a new MKVWRC and
restructuring of WRD were not complied with. In addition there was slow progress on the
award of dam safety works contracts and overall disbursement was low. Both disbursement
and dam safety investment picked up after the MTR and the IP rating was upgraded to
satisfactory in May 2010. However, the DO rating was retained as Moderately Satisfactory
until the end of the project because of non-compliance with the covenant on restructuring
MKVDC.

       Level 2 Restructuring. Through a restructuring approved in March 2012, the loan
closing date was extended by two years to March 28, 2104 (Report No. 67032 IN). This was
to enable GoM to achieve the PDOs by completing: (i) further consolidation and deepening
of completed/on-going water sector reform initiatives, including the major irrigation sector
reform involving transfer of irrigation management to WUAs; (ii) restructuring of MKVDC
into a river basin agency; and (iii) on-going dam safety works. Apart from the “formal”
MKVDC restructuring, all other project activities envisaged at the time of this extension
were completed.

       A second Level 2 restructuring involving a reallocation of funds amongst categories
and partial loan cancellation was approved in March 2014 (Report No: RES13811) to match
the work plan and progress at the end of the project. These reallocations resulted in an
increase of funds in the civil works category, with a corresponding decrease in the other
categories. Also, because of large variations in the exchange rate which saw the Rupee
depreciate by about 40% over the life of the project and GoM’s inability to utilize these
savings, US$15.0 million of the loan was cancelled.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


                                                7
        M&E Design. Institutional and management arrangements for the M&E system,
which included the establishment of Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation sub-unit
within the PPMU and an independent M&E agency, were sound. The project would have
benefited from a more thoughtful framing of key indicators and the results framework to
establish a clearer link to the achievement of the PDOs. Some confusion was apparent in the
use of identical indicators for PDO outcome and intermediate outcome/outputs. Progress
against PDO indicators was designed to be monitored as an integral part of project
implementation.

        M&E Implementation. Overall, M&E activities were driven entirely by external
consultants, who worked relatively independently towards a common end objective. There
were a number of positive aspects to M&E implementation. The approach taken and quality
of the data provided by the third party consultant was sound. End of project impacts were
compiled from data that tracked the same households (HHs) over the course of the project
(quarterly) from baseline survey to the final HH survey. Net increases/decreases for project
HHs were determined from the parallel tracking of a control group of HHs outside the project.
Shortcomings in M&E implementation include: negligible development of institutional
capacity for M&E within the PPMU and the implementation agencies; and low priority
accorded by the Bank and Borrower to developing sound on-going M&E systems for data
collection and analysis, and for continuous review of M&E quality and internalization.

       M&E Utilization. Physical and financial progress was monitored regularly, based
on project progress reports. Information collected and collated by the monitoring
consultants has been used in the Borrower’s and the Bank’s ICRR. However, there is little
evidence that the M&E system was purposefully used in dynamic decision making for
management purposes.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguard compliance. The Social and Environmental Management Framework
(SEMF) provided a sound basis to respond to the environmental and social issues in a
programmatic manner. It included an entitlement framework for resettlement of project
affected people, strategy for consultation, participation, and strategy to address issues related
to women and tribal people, as well as institutional strengthening activities in relation to the
social and environmental management of the project. It also described the process to be
followed to ensure that environmental and social aspects were integrated in planning and
implementation of project activities at the sub-project level. Based on the findings of ISEA
and SEMF, social and environmental management plans (SEMPs) were prepared for each
scheme included in the project, and took into account the respective framework and
strategies for key issues. i.e., Dam Safety, Sustainable Agriculture including Pest Nutrient
Management, Resettlement, Tribal and Gender development and Community participation.
SEMPs included a detailed design for institutional/management arrangements and a detailed
budget for executing these plans. A model tribal development plan for one of the sub-
projects was also prepared.

        Environment Aspects. As the scope of physical works was on the rehabilitation and
modernization of existing irrigation systems, there were no significant negative
environmental impacts identified, including on forestry and bio-diversity. There was
satisfactory compliance with the environmental impact safeguard.

                                               8
        Social Aspects. The project was in compliance with Bank social safeguard polices.
A total of 1,677 WUAs were formed with 30% of women in the Managing Committees
(MC). In all, 41 Tribal Development Plans were implemented to enhance the representation
of tribals in WUAs. This also enabled tribal people to access project benefits equitably.
Application of the SEMF to each of the 235 schemes facilitated the determination of any
adverse impacts on households. Screening reports prepared on the implementation of SEMF
established that no land asset was required for sub-projects. An independent assessment
confirmed that none of the 149 families at Mula (Ahmednagar) were adversely affected by
the rehabilitation of the canal network.

       Dam Safety. The project was in compliance with the Dam Safety policy and work
programs for each dam were implemented satisfactorily. Three Expert Dam Safety Review
Panels (DSRPs) were established and provided sound professional oversight during project
implementation. They made a number of recommendations to improve dam safety
including: (i) restoration of dam sections; (ii) raising dam heights in view of recalculated
probable design flood; (iii) leakage treatment; (iv) repairs to overflow weirs and spillways;
(v) downstream apron reinforcement, including grouting; (vi) provision of new
instrumentation; (vii) strengthening of dam sections consistent with revised seismic
assessment; (viii) repairs to drains and relief wells; (ix) repairs and reconstruction of head
regulators; and (x) repairs to electro-mechanical components (gates, hoist, cranes).

        Nutrient and Pest Management. Management of this safeguard was in compliance
with Bank policies. Each scheme SEMP included the development of separate pest and
nutrient management strategies that were successfully applied (Details in Annex 2).

       Physical Cultural Resources. This safeguard policy was triggered to ensure that
“chance find procedures” were followed by contractors and/or supervising engineers in
charge during construction. No findings were reported during project implementation.

        Project Operational Manual on Social and Environmental Management. The
project supported the preparation of an Operational Manual, which includes the Social Audit
tool on Social and Environment Management. The Manual was based on due consultations
with stakeholders and engineers.         Two dissemination workshops on ‘Social and
Environment Management Framework’ were conducted under the project to propagate
information summarized in the ‘Operational Manual on Social & Environmental
Management’. The Manual was used by WRD in all State projects, irrespective of financing
source.

2.4.2 Fiduciary Compliance

       Procurement. Procurement was carried out in accordance with the agreed Bank
procedures. In spite of the large number of schemes undertaken and the highly decentralized
nature of the procurement, there were very few cases of complaints. Where complaints did
arise, they were promptly attended to by the PPMU. Community participation in
procurement was efficient. Adequate training on procurement and contract management was
provided throughout the implementation period.

       The main procurement management issue was the inability to align and co-ordinate
procurement planning with detailed engineering. This led to serious time overruns, cost

                                              9
escalations at the bidding stage, and poor procurement management performance, which
further led to the termination of some contracts and the rebidding for fragmented and small
works. The lessons learned included the need to improve contract estimates through better
data gathering, and use and analysis of current market prices from recently completed
contracts. Provision should be made for any additional requirements on account of specific
site conditions, including the costs associated with environmental and social aspects. The
cost of management and supervision, including quality control, need to be included in cost
estimates, and the scope of these aspects should be effectively communicated to bidders so
that they are adequately addressed and included in bids. Contractors’ workshops need to be
conducted frequently to discuss these and other issues and to receive feedback.

       Financial Management. FM was in compliance with Bank policies and procedures.
FM arrangements were characterized by the use of GoM systems for accounting and reporting.
A Financial Management Manual (FMM) was used to standardize accounting procedures
across the three implementing entities. In addition, an ‘FM support Consultancy’ was
mobilized.

        FM implementation. With three government departments acting as implementing
agencies, combined with the large number of accounting locations at the district level, at
times implementation proved challenging. The following issues were noted: (a) responses to
several high level/value observations made by the project auditors (Comptroller and Auditor
General) were often delayed; and (b) internal audit arrangements did not add value in terms of
constructive inputs and generally were a repetition of the external audit findings.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

       The post-project transition and management arrangements for the various project
interventions – both sector reforms and investments - were built into the project design and
were implemented well. The status at project closure is as follows:

      (a) MWRRA - MWRRA is now well-established, is performing well, has a clear vision
          for the future, and is fully funded by GoM.

      (b) WRD - The restructured WRD is now operating with a clear separation of
          development and management of water resources. Costs directly associated with the
          management/operations arm of WRD are included in water charges ’ calculations and
          other costs are excluded and funded separately by GoM.

      (c) WALMI - WALMI continues to function at a high level and is well supported and
          funded by GoM. GoM has committed to further enhancement of WALMI through
          the establishment of a permanent training unit with 19 new staff posts specifically for
          “Providing training support, monitoring and evaluation of WUAs”.

      (d) WUAs - Over 1,500 WUAs have been established and taken over the responsibility
          for MOM of irrigation systems below the minor head, in accordance with the
          provisions of the MMISF Act 2005. The input of farmers and their direct influence
          on decision making in major and medium irrigation schemes has been enhanced with
          the formation of project level and distributary level associations that include farmer
          representatives from WUAs. Some WUAs are still nascent and will need continued
          support and capacity building beyond the project.

                                                10
      (e) Groundwater pilots - Concerned communities, through their respective local
          committees, have taken over O&M responsibilities for sustainable groundwater
          management at the aquifer level, including for recharge structures and monitoring
          equipment. Groundwater management committees have the legal right to set
          groundwater charges to cover O&M costs.

3.         Assessment of Outcomes

3.1        Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: High

        The Project design (PDO and components) remains highly relevant for Maharashtra
and for India as a whole. It is consistent with current development priorities of: (i) GoM
(water sector and institutional reforms); (ii) Government of India (at both higher and water
sector level reforms); and (iii) the Bank, under the current Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS 20131). Key priorities of the project ensure a focus on: (i) water and natural resources
management, with an overall emphasis              on innovative approaches and systems
strengthening; (ii) more inclusive agricultural and rural growth; (iii) technology
development and low-carbon and climate-resilient agriculture; (iv) agricultural markets; and
(v) strengthening collective action (especially among women) to facilitate access to better
economic opportunities.

        Project design is relevant and consistent with the stated PDO, in particular the
integrated approach to irrigation system improvement, including the empowerment and
capacity building of farmers through WUAs and agricultural support activities. The mostly
successful achievement of the PDOs is consistent with the current State and national
development priorities, particularly with respect to the establishment of MWRRA. In fact, in
order to attract national funding in the sector, GoI now requires states to establish a
regulatory authority based on the principles of the MWRRA. Much of the success of the
groundwater pilots has been adopted by GoI’s Central Groundwater Board. In addition,
sustainable management of groundwater is a huge national priority. Legislative changes,
particularly with respect to the need for groundwater mapping, the production of sustainable
groundwater management plans on an aquifer basis, and user/community involvement in
groundwater management, point to the contributions of project implementation.

3.2        Achievement of Project Development Objectives

           Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory, based on the detailed assessment below.

3.2.1 PDO Part (i). To strengthen the state’s capacity for multi -sectoral planning,
 development, and sustainable management of the water resources.

         Institutional objectives were addressed principally through Component A, with the
objectives of: (i) establishing a new MWRRA; (ii) Restructuring MKVDC; (iii)

    Country Partnership Strategy – India dated March 21, 2013 Report No. 76176-IN.


                                                      11
Restructuring WRD; (iv) Strengthening WALMI; and (v) introduction of a sector wide ICIS.
Also, Component C1, Piloting of User Centered Aquifer Level Goundwater Management,
contributed to the achievement of the PDO.

        The project’s contribution to strengthening State capacity as measured by the PDO
indicators, as well as other measures, is discussed below. The institutional reform objectives
of the project were ambitious, and have been substantially achieved, except for the
restructuring of MKVDC. GoM, through the Maharashtra Chief Secretary’s letter of
November 20, 2013 to the Bank, has conveyed its commitment to implement the reforms
intended under the restructuring and to ensure that all functions expected from a river basin
authority are accomplished by existing Irrigation Development Corporations (such as
MKDVC) and the State Water Board. In view of the above, achievement of this element of
the overall PDOs is rated moderately satisfactory.

        Establishment of MWRRA (PDO Indicator 1). MWRRA was established in
August 2005 and its capacity was developed over the course of the project. The Authority is
discharging its mandated functions of: (a) setting water charges; (b) establishing criteria for
water entitlements; (c) regulating development of water resources in river basins, including
environmental/water quality; and (d) monitoring of the bulk entitlement program and dispute
resolution.

        Restructuring of MKVDC (PDO Indicator 2). The objective was to restructure
MKVDC into the MKVWRC, as a fully functioning river basin agency with a newly
assigned primary role of preparing and periodically revising basin plans for the Krishna
Basin. GoM has drafted an amendment to the existing Act. However, the amendment has
not been enacted yet and the restructuring MKVDC remains a work in progress. GoM is
implementing the planning activities, including preparation of some sub-basin plans, within
the present institutional setup. A river basin plan for a sub-basin of Godavari River has been
prepared under the close guidance of MWRRA.

        Restructuring of WRD (PDO Indicator 3). The restructuring of WRD was
completed, albeit later than envisaged. There has been a clear separation of water
development functions from water management functions, including irrigation service
delivery. This separation, combined with the establishment of WUAs, has allowed a
“partnership” to develop between WRD and WUAs. However, further reforms are required
to strengthen this partnership, which would improve irrigation system performance through
proper operation and maintenance (O&M). Training courses need to be strengthened to
impart the required new O&M skills to staff.

       Piloting user-centered aquifer level groundwater management in three pilot
areas (PDO Indicator 4). One of the pilots was dropped because it required surface water
through a new irrigation development, which is not a part of this project. The core principle
developed from the pilots, of assessing, developing and sustainably managing groundwater
on an aquifer basis (instead of the earlier watershed basis), has been incorporated in the new
Maharashtra Groundwater Development and Management Act. The Act also mandates the
preparation of annual groundwater use plans. Successful outcomes of the Pilots have now
been significantly scaled up under a separate Bank supported intervention being
implemented over the period 2013-2019.



                                              12
        In addition to the above the project also strengthened WALMI, which conducted
training courses that benefited about 24,000 people, including WRD managers and technical
staff, WUA management committee members, and NGOs. Integrated Computer Information
Systems (ICIS) activities have enhanced the state water resources planning capability through
the provision of real-time information and communication to senior policy makers. These
activities have strong backing from GoM and ownership from WRD management and staff.
GoM has committed to funding the further development of the ICIS.


      3.2.2 PDO Part (ii).       Improved Irrigation Service Delivery and increased
productivity of irrigated agriculture.

        Achievement of PDO Part (ii) was through activities under Component B comprising
six closely inter-related sub-components B1-B6, The performance indicators and output
targets, as summarized in the table below (and in the DATA SHEET), have been achieved,
with minor shortcomings. There are, however, some risks to the sustainability of the WUAs.
In view of this, achievement of PDO Part (ii) is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.3        Efficiency

           Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

       The estimated overall economic rate of return (ERR) for the project was recomputed
at completion using the same methodology as at appraisal. The ERR at completion is
acceptable at 20.8%, although it is somewhat lower than the 27.8% estimated at appraisal.
Project benefits were delayed because of the need for a two year extension of the loan
closing date to complete project activities. Annex 3 provides more details, including the


                                                          13
identification of some computational errors at appraisal that are not systemic and did not
affect the calculation of project ERR and NPV.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

       Taking into account the rating of High for Relevance of Objectives, Design and
Implementation, the rating of moderately satisfactory for Achievement of Project
Development Objectives, and moderately satisfactory for Efficiency, Project Outcome is
rated Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

        Poverty Impacts. Poverty reduction was a higher level objective and not a specific
PDO. That said, the project had a significant poverty impact, as the average agricultural
income increased more than 200% from Rs.29,245/year at baseline to Rs.64,220/year at
project close. The majority of the small farmers constitute the rural poor and their incomes
have risen by over 250% as a result of the project.

        Gender Aspects. Overall, the project benefited both men and women equally and
was not designed to specifically benefit women. However, each SEMP contained activities
targeting the inclusion of women and other vulnerable groups. Women benefited from the
successful implementation of Gender Action Plans (GAPs) in all of the 235 irrigation
schemes under the project. WALMI conducted 36 training courses specifically tailored to
women. At appraisal it was estimated that there would be about 3,600 female participants
in training courses, but the courses proved so relevant and popular that at project end 4,009
women had participated in the training programs.

        Social Development. Tribal Development Plans (TDPs) were implemented
satisfactorily in all of the applicable 41 schemes. They addressed the inclusion of tribal
communities through targeted training and capacity programs (conducted by WALMI) for
WUA members from these communities and through site visits and community level
training programs conducted within the communities.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

       The overall risk to development outcome is assessed as Moderate, based on the
following considerations:

       a. Continued Political Commitment of GoM to pursue Water Sector reforms.
          Implementation of the MWRRA Act of 2005 and the MMISF Act of 2005 under
          the project confirmed GoM’s commitment to transfer irrigation system
          management to WUAs. It also confirmed their commitment to bulk supply and

                                             14
          volumetric charging of irrigation water to WUAs as per their water entitlements
          and through effective involvement of WUAs. GoM’s commitment to implement
          reforms is also indicated by the Chief Secretary’s letter to the Bank, referred to
          above.
       b. Sustainability of WUAs. Both national and international experience shows that
          maturing of WUAs as institutions takes considerable time and requires on-going
          State support beyond the project. The necessary legal backing and incentives are
          in place to sustain WUAs and enable them to perform their mandated functions.
          Most WUAs have permanent offices and GoM is committed to providing
          permanent offices to the remaining WUAs. Distribution systems for irrigation
          management have been handed over to 80% of the WUAs. In March 2014, GoM
          issued a Government Order to establish a permanent unit for the continued
          training and capacity building of WUAs.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

5.1.1 Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        Project preparation started in 2003 when GoM, with support from the Bank, began to
identify and address the reforms necessary in the water sector. The Bank provided
additional technical assistance and knowledge support to GoM in strengthening the enabling
policy, regulatory and institutional environment for a possible Bank supported project. The
Bank also subjected the project to a thorough QER to provide detailed guidance to the task
team for ensuring quality at entry. Project design adequately addressed environmental,
poverty, gender, Pest and Nutrient management aspects. (See section 2.4). The Project FM
was designed around domestic procedures. The Bank had a multi-disciplinary team of
specialists that supported project preparation and carried out project appraisal (See annex 4).
The M&E system (Section 2.1.5) was adequately designed, but PPMU responsibilities for
M&E could have been developed further. However, the overall project design was complex
and the risks associated with the restructuring of MKVDC were underestimated.

5.1.2 Quality of Supervision

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        Seventeen supervision and implementation support missions were conducted over the
life of the project. All but the last supervision mission were led by the same senior TTL
who was involved from the beginning of the reform process in Maharashtra. Supervision
missions focused on the development impacts of institutional and irrigation system
improvements. A persistent problem that was not adequately addressed and resolved was
the setting up of the M&E unit within the PPMU to analyze quarterly reports prepared by the
M&E consultant. The project was originally designed with two formal reviews to be carried
out in December 2007 and December 2009. However, because of the slow start to the
project, the planned December 2007 review was postponed and a traditional MTR was held
in March 2009.


                                              15
        The MTR identified the need for project restructuring which was completed
thereafter in a timely manner. The Bank followed up on critical loan covenants and
downgraded the DO rating to moderately satisfactory to reflect non-compliance with the
covenant regarding the restructuring of MKVDC. Bank dialogue with GoM resulted in GoM
confirming its determination to implement the key reforms underpinning the restructuring of
MKVDC within the existing structure.

         Because the Bank’s core supervision team was based in Delhi it was able to follow-
up on issues through frequent contact with the Borrower, thus providing consistency in
guidance and continuity. The supervision team had an appropriate skills mix to address the
policy, regulatory, institutional, technical and fiduciary requirements of project
implementation. At the end of each formal mission, the team proactively, clearly, and
candidly identified critical issues affecting implementation and project effectiveness, and
provided guidance through detailed aide memoires and guidance notes/annexes and
informal follow up visits.

        Fiduciary and Safeguards Supervision. Supervision of fiduciary, environmental
and social safeguards aspects was satisfactory. Specialists with the required skills in FM,
procurement, environmental management and social development were consistently part of
the core Bank supervision missions throughout the project, in day-to-day follow-up, and
interaction with the PPMU. Dam safety aspects were supervised by the Task Team Leader
who had a background in this field. Compliance with the Bank’s dam safety requirements
were further strengthened by the high level of involvement of the expert DSRPs.

5.1.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

        The rating for overall Bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory based on the
ratings for performance in ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision, as detailed
above.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        In 2003, GoM developed a vision for the longer term reforms required in the water
sector and took steps to establish the necessary policy and regulatory frameworks upon which
the project was built. This commitment remained strong throughout implementation and
GoM deserves credit for the satisfactory implementation of sectoral reforms discussed in
Section 3.2. However, the legal covenant to restructure MKVDC into a fully functioning river
basin agency was not complied with, although GoM has implemented activities envisaged for
MKVWRC under the existing setup, e.g., developing water resources plans with a river basin
concept. Delays in the allocation of counter-part funding affected project implementation.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                              16
       The three existing government agencies responsible for project implementation
contributed to a mostly satisfactory or better level of achievement of project outputs and
outcomes (see Annex 2 for details). As discussed in Section 2.4, fiduciary and safeguard
aspects of the project were implemented in compliance with Bank requirements. Loan
covenants were complied with, except for the one relating to the restructuring of MKVDC,
which was primarily a GOM responsibility. Issues identified by Bank missions were
generally addressed in a timely manner, e.g., FM reporting, speedier implementation of the
dam safety component, and quality control of civil works implementation. However, the
PPMU suffered from staff shortages in key areas.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

       The overall rating of moderately satisfactory is based on the ratings of Government
performance and implementing agency performance.

6.     Lessons Learned

       a. Success of institutional reforms depends on level of government
          commitment. The success of broad sector-wide institutional reforms, similar to
          those undertaken by this project, needs significant upfront political commitment
          and effective Bank dialogue with government (as well as technical assistance
          support) so as to have the key legal, policy and legislative frameworks (State-
          water policy, MWRRA Act and MMISF Act) in place before project
          effectiveness.

       b. Client capability for effective M&E. The focus should be on building client
          capacity for M&E through training and investment in computerized systems
          instead of mostly relying on M&E consultants to carry out project M&E.

       c. Importance of well-designed agricultural support services. The effectiveness
          of large infrastructure investments to rehabilitate/modernize irrigation systems
          for improved water use efficiency and productivity are considerably enhanced by
          the inclusion of a well-designed and well-implemented agricultural support
          services component. This component should support farmers in improving
          cropping and cropping systems.

       d. Effective Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities. IEC
          activities were an important part of this project because of the significant and
          complex policy and institutional changes. IEC activities are more effective and
          far better coordinated when they are designed as an integral part of a particular
          component or sub-component, e.g., with the groundwater pilots, rather than as a
          standalone sub-component.


       e.    O&M funding for rehabilitated and modernized irrigation schemes. A
            fundamental change in government procedures is needed to address the
            disconnect between a) increased water charges and collections that reflect full
            O&M costs and b) low budget allocations for O&M.

                                            17
       f. Continuity in WUA Elected Representatives. There is a 100% turnover of
          positions in WUAs every six years which affects their continuity and
          sustainability because the “institutional” memory and functionality are lost and
          new capacity needs to be built. Consideration should be given to amending the
          MMISF Act to allow staggering of the election of representatives such that half
          the members are elected for a six year term every three years.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)    Borrower/implementing agencies

        The Borrower commented that some of the data on outputs contained in the initial
draft ICRR needed updating; this has since been done. The Borrower suggested that ratings
of project performance, as well as Borrower and Bank performance be revisited based on the
updated data for a more balanced assessment of the achievements and shortcomings of this
complex project. The Borrower’s comments and the updated data were taken into account in
finalizing the ICR and the ratings have been revised.

                   The project components, sub-components and related achievements are outlined
          below:

          1.       Component A: Water Sector Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building

          1.1.     Subcomponent A1 - Establishment, operationalization and fostering of MWRRA

                 The MWRRA was established in August, 2005 and has been operationalized in terms
          of budget, HR provisions and mandated functions. In terms of function there have been a
          number of notable advances in terms of activities and outputs in relation to rules, regulation
          and planning. These are indicated below.
                 a. A number of institutional rules have been adopted including (a) conditions of
                     services of Chairpersons (September 2006), (b) recruitment and conditions of

                                                            21
           services of employees- (Aug 2013) (b) MWRRA (Conduct of Business)
           Regulation (Aug 2013).

       b. Fixing Bulk water tariff: Finalization and adoption of criteria for and issuance of
          Tariff Order for Bulk Water Regulations (Aug 2013). Bulk water charges for
          various categories for period 2010-13 were fixed using the new criteria and
          processes development by the MWRRA, which included input from a state wide
          public consultative process. A more refined process for determination of criteria
          for Bulk Water Tariff in Maharashtra led by MWRRA for the period 2013-16 is
          underway.

       c. Water Entitlements: The MWRRA has published 2 key documents. (i) Technical
          Manual for fixing, regulating and enforcing the entitlement on irrigation projects,
          (January 2007) and, (ii) Procedures for regulation and enforcement of
          Entitlements - Powers and functions of regulators, (October, 2007). In total, 232
          projects covering 1341 WUAs under MWSIP are now included in water
          entitlement program. In addition, 25 projects covering 27 WUAs outside the
          MWSIP have also been included in the program.

       d. Annual reports: The MWRRA prepares and publishes annual reports on the
          evaluation of the Bulk Entitlement program. Reports have been published for
          2008-09 to 2011-12.

       e. Water Resource Development: To standardize preparation of river basin plans, the
          MWRRA has prepared a Technical Manual for Preparation of River Basin Plans.

       f. Other Key Functions: Since establishment, MWRRA has cleared 189 new major
          water resources projects and is actively engaged in monitoring bulk water
          entitlement awareness campaigns. The Authority also has responsibility for state-
          wide water quality issues and is developing an environment management plan for
          the Krishna River Basin

       g. Dispute Resolution: The Authority is responsible for dispute resolution relating to
          bulk water entitlements and tariffs and has resolved 9 cases.

1.2.   Subcomponent A2 - Restructuring of Existing MKVDC into MKVWRC

        The restructuring of the MKVDC into a river basin agency was not completed under
the project for reasons outlined in the main report – sections 2 and 3. However, in terms of
function GoM and WRD have begun institutionalizing the processes of integrated water
resource management (IWRM) on the basis of river basin plans. There were no specific KPIs
for sub-component A2 at appraisal.

1.3.   Subcomponent A3 – Restructuring and capacity building of WRD

       In large part, the restructuring was in line with Government orders (GOs) of October
12, 2010. The principal aim of the restructuring was to separate the primary functions of
water resource development and management. This separation has been completed with each
functional area of responsibility assigned at the secretary level. The design and


                                             22
implementation of the ICIS (see sub-component A5 below) was an important and integral
part of the restructuring of WRD.

1.4. Sub-component A4: Strengthening and capacity building of the Water and Land
Management Institute (WALMI).

        The WALMI is the nodal training institute of the WRD. Under the MWSIP, funding
was provided for strengthening and capacity building of WALMI, establishment of and
operational support to a dedicated cell for the training of WUAs and staff of the WRD. At
project close the following activities and outputs were achieved;

       a. 315 training programs (88% of target)

       b. 23,489 trainees against a target of 21,201 (111%). The participants included
          technical staff and officers of the WRD, management committee members of
          WUAs, WUA members/farmers, WUAs secretaries, NGOs. Training included
          participatory irrigation management / irrigation water management, technical
          training for mid-level officers, MMISF Act, water entitlement, training courses for
          training of trainers, M&E of WUAs, communication, state level seminars on
          Participatory Irrigation Management.

        At ICR, there was one key limitations identified that may impact sustainability, - the
lack of institutional capacity to provide training to a growing number of WUAs in future. In
order to address this shortcoming in March 2014, GoM, issued a GO for the establishment of
a permanent unit for the continued training and capacity building of WUAs. To this end, 19
new permanent staff posts have been approved for this new unit.

1.5.   Subcomponent A5 – Integrated computerized information system (ICIS)

       As part of institutional capacity development, the project funded the establishment of
an Integrated Computer Information System under the WRD. The key aims of the ICIS were
to improve availability of real time data for improved water planning and inter and intra
departmental management information system for decision making. At project close, the ICIS
unit had been established, equipped and computer systems commissioned. The application of
the ICIS has spread across the sector.

        A special campaign named e-Jalseva Abhiyan (e-Water), aimed at a broad range of
WRD staff was conducted over the period September-October, 2013 to create awareness,
training, data digitization, data validation and the use and application of ICIS. Regular
monthly bulletins regarding e-Jalseva are being published. GoM has now established a
permanent dedicated Project Management Office at Pune to ensure the sustainable
maintenance and continued development and training of e-Governance. GoM has issued
instructions to all departments to spend up to 0.5% of their allocated budget for e-Governance
activities.

       Overall the ICIS was an ambitious e-governance initiative under the project. It was
conceptualized as a Management Information System (MIS) at appraisal and later was re-
designed and implemented as a comprehensive integrated e-governance project covering 726
offices of the WRD. Employees, citizens, farmers WUAs, industries, project affected
persons (PAPs), contractors, other government departments, the media etc. are the major

                                             23
stakeholders of the WRD. The short to medium-term objective of e-Jalseva is to fulfill the
major information requirements of these broad stakeholders. However, under the project, the
biggest beneficiaries of the system are the employees of WRD and staff of other institutes
within the water sector. Tangible benefits of the ICIS include:

       a. Centralized and Unified Database. ICIS assisted with the creation of one central
          database updated only by the owner of the data, and then validated. Decision
          makers have instantaneous access to up to date and accurate data.

       b. Cost and time saving. Before ICIS, the time taken to collect and receive data,
          information and reports from field offices could take anywhere between 15 days
          to 2 months. The ICIS now has provided data information platforms for timely
          access to information both vertically and horizontally within WRD.

       c. Record Management and Documentation. Computerized data bases to store
          projects data are being developed. This will significantly improve management
          access to information and performance.

       d. Capacity development. WRD staff are becoming increasingly aware and
          capacitated to use the ICIS. This has created a sense of ownership and familiarity
          in the use of computer technologies. At the field level, especially in remote areas,
          ICIS has greatly improved connectivity through use of laptops and through
          networks. Under the project, a total of 10,000 person hours of training were
          provided to WRD staff. This training took the form of formal training sessions,
          workshops, discussion forums etc. Nearly 600 Master Trainers along with the
          Change Management Division of the ICIS PMO worked very hard to empower
          individual employees, from Senior Managers to junior ranks, and to ensure broad-
          based ownership within the WRD.

2.     Project Component B: Improving irrigation service delivery and management

2.1. Sub-component B1 - Participatory rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation
schemes

         The sub-component was the largest investment component, which aimed to improve
irrigation service delivery through the rehabilitation and modernization of existing irrigation
schemes.

        A total of 235 schemes were rehabilitated covering CCA 608,007 Ha (94% of revised
target). Works in 5 minor schemes covering a CCA of 1624 Ha could not be completed
before project end. However, GoM are committed to completing these using domestic funds.
A summary by canal rehabilitation scheme (major, medium and minor) and modernization
works is given in the following table:

Total 235           230              645,604          608,007             94%

        The rehabilitation works mainly included re-sectioning of canal, lining in selected
locations, repairs to structures, installation of measuring devices. About 43,636 TCM of
earthwork, 6.956 million square meters of concrete lining and repairs to 42,115 canal
structures were completed. Canal rehabilitation and modernization works on minor canals
were carried out with the full participation of WUAs, through membership and representation
on locally established contract management committees.

        At ICR, it is assessed that adequate arrangements were made for Quality Control and
Quality Assurance (QC/QA) of all works carried out under this sub-component. The QC/QA
responsibilities were assigned to an independent QC/QA organization in the WRD, which
consists of three independent QC Circles (units), each managed by a Superintending Engineer.

         All the works on the canals were to be carried out without interruption to existing
irrigation service. The works were only carried out during scheduled canal closure periods.
However, construction time, particularly in main branch and distributary canals, was
significantly under estimated at appraisal, resulting in more construction time being required.
This is the main factor behind the 2 year extension to the project. After completion of minor
level canal rehabilitation, the management of the systems was transferred to 1,202 WUAs
covering area 507,496 Ha (79 %).

       Also included under this subcomponent was the construction and rehabilitation of 236
(37 new and 199 rehabilitated) drainage schemes. At project close, all 236 drainage schemes
have been completed and handed over to WUAs for future operations and maintenance.

b.     The main achievements at intermediate outcome level were:

      As expected, investment in rehabilitating and modernizing irrigation schemes
improved system delivery performance, positively impacting the following key area:

       Water Utilization Efficiency (WUE) at Scheme Level

      WUE increased from 96 Ha/MCM to 147 Ha/MCM, representing an increase of 53%
compared to the target of 30% at appraisal. Incremental WUE was higher on minor schemes
compared to major and medium schemes as shown in Figure 1 below

                                                                          .

b1.           Water Delivery Efficiency (WDE)

       For all schemes under the project, the WDE increased from 31.19% to 60.96%
representing an increase of 95% over BL against a target of 100%. A breakdown of schemes
shows increases of major 80%, medium 89% and minor 211% schemes as presented in
Figure 2 below.

b2.           Revenue Collection Performance (RCP) - Irrigation Water

        For all schemes under the project, the RCP increased from 45% to 61.7%, compared
to a target of 54%. This is 114% of the target at appraisal. The largest increase was on minor
schemes 36% to 60.9% followed by major schemes, while medium schemes actually
experienced a reduction from 49% to 36%. Figure 3

b3.            Reveune Collection Performance – All Water Users

       For all schemes under the project, the RCP for all commercially provided water
services (irrigation, drinking and Industrial water) improved from a baseline value of 52.3%
to 79.5%. The target was set at a 20% increase over the baseline (ie 62.8%). The actual
achieved RCP was 79.5%, which is 127% of the target. Major schemes had the biggest
increase in RCP, followed by minor schemes. Both surpassed the target of 62.8%. However,
medium schemes, which recorded the highest baseline figure (61%), actually had a reduction
to 51%. Figure 4

b4.            Increased Value of Crop Production/Unit of Irrigation Water

        For all schemes under the Agriculture Support Services (ASS) sub-component of the
project, agriculture income increased from Rs. 3,532 /TCM to Rs. 9,219 /TCM (201% over
target of Rs. 4592/TCM). For the baseline schemes tracked separately under the project’s
M&E arrangements, the income increase was somewhat less at Rs 7,889/TCM. Figure 5

2.2.               Sub-component B2 – Dam Safety Works

        The original objective of this subcomponent was to carry out dam safety works on a
total of 291 dams serving 286 schemes (9 major, 13 medium and 264 minor schemes).
However, due to changes to the number of schemes included at MTR, the dam safety
activities were altered to include dam safety works on 281 dams supplying 278 schemes (8
Major, 12 medium and 258 minor schemes). Of the 281 dams, works on 266 dams were
completed under the project (95% of revised target). Dam safety works on the remaining 15
dams serving 15 minor schemes could not be completed within the project period, due to
difficulties associated with contract administration and local site problems. The GoM,
however, has given assurances that all of these remaining dams will be completed through
domestic funds.

        The dam safety works, as recommended by three Dam Safety Review Panels (DSRPs),
mainly included restoration of the dam section, raising the dam top in view of design flood
review, leakage treatment, repairs to waste weir / spillway, works in downstream apron, tail
channel, grouting, instrumentation, strengthening of dam section in view of revised seismic
zone, repairs to drains, relief wells, repairs / reconstruction of head regulators, repairs to
electro mechanical components (gates, hoist, cranes). DSRPs visited the site during the
implementation of works.

      Arrangements for the QC/QA of these works were the same as for the rehabilitation
and modernization works.

        The outcome of this investment was such that the safety of the dams was brought up
to contemporary national and State-wide engineering standards.

2.3.               Sub-component B3 – Formation and capacity building of WUAs

                   At output level the achievements of the project were:

                   a. At MTR, targets were revised to register about 1,708 WUAs (1,509 minor level
                      WUAs, 121 DLAs, 34 CLAs and 44 PLAs). At project close, 1,704 WUAs had
                      formed (1,508 minor level WUAs, 121 DLAs, 33 CLAs and 42 PLAs). During
                      project implementation, the initial six-year tenure of 1,493 WUAs was completed

                                                         28
   and second term elections were completed for 1,384 WUAs. The re-elections
   process for all WUAs is on-going and will continue to be supported beyond the
   project by the reorganized WRD.

b. Capacity building of 1,508 WUAs was completed under the project and initial
   training was provided to 1,367 WUAs (91%). First refresher training was
   completed for 1,040 WUAs (69%), second refresher training for 491 WUAs
   (33%), and the third refresher training was completed for 98 WUAs (7%).

c. A total of seven NGOs were appointed for a period of 3 years for capacity
   building of WUAs. However, it was necessary, especially at the critical stage of
   completion of rehabilitation works and system handing-over phase, to extend the
   use of NGOs for period of 1 year in 2 regions (Jalgaon and Pune) for capacity
   building of WUAs.

d. The original objective was to construct 1,704 WUA office buildings. At project
   close, a total of 1,120 buildings were completed. For the remaining 584, some
   could not be included in the project due to various reasons, but mostly because
   WUAs where unwilling to contribute their 15% share of building cost. In a few
   cases, there was a problem with the availability of suitable land. The requirement
   was that land for WUA offices must have a separate title and be permanently
   transferred to ownership of the WUA. The WRD is committed to solving these
   outstanding problems.

e. There were a total of 28 study tours / exposure visits organized for WUAs
   covering 1,603 participants.

f. After rehabilitation of minor level canals the works were progressively handover
   to WUAs for MOM. At project completion, works handed over to 1,202 WUAs
   (80% of WUAs), covering area 507,496 Ha (83% of the completed CCA) had
   been completed. The remaining 306 minor level systems are in the process of
   being handed over and could not be completed during the project period because
   of the completion of civil works. However, the management mechanisms are
   permanently in place and the GoM is committed to completing the handover as
   soon as possible.

g. Other Impacts: The election cycle means that there is a 100% turnover of
   positions on WUA MCs every six years. When there is a significant change of
   office bearer at WUAs, WALMI must provide training all over again for the new
   appointees. To improve the efficient use of WALMI resources dedicated to WUA
   training, one option is to amend the MMISF Act to allow “half elections” i.e. half
   the elected members of WUAs retire every three years after their six year term.
   This has the potential to halve the number of trainees at any one time from mature
   WUAs. The added advantage would be for the WUAs themselves. Even with the
   election of all new members at a “half elections”, at least half the members will
   retain the “institutional memory” and the WUA can remain functional and stable.
   Members not facing election can also help the newly elected members assimilate
   and get them up to speed sooner.

2.4.   Subcomponent B4 – Improved water management practices in selected schemes

       Improved water management practices, including volumetric charging and bulk
delivery of water to users as per the WUA water entitlements have been implemented in 6
schemes (Ghod and Kukadi, Mangi, Diwale, Hiware and Benikre) in the Krishna Basin.
These activities were scaled up considerably. For the year 2013-14, a total of 232 projects
and 1,341 WUAs, covering area 603,121 Ha are included in the water entitlement program.
Volumetric measuring devices are installed for 1390 WUAs (93% of WUAs).

2.5.   Subcomponent B5 – Agricultural support services

         This subcomponent aimed at increasing productivity of water through irrigated
agriculture intensification and diversification. Originally, the main focus was on 38 schemes
in 19 districts, covering an area of about 450,000 ha of CCA. Agricultural intensification and
diversification are planned to be achieved through: (i) improved agricultural support services;
(ii) strengthening of extension-farmer-market linkages; (iii) effective collaboration of GoM
line Departments (Departments of Water Resources, Agriculture, Fisheries, Agricultural
Marketing, etc.); and (iv) greater involvement of the private sector.

        For achieving the desired outcomes, various extension activities were to be temporally
and spatially integrated with asset rehabilitation and on-farm development programs in the
project’s minor, medium and major irrigation schemes. The areas of activity were to be
planned in terms of head, middle and tail regions of a minor/distributary or an irrigation
scheme which reflect different levels of water availability. The implementation arrangements
included the setting up of a Policy Support Group at State level, a Project Coordination Unit
in the Commissionerate of Agriculture, 33 Agricultural Technology Management Agencies
(ATMA) at district level and Village Support Groups at village/WUA level. The Department
of Agriculture was responsible for the overall coordination and implementation of this sub-
component.

        The design included implementation through a community-based approach with the
active participation of the beneficiaries and other stakeholders (including line departments,
NGOs and private sector) in the design, implementation and monitoring of the interventions.
For enhancing interdepartmental coordination and effectively involving farmers in the
planning and implementation of various activities, multidisciplinary and interdepartmental
support groups at scheme (village, taluk and district) level were created. The approach was
planned as fully participatory, based on farmer’s perceived needs , and used farmer groups
linked to WUAs. The project design envisaged the following support: preparation of
agriculture development plans in the selected irrigation schemes, training of farmers and line
department staff, exposure visits, organizing about 10,000 demonstrations, strengthening of
State Agricultural Extension Management Training Institute (SAEMTI), 7 Regional
Agricultural Extension Management Training Institute (RAEMTIs) and 81 Agro Polyclinics,
feasibility studies, setting up ago-enterprises and other innovative activities, monitoring and
evaluation, and impact assessment.

       At output level the achievements of the project were:

       a. The ASS component ultimately included a total of 66 schemes (target of 38), 9
          major, 13 medium and 44 minor, covering approximately 481,000 ha (target of

                                              30
          450,000 ha), about 79% of the total area rehabilitated (608,007 ha) under
          Component 1. The coverage of an additional 31,000 ha without a significant
          increase in the original budget allocation was a significant achievement. The
          project conducted about 32,500 demonstrations, trained 763,650 farmers and
          undertook various other extension activities. As a result, the cropping intensity is
          reported to have increased from a baseline figure of 120% to 130% in 2012-13.

      b. Monitoring of adoption rates by the project indicate that large areas (more than
         287,000 ha) are now producing crops using better farming practices. A good
         example is mulching in sugar cane, where as a direct result of the project, about
         85,000 ha are now covered by this technology. Generally there were significant
         increases in yields over the baseline (8% for cereals to over 100% for fruits and
         vegetables). However, productivity gains in the control groups were higher for
         cereals at 28% - recognizing that control baseline yields (1.2 t/ha) were much
         lower than project baseline yields (1.6 t/ha). The project achieved significant
         diversification in terms of a shift in cropping patterns, primarily away from paddy
         and into cash crops (cotton and sugar cane). The percentage of area under cereals
         declined from about 50% of the command pre-project to 37% post-project, while
         the area under cash crops increased from 11 to 29%. On-farm water use
         efficiency (defined in this project as the area irrigated per unit of water) has
         increased by about 34% to 129 ha/MCM. However, this value gives little
         indication of the ‘water productivity’.

      c. Integrated Pest and Nutrient Management. Under the Environment and Social
         Management Plans (SEMPs) the promotion of Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
         and Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) were introduced in 168 schemes with
         the following encouraging results; reduction in average use of inorganic fertilizer
         from about 200 kg/ha to less than 150 kg/ha and increase in organic fertilizer from
         10.5 t/ha to 13.7 t/ha. Average use of chemical pesticides dropped from 1.8 lit/Ha
         to 1.5 lit/Ha. On the other hand use of bio-pesticides has increased from 1.1 lit/ha
         to 2.6 lit/ha.

      d. The ASS component set out to deliver improved agriculture technology to
         leverage the improved water availability and reliability as a result of the project.
         Generally this was achieved with overall increases in productivity and production,
         diversification, cropping intensities and a greater awareness - or culture change -
         to understand the value of water (see the results framework). Additional benefits
         were observed from the successful implementation of an agriculture enterprise
         development program.

Institutional Development

      a. This component was implemented through the Agriculture Technology
         Management Agency - ATMA (GOI flagship program for the evolution of
         agriculture extension, developed under WB funded projects National Agricultural
         Technology Project and Diversified Agricultural Support Project). As the ATMA
         was still in the initial phases of establishment, the project planned to expand and
         strengthen ATMA activities in project districts (with some funding to support
         infrastructure related to training facilities), and then to use this platform to plan
         and fund project activities in detail. However, some key elements in ATMA were

                                            31
   thought to be lacking, mainly relating to interdepartmental coordination and the
   effective involvement of farmers in planning and implementation. The following
   were added (to ATMA) in the project design, Policy Support Group (state level),
   POs and FOs, village support groups, and community resource persons.

b. Institutions – A number of institutions were planned under the ASS, these
   included lower level institutions such as the Krishi Vigyan Mandal (KVM) and
   the Village Support Group (VSG). These were seen as playing an important role
   in delivery of agriculture services to farmers under the project. However, at the
   MTR, the state level policy support group (PSG) though constituted and
   functional, was not very effective, and was ultimately assumed by the State Level
   Project Steering Committee.

c. The main purpose of the 300 KVM formed under the project was to provide
   technical support to farmers under its jurisdiction. It consisted of representatives
   from the VSGs, Krishi Sainiks, Krishi Mitras and representatives of the line
   departments. It was structured in a way so they would have the potential to
   become farmer producer organizations (FPO). It was reported that at least one
   FPO is already registered. All KVMs have been registered under ATMA, which
   allows them to provide certain services to farmers, such as seed production and
   potentially extension services and gives them opportunity to continue operating
   post project. While these groups are not necessarily formed in relation to the
   command area of the irrigation project, nor the water supply, it is linked to the
   number of farmers that will be under its jurisdiction. The KVM are (by design)
   under the direct supervision of the WUA, however it is not clear how this works in
   practice. The KVM might be better integrated if they were aligned with an
   agriculture sub-committee under the WUA, and if farmer representatives (on the
   KVM) were selected from/by the WUA.

d. The 1,369 VSGs consist of close to 6,845 krishi sainiks (lead farmers), NGOs,
   input providers and field level line department staff and are under the supervision
   of the ATMA. The role of these groups is to provide technical support directly to
   farmer members of the WUA, as such there is almost one VSG per WUA.
   However, these groups have a sustainability risk, as there is little connection to the
   WUA. Likewise there is no formal arrangement for their continued connection to
   ATMA. There are signs that the DOA is committed to having these groups and the
   associated cascade extension structure integrate into ATMA, as the design was
   largely driven by the Department. However, at present there is no formal plan in
   place for the continuation of these groups beyond the project, and without them
   there is a serious bottleneck for the agrarian line departme nt’s outreach to farmers.

e. The viability of the VSGs would be greatly enhanced if there was a better linkage
   with the WUAs on one hand and with the line departments on the other, combined
   with a greater focus on development of commercial opportunities. These groups
   could play a much greater role in the strategic planning and implementation of the
   large number of on-going government programs if there were a more
   comprehensive and inclusive planning mechanism from the departments.

f. In order to mainstream ATMA the strengthening of the State Agricultural
   Extension Management Training Institute (SAEMTI), 7 Regional Agricultural

                                       32
          Extension Management Training Institute (RAEMTIs) and 81 Agro Polyclinics
          and DTCs was seen as a key intervention at preparation for the improved delivery
          of services (trainings) to both farmers and extension staff. This consisted primarily
          of civil works for renovation of existing structures and supply of equipment,
          engaging manpower (temporary contracts), travel and operational costs. Against
          the targets, 55 (from 60) Agro Polyclinics, 20 (from 21) DTCs, 4 (from 7)
          RAMETIs and the VANAMATI were strengthened under the project.

      g. At design, Participatory Agriculture Development Planning was seen as key for
         setting out the overall pathway to improved productivity and production in the
         project area; as such these were included for all selected irrigation schemes.
         Village support groups were formed to implement and monitor these plans. These
         would then be consolidated into block and district level plans (under the guidance
         of ATMA) and subsequently funded.

      h. However, the Agriculture Development Planning by scheme was a concept that
         was not well understood. At the MTR stage, the preparation of these remained an
         outstanding issue. In the end only 3 were completed (Ahmadnagar, Nanded and
         Sangli) and these plans were deficient because they “did not reflect the irrigation
         scheme needs”. Subsequently, little attention was paid to this process. Future
         projects should learn lessons from this experience, some suggestions include:

         Planning for agrarian line departments is set on different boundaries
          (administrative) to the irrigation departments (hydraulic) and irrigation schemes,
          this needs to be better understood;
         Poor capacity for (participatory) planning in line departments at field level should
          be addressed;
         Poor understanding of the developmental needs of farmers, and variations
          between subsistence and commercial farmers, thus planning that caters to both is
          recommended (may mean separate planning processes);
         Project focus for planning excludes understanding of the wider need of farmers
          (and the broader range of services available in other projects/schemes and line
          departments), hence more holistic and inclusive planning is recommended;
         Lack of farmer participation, while plans are conceived with the participation of
          farmers, the overall essence and approach of the line departments remains
          somewhat paternalistic hence little farmer buy-in;
         It may have been useful to produce pilot plans during the project preparation to
          guide the process;
         Should have a goal for dynamic plans that are regularly assessed, reviewed and
          updated by stakeholders (rather than the shopping list approach);
         These should be targeted at groups/WUAs that are developmentally ready.
Training and Capacity Building
      a. Training of farmers and line department staff was conducted on a large scale,
         approximately 1.2 million training days were provided for farmers.
         Approximately 20% of the attendees at these trainings were female. The gross
         number of farmers trained is over 763,650, however many of these received more
         than one training so the net number trained is unknown. In addition, 594 farmer



                                             33
              exposure visits were conducted, both within and outside the State, with about
              29,700 farmers participating.

          b. The farmer training was implemented through a cascade approach. To facilitate
             this approximately 320 training sessions were provided to both Master Trainers
             (field level department staff) and to extension service providers (NGOs, lead
             farmers, input sellers etc.) This covered about 8,350 persons (about 46% were
             department staff). ATMA developed a system to both review and update training
             materials on an annual basis (workshops and feedback), ensuring that trainings
             remained relevant and interesting. In addition, trainings were provided to higher
             level Department of Agriculture staff. This training then cascaded to the Krishi
             Mitras (about 36,250 KM were trained, 1 for each five VSGs) and to 188,650
             Krishi Sainiks. Extensive training was provided to these field functionaries to
             build their technical capacity.

          c. Demonstrations were reported as being one of the most successful tools for
             dissemination of messages to farmers. Against a target of about 10,000, nearly
             32,500 demonstrations were conducted on the fields of more than 145,000 farmers
             covering close to 92,604 ha (or close to 24% of the Gross Irrigated Area of the
             project). These were spatially distributed across the head mid and tail of the
             irrigated area. Impressively, the Department also tracked the adoption of the
             demonstrated technology through regular monitoring of farmers in the command
             areas (through the network of Krishi Sainiks and Krishi Mitras). This helped to
             sharpen the focus of the demonstrations to address farmer’s needs. By the close of
             the project, the various technologies promoted under the ASS were assessed as
             covering close to 287,000ha2 (note, this is about 77% of the gross irrigated area, a
             number of demonstrations were repeated on the same fields). These covered
             various thematic areas, including crop technology demonstrations, Integrated
             Plant Nutrient Management, Integrated Pest Management, and Water Use
             Efficiency. The crops in which technologies were adopted on the broadest scale
             include sugarcane, cotton, soyabean, and gram.

          d. An Agro Entrepreneurship Development Program was also included under the
             component so that prospective entrepreneurs could be given support for
             infrastructure development to enhance existing agriculture enterprises. Support
             was envisaged for post-harvest management, agro processing and marketing.

        Under this activity a total of 362 projects were approved, mainly on post-harvest
management (139), farm service provision (66), innovations (63) and agro processing (50).
The remainder covered horticulture, input supply, marketing and medicinal plant production.
However, only 336 were actually started, for which the average investment was close to INR
1.4 million. Entrepreneurs contributed close to 60% of this amount. Of the 336 projects, 58
were ‘bankable’, which meant that these enterprises were also able to obtain financing from
Banks. It was estimated that this program benefited about 13,000 farmers and created close to
3,000 jobs. The project provided support for these emerging enterprises to develop business
plans, then subsequently to monitor them (to see whether the expected returns were being

realized). Over 25% of these enterprises proved commercial enough that Banks were willing
to finance them, indicates the quality of the intervention, which is now being scaled up under
the World Bank funded Agriculture Competitiveness Project. 16 of these enterprises were
documented in case studies that reported on profits and losses, repayment (of bank loan)
capabilities and details that would be useful for other interested entrepreneurs.
Achievement of intermediate outcomes
       Increases in Crop Yields – 5 to 20%
            o Increased production at full development
                     Cereals 303,000 tonnes
                     Oilseeds 37,000 tonnes
                     Pulses 10,700 tonnes

        completion)
       Adoption rates for the improved production management techniques were spread over
        4 years starting with 25% one year after the scheme completion and increasing at the
        same rate thereafter.
       Irrigated Area Expansion 65% increase, gross fully irrigated area expands by 105,082
        ha and gross partially irrigated area 41,534 ha.

2.6.    Subcomponent B6 – Environment and social management plans

       Based on issues in each river basin, Social and Environmental Management Plans
(SEMPs) were to be prepared to mainstream environmental concerns under this
component. GoM had completed an Integrated Socio Environmental Assessment (ISEA)
Study. It identified water sector related social and environmental issues and
recommended suitable Socio-environmental Management Framework (SEMF) along with
sample mitigation plans. Necessary provision was made under this component to prepare and
implement the mitigation plans in the project wherever required. Assessment of Social and
Environmental issues for all 235 schemes was completed. The social assessment, determined
that there was no resettlement and relocation (R&R) in any of the schemes. Tribal
Development Plans (TDPs) for 41 schemes and gender action plans for all 235 schemes were
also developed.

        The environmental assessment identified the requirement for compensatory tree
plantation in 29 schemes, and reclamation of waterlogged and salinity affected areas to about
10,505 ha in 6 irrigation schemes (Ghod, Kukadi, Mula, NLBC, NRBC and Khadakwasala).
In total, 236 drainage schemes (199 Renovation of existing schemes and 37 new schemes)
were completed to successfully address the issues. The drainage and salinity reclamation
works identified were implemented under the sub-component B-2, canal rehabilitation works.

       A total 168 schemes were identified for application of IPM and INM. Details of the
successful outcomes are given in the ASS sub-component B5 (see above).




                                             35
      Training and capacity building for field engineers for the preparation and application
of SEMF and EMP was done through a series of workshops arranged at 5 key locations
(Nagpur, Pune and Nashik, Baramati and Nanded) in 2012 and 2013.

        An important key outcome from the project was that the guideline document for field
engineers for Social and Environmental Management developed, prepared specifically for the
project has now been adapted and circulated to all the offices within WRD. In addition, the
guideline document has been published on the WRD/GoM website and the GoM has issued
directives to adopt and apply these guidelines for all projects managed by WRD.

3.      Project Component C: Innovative Pilots
        Because of the deletion of one groundwater pilot and the cancellation of all activities
for the irrigated agricultural pilot proposed under the sub-component C2, the PAD original
estimated cost of US$4.80 million was reduced to about US$2.00 million to fund the
remaining three groundwater pilots. All physical activities were completed for these pilots as
detailed below. The final recorded expenditure was US$1.05 million, which was well below
the revised estimate of US2.00 million. The actual contracted cost of the main civil works
investment for the 116 groundwater recharge structures was considerably under estimate
because of the close involvement of each community. Also water meters for two of the three
pilots could not be procured in time.

3.1. Sub-component          C1 – Piloting of user centered aquifer level groundwater
management
         On the advice of the Groundwater Surveys and Development Agency (GSDA), the
Bank agreed at the MTR to delete the pilot area in Amaravati district because it was coming
under command area of one of the irrigation projects and would be supplied with surface
irrigation water. This subcomponent fully achieved its stated key result indicator, which was
to change groundwater policies and legislation based on the pilot outcomes.

        Prior to the project, the Maharashtra Groundwater Act, 1993 provided the legislative
framework for groundwater development and management in the state on watershed basis.
This Act lacked any provision for community participation in sustainable development and
use of groundwater. After the successful implementation and application of the lessons
learned from the innovative pilots, a new legislation, the “Maharashtra Groundwater
(Development and Management) Act 2009” was passed and published on December 3, 2013.
As a direct result of the pilots, this new Act incorporated the key core principles of assessing,
developing and sustainably managing groundwater on an aquifer and not on the old
watershed basis. Based on the successful trials under each pilot, the new Act mandated the
preparation of annual groundwater use plans, coupled with crop plan for the notified areas.
Also, the community participation activities, involving village and aquifer level institutional
arrangements have been incorporated in the new Act.

       The Pilots were implemented in 3 districts, Jalna (covering 8 villages, Area 57 km ²),
Beed (covering 10 villages, Area 98 km²) and Satara (covering 24 villages, Area 214 km²).

At output level, the achievements of the project were:

        Baseline Hydrological survey completed (2007).


                                               36
          All 42 Gram Panchayat Level Committees (GPLCs) and 3 Ground Water
           Management
          Association (GWMAs) had been formed and registered under Society Registration
           Act.
          Community Based Ground Water Use Plan (CBGWMUP) has been prepared by
           respective GWMAs / GPLCs.
          Based on CBGWMUP, supply and demand side ground water management activities
           were being implemented in all three pilots.
          All 26 piezometers had been completed.
          All 116 groundwater recharge structures had been completed.
          Elections of GPLCs and GWMAs: completed
          GWMA Building: Construction of GWMA buildings for Jalna Satara and Beed has
           been completed.
          Supply of computers to GWMA: Desk Top computers had been made available to
           Beed and Satara GWMAs.
          Procurement of Water meters for Jalna Pilot
          Water meters for the other pilots could not be procured as 2 bidding rounds of
           procurement remained unsuccessful and it was not possible to invite bids in 3rd
           round and complete the procurement within project period.
          Community Groundwater Management Action Plans. These plans are prepared
           annually and are based on the principle of managing available groundwater in a
           sustainable way through demand side interventions such as control of cropping
           patterns and use of advanced on-farm irrigation application technology, such as drip
           and sprinkler irrigation methods. Water allocations for drinking water and agriculture
           are calculated based on seasonably available groundwater resources.

3.2.       Subcomponent C2 – Piloting innovative irrigated agriculture.

        This activity was designed to improved resource base for problem solving and
technology transfer in the water sector, and was to be measured by Net increase in
agricultural value in the agriculture pilot areas (%). The original design included two pilots:
the first entailed the WUA hiring a private entity hired for technical support to promote
commercial farming, and the second model was involved the formation of a joint venture
company between the WUA and a private entity under which farmers will be given a
minimum return and will also share the profits as per pre-agreed terms.

        The project had difficulties finalizing MOUs and getting agreements in place. The
Aide Memoire of April 2011 recommended that “in view of little progress being made in the
implementation of this sub-component, and the fact that similar initiatives are now been
undertaken under Maharashtra Agriculture Competitiveness Project, it was agreed to drop
this activity”. There was no expenditure recorded for this actively against an original PAD
estimate of US2.7 million.

4.         Project Component D: Project Management

4.1.       Subcomponent D1 – Establish PPMU.

       To manage project implementation, a Project Preparation and Management Unit,
based within WRD was formed from the existing Project Preparation Unit that prepared the

                                                37
project to appraisal stage. This unit’s primary responsibilities were to: (i) monitor phy sical
and financial progress and co-ordinate with different departments; (ii) take up evaluation
studies periodically; (iii) prepare the necessary progress reports for the Bank; ensure the
compliance with the Bank’s safe guard policies and covenants; and m aintain liaison with
World Bank. Generally, throughout the implementation period, the PPMU carried out the
responsibilities entrusted to it very efficiently.

4.2.   Subcomponent D2 – Monitoring and Evaluation

        This subcomponent was designed to have a third party Project M&E and supported
appointment and financing of an independent consulting firm. An independent consultant
for M&E was appointed on June 18, 2007. The duration of the consultancy was originally 55
months, ending on January 17, 2012. The original deliverables were an inception report, 10
six monthly Monitoring Reports (MRs) and 3 Evaluation Reports (ERs). The consultancy
period was extended up to March 31, 2014, consistent with the project extension. Scope of
work during extended period included 4 Monitoring Reports, one additional Evaluation
Report, changes in the structure of Monitoring and Evaluation Reports, inclusion of
diagnostic study on Rapid Appraisal Process (RAP) of WUAs, case studies (crop
diversification) as per recommendations of the supervision mission of the World Bank in
June 2012. All required reports and activities were of high quality and delivered by the
consultant in a timely manner.

4.3.   Subcomponent D3 - Information, education and communication (IEC) programs

        This component supported the communication and dissemination of the GoM’s water
sector reform initiatives and other project-related activities to the broad range of stakeholders
in the water sector as well as creating famer awareness and support for formation and
functioning of WUAs and educating service providers. The project supported technical
assistance, consultancies, publications, media coverage, workshops, seminars, village
animators and exchange visits etc.

         A consultant was appointed in January, 2007 to prepare an action plan for all IEC
activities and the plan was subsequently approved. The activities undertaken, included: (i)
printed material, posters information booklets, other IEC materials covering sector reforms;
(ii) distribution of these materials; (iii) training of selected staff in PR and communication
skills; (ii) workshops on writing skills; (iv) the appointment of 2 NGOs in 2 regions
(Jalgaon and Pune) specifically for capacity building of WUAs; (v) Two TV and three radio
advertising campaigns were created and run, the TV campaign broadcast on 8 popular TV
channels in the state. The Principal Secretary (WRM and CAD) was interviewed in a popular
radio program ‘Dilkhulas’ in the state; (vii) 28 study tours for 1,603 WUA members from
Nagpur and Sangli were completed. The WUAs visited and interacted with the progressive
WUAs like those on the Waghad medium irrigation scheme. In addition, information
regarding WUAs as well as the MWSIP was presented at a large Agro exhibition organized at
Nagpur. A small booklet, useful for office bearers of WUA, had been prepared by WALMI.
This was for distribution to all WUAs. IEC activities were included as an integral part of the
groundwater pilots, that component, which proved very effective.

 Annex 3.        Economic and Financial Analysis

         This Annex is presented in three parts as follows: (i) The analytical soundness of the
 F & E analysis at appraisal; (ii) The value for money (of project investment) by comparing ex
 ante economic cost/benefit and fiscal benefits with ex post; and (iii) The fiscal impacts of the
 project related to cost recovery.

 1.       Assessment of Analytical Soundness Appraisal

         At appraisal, there were notable computational errors in the financial and economic
 models and analysis (at scheme level) which contributed to an over-estimate of rates of return
 (F/E IRRs). Table 1, indicates the error-difference in the appraisal and corrected estimates for
 ERRs for representative scheme level, whilst Table 2 shows the corrected estimates at
 individual scheme level. Whilst the economic rates of return still remain reasonable after
 correction at representative scheme level, the overall economic merits are less pronounced
 and some individual major and medium schemes would have been uneconomic (Kai and
 Natuwadi) and Koradi and Krishna Canal may have been at best marginal and sensitive to
 changes in switching values. The computational errors were not systemic and therefore did
 not affect the calculation of the overall ERR and NPV for the project (including all project
 cost).

           The ex post estimates are based on:

              Corrected and updated financial and economic models used at appraisal;
              Assumptions used at appraisal for cost allocation of institutional and management
               costs;
              Actual project investment for a representative sample of 17 major, medium and minor
               schemes for which actual project costs were available;
              With and without project data and farm-models collected by the M&E consultants for

3.     Cost Benefit and Rates of Return Analysis

        Whilst rate of return analysis with respect to capital (ERR or NPV analysis) is
conventionally used in Bank projects as a measure of efficiency, an opportunity was missed
at appraisal to assess fuller returns (including economic) to water which, ex ante was clearly
identified as the key constraint in agricultural and industrial production and urgently needed
regulatory (including price) instruments for improved allocative efficiency. Further analysis
from an economic efficiency standpoint could, therefore, have added significantly in
underpinning the principles of allocative efficiency outlined in the PDO and provided a
more thorough basis for cost and price determination. Although the PAD signaled an
intention to examine at least rates of return to water, and cites improved water productivity
as an important driver in F & E analysis, no meaningful indicators or analysis were included
under the project and undertaken ex post by the project M&E consultants.

4.     Fiscal Impacts

       The cost of water for irrigation, drinking, and industry is now set by MWRRA after
due consultation and reflects the full cost. Collection rates are improving as the level of
service to farmers has improved and WUOs have much more input into decision making
under this project. The six pilot schemes with volumetric charging and bulk supply of water
were very successful and volumetric pricing and bulk supply of water was included in 236
schemes covering 1,341 WUAs. These are very encouraging trends, especially as
Maharashtra is already a leader in water sector reforms in India and GoM is committed to
implementing these reforms as on-going policy beyond the project.

Annex 7.      Summary of Borrower's ICRR

        The Borrower prepared a comprehensive and useful ICR report that generally
followed the Bank’s recommended format. The full report is in the project files. The report
was prepared in nine sections, with many subsections providing a lot of detail on project
component outputs. In addition, there were nine annexures that provided information on
performance indicators, costs and expenditure and many other details. A lot of the data was
provided from the final consultant’s comprehensive and detailed M&E report, which is also
in the project files.

       The table of contents and annexures of the borrower’s report was as follows:

       Section 1: Introduction

       Section 2: Project Development Objectives

       Section 3: Project Components and Sub-components

        The key experiences noted by the borrower were: (i) The achievement of the creation
and well-functioning nature of the MWRRA was pivotal in reforming the water sector, not
only from the State perspective, but also because of the precedent it set and the influence it is
having on shaping national water policy and actions in other Indian states; (ii) the enthusiasm
and acceptance by the WRD staff of the ICIS (e-Javseva); (iii) The restructuring of the WRD
that has resulted in the separation of development from management, which in turn has led to
a culture change within the WRD, facilitated by the project PIM activities; (iv) the
combined impact of improved irrigation services, the PIM and agricultural support services
activities on farmers and the increase in water use efficiency and agricultural production; (v)
the huge impact on changing the way the State approached sustainable groundwater
management, because of the highly satisfactory outcome of piloting the community/user
centered groundwater management.

        Some of the key lessons learned from the borrower’s perspective are: (i) Participation
by beneficiaries from the earliest stage possible is essential for success and creates a sense of
ownership right from the beginning of a project; (ii) to build the capacity of newly
established institutions like WUAS, it is essential to properly assess training needs,
sequencing and the resources necessary, including costs; (iii) early capacity building of
implementing agencies, especially with respect to procedures for procurement, project
management, contract management, communication skills, and FM is very necessary to
ensure smooth implementation of the Project right from the start; (iv) better co-ordination,
cooperation and scheduling/sequencing of interrelated project activities where multiple
implementing agencies are involved is important.
