                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall project implementation is progressing well. Of the 235 irrigation schemes covered under the project, canal rehabilitation/modernization works have been completed in 183
                         schemes (78%) have been completed. Works in the remaining 52 irrigation schemes are also at advanced stages of implementation and on an average have reached a completion
                         level of about 80%, and are expected to be completed by project closure. The training and capacity building of 1674 water user organizations formed in 235 irrigation schemes are
                         continuing and these associations are involved in the irrigation systems management under the project.
