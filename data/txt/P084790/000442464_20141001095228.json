moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: success of institutional reforms\n            depends on level of government commitment. The focus should\n            be on building client capacity for monitoring and evaluation\n            (M and E) through training and investment in computerized\n            systems instead of mostly relying on M and E consultants to\n            carry out project M and E. The effectiveness of large\n            infrastructure investments to rehabilitate and modernize\n            irrigation systems for improved water use efficiency and\n            productivity are considerably enhanced by the inclusion of a\n            well-designed and well-implemented agricultural support\n            services component. Information, education, and\n            communication (IEC) activities were an important part of the\n            project because of the significant and complex policy and\n            institutional changes. A fundamental change in government\n            procedures is needed to address the disconnect between: (a)\n            increased water charges and collections that reflect full\n            operation and maintenance (O and M) costs, and (b) low\n            budget allocations for O and M. Consideration should be\n            given to amending the Maharashtra Management of Irrigation\n            Systems by Farmers (MMISF) Act to allow staggering of the\n            election of representatives such that half the members are\n            elected for a six year term every three years."}, "docdt": "2014-09-26T00:42:02Z"}
