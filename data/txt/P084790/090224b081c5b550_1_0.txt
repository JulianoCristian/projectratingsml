                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After the initial slow start, the overall project implementation is progressing well. Most of the contracts relating to works, consultancies, and goods and equipment under the project
                         have been awarded, canal rehabilitation works in about 73% schemes covered under the project are completed and in the remaining 27% schemes also these works are at advanced
                         stages of implementation. The training and capacity building of 1674 water user organizations formed in 235 irrigation schemes are continuing and these associations are involved in
                         the irrigation systems management under the project.
