  moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included: 1) Sound quality at entry is critical; design must\n            be supported by solid analytical work; piloting smaller\n            scale operations and reforms can help build capacity and\n            stakeholder support; 2) Strong Government ownership is not\n            sufficient, it must be backed up with resources and budget\n            execution must be synchronized with health reforms; 3)\n            Explicit assessment of political risks could provide\n            guidance to teams embarking on projects that support\n            reforms; 4) A lesson on how to undertake health sector\n            reforms is that sometimes complex designs are necessary and\n            a broader approach could be the only way to achieve the\n            expected outcomes. This means that within the Bank, teams\n            from different sectors need better coordination that would\n            allow for full use of instruments and within a country\n            better alignment of frameworks is a must; 5) In a developing\n            sector supported by a large number of donors; successful\n            donor coordination is critical for successful comprehensive\n            reforms and; 6) When health reforms change the role of the\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) to one of stewardship, focus must\n            also be on institutional development and governance. As a\n            steward of health care, more transparency and accountability\n            become expected. This means that MOH and the sector as a\n            whole need stronger and transparent fiduciary function\n            (procurement, financial management)."}, "docdt": "2007-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
