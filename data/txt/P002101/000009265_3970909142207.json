The main objectives\n            of the project were (i) to support and strengthen the\n            institutional and policy framework and to facilitate the\n            commercialization of Nigerian Telecommunications Plc.(\n            NITEL); (ii) improve the access to and quality of\n            telecommunications services; and (iii) improve NITEL's\n            financial performance. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (a) institutional\n            development of monopolies is ineffective in Bank-financed\n            projects in the absence of Government commitment, or\n            suitable readiness, to an appropriate policy and regulatory\n            framework and operating environment of the enterprise in the\n            concerned sector; (b) autonomy is not an automatic result of\n            corporatization; (c) the Bank should consider portfolio\n            remedies when systematic problems occur with project\n            implementation. Major project reviews should be made about\n            two years of loan effectiveness in countries where\n            implementation problems are common; and (d) consultants can\n            play a critical role in project implementation."}, "docdt": "1997-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
