MEMORANDIM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE NIGERIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a preposed loan
to the Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL) with the guarantee of
the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FGN) for US$225 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be at the Bank's variable
interest rate with 20 years maturity, including a five-year grace period.
The FGN is seeking co-financing from other sources for US$110 million
equivalent.
2.        Background.  Despite substantial past investments in the sector,
Nigeria suffers from very low levels of telecommunication services, even by
Sub-Saharan Africa standards. Its penetration of 0.2 telephone lines per
O00 inhabitants is only about 502 of the average in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Investments have been executed with many delays and at about triple the
regional average cost. The quality of service is unacceptably poor with
the call completion rates for local and incoming international calls at
about 302 and 20X, respectively. The present service fails to meet the
expressed demand and significant costs are being incurred by the economy.
In addition, the sector, which is potentially very profitable, had been
operating at a loss primarily due to inadequate tariffs and poor quality of
service. In general, poor performance has been largely due to the
institutional and management weaknesses. To improve sector performance, in
January 1985, FGN reorganized the sector and established NITEL, a wholly
government owned limited company, to operate telecommunications services on
a commercial basis. However, due to inadequate advance planning, the
commercialization process has been slow and not fully effective. NITEL
lacks operational autonomy, proper management systems and procedures, and
adequately trained staff. FGN's continued commitment to improve the
performance of the sector is further demonstrated by: (a) the decision in
July 1988 to fully commercialize NITEL as part of its broad reforms of
public enterprises involving privatization and commercialization of key
public enterprises. The Technical Committee for Privatization and
Commerciallzation (TCPC) has examined NITEL's situation and its
recommendations are in line with the Bank's dialogue; (b) the request for
Bank assistance to support implementation of its commercialization efforts.
As an initial step, the Bank's Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance
was utilized to finance preparatory activities designed to strengthen
NITEL's commercial orientation; (c) the acceptance by FGN and NITEL, of the
findings of the PPF consultants and implementation of some of their key
recommendations, such as restructuring of the Finance Department, improving
billing and collection systems and procedures, expediting completion of
outstanding accounts and audits and introduction of preventive maintenance
of its telecommunications facilities; (d) the substantial increases in
international tariffs (about 6002 in February 1988) and domestic tariffs
(call and rental charges for telephone service by 8002 and 3002,



- 2 -
respectively, in February 1990); (e) the decision to open up previously
directly coutracted items to international competition; and (f) the
preparation of a telecommunications policy paper to articulate )ITEL's
commercial operating framework, determine conditions and areas under which
service would be provided for telecommunications, and define a regulatory
framework. The policy paper is in line with the trends in the sector in
most other countries and consistent with the Bank's dialogue with FGN. In
addition, FGN has already taken substantive actions along the lines
proposed by the Bank in its policy dialogue including the implementation of
a rational digitalization policy.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project would support the
public enterprise reform process in Nigeria, which is a key element of
FGN's structural adjustment program. It foct;sses on the commercialization
of NITEL, whose performance impacts consider.ably on all aspects of the
economy, and financing the most urgent rehabilitation and expansion
components. The Bank's cross country experience in telecommunications
would directly and immediately play a key role in assisting PGN and NITEL
in implementing a rational national sector policy and institutional, and
development strategies necessary to improve the performance of this vital
sector. In addition, the Bank's presence would lead to streamlining the
procurement process and standardization resulting in the reduction of unit
costs of equipment.
4.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the project are to:
(a) support strengthening of the institutional and policy framework and
facilitate commercialization of NITEL; (b) improve the access to and
quality of telecommunications services; and (c) improve NITEL's financial
performance and enable net transfer of funds from the sector to FGN.
5.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project consists of the
following: (a) institutional development program including technical
assistance to: (i) develop long-term network development strategy and
realistic investment program; (ii) undertake technical audit of Lagos
network; (iii) review NITEL's accounting and financial systems and
procedures as well as billing and collection system; (iv) design and
implement management information system, review tariff levels and
structure, and revalue fixed assets; and (v) improve project management,
financial management, materials management, network planning and huwa.^
resource development; (b) physical development program for rehabilitation
of existing facilities including the provision of spare parts and
equipment; supply, installation and commissioning of new exchanges and
matching external line plant in the Lagos metropolitan area and major
cities; rehabilitation and upgrading of Lanlate satellite earth station;
expansion o; long distance transmission links; establishment of teleprinter
and telex module repair center; provision of telephone instruments and
motor vehicles; construction of buildings; and provision of ancillary
equipment.
6.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$483.5 million
equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$370.9 million



(77X). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursements schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8035-UNI dated May 16, 1990 is being
distribiuted separately.
7.        Actions Agreed:  The following major agreements were reached:
(a) key performance objectives and targets for inclusion in a performance
contract between FGN and NITEL. NITEL will furnish to the Bank for its
comments, by October 31, 1990, the final draft of the performance contract
to be implemented starting January 1, 1991; (b) improve billing and
collection performance and reduce outstanding subscriber receivables to 120
days of billing for the ye"r by 1990, 90 days by 1992 and 60 days by 1994
and maintain it thereafter; (c) furnish to the Bank draft and audited
accounts for PY89 within nine and twelve months of the close of the fiscal
year and for each year, thereafter, the draft and audited accounts within
four and six months of the close of the fiscal year. Audits of project
accounts, special accounts and statement of expenditures will be submitted
with the audited financial accounts for each fiscal year; (d) review with
the Bank not later than October 31, each year the composition of its
capital expenditure program for the five years immediately following such
review together with details of the financing plan prepared for such
program until the completion of the Project; (e) technical, operational and
financial performance indicators and targets for 1990. Targets for
subsequent years, together with an action plan to improve performance, if
necessary, will be agreed upon by October 31 of the preceding year;
(f) report progress oa project implementation and against technical and
operational indicators in the quarterly progress reports to be submitted
within six weeks of the end of each quarter and against financial
indicators in the annual financial statements; (g) NITEL to: (i) finance
from internally generated funds net of debt service obligations, the local
cost component of its annual investment program; (ii) earn an annual rate
of return on revalued net fixed assets of not less than 102 in 1991 and
thereafter; (iii) maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5;
and (iv) maintain a debt equity ratio of not more than 60s40. The main
conditions for loan effectiveness are: (a) appointment of consultants for
project and financial management; and (b) issuance of letters of invitation
for remaining consultancy services.
8.       Benefits.  Investments focussed on rehabilitation and improved
utilization of existing facilities as well as expansion in high demand
areas would maximize the utilization of NITEL's existing facilities and
hence improve its financial and economic returns. The minimum internal
economic rate of return from the program is estimated at about 24Z. The
project will alleviate a major infrastructure constraint to the
sustainability of economic development and adjustment in Nigeria through
upgrading the country's standard of telecommunications, currently among the
lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, institutional building and



- 4 -
strengthening of NITEL's management systems would result in improved
financial performance and net transfer of funds from the sector to 7GN.
9.        Risks.  While progress has been made by the Bank in seeking
commitment from both FGN and NITEL on major areas and required actions for
substantially improving the performance of the sector as well as its
sustainability, the principal risk still relates to the pace at which
implementation capacity can be strengthened. However, this risk has been
minimized by the upfront commitment and action by FGN and NITEL for
strengthening the sector and entity management and other related issues.
Finally, annual reviews by FGN and the Bank of NITEL's achievements would
provide a framework to ensure satisfactory implementation of both the
institutional and physical aspects of the proposed project.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Ezecutive Directors approve the proposed loan.
