Restructuring Paper 
 
1.  The closing date for INDIA 
–
MUMBAI URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
,
[Loan 
4665-IN/Credit 3662-IN], P050668 
will be extended
 
from June 15, 2010 until June 
15, 2011.   
2. 
The project was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors on June 18, 2002 and 
its restructuring approved on September 30, 2008 by the Board. Every component is 
progressing satisfactorily except for the road construction component that has 
experienced long delays and still suffers from uncertainty in interagency coordination  
and a few remaining challenges in resettlement and rehabilitation. The project includes an 
extremely large resettlement component (18.000 households and shops) that suffered 
difficulties resulting in an Inspection Panel investigation to which the Bank’s 
Management presented a remedial Action Plan that was discussed by the Board on March 
28, 2006. Since then the quality of resettlement and rehabilitation under the project has 
regularly improved to become satisfactory and the resettlement is almost complete (96% 
complete as February 1
st
,
2010)
while post-resettlement activities are exemplary. The rail 
component, which is expected to have the largest impact on transport capacity, is 
progressing satisfactorily and the implementation of the new traffic management system 
over 253 intersections is also progressing well. Out of the two major link roads that are 
included in the project, the widening of Jogeswari-Vikhroli-Link-Road is almost 
completed, but the creation of Santacruz-Chembur-Link-Road is still encountering 
important difficulties that leave uncertainty as to its successful completion in a reasonable 
time. The disbursement of the project amounts to 70% of the loan/credit amount on May 
31, 2010. Overall the project is rated satisfactory for compliance with safeguards policies. 
The financial management risk of the project is substantial but these risks have been 
mitigated by MMRDA recently increasing its accounting capacity and developing an 
action plan for effective internal audit. The project development objectives are still 
achievable. 
3. 
The proposed extension of the IBRD loan and IDA credit is necessary to complete 
the remaining three major activities that are the rail component, Part A of the project, the 
traffic management component, Part B1 of the project and the Jogeswari-Vikhroli-Link-
Road, Part B2a of the loan, as well as the resettlement and most of the post-resettlement 
activities under the project. It will not be sufficient to complete the construction of 
Santacruz-Chembur-Link-Road, Part B2b of the project. The Government of India (DEA) 
requested the extension of the loan and the credit through several letters since November 
2009 and several meetings were held, and communication exchanged, between the Bank 
and the borrower on this matter since January 2010. The Government of India has agreed

to a set of actions to progress the implementation of the project and to submit a 
satisfactory implementation plan to complete the construction of SCLR. This action plan 
is detailed in the letter sent to the borrower dated March 25, 2010 that includes the aide 
memoire of the Implementation Support Mission, February 15-19, 2010. If before June 
2011 the Government of India submits an implementation plan, satisfactory to the Bank 
to complete the implementation of SCLR, part B2b of the project, the Bank will consider 
further extending the loan.
 
This plan is agreeable to the Bank for the proposed one year 
extension. 
4. 
This will be the fourth extension of the loan.
