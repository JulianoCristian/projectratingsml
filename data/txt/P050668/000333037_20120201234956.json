Some lessons\n            learned included: a project of this nature should have\n            included a user survey to be undertaken by an independent\n            entity before the investments were completed and after the\n            entry in operation of some of the investments. This will\n            allow gauging the impact of the project components on\n            different segments of the population and start building up a\n            philosophy that the users must be heard periodically in\n            Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The nature and\n            significance of some major resettlement difficulties were\n            appreciated by the client during the process of\n            implementation. Through very active Bank involvement, Mumbai\n            Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) gradually\n            evolved its mindset for resettlement from a bureaucratic to\n            a more sustainable and consultative approach. It developed\n            capacity for managing a large scale and complex resettlement\n            process. The same was needed from other agencies such as\n            Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation Limited (MRVC) and Indian\n            Railways (IR) to change their mindset and reinforce their\n            capacity to address difficult and sensitive challenges, such\n            as the safety of trespassers and users, environmental\n            management and financial sustainability."}, "docdt": "2011-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
