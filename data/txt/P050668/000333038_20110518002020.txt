SUMMARY
The proposed change is to cancel an amount of US$ 8 million from the IDA credit of
Mumbai Urban Transport Project (Credit No 3662 IN).


PROJECT STATUS
Background: MUTP was approved by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on June
18, 2002 (Loan No. 4665-IN; Credit No. 3662-IN).1 The Project became effective on
November 6, 2002 and is being implemented by the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation
(MRVC); the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM); Brihanmumbai
Electricity Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST) Corporation; Maharashtra State
Roads Development Corporation (MSRDC); Traffic Police of Mumbai; and the Mumbai
Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on behalf of the Government of
Maharashtra (GoM) and the Borrower, Government of India (GoI). MMRDA is the
coordinating agency and is responsible for implementing the road and resettlement and
rehabilitation component on behalf of all the implementing agencies.

The Project Development Objective is to facilitate urban economic growth and improve
quality of life by fostering the development of an efficient and sustainable urban transport
system including effective institutions to meet the needs of the users in the Mumbai
Metropolitan Region (MMR).

The Project consists of three components:
• Component 1 -- Rail Transport, the main activities of which are: (a) improvement of
   capacity and performance of the suburban rail network of the Central and Western
   Railways through provision of infrastructure, (track additions, signaling systems
   power, etc.), new rolling stock (101 9-car electric motor units); and (b) technical
   assistance.
• Component 2 -- Road-based Transport, the main activities of which are: (a) area
   traffic control (250 junctions), selected traffic management infrastructure schemes
   implemented by MCGM; (b) buses (644) procured by BEST; (c) road widening to
   facilitate two East-West linkages, the Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR) and
   Santacruz Chembur Link Road (SCLR), and (d) technical assistance.

  It should be noted that during the preparation phase, the resettlement and rehabilitation aspects were for
some time considered to be implemented as a separate, but complementary project, the Mumbai Urban
Rehabilitation Project (MURP).
                                                     5
•     Component 3 -- Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R), comprising mainly:
      construction of housing, and provision of services for resettlement and rehabilitation
      of project-affected families, implemented by MMRDA and financed with an IDA
      credit.

2.      Current Status:        The project closing date is June 15, 2011.and by that time,
most of the project components are expected to be completed. The benefits of the project
are already visible especially for rail component, R & R, Bus component, JVLR and Area
Traffic Control (ATC). The rail capacity has been significantly increased and the
overcrowding decreased. The quasi totality of the people and shops to be displaced has
been relocated in a satisfactory manner and the quality of the post-resettlement carried
out by MMRDA is exemplary. The JVLR is now carrying large number of users. The
new traffic signal system under ATC has already reduced delays at junctions. The
regional strategic transport Plan TRANSFORM is serving as basis for the gigantic
development program that MMRDA has started to implement. The major component
which will not get completed by June 2011 is Santacruz Chembur Link Road and this
road will take another about two years for completion.



PROPOSED CHANGES
3.      The IDA credit is for the activities planned as part of the R&R Component of the
project. In addition, during the earlier restructuring on September 30, 2008 one more
category that is “Goods” under part A (Rail Transport Component) was added. Most of
the works under R & R component are completed. DEA, in a review meeting of the
project on April 7, 2011 asked the project implementing agencies of the expected savings
in IDA and accordingly DEA, vide their letter of April 21, 2011 requested for
cancellation of a total of US$ 8 million from the credit.
