                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is the result of a full implementation support mission carried out during January 31 - February 11, 2011 and partial implementation support mission during May 23-28, 2011.

                         The benefits of the project are already visible especially for rail component, Resettlement & Rehabilitation (R&R), Bus component, Jogeshwari Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR) and Area
                         Traffic Control (ATC). The rail capacity has been significantly increased and the overcrowding decreased. Improvement in transport service in terms of quality and comfort is also

                         noticed as a result of the replacement of 644 old buses. The quasi totality of the people and shops to be displaced has been relocated in a satisfactory manner. The JVLR is now
                         carrying large number of users. The new traffic signal system under ATC has already reduced delays at junctions. The regional strategic transport Plan TRANSFORM is serving as

                         basis for the development program that Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has started to implement.
                         The overall disbursement is 98.73% for IDA and 77.05% for IBRD. Most of the activities are expected to be completed by June15, 2011. The major works which are not likely to be
                         completed by June 15, 2011 are Santacruz Chembur Link Road (SCLR), Some works on JVLR especially of road safety, few cases of land acquisition and R & R, the completion of
                         post-resettlement support activities followed with formal handing over of resettlement colonies to Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), procurement of Railway new
                         bogies, some of the civil works in Virar Car Shed and few locations of traffic signals under ATC. While most of these works have a good possibility of getting completed in next few
                         months, the completion of SCLR, remaining land acquisition and R & R in a time bound manner remains uncertain and it may take more than one and a half years to get completed.
