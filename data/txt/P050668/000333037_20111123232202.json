Progress has\n            been notable with regard to promoting sustainable\n            self-management of the resettlement sites with support for\n            income activities, building institutional capacity of\n            housing cooperative societies, and provision of social\n            services. Management is satisfied that the Mumbai\n            Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has\n            transformed its approach to Resettlement and Rehabilitation\n            management to one that is responsive and sustainable. In\n            view of the substantial completion of the Action Plan and\n            Project closure on June 15, 2011, Management proposes to\n            conclude the reporting on the Action Plan with the next\n            progress report which will occur by June 30, 2013. Lessons\n            learned and implementation experiences will be documented as\n            part of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), which is\n            currently being finalized. The mainstreaming of the\n            resettlement sites into the urban services network remains a\n            challenge and MMRDA is pursuing the matter with GoM and MCGM\n            to ensure that all basic services are provided on a\n            sustained basis to the resettlement sites."}, "docdt": "2011-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
