Every component is progressing satisfactorily\n            except for the road construction component that has\n            experienced long delays and still suffers from uncertainty\n            in interagency coordination and a few remaining challenges\n            in resettlement and rehabilitation. The project includes an\n            extremely large resettlement component (18,000 households\n            and shops) that suffered difficulties resulting in an\n            Inspection Panel investigation to which the Bank's\n            management presented a remedial action plan that was\n            discussed by the Board on March 28, 2006. Since then the\n            quality of resettlement and rehabilitation under the project\n            has regularly improved to become satisfactory and the\n            resettlement is almost complete (96 percent complete as\n            February 1st, 2010) while post-resettlement activities are\n            exemplary. Out of the two major link roads that are included\n            in the project, the widening of Jogeswari-Vikhroli-Link-Road\n            is almost completed, but the creation of\n            Santacruz-Chembur-Link-Road is still encountering important\n            difficulties that leave uncertainty as to its successful\n            completion in a reasonable time. The disbursement of the\n            project amounts to 70 percent of the loan/credit amount on\n            May 31, 2010. Overall the project is rated satisfactory for\n            compliance with safeguards policies."}, "docdt": "2010-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
