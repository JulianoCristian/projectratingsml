                         This ISR is the result of a full implementation support mission carried out during January 31 - February 11, 2011

                         The benefits of the project are already visible especially for rail component, R & R, Bus component, JVLR and Area Traffic Control (ATC). The rail capacity has been significantly
                         increased and the overcrowding decreased. Improvement in transport service in terms of quality and comfort is also noticed as a result of the replacement of 644 old buses. The

                         The overall disbursement rate has improved but is still slow. Most of the activities are expected to be completed by June15, 2011. The major works which will not be completed by
                         June 15, 2011 are Santacruz Chembur Link Road (SCLR), Virar Car Shed and train bogie supply contract. While the work on Virar car shed and train bogie supply will be
                         substantially completed by June 15, 2011, completion of SCLR will take about two years beyond June 15, 2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The loan has been extended to June 15, 2011. It is expected that all activities except SCLR, Virar Car Shed and train bogie supply will be completed by that time. While the work on
                         Virar car shed and train bogie supply will be substantially completed by June 15, 2011, completion of SCLR will take about two years beyond June 15, 2011. The Bank team plans to
                         carry out an Interim Mission during May 23-25, 2011 to get an update on the progress.
