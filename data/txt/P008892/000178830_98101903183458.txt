INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPNENT
REPORT AND RECOgNNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.   I submit tlae following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $13.5 million to the
Republic of Turkey for an education project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.   In July 1970, the Turkish Government requested Bank assistance in
financing the proposed education project which had been identified and
prepared with the assistance of UNESCO.   The project was appraised by
the Bank in September/October 1970.   Negotiations with representatives
of the Government took place in Washington during April 19 - 22, 1971.
The Government was represented by .lr Tufan Gul, Chief Counselor for Economic
and Financial Affairs at the Turkish Embassy in Washington and head of the
delegation, IHr Candan, Assistant Undersecretary for Technical Education
in the Ministry of Education, Mrs Sayar and Messrs Gozaydin and Dulger of
the S-tate Planniing Organization and Mr Guvendaran, First Secretary of the
Embassy.
3.   The proposed loan, the twenty-second Bank/IDA operation in Turkey,
wfould be the first for education.   An agricultural education project for
which the Government intends to request Bank financial assistance, has been
recently identified and will be prepared under the FAO/IBRD cooperative
program.
4.  The follo,wing is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
to Turkey as of harch 31, 1971;

5.      Execution of most of the projects has been satisfactory.  Progress
with on-farm development under the Seyhan Irrigation Projects (Credit 38-TU
and Loan/Credit 587/143-TU) had been disappointing until 1967, but is now
satisfactory. The excavation work on the Second Cucurova Power Project
(Credit 59-TU) was originally substantially dela-jed because of a contractor
dispute about possible cost overruns arising from bad rock formations, but
since 1969 progress has been satisfactory.  It will be necessary to post-
pone the closing date from June 30, 1971 to December 31, 1971 to meet final
contract payments. The Third Cukurova Power Project (Loan 623-TU) has con-
sequently been delayed by one year and tihere have been cost overruns which
have, however, not materially affected the viability of the project. The
Bank is considering a fourth loan to Cukurova Elektrik to meet part of the
cost overruns and to finance additional transmission work. The construction
period for the Keban Transmission Project (Loan 568-TU) has been prolonged
to accommodate delays which have occurred in the building of the related
Keban Power Project (not financed by the Bank), but the Bank project is now
progressing satisfactorily.
6.      A substantial increase in Bank/IDA lending for Turkev is planned for
the next years in most economic sectors, i.e. agriculture, industry, power,
urban development, tourism, and transport. For the immediate or near
future, two agricul-tural projects (fresh fruit and vegetables, and irri-
gation), two power projects, and two industrial projects (steel making and
fertilizers) are under advanced consideration.
7.      IFO carries in its portfolio investments in the Industrial Develop-
ment Bank of Turkey (TSKB), Sentetik Iplik Fabrikalari A. S. (SIFAS)
(textiles), Viking Kagit ve Seluloz A.S. (pulp, paper and paper products),
Anadolu Cam Sanayii A.S. (ACS) (glass and glass products), and NASAS -
Aluminyum Sanayii ve Ticareti A.S. (aluminum sheet and foil), and is pre-
pared to finance industrial projects and to take equity where appropriate.
IFC-has a number of projects in various stages of analysis or discussion,
including soda ash, lead-zinc smelting, dairy: and alloy steel.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
8.      Borrower:                     Republic of Tarkey.

tion period.



Amortization:             In 25 years including a 10-year period
of grace, through semi-annual install-
ments beginning October 1, 1981 and
ending April 1, 1996.
Interest rate:            7-1: percent.
Commitment charge:        3/4 of 1 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.     A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in Turkey"
(PE-28a, dated May 10, 1971) is attached.
10.    The educational system of Turkey is passing through a transition
period in which the traditional general academic education is giving way
to the functional training required by a modern society. Turkey has
undertaken a number of measures to introduce into its educational system
the changes necessitated by developments in the socio-economic framework
of the country and, in particular since the early 1960's, to relate its
educational system to the manpower needs of its changing economy. The most
significant changes have been: (a) revision of primary school curricula;
(b) strengthening of science streams in secondary education; (c) initia-
tion of technician schools and practical trade schools; and (d) the
establishment of new faculties and institutions to provide instruction in
modern technology, science and management. Despite the efforts being
made in this direction, the shortage of technicians, craftsmen, semi-
skilled workers and managerial personnel is increasing in relation to the
growming needs resulting from industrialization.  The proposed project is
expected to reduce this gap by improving the quality and increasing the
availability of technical and managerial training.
11.    The project will provide equipment for 32 technician schools and
12 practical trade schools spread throughout the country as well as for the
Men's Technical Teacher Training College, the Science Equipment Production
Center and the Educational Film, Radio and Television Center (to help ex-
pand educational television broadcasts, especially to rural schools and
adult training schemes). It also includes the establishment of two new
types of institutions, namely a Management Training Institute at Gebze
near Istanbul to provide short courses in business administration for
middle and high level managers, and six Adult Training Centers.  The latter
will be located in the industrialized areas of the country and provide
employable skills to immigrants coming from rural to industrial areas and
also assist in reducing their problems of adjustment to an industrial en-
vironment. Technical assistance is also included in the project in the



- 5 -
form of fellmrships abroad and services of specialists to assist the above
institutions in implementing new curricula, introducing new teaching methods
and modernizing educational equipment production techniques. A sufficient
supply of teachers is ensured by current government programs to expand
teacher training institutions and by the assistance provided for in the
project to cormplement these programs.  A UNDM  project will also aid in the
supply of instructors.
12.      The project will be executed by a project unit established for
this purpose in the Ministry of Education. A project director reporting to
the Under-Secretary of Vocational and Technical Education, will be respon-
sible for implementation of the project and for communications with the
Bank.
13.      The total cost of the project (including contingencies) is esti-
mated at $17.9 million of which $12.7 million in foreign exchange. Tne
proposed loan would cover the estimated foreign exchange component of the
project plus interest and other charges on the loan during construction,
which are estimated at $0.8 million.
14.      Contracts for civil works and procurement of furniture and equip-
ment will be awarded on the basis of international competition. Procure-
ment will be grouped in packages of a sufficient size to encourage foreign
as well as domestic contractors and suppliers to participate in the biddirg.
A 15 percent margin of preference or the applicable import duties, which-
ever is lower, will be given to local manufacturers of equipment and furni-
ture in bid comparison. Contracts for civil works and furniture are expected
to be won by local contractors and suppliers and the Bank will disburse 15
percent of the total cost of these items, representing the estimated foreign
exchange component. Foreign manufacturers are the most likely source of
supply for equipment, but if local manufacturers are awarded contracts, the
Bank will disburse the total ex-factory cost.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the
Bank, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text
of a Resolution approving the loan are being distributed separately to
the Executivie Directors.  The draft Loan Agreement follows the usual
pattern of agreements for similar education projects.

PART V - THE ECOMCMY
16.     A report entitled "The Development Prospects of Turkey" (EME-30a,
dated February 1, 1971) which was recently distributed to the Executive
Directors described Turkey's economic performance and appraised the country's
prospects. A basic date sheet is attached.
17.     IFWith the devaluation and the accompanying stabilization program
adopted in August 1970, the foundation for a new external orientation of
the Turkishi economy had been laid. To reap the full benefits of devaluation,
follmo-up measures to reform economic policies and the institutional struc-
ture were called for to re-establish a fast growth rate and progress towards
external viability. In the months following devaluation the short term
management of the econoVy was good b-at it was not clear whether the funda-
mental reforms needed would be made.  Since the report w,,Tas issued, the
budget for 1971 has been approved, which aims at balancing revenues and
expenditures.  The major development has been a change in Government.  At
the end of March 1971 a new non-partisan, technocratic government succeeded
the previous government which had been asked to resign by the armed forces
in the face of increasing social and political unrest. The new government
has nowT announced its program for social and economic reform, in which it
has emphasized its intention to take both short and longer term measures to
reform economic policies and make needed administrative and institutional
changes.
18.     The mTost noteworthy features of the government program are reforms
in agriculture, education, state economic enterprises, fiscal policy and
administration, and measures to secure larw and order.  The pro-
gram also calls for the transfer to public authorities of responsibility
for certain services (e.g. the wholesale distribution of oil). In agri-
culture the government intends to improve production methods and the coordi-
nation between different agencies to ensure consistency in agricultural
policies and their implementation. State economic enterprises --ould be
operated in accordanice with the principles of profitability and productivity.
In the fiscal sphere, improvement in budgetary proceduzes and tax collection
is proposed.
19.     Thile pursuing these important goals, the government wTill also
have difficult problems to face.  It is particularly important to avoid
rapid price increases, and to taks advantage of the relative price changes
after devaluation to expand exports. Unfortunately at this time, large
salary increases in the public sector have to be found out of the budg,-et,
and price increases due to devaluation and wage increases have also still
to be absorbed by the economy. In view of this, sound budgetary management
is important. The budget approved for 1971 provides for total expenditure
of TL 38.3 billion compared .with TL 29.9 billion for 1970 but adequate pro-
vision appears to have been made on the revenue side. Although the prospects
of a steady increase of about 10 percent per arnum in exports are good, the
balance of payments remains vulnerable to factors largely outside the



- 7 -
Government's control. As a result, the liberalization of imports
should proceed in step with improvements in the external position.
The rate of expansion in business activity and further export growth
are likely to be highly dependent on maintaining the business comrunity's
confidence in its future role in the Turkish economy.
20.     If Turkey is to maintain a growth rate of about 7 percent, its
needs for external assistance are likely to be considerable. Debt
service obligations in 1970 wqere about 19 percent of foreign exchange
earrnings, in spite of the highly concessionary terms of aid in the
past. In the future Turkey may have to accept a gradual hardening of
terms.  In these circumstances, the country's borrowving capacity will
have to be kept under continuing review. Turkey has a margin for
borrowing on conventional terms, but it should seek to obtain as much
aid as possible on concessionary terns.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREMENT
21.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOPINDATION
22.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
