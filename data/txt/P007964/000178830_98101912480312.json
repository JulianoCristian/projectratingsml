{"cdata!": "The objectives of this project, which\n            would be carried out in the southern Peruvian altiplano near\n            Puno, are to improve living conditions for the approximately\n            29,500 rural families in the project area now at or below\n            the relative poverty level. Of these, 170,000 families\n            participating directly in the agricultural development\n            components would increase their agricultural and livestock\n            production on about 24,000 ha of the project area through\n            the improvement and construction of irrigation systems, the\n            provision of agricultural credit and intensive research and\n            extension programs. The project would also include the\n            rehabilitation of rural roads a forest plantation component\n            for fuel and soil conservation, improvement of rural health\n            facilities, construction of communal potable water systems,\n            vocational training and preinvestment studies for a\n            follow-up project. The principal risk confronting the\n            project is its administrative complexity. To deal with this\n            risk a Project Unit would be established in ORDEPUNO, the\n            Puno Regional Development Organization, with operational\n            control over most of the executing agencies. In addition,\n            the project would be closely supervised by Bank staff and\n            would receive substantial technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
