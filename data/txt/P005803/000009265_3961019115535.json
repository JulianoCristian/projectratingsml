The primary objective of\n            the project was to assist the government in rehabilitating,\n            maintaining, and improving its road system. It aimed to\n            conserve and develop economic resources, prevent potentially\n            high road reconstruction and vehicle operating costs, and\n            repair flood damage to important road links. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (i) need to assess early on potential Borrower problems with\n            procurement and other Bank or International Development\n            Association (IDA) procedures and provide close supervision\n            when difficulties are anticipated; (ii) complex\n            institutional changes are often not carried out successfully\n            unless the Borrower is strongly committed to them and there\n            is an appropriate constituency supporting their\n            implementation; and (iii) on the technical side, the\n            experience with the Harad bridge points out the importance\n            of frequent on-site supervision and taking early action if\n            the assumptions underlying design standards need to be\n            changed to take account of changed circumstances."}, "docdt": "1995-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
