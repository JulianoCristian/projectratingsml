lead\n            to the mobilization of more resources, and faster economic\n            recovery in The Republic of Congo. The primary development\n            objective of this project will be to increase the efficiency\n            of petroleum operations; of the Ministry of Economy, Finance\n            and Budget (MOFEB) financial operations; and, of the\n            Government's public enterprise reform, and\n            privatization process. While the project's support to\n            the three-year Interim Post-Conflict Program, and structural\n            reforms, will improve transparency of decision-making in the\n            government, and its agencies - prioritizing on the\n            management of oil resources, and state budgetary\n            expenditures - and, strengthen partnership, and dialogue\n            among government, civil society, and the private sector,\n            risks include the resurgence of political instability,\n            particularly if the international community fails to support\n            the peace process. Mitigation measures - outside the control\n            of this project - include support to a comprehensive\n            disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program,\n            through political dialogue, and willingness to implement\n            reforms. The operation will contribute to minimize risks by\n            strengthening capacity, and the dialogue and partnerships\n            promoted through the project."}, "docdt": "2002-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
