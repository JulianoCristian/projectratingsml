Some lessons\n            learned includes: it is clear with hindsight that the\n            original project design was excessively ambitious,\n            attempting to impact distinct and unrelated areas of\n            government policy and management. The implementation of the\n            project rested on one project coordinating unit and close to\n            thirty project executing agencies. This created a distinct\n            implementation challenge since the institutional capacity\n            for coordination was a weak point on the side of the\n            borrower. The second phase featured recognition of the\n            potential of the project to support a high priority agenda\n            with political salience."}, "docdt": "2011-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
