INTEGRATED PHOSPHATE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
A. hackmwi
1.1      The Jordan Phosphate Nines Company Ltd. (JPMC), in which the Government
of Jordan is the majority shareholder, has requested a Bank loan of US$25.0
million equivalent to help finance the Integrated Phosphate Project. Phosphate
is the most important of Jordan's mineral resources and provides substantial
foreign exchange earnings (US$211 million gross in 1988) through the export of
phosphate rock and thereby makes a substantial contribution to Gross National
Product (GNP). A portion of p1osphate production provides feed to JPNC's
Industrial (fertilizer plant) Complex at Wadi II on the Gulf of Aqaba coast and
the export of fertilizer products and aluminium flouride by-product yield
additional foreign exchange earnings (US$142 million gross in 1988).  The
project has two components, the second stage development of the Shidiya deposit,
which contains vast reserves of phosphate rock, and rehabilitation of the
fertilizer plant at Aqaba. The project will increase phosphate rock production
at Shidiya from the 1.75 million tonnes per year (mtpy) planned under the
Shidiya Phosphate Nine Project (Loan 2902-JO), to 3.23 mtpy by 1996; and will
provide replacement tonnage for the declining phosphate production at existing
mines (which are reaching the end of their economic life) while permitting a
gradual increase in the level of phosphate rock exports from a planned level of
7.0 mtpy in 1996. to 8.2 mtpy in 2000. Rehabilitation of the fertilizer plant at
Aqaba will raise the level of DAP (diammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid
exports to 740,000 tonnes and 59,000 tonnes P205 equivalent, respectively, by
1994.
B. Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.2      The Jordanian economy suffered serious reversals in 1988. GDP fell by
almost 3.5% in real terms.  This decline was accompanied by a further
deterioration in the overall fiscal situation, with an increase in the budget
deficit (after grants) to nearly 14.5% of QDP. The balance of payments also
worsened. Large overall deficits led to a depletion in official reserves and
there have been arrears on external payments. The underlying weakness of the
balance of payments, coupled with speculative pressure on the JD, led to the
first round of devaluations in late 1988. The economic situation in 1989 turned
out to be considerably more difficult than was expected earlier in that year.
The signs of increased investment activity in late 1988 were not been borne out
during 1989; consequently, there will be no growth in output. The budget
deficit, although less than in 1988, will remain large (11.4% of GDP). The
balance of payments was considerably tighter and necessitated a further sharp
devaluation of the JD in July 1989.



- 2 -
1.3      The Government responded to this situation by making significant
adjustments: floating the JD (with a substantial depreciation in real terms vis-
a-via the US Dollar); liberalizing the financial markets; implementing measures
to deregulate industry; and introducing an austerity budget for 1989. These
measures are in line with the thrust of Jordan's recent Five-Year Plan, under
which the Government has, by and large, pursued liberal, outward-looking
policies and promoted private enterprise. However, the situation require. a
continuation of reforms to lay the basis for balanced growth on a sustained
basis and to restore confidence in the economy. With the assistance of the Bank
and the IMF, the Government has adopted a structural adjustment program designed
to (i) reduce macroeconomic imbalances, (ii) generate growth by expanding and
diversifying exports, and (iii) protect the poor during the adjustment period.
The Government's program is being supported by an IMF standby program which was
approved in mid-July 1989, and rescheduling by the Paris and London Clubs. The
Bank is supporting the Government's program by the Industry and Trade Adjustment
Loan, presented to the Board in December 1989, which irnvolves measures to
complement the program agreed with the IMF and ensure a competitive and stable
macroeconomic framework; improve and rationalize the trading environment in the
economy; increase the efficiency and comp  .tiveness of the industrial sector in
Jordan; and develop policies to protect the economically-disadvantaged during
the reform period.
1.4     Bank assistance in the industrial sector has, hitherto, consisted of a
pilot Engineering Credit (1975) in the Potash sector, a Potash Project (1978),
an Energy Development Project (1983), several Power Projects, a second Potash
Project (1986), and a Phosphate Mine Project (1988). IFC's involvement in
Jordan has been in the production of ceramic tiles, phosphate fertilizers, and
bricks, and in the developmen' of he Amman capital market. The Bank's further
involvement in the phosphate sectol' - to help increase pnosphate rock and
fertilizer production and exports, expanding utilization of the country's major
natural resource and foreign exchange earner - is, therefore, within the Bank's
country and sector lending strategy.
C. Rationale for Bank Imolvement
1.5     During the 1981-87 period, the Bank provided extensive technical and
economic advise to continuously assist the Government and JPMC to monitor
project preparation and to identify an optimal configuration for the development
of the substantial Shidiya phosphate deposit. This culminated in the definition
of an initial mine development phase, the Shidiya Phosphate Mine Project - Loan
2902 JO, of manageable financial proportions and involving minimum market risk.
More recently, the Bank has provided further technical, economic and strategy
advise to assist further sector development and rationalization and
institutional development.
1.6      The Bank has been requested by JPMC and the Government to continue to
provide extensive technical, economic and strategy advice to assist the
development of the phosphate sector. Under the previous loan, the Bank assisted
JPMC to (i) initiate mine development at Shidiya in a low-cost, low-risk manner;
(ii) initiate rationalization of the phosphate sector; and (iii) address the
need to rehabilitate the financially troubled fertilizer plant. The Jordanian



- 3 -
authorities regard the Bank as a unique source of technical advice and financial
support for JPMC in this crucial transition period. Following the merger with
JFI, JPNC is trying to resolve complex technical problems at the fertilizer
plant and to introduce modern beneficiation technology to improve efficiency and
the economics of mine operations. The Government is also considering merging
the aillng Aqaba Railway Corporation with JPMC, since it is the railway's only
customer. At this critical juncture, the Government and JPMC have requested
continued Bank involvement to ensure (i) the systematic introduction of complex
phosphate beneficiation technology into Jordan and a rational project design,
(ii) the further development and integration of Shidlya phosphate rock
production with declining production from traditional mine areas, and (iil) the
systematic rehabilitation of Jordan's fertilizer sub-sector. The proposed
project is consistent with the Bank's lending strategy, which includes support
for export-oriented projects. IFC has not shown any interest in participating
in the project, in view of the still public sector nature of the company, and
IFC's earlier withdrawal of equity from the fertilizer unit of JPMC. Bank
participation would fill the gap in the financing plan after the support
available through cofinancing and an appropriate level of JPMC generated funds
have been taken into account.
1.7      The project was appraised in June/July 1989, by a mission consisting of
Messrs. C. Wardell, R. A. Mertz, L. Borin, and M. A. Pearson, (Bank) and Mr. J.
J. Cape (consultant). A post-appraisal was undertaken in October/November 1989
by Messrs. C. Wardell and J. J. Cape.
II. IHE JORDAN PHOSPHATE MINES COMPANY LTD. (JPMC)
A. Jistory
2.1      Phosphate deposits were discovered in Jordan in 1908. JPMC was formed
in 1953 with a capital of JD1.O million to exploit the phosphate deposit at
Ruseifa, north of Amman. In the early 1960's mining commenced at El Hassa,
south of Amman and in the late 1970's the El Abiad mine was opened, adjacent to
El Hassa. In 1988, the Shidiya mine was opened with Bank assistance (Loan 2902
JO) and is currently under implementation. The share capital of JPMC has
increased several times and, following the absorption of Jordan Fertilizer
Industries (JFI) in early 1986, and the share issue floated for the purpose of
financing the Shidiya Phosphate Mine Project in 1988, reached JD98.9 million at
end 1988. Following this share issue, the company is owned 38% by Government of
Jordan, 20% by the Jordan Social Security Pund, 20% by the 'overnment of Kuwait,
and 21% by numerous JordAnian and Arab individual and private institutional
shareholders.
B. Organization and Management
2.2      JPMC's basic organization structure and accountability to the
Government remains unchanged since the first loan. The Board of Directors has
been expanded to incorporate representatives of the Government of Kuwait.
Following integration of the mining and fertilizer units, the organizational



-4-
structure has been expanded to effectively manage and operate the enlarged
company activities (A.nnex 2-1). JPMC management continues to operate the company
on a commercially oriented basis and is satisfactory and efficient. The
Managing Director retains full charge of operations, livestment and borrowing,
foreign currency management, finance and personnel management.
2.3     JPMC has successfully reorganized itself into an integrated company and
while the production (mine and fertilizer) units maintain their necessary
operational and managerial autonomy, the marketing, finance, administration,
internal audit, corporate planning and budget functions are now integrated. The
company's management information systems have been improve' following the
acquisition of JFI and now form a common basis for the mining and fertilizer
units. Under the technical assistance component of the first loan, JPMC is
continuing to upgrade corporate, production, and financial planning in a
satisfactory manner.
C. Narn ower and Training
2.4     JPMC employs 4001 personnel, 397 at the Amman headquarters, 3607 in
mining, 700 at the fertilizer plant at Aqaba, 61 at the Ruseifa research center,
and 146 at Aqaba port. The table below gives a breakdown of the employee areas.

Source: JPMC Feasibility Study, November 1988.
2.5      The quality of the workforce remains high at all levels and labor
relations are good. Personnel management is centralized but the Managing
Director uses this freedom effectively and individual performance is highly
motivated at most levels. JPMC has a team of qualified and experitnced
managerial, operational and marketing personnel, engineers, technicians,
skilled and semi-skilled workers and the existing mine and fertilizer
operations are highly productive. The JPMC management and staff have quickly
and effectively adapted to the expanded company responsibilities.
2.6     JPNC has not faced difficulties in recruiting personnel at all levels
and there remains a more than adequate supply of skilled labor interested to
join the company, both those returning from the Gulf States as well as
engineers/technicians from JPMC training centers and polytechnics in Jordan.
JPMC salary levels remain competitive with commercial companies in Jordan.



-5-
2.7      Over the 10-year 1977-86 period, Jordan increased its annual phosphate
mine production at an average rate of 158 and tripled its exports of phosphate
rock (see table below). Jordan remains the fifth largest phosphate rock
producer after the USA, the USSR, Morocco, and China, and the third largest
exporter of phosphate rock after Morocco and the USA. In 1987 and 1988, Jordan
reduced its dine production in order to reduce levels of stocks (that had risen
to a level approaching 3.0 million tonnes) to manageable levels. At the same
time, Jordan increased only marginally the level of rock made available to
export markets in a successful attempt, together with other leading worldwide
phosphate rock producers, to reduce world phosphate rock overcapacity and to
strengthen international prices.

2.8     Mlnes. JPMC currently operates three open-pit mines - El Hassa, El
Abiad, and Shidiya. The production design capacities of the El Hassa and El
Abiad mines are 4.1 and 3.0 mtpy, respectively. The Shidiya mine which is
currently being implemented (Loan 2902-JO) will produce 0.30 mt phosphate rock
product in 1989, increasing to 1.00, 1.50 and 1.75 mtpy in 1990, 1991 and 1992,
respectively. This production is from the high grade 73/75 TCP1/ A2 phosphate
bed which can be marketed following simple dry screening provided under the
first loan. The design capacity of the mine is 3.23 mtpy including development
of low grade A.l and A3 ore beds which can be marketed only following wet
beneficiation (see paras. 4.11-4.17).
I/ TCP - tricalcium phosphate (equivalent to BPL - Bone Phosphate of Lime)
is equivalent to 0.46 units of P205.



- 6 -
2.9      The E1 Hassa and El Abiad mines produce two grades of rock, Standard
or S Grade (70/72 TCP- after simple screening and drying of higher quality run-
of-mine ore) and Concentrate or C Grade (73/75 TCP - a washed product from wet
beneficiation). The 1988 ratio of production was 56:44, S to C grade.
Production from the initial mining operation at Shidiya will be minimum 73/75
TCP, following dry screening.
2.10     Mining at E1 Hassa and El Abiad has traditionally been by mobile
(truck and shovel) equipment. JPMC continue to employ local contractors
effectively to supplement its own mobile equipment fleets. The overall
stripping ratio at El Hassa/El Abiad continues to deteriorate annually as
remaining ore bodies lie at greater depth. The overall stripping ratio for
operations in 1988 was 10.5 m3 of )verburden to 1 m3 of phosphate rock. To
reduce unit excavating costs, JPMC has been increasing effectively its dragline
fleet and this has not only reduced unit mine operating costs but also has
facilitated the extraction of phosphate that could not be recovered
economically with traditional mine equipment. Mining at Shidiya commenced
under the first loan in 1989, with the transfer of a small fleet of mobile
equipment from existing mines and has been progressively supplemented by mobile
and auxiliary equipment under the first loan, procurement of which is
completed. Erection of the two draglines to be financed under the first loan
and which will be the primary overburden removal equipment, commenced June 1989
and these units are expected to be in service October 1990, as scheduled.
2.11    ABenefLciatio.  At El Hassa and El Abiad, ore is trucked and conveyed
to crushing/screening stations and then conveyed to beneficiation plants.
Screened undersize (70/72 grade) is dried to produce S grade rock product.
Undersize (66/68 grade) is fed to log washers, slurrifiers and wet screens.
Undersize from the wet screens is agitated and fed to hydrocyclones, where
overflow (shimes) are rejected and underflow fed to centrifuges to produce
phosphate cake. Cake moisture is reduced by drying to produce 73/75 C grade
phosphate product. At Shidiya, A2 ROM ore is trucked to a mobile
crushing/screening plant where it is sized, producing a dry (less than 2%
moisture) minimum 73/75 rock product.
2.12     Fertilizer ODerations.  JPMC fertilizer production is located at the
Industrial Complex at Vadi AI. Aqaba. The plant was engineered and constructed
under a turnkey contract by the former Jordan Fertilizer Industries (JFI - now
absorbed by JPMC) in 1981/82. The plant was designed to produce 740,000 tpy
diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 59,000 tpy 2/ phosphoric acid for export. Plant
operations were beset by technical dlfficulties from the outset. The plant was
to consume 1.3 mtpy 73/75 phosphate rock at full production. Following the
technical difficulties, rock feed was adjusted to a mix of 70/72 and 73/75
grades. DAP is the principal fertilizer product. A small quantity of excess
phosphoric acid is exported, as is the aluminium fluoride, a process by-
product. Export levels are tabulated below.

Source. JPMC Annual Reports and 1988 Feasibility Study
2.13     The plant is currently operating at about 74* of design capacity,
compared to a typical capacity utilization of 90-95% at most worldwide
fertilizer plants. Although during initial years of operation, JFI staff were
in an unavoidable learning process in a totally new and sophisticated
industrial complex, operational and maintenance procedures are now satisfactory
and management of the plant by JPMC is efficient. Markets and marketing have
not and do not represent any limitation at projected production levels (paras.
3.4 and 3.21).
2.14     The plant continues to be constrained by technical difficulties and
deficiencies and cannot be expected to reach higher than about 75% capacity
utilization on a sustainable basis, without debottlenecking of the facility.
Technical problems are mainly concentrated in the phosphoric acid plant. This
plant is one of the largest single-train units operating in the world and has
been designed on the basis of a relatively high grade Jordanian rock feed.
Although the quality of the rock feed has been adjusted, there appears to be no
relationship between the lower quality feed and past or present low production
performance. Output limitations are principally (i) shortfalls in plant
design, which limit achievable name-plate capacity; (ii) overestimated
operating factor assumptions for the various sections of the phosphoric acid
plant; and (iii) designed inadequacies and restrictions in the plant's cooling
pond facility. The combination of these factors is the over-riding reason for
the plant's inability to reach design output levels. In particular, (i) the
reaction section is undersized; tests undertaken by JPMC indicate that the
reaction volume should be expanded by at least 80% to produce the required
amount and concentration of filter acid (on an instantaneous basis); (ii) the
intermediate filter acid storage capacity is limited , with a residence time
insufficient to permit proper acid desaturation and cooling; (iii) the
concentration section capacity is based on a high operating factor and there is
inadequate evaporative capacity to offset the low concentration of the filter
acid; (iv) the concentrated acid storage capacity is limited and the
purification process (for export acid) poses operational difficulties; and (v)
the cooling capacity of the cooling pond loop is insufficient - the pond water
return temperature is too high, restricting the condenser capacity and the
production rate.

2.15     In addition, JPNC faces certain problems in the selection of materials
and equipment. The selection of graphite block exchangers for the dilution of
sulphuric acid and for the concentration of phosphoric acid, although widely
adopted in similar plants worldwide, have not proved entirely satisfactory for
process reasons and considering the in-house capability to properly maintain
such sophisticated equipment.
2.16     The downstream DAP plant could produce at design capacity if
restrictions to phosphoric acid concentration and storage were removed. Some
mechanical improvements are necessary to reduce production costs and improve
product quality, particularly the granule size range and caking tendencies. No
problems exist in the sulphuric acid plant which appears capable to supply 110%
of design capacity.
2.17     Infrastructr. Water supply for potable and industrial use at the
three existing mines is tapped from wells and is more than adequate. Electric
power is provided from the grid of the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA). JEA
have completed installation of transmission lines to, and a sub-station at
Shidiya and the lines were energized in October 1989. Workshop and warehouse
facilitles at El Hassa and El Abiad provide comprehensive maintenance and spare
parts facilities that secure high levels of mine equipment and beneficiation
plant availability that are comparable to any international standards.
Provision for consignment stocking of mine equipment spare parts at Shidiya has
been completed and a temporary workshop has been constructed. The mines and
beneficiation plants at El Hassa and El Abiad are well connected to road and
rail transport networks to Aqaba. Th- Ministry of Public Works have completed
construction of an all weather road :rom Shidiya to the Ma'an - Saudi Arabia
Highway and planned phosphate productitn now has permanent access to the road
network to Aqaba.
E. Markets and Marketing
2.18     JPMC has its traditions as a mining company, developing phosphate
deposits for the purpose of exporting rock products to countries producing
phosphate fertilizers and requiring rock feed for their processing plants. With
the acquisition of JFI in 1985, JPMC became responsible for the production and
export of fertilizer products (primarily DAP). In volume terms, JPNC remains,
primarily, a phosphate rock export company. However, revenues from fertilizer
product and by-product sales (US$142 million gross in 1988) are now significant
compared to those from rock product sales (US$211 million gross in 1988) and
will grow in value following completion of rehabilitation of the JPMC
fertilizer plant.
2.19     JPMC has found strong markets for phosphate rock in Asia, East Europe
and the Far East, due to its geographic proximity to these markets, compared to
major competitors. Eastern Europe is the largest regional consumer of Jordan
rock, absorbing some 40% of JPMC exports (Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland, each
about 10% and Turkey 5-10%) and Asia is the second largest market, taking about
25% (India 20%, Pakistan 5%). These two regions have traditionally
represented 65-75% of Jordan's markets, with the Far East taking an additional
20-25% (Indonesia 8-10S, Taiwan, Japan, each 4-5%), (Annex 2-2). Other
consumers are on a sporadic spot market basis - the Americas (Mexico, Canada),

2.20     JPMC has traditionally shipped phosphate rock to 20-30 countries each
year. However, more than 80% of total exports are absorbed by nine countries:
India and Pakistan (Asia); Yugoslavia, Turkey, Poland, and Romania (Eastern
Europe); and Indonesia, Taiwan, and Japan (Far East). The historic imports of
Jordan rock by these countries are shown in the Table below. The overall
growth rate over the 1984-88 period has been a healthy 9.0% pa. Average annual
growth in individual country markets is strong - India (8.7%), the primary
consumer of Jordan rock, Yugoslavia (19.9%), Turkey (40.2%) and Poland (25.3%),
with demand diminishing somewhat in Pakisten. Romania and Japan. Sales in
Western Europe, an area where JPMC has no specific freight advantage, have
declined over the 1984-88 period from 10% to 5% of total JPNC exports. Sales in
the Americas, Oceania and Africa have been sporadic spot market sales of small
quantity.

2.21     Throughout the 1970's and early-mid 1980's, JPMC followed an
aggressive phosphate rock marketing policy taking advantage of geographic
position and consequent freight advantages. Within the last 1-2 years, JPMC
has recognized the benefit of Jordan developing stability in relation to the
interests of other major worldwide phosphate producers. In 1988, JPMC
implemented a more conservative marketing strategy, focusing on maintaining
market share in established markets and avoiding spot market sales, and
focusing more on overall company profitability from rock sales rather than on
export sales volume and revenue. This strategy, recognizing the position of
other producers and the world supply/demand balance, is a sensible one, and
will enable Jordan to both secure its market position and to continue its
policy of expansion in relation to the plans of its long term customers,
particularly those located in Asia and the Far East.
2.22     JPHC produce primarily DAP fertilizer at its fertilizer plant at
Aqaba, (see part 2.12). Excess phosphoric acid not required for DAP
manufacture is exported and aluminium flouride is produced from process by-
product and exported. The export of these products is nominal by world
standards and JPKC has not faced any diffictlty in penetrating export markets.
2.23     Since the acquisition of JFI, JPMC have maintained a diversified
fertilizer marketing policy with the objective of.maximizing sales revenues.
Sales have been on the basis of annual or bi-annual negotiations (India and
Saudi Arabia), international tenders (Italy and Ethiopia), and spot market. Key
DAP markets have been Asia (India and China), Europe (France and Italy), Africa
(Ethiopia) and Saudi Arabia (see Table below).

2.24     India has traditionally been a leading customer for JPMC's DAP
production due to its geographic proximity. Jordan has not sold DAP to China
since 1987 due to China's more recent purchasing policies. Saudi Arabia has
been a dedicated customer. Since the start-up of DAP manufacturing plants in
Morocco in 1988, Jordan's competitive edge in Western Europe is being eroded.
JPMC's marketing plan for DAP in 1990 includes anticipated annual contracts
with it's major long-term customers; India, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia,
expected to take 150,000, 120,000, and 100,000 tonnes respectively. JPEC
expect to be able to supply Pakistan and Italy, 100,000 and 50,000 tonnes
respectively, through international tender, and to dispose of 100,000 tonnes on
the spot market.
2.25     In addition to DAP, JPEC exports excess phosphoric acid, and aluminium
flouride (produced from the process by-product fluo-silicic acid). These
products are of nominal quantity and are exported to aluminium smelters located
in Egypt, Bahrain and Dubai. These Middle East export markets are expected to
continue to provide a profitable bonus to JPNC's fertilizer plant operation.

F. Ssctor Development
2.26     Following the acquisition of responsibility for fertilizer production
and export, JPNC appreciates that, although its traditions are as a mining
company, It now must focus on improving the vertical integration of its mining
and fertilizer operations and maximizlng the added value of its products. The
trend worldwide of major phosphate producers is to utilize low grade non-
commercial phosphate rock in fertilizer manufacture and to maximize in-country
processing of final and/or intermediate fertilizer products.
2.27     The fines content of phosphate rock produced at JPMC mines, although
*of relatively high quality, is essentially non-tradeable because its export can
create technological (fertilizer processing) and environmental problems for
customers. JPMC have undertaken bench scale and pilot plant tests to evaluate
the use of the phosphate fines in the Aqaba fertilizer plant. This research
program has produced very encouraging results. Commercial scale tests are now
being planned. JPKC has initiated a program for de-dusting of phosphate rock at
the existing mines. The collection and utilization of phosphate fines at the
Aqaba fertilizer plant will not only enhance the economics of the phosphate
sector operations, but will also substantially reduce phosphate dust pollution
at the port of Aqaba. Granulation and pelletization tests have been
successfully completed and a study of the economics of transporting and
utilizing compacted vs. noncompacted fines is now being finalized.
2.28    JPMC appreciate that as a major rock exporter and a marginal
fertilizer producer, it is not maximizing the added value of its products and
is exposed to fluctuations in fertilizer products. During the last 18-24
months, the company has been exploring options to diversify fertilizer
operations. It has discussed joint ventures with various countries including
India, Pakistan, USSR, Japan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia,
which are in various stages of negotiation. These discussions have focused on
the development of phosphoric acid facilities in Jordan to supply fertilizer
plants operated by joint venture partners. The discussions thus far anticipate
JPMC taking responsibility for manufacture of phosphoric acid (with rock feed
from JPMC mines) but as a minor shareholder In the joint venture companies to
be established. Discussions with three Indian fertilizer companies are in an
advanced stage of regotiations and the Government of India has indicated a
willingness to underwrite the phosphoric acid supply to the state companies.
Such joint ventures arrangements have the potential benefit for JPMC of a
captive market for a portion of their rock production and the benefit for the
joint venture partner of a captive and guaranteed supply of phosphoric acid at
a negotiated price, thus freeing Indian fertilizer manufacturers from reliance
on spot market purchases of phosphoric acid at prices that have historically
fluctuated widely. Another joint venture discussion foresees the option of
JPNC developing a NPK compound fertilizer plant at Aqaba, either by modifying
the existing plant or by developing a new plant adjacent to the existing
facility. This option is attractive since Jordan produces both phosphate and
potash and has access to ammonia at attractive prices. The added value would be
significant but the market for NPK is more specialized and narrow than DAP.
2.29    JPNC's sector development strategy, to increase vertical integration
of its mining and fertilizer operations and to secure additional and wider



- 13 -
markets, is sound. Potential joint venture operations with overseas customers
for the production in Jordan of intermediate or finaL fertilizer products are
particularly attractive and will be pursued vigorously by JPMC in the coming
months. Any future joint venture equity position proposed by JPMC would be
reviewed by the Bank under the investment covenant of the first loan.
G. Accounting and Artangements for Audit
2.30    JPMC's accounts are satisfactorily kept and accounting systems and
procedures of the mining and fertilizer units are fully integrated. The
company's accounting staff are qualified and bookkeeping is efficient. JPMC
produces a full set of financial statements every quarter, and the unaudited
financial statements are available 2 months after the end of each fiscal year.
The company's accounts are audited every semester by qualified external private
auditors applying internationally accepted standards. JPMC prepare unit and
consolidated accounts. Agreement was reached with JPNC during negotiations
that separate unit and consolidated company accounts will continue to be
prepared and audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and that audited
financial statements will presented to the Bank within 6 months of the end of
each fiscal year.
MII.  THE MARKET FOR PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS AND PHOSPHATE ROCK
3.1     The proposed Project will increase Jordan's phosphate rock export
capacity by 1.5 mtpy by 1996, representing less than 1.0% of projected world
rock production in that year and 3% of anticipated world trade. This
additional rock production will provide for the rock feed requirements to the
JPHC fertilizer plant at Aqaba. Additional rock exports will be absorbed by the
expanding Asian and Far Eastern markets and will partially replace closed and
depleting mines in the Oceania area. The proposed Project will also increase
export of final and intermediate fertilizer products and process by-product,
but JPMC's world market share will continue to decline and JPNC will remain a-
fertilizer exporter of nominal quantities. Phosphate rock prices are forecast
to continue to rise modestly in real terms from recent levels and fertilizer
prices are projected to decline nominally in real terms, due to the long-term
industry investment and production response to the higher fertilizer prices of
the 1988-89 period. Jordan's mine production costs are projected to remain
competitive with other phosphate rock producers. For these reasons, marketing
does not represent a major risk for the Project or JPMC as a company.
3.2      The phosphate world market is important to consideration of the
Project for three inter-related reasons. Firstly, the incremental Project
production must be readily marketable without disruption to the world market
and without major market risk. Secondly, world market projections impact the
economic justification of the Project through forecast rock and fertilizer
prices. Thirdly, projected rock and fertilizer prices affect JPMC's future
financial position and long-term viability as a company.

A. Phogshate Fertilizer World Demand/Supply
3.3      The predominant use of phosphate rock worldwide is as a raw material
input for the production of phosphate fertilizers. Accordingly, the upper
limit to the market for rock is the supply capacity of fertilizer producers.
World demand for phosphate fertilizers is projectedl/ to grow by 138 from
1987/88 to 1992/93, approxim-tely 2.6% pa, and by 8.3.6 from 1993/94 to 1997/98,
approximately 1.60 pa, somewhat slower than the annual growth of 3.2% between
1982 and 1987 (see Table below and Annex 3.1). Stagnating demand is
particularly noticeable in Western Europe, where phosphate fertilizer
consumption is expected to remain constant through 1992/93 and decrease through
1997/98, and North America, with growth of only 1.1% and 0.85% pa through
1992/93 and 1997/98, respectively. In spite of this general weakening, growth
in fertilizer demand in Jordan's natural market areas is projected to remain
strong. Demand in Asia/Far East and Eastern Europe, regions where Jordan has a
demonstrated competitive (freight) advantage, is projected to grow at a 4.5%
and 2.48 pa, respectively, over the 1988-93 period.

3.4      Phosphate fertilizer production capacity closely matched world demand
until demand-driven fertilizer price increases in 1974 induced investment in
new production capacity and resultant production overcapacity. Until the mid-
1980's fertilizer production overcapacity was of serious proportions. However,
the lack of further new investment in fertilizer production is slowly reducing
overcapacity and continueid demand growth is projected to reduce the gap from
its recent 2.9 mt (P205 equivalent) to about 1.5 mt by 1992. World supply
potential of P205 is projected to grow more slowly (1.86% p.a.) than demand
over the next five years, due to the remaining industry overcapacity. However,
fertilizer plant capacity utilization rates are expected to increase, causing
the demand for phosphate rock to grow faster than the rate of growth of supply
potential. The geographical distribution of increased demand for phosphate

fertllizer is mainly towards the developing countries where fertilizer
application rates are still relatively low and agriculture is an important
growth activity (Annex 3-1). It is projected that necessary agricultural
growth will require sustained increases in fertilizer consumption especlally in
Asia and the Far East (particularly India, Pakistan, and Indonesia) where
Jordan is well situated geographically to take advantage of freight rate
differentials.
B. World Phosnhate Rock Demand/Sunuly and World Trade
3.5     The production and supply of phosphate rock depends on (i) the demand
for phosphate fertilizers, (Li) mine capacity and (iii) mine exploitation
rates. The amount of phosphate rock supplied for export depends on the total
production of rock and the degree of processing done in the country of origin
(domestic consumption). Although thie trend among worldwide phosphate producers
is to develop in-country fertilizer process plants to maximize value-added,
JPNC currently exports the majority of its phosphate rock production because of
its traditions as a mining company and its historical base of established
relationships with fertilizer manufacturers.
3.6      Demand for phosphate rock is forecast to grow at approximately the
same rate (2.7% pa) as the demand for phosphate fertilizers, increasing by 57
million tonnes during the period 1988-2000 (see Annex 3.2).
3.7      Forecasts of rock supply (see Table below and Annex 3.3) project rock
production growing also at 2.7% pa, somewhat slower than the annual growth rate
from 1970-87 of 3.6%, but recovering from the production stagnation in 1985 and
1986. A significant proportion of the expected growth in rock production is to
feed expanding domestic fertilizer industries in countries such as Morocco,
China, and the US. Rock production capacities are forecast to diminish in
certain countries; production has already ceased in Christmas Island and the
mines in Nauru are expected to be depleted by the mid-1990s. In the US. the
high production costs of new mines are expected to inhibit the creation of new
capacity at prices near or below their current levels and the depletion of
existing mines is expected to begin to reduce U.S. capacity by 1995. Rock
production at the Soviet Union's northern mines is expected to diminish.

3.8      The major worldwide phosphate rock producers are planning varying
levels of expansion in phosphate mine capacity over the coming years, notably:
(a)   Soviet Union. In recent years, the USSR has exported quantities
of phosphate rock to Eastern Europe and imported phosphate fertilizers.
However, indications are that the level of exports will be reduced in favor of
domestic consumption. Total phosphate rock production is projected to increase
by 5 mpty by 1995;
(b)   China.  China has plans to be self sufficient in phosphate rock
production by the year 2000 and has several large mines under plan that would
increase their production capacity to 16 mtpy in 1995, an increase of about 4
mtpy;
(c)  Moroccg.  The output of Moroccan mines is expected to grow by 10
mtpy by 1995 to provide raw material input to fertilizer plants being developed
and planned; and
(d)   Latin America.   Brazil and less significant Latin American
producers (Peru, Mexico) have plans to increase rock production for an overall
1-2 mtpy regional production increase.
3.9      World trade in phosphate rock is essentially influenced by phosphate
fertilizer producers without, or with inadequate domestic phosphate rock
supply. The trend of worldwide phosphate rock producers to process
domestically to increase value-added content, although temporarily arrested in
the mid-1980's due to falling fertilizer prices, is expected to continue.
Demand for phosphate rock imports is projected&/ to increase by 9.2 mt during
the period 1988-2000, a growth rate of 1.6% pa.

C. Phoa_hte Rock and Fertilizer Prices
3.10     Phosghate Rock.  The price for phosphate rock relative to overall
price of manufactured goods has been on a gentle long term decline since 1960
except for brief price increases in 1974-76 and 1980-81 (Annex 3-4). The long
term floor of prices has been set by marginal production costs in the U.S. and
fluctuations above that level determined by specific market conditions.
3.11     In 1987, phosphate rock prices in real terms were at their lowest
level since 1960 having fallen progressively since the brief recoveries in
1974-76 and in 1981. Through 1988 and the first quarter of 1989, strong
increases in demand left the market sufficiently tight to allow price increases
of about US$5-10 per tonne that elevated the FOB Casablanca price of Moroccan
rock to in excess of US$41 per tonne. Major inventory (phosphate rock
stockpile) reductions at several large US mines allowed deliveries to exceed
production in 1988 by several million tons. Prices are expected to continue to
remain strong in the short-term as demand appears to be robust and supply
conditions are expected to remain tight in some of the major producer countries
(USSR, China). Over the long-term, real prices are projected to increase
nominally at about 0.6% pa, 1991-95, and 0.5% pa, 1996-2000. These price
forecasts are based on conservative assumptions and actual export prices
realized by JPNC during 1989, and are lower than those forecast by the Bank
(see Annex 3-4, pages 67-68).

3.12     Jordan has traditionally captured a price premium for its export rock
due to its relatively high quality (TCP grade and low level of rock impurities)
and consequent operating cost savings available to phosphate fertilizer
producers. FOB Aqaba prices have exceeded FOB Casablanca prices, in some
instances. The beneficiation plant component of the Project will produce two
rock products, one of which will be an exceptionally high 75/77 grade that will
command a price premium.
3.13     Fertilizers.  Although historically subject to short-term cyclic
fluctuations, phosphate fertilizer prices declined progressively 1980-86, for
example, DAP fell from US$213 to US$130 per tonne over that period, a decline
of 61%, in constant terms. Due primarily to strong US demand and reduced
exports, prices increased strongly in real terms from 1987. In early 1989,
bulk DAP was selling at a price US$215 per tonne (FOB Aqaba), but fell under
short-term fluctuations to US$165 per tonne in mid-1989. Phosphoric acid prices
jumped as high as US$480 per tonne in some markets in mid-1989. The general
upward trend in fertilizer prices should increase the fertilizer capacity

utilization in the short-term, and hence the near-term demand for phosphate
rock. In the longer term, phosphate fertilizer prices are projected to
decrease at 0.1% pa, 1991-95 and 0.7% pa, 1996-2000.
D. The Market for Jordanian Phospbate Rock and Fertilizer
3.14     Phosnhate rock.  Jordan's rock exports have increased progressively
since the middle 70's, ia spite of generally stagnant global market conditions.
Through competitive marketing and pricing strategies Jordan's exports grew at
an average 13% pa from 1975 to 1988. Jordan managed to significantly increase
its share of world phosphate rock exports from 2.5' in 1975 to 13.8% in 1988.

3.15     Cash operatLig costs at the existing phosphate mines in Jordan are in
the same range (US$15-20 per tonne FOB basis) as the major high-volume, low-
cost phosphate export competitors, Morocco and the US. As existing higher cost
mines (El Hassa and El Abiad) are phased out over the coming 15 years and
replaced by successive developments at Shidiya, cash operating costs at JPMC
mines will approach the lowest worldwide. However, the new Shidiya mine and
beneficiation plant developmbnts will bear relatively high capital recovery
factors and production costs are expected to remain competitive with other low-
cost producers worldwide.
3.16     Because of its geographic location, Jordan has significant freight
advantage in relation to its competitors, for rock exports to expanding
phosphate fertilizer regions and countries - Asia (India), the Far East
(Indonesia), and to a lesser extent, Eastern Europe (Yugoslavia and Turkey).
Following recent increases in freight rates, Jordan currently hias a freight
advantage of a minimum US$10 per tonne into India and many areas of the Far
East and is competitive with Morocco into certain Eastern European markets.
Jordan has priced its rock exports essentially on a net-back basis, sharing any
freight advantage with its customer (importer) and has been able to place its
rock on a CIF basis competitively with the next best placed rock producer.
3.17     Jordan currently captures only 30% of the total Asian and Far Eastern
market, 19% of imports into East Europe, and remains a minor source of imports
to Western European, Latin American, and some Far Eastern markets. Into South
Asia, Jordan's share was 60%, but was only 19% into the Far Eastern market.
Jordan captures a relatively large share of only three Eastern European
countries - Poland (26%), Romania (20%), and Yugoslavia (41%). Jordan relies



- i9 -
on the requirements of its long-term customers in nine countries (para. 2.20
and Annex 2-2), which absorb 858 of rock exports. In 1988, domestic rock
delivered to the Aqaba fertillzer plant reached 1.0 mtpy. Following completion
of the fertilizer plant component of the Project, rock feed requirements will
increase to 1.4 mpty starting 1994.
3.18     The potential demand for Jordanian rock has been calculated on a
conservative basis. The market shares of 1987, on a country by country basis,
are extrapolated (Annex 3-5) and forecasts of total imports by importing
country were used to derive export figures for individual rock producers. In
contrast to historically robust growth, projected changes in Jordan's market
share have been conservatively assumed to result only from the differences in
demand growth rates between regions and from the anticipated reductions in
exports of Nauru and the USSR. Existing rock exporting countries suffer no
erosion in market share. In this market scenario, expected demand for
Jordanian rock is in line with JPMC's export forecasts. The strong growth
pattern stems principally from the fact that (i) the markets in which Jordan
has a clear competitive advantage (India, Pakistan, Indonesia) have the
strongest expected growth of demand over the next five to ten years (Armnex
3-6), and (ii) the continued decline in rock production in Oceania will open
potential new markets for Jordanian phosphate rock.

Source: Bank estimates and JPMC Production/Export Plan
3.19     The above potential demand is conservative for several reasons:
(i) Jordan is assumed to capture only slightly larger shares of th,%
increased demand projected in Oceania and Eastern Europe; the potential
market substantially exceeds the export forecasts; (ii) Jordan's market
share, which has been increasing annually in various major markets, is
assumed to be limited to 1987 market shares; (iii) JPKC is actively
exploring joint venture fertilizer plant development schemes with various
countries (para. 2.28) that would require Jordanian rock feed; and (iv) all
other major exporters (with the exception of Nauru and the USSk) increase
exports with the projected market increases, even though some major
producers are expected to maintain, or decrease their export levels over
the coming years.
3.20     Predictions in the worldwide phosphate rock market are necessarily
tentative but the conservative potential demand forecast indicates that the
marketing of the additional 1.5 mtpy phosphate rock product from the



- 20 -
beneficiation plant component of the Project presents no major risk. Even
under conservative assumptions, the incremental rock production can be
absorbed without either destabilizing international phosphate market prices
or impacting other producers' marketing plans.
3.21     Phosphate Fertilizers. Jordan's position in world markets as a
supplier of fertilizer products is relatively insignificant (less than 2%
of world demand in 1988), and even following rehabilitation of the Aqaba
fertilizer plant, Jordan's market share will continue to decline. Jordan's
market share would grow slightly, in the event that fertilizer plant joint
venture discussions with one or more countries are successful and new
fertilizer plant capacity is developed in the mid-1990's. However, such
joint venture discussions anticipate captive rock supply, and there would
be, therefore, no disruption to the production plans of existing producers.
IV. THE PROJECT - INTEGRATED PHOSPHATE
A. Project Objectives
4.1      The proposed project is a second step in the development of the Shidiya
phosphate deposit which within the next 15 years will most probably be Jordan's
only productive mining aiea, as economically recoverable phosphate reserves at
existing mines become exhausted. The project will provide relatively complex
beneficlation facilities that can be later replicated to process other low grade
phosphate ore that will need to be exploited in future development phases at
Shidiya, and possibly elsewhere in Jordan. In addition, the project will
rehabilitate the existing fertilizer plant at Aqaba, enabling JPMC not only to
reach, but marginally exceed the original fertilizer plant production
objectives, thus enhancing the sector configuration.
4.2      The Project's primary objectives are (i) to aevelop phosphate
beneficiation (washing and flotation) plant facilities of capacity 1.5 mtpy rock
products, which together with rock production planned from the Shidiya Phosphate
Mine Project (Loan 2902 JO), currently under implementation, will generate 3.23
mtpy phosphate rock product by 1995 and (ii) to rehabilitate the fertilizer
plant at Aqaba and raise the levels of fertilizer exports to 740,000 tonnes DAP
and 59,000 tomes phosphoric acid. The project benef'ciation component will
contribute to offset the progressive decline in rock production from the
existing El Hassa and El Abiad mines and will provide additional rock feed
requirements of the JPNC fertilizer plant, following rehabilitation and
expansion.
B. Phasing of Shidiya Development and Sector Strategy
4.3      The phosphate sector strategy, of which the proposed project is an
integral part, is to progressively develop the Shidiya deposit to (i) compensate
for progressive decrease in production from existing mines; (ii) provide
additional rock feed to the Aqaba fertilizer plant following rehabilitation and
expansion; and (iii) to increase export levels of phosphate rock and fertilizer



- 21 -
products. Phosphate rock production at the El Hassa and El Abiad mines cannot
be sustained at current levels beyond 1992 due to the limited nature of
remaining reserves that can be recovered economically. Reserves are expected to
be exhaubted at El Abiad and at El Hassa wlthln the next 15-year period. The
implementation of the project's beneficiation component will support the
necessary production expansion at Shidiya as a replacement for production at
existing mines. The additional phosphate rock production will support also the
additional phosphate rock feed requirements of JPNC's fertilizer plant,
following completion of rehabilitation and expansion under the project in 1993
(see para. 4.19). Phosphate rock exports will be progressively increased to 7.0
st.py by 1994, a relatively nominal increase of 1.2 mtpy compared to the 1988
export level, requiring a growth of 3% pa. This strategy is presented in
tabular form at Annex 4-1.
4.4      JPEC recognize that thte configuration of their mining and fertilizer
operations is unusual because of their traditions as a mining company, and that
these operations are not sufficiently vertically integrated. Leading
competitors worldwide process, domestically, a much higher proportion of rock
(50% in Morocco, 75% in Tunisia, compared to 18% in Jordan), utilizing low-grade
rock production. JPMC appreciate that they are not capturing the potential
higher added value of fertilizer processing, that they have limited flexibility
in terms of output mix to adapt to changing market conditions, and that they are
rather fragile in terms of production margin in fertilizer products. As a
result, JPNC has initiated discussions with various countries (para 2.28)
regtrding development of joint venture fertilizer plant operations. Feed to such
joint venture plants would require further expansion of operations at Shidiya.
The more ambitious production plan and sector strategy associated with this
increased domestic production of fertilizer products is presented in tabular
form at AnMnoA.J.
C. Proiect Description
4.5      The principal featurec of the proposed project are:
(i)  turnkey engineering, procurement, construction, and
commissioning of a beneficiation plant with an output capacity
of 1.5 mtpy, consisting of dry sreening plant, washing plant
(scrubbers, hydrocyclones, screens, storage tanks, and clay
thickeners), flotation plant (hydrocyclones, hydraulic sizers,
reagent conditioners, flotation cells, and product filters),
dryers, and inter-connecting belt conveyor systems;
(ii)  turnkey engineering, procurement, construction, and
commissioning of phosphate ore and product handling, storage,
reclaim and loading facilities;
(iii)  engineering, procurement, and construction of supporting
infrastructure including power distribution, water supply,
workshops, warehouses, and offices to serve the beneficiation
plant;



- 22 -
(iv) expansion of the Shidiya townsite with necessary utilities; and
(v) turnkey engineering, procurement, construction, and
commissioning to rehabilitate and expand the existing
fertilizer plant at Aqaba.
D. Detailed Features
1. Beneficiation Plant.
4.6       Location. The location of the Shidiya phosphate area, climatic
conditions, and details regarding the absence of population, vegetation, and
water courses, have been described previously. Alternative locations for the
proposed beneficiation plant have been considered with due regard to the
location of the adjacent mine area, transport facilities, the project townsite,
and economically recoverable phosphate reserves in the area.
4.7     Or Reserves. During project preparation for the first loan,
extensive phosphate reserves were identified in the lower grade Al and A3 ore
beds, in addition to those in the high grade A2 ore bed which are currently
being exploited under the first loan. In situ reserves are more than adequate
to assure planned production from the beneficiation plant component of the
Project, for in excess of 20 years.
4.8      Mie Developm   . Mining equipment procured under the first loan was
sized to permit overburden removal and extraction of high and lower grade ore
beds. Refinement of mine planning has identified that phasing of mine
development requires A2 ore production to reach and maintain 1.75 mtpy to
permit 1.5 mtpy combined production of Al and A3 rock products.
4.9      Exploration and Research.  Extensive sampling of the phosphate ore
beds has been undertaken during successive exploration campaigns. Within the
project area, 450 boreholes have been drilled, 82 pits (1.25 m diameter) have
been dug, and 2 trial cuts and the mine opening cut have been excavated.
Extensive bench scale tests have been completed and physical, chemical, and
metallurgical ore properties identified. The trial and mine cuts provided
several hundred tonnes of phosphate ore for pilot plant evaluation. This
research has confirmed that Al rock products (0.82 mtpy 68/70 grade) can be
produced by washing and A3 rock products (0.66 mtpy 75/77 grade) can be
produced by washing and flotation, utilizing conventional beneficiation
technology. The table below highlights the ore reserves and the results of the
research in terms of rock product recovery factors, quantities, and grade. The
suitability for fertilizer manufacture of Al and A3 rock products from
beneficiation has been successfully damonstrated by evaluation of pilot plant
samples at international laboratories.

4.10     Process Selection.  At the conclusion of feasibility work undertaken
by project consultants in 1987, preliminary beneficiation plant criteria and a
flowsheet were developed. Pilot plant tests demonstrated the suitability of
the flowsheet. Howsver, JPMC subsequently undertook additional studies, ore
sampling, and bench scale and pilot plant tests to investigate options to
simplify the flowsheet, to optimize plant design criteria and to establish a
commercial appreciation of the response of A3 ore to flotation. Plant design
criteria have been refined following th.ts additional sampling and test program.
The criteria developed are necessarily couservative to ensure that projected
plant outputs (product quantities and grades) can be achieved and sustained,
bearing in mind the variability of RON ore grade and washing and flotation
response. The TCP and weight balance, and water/solids flow diagrams developed
are at Annexes 4-2 and 4-3. JPMC are continuing with further sampling and
pilot plant testwork to generate additional data to facilitate detailed
engineering by prospective turnkey contractors.

diagramatic form at Annex 4-4, Plant Flow Diagram, and at Annex 4-5, Plant
Arrangement Drawing. The process encompasses a scalping station adjacent to
the mine to remove oversize boulders from the RON ore; a dry screening plant to
remove coarse oversize; a washing plant to remove fine oversize and clay slimes
and to produce both an Al rock product (68/70 TCP) and an A3 washed product for
feed to a flotation plant, which will remove silica sand to produce an A3 rock
product (75/77 TCP). The details of the process are set out below (paras. 4.12
- 4.19).
4.12     Scalping Stations.  Phosphate ore from the mine will be hauled to two
scalping stations (one for each of the East and West phosphate mine extraction
areas) immediately adjacent to the mine, where large boulders of indurated
marly ore, chert, and limestone will be removed as 250 mm. oversize. The minus
250 mm. screened ore will be conveyed to stockpiles, according to ore
character.  Five stockriles will be developed to separate Al ores with high and
low CaO/P205 ratio, A2 ore with high and low chlorine content, and A3 ore. The
combined active storage capacity of 65,000 t will complement the sel"c'tive
mining operation to ensure a homogeneous ore character for further processing.
4.13     Dry Screening Plant.  Scalped ore will be recovered via reclaim
tunnels and conveyed 3.0 km. to a high capacity screening plant. The plant
will reject plus 12.5 mm. oversize as waste for all ores. A2 ore will be



- 24 -
further screened at 6 m. to produce a final 73/75 phosphate rock product for
direct shipment to export, as envisaged under the first loan. Four minus 12.5
mm. screened ore stockpiles of individual capacity 13,000 t will be created to
facilitate interim blending, two for Al ore and two for A3 ore.
4.14     A2 screened ore will be conveyed to four (10,000 t) product storage
concrete silos. Facilities will be provided to accommodate both high grade A2
oversize and A2 product with high (plus 3%) moisture. High grade oversize will
be crushed and screened to selectively recover softer high grade A2 portion and
A2 ore containing excess moisture will be dried.
4.15    Washing Plant. Dry screened ore will be reclaimed by conveyor from
the stockpiles and fed to washing plant feed bins. The washing plant will have
four parallel lines, two each for Al and A3 ore where the ore will be scrubbed,
screened, rinsed, and deslimed to produce a minus 1 mm. plus 40 microns
product. Feed from the storage bins will be passed, at a controlled rate, into
drum scrubbers, where with the addition of water, sticky clay lumps will be
broken down and harder particles attrition scrubbed (polished). Drum scrubber
discharge will be screened at 5 mm and at 1 m. The Al ore will be rinsed
(deslimed) to produce commercial grade minus 1 mm. plus 40 microns 68/70 TCP
rock product and conveyed to 30,000 T wet rock product storage piles.
4.16     The minus 5 m  A3 ore will pass through additional attrition
scrubbing. The minus 5 mm plus 1 mm A3 ore (approximately 40% TCP) is rejected
to waste. The minus 1 mm plus 40 microns A3 ore will be pumped to hydraulic
sizers that will produce coarse (plus 0.6 mm) and fine (minus 0.6 mm) flotation
feeds.
4.17     Flotation Plant. The coarse and fine A3 ore (flotation feeds) will be
pumped from the hydraulic sizers to two 2,000 t slurry storage bins as feed for
final processing by flotation. The flotation feed will be thickened through
hydrocyclones and coated with reagents in conditioning (mixing) units. The
flotation feed will be discharged into rougher flotation cells which will float
phosphate particles. Additional cleaning cells will be provided to further
upgrade the concentrates to produce a 75/77 TCP phosphate rock product.
Dewatering will be by belt filters and conveyed to wet rock product storage
(30,000 t) piles, along-side the Al wet storage piles (para. 4.12).
4.18     Drving  Plan. Rock product from the Al and A3 storage piles will be
recovered from stockpiles by drag reclaimer and fed to rotary dryers to produce
final rock products with less than 3% moisture.
4.19     Uaste Disposal. Oversize products and reject (silica sand) from
flotation will be conveyed to nearby waste disposal areas. Clay slimes waste
from the washing plant will be pumped to thickeners to recover a substantial
portion of the water content for reuse in the plant and the thickened clay will
be pumped to a slimes disposal area located 17 kms. from the beneficiation
plant (see also para. 4.36).

2. Fertilizer Plant Rehabilitation
4.20     The existing fertilizer plant at Aqaba will be rehabilitated under a
turnkey contract covering detailed engineering, procurement of equipment and
materials, and construction. The rehabilitation will involve debottlenecking
of the phosphoric acid plant (reaction/filtration and concentration sections),
expansion of acid storage facilities, modification of industrial water cooling
facilities, modifications to the DAP plant, and other minor improvements. The
rehabilitation will increase effective phosphoric acid production from its
current level of 303,000 tpy to 414,000 tpy starting 1994. Capacity utilization
of the phosphoric acid unit is forecast to rise from 74% of current design
capacity (412,000 tpy P205) to 92% of future design capacity (450,000 tpy). DAP
production will increase from 633,000 tpy to 740,000 tpy. The lncreased
phosphoric acid surplus production will be exported.
4.21       actign/F[tration. Rehabilitation of this section of the phosphoric
acid plant will involve reaction volume expansion and the installation of
additional surface or vacuum coolers to enable a production of 450,000 tpy P205
as acid at 28% concentration. P205 recovery (rock to filter acid) would
increase from 94.0% to 95.5%. Specific consumption requirements of phosphate
rock and sulphuric acid would be decreased by approximately 0.5% and 1.5%,
respectively. Filter acid storage facilities would be increased to permit acid
cooling down to 45-500 C.
4.22    ,Acd ConcentratLo. Rehabilitation of this section of the phosphoric
acid plant will involve adding a fourth concentration line, rearranging the
sequencing of the concentration phases, and replacing the existing graphite
carbon block exchangers with shell-and-tube exchangers. The revamped section
will have capacity to produce 450,000 tpy P205 as phosphoric acid at 54%
concentration. Concentrated acid storage will be expanded from 12,000 to
22.000 m3 capacity to permit high operational flexibility ln the downstream DAP
plant, and to facilitate shipment of excess phosphoric acid in sizeable
tankers.
4.23     Coolin  Pond System. The industrial water cooling system of the
phosphoric acid plant will be radically upgraded. A cooling tower will be
constructed to facilitate effective cooling in the fertilizer plant. The
existing cooling pond will be by-passed.
4.24    DAP Plant. Modifications to the DAP plant will be undertaken to
upgrade the product screen size, to improve cooler effectiveness and to add a
DAP coating unit.
4.25     Other minor process and mechanical modifications will be implemented
to enhance smooth operation and maintenance of the fertilizer plant complex.
3. Infrastructure Development at Shidiys
4.26     RoAds. The project area has been connected to the Ma'an-Saudia Arabia
highway by a 25 km road constructed by the Ministry of Public Works. JPMC plan
to contract trucks to transport phosphate rock products to Aqaba due to the



- 26 -
rail capacity limitations (see paras. 5.1-5.2). An inter-ministerial Committee
is currently reviewing options to transfer responsibility for the operatLon of
the ARC to JPHC (see para. 5.4) and the Ministry of Planning is investigating
the economics of developing a new road which will pass Shidiya and connect to
Aqaba via Disi. The optimal longer-term transport route and mode for project
phosphate output is being discussed through ongoing dialogue with the
Government and will be addressed through the proposed Transport III project,
tentatively scheduled for Board consideration March 1991. For project analysis,
transport of phosphate products by road, via Ma'an, to Aqaba, has been
considered as a worst case assumption.
4.27     Electricity Supuly.  The total power requirement for the development
at Shidiya is 35 MW, 15 MW for the beneficiation plant, 12 KW for the minesite
2 MW for the townsite, and 6 MW for the water wells. Under the first loan,
JPMC signed an agreement with JEA to provide these power requirements.
Necessary modifications to the Ma'an sub-station have been completed, a 55 km.
132 kv overhead transmission line from Ma'an to Shidiya has been installed and
energized, and construction of the Shidiya transformer sub-station is complete,
providing 2 x 40 NW, one unit being available on standby. JPMC are
progressively implementing the necessary 33 kv (underground feeder lines)
distribution systems.
4.28     Telecomomications. Project requirements at Shidiya will be 400
direct exchange lines. A contract for the supply and supervision of
installation of an electronic digital exchange, including necessary ancillary
equipment, was awarded by JPMC in August 1988. External telephone link with
Ma'an will be by IPCM system with minimum 30 channels. An agreement with the
Jordan Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) is being prepared in this respect.
During the construction period, the existing VHF transmitter/receiver will be
supplemented by direct microwave telephone to facilitate communications between
Shidiya-El Hassa/El Abiad/Ma'an/Amman.
4.29     Water SuL.l.  Annual demand for water for industrial use at the
beneficiation plant is conservatively estimated at 4,700,000 m3 based on
maximum plant design values. Detailed hydrological investigations undertaken
by international consultants indicate that the Amman-Wadi Sir aquifer, located
23 km. north of the plant can supply not only the requirements of the
beneficiation plant but also future expansions at Shidiya. The hydrological
studies indicate that the aquifer recharge is 2.1 million m3 per annum and may
reach 3.5 million m3 per annum. Gross aquifer volume is estimated at 16.64
billion m3 of which 500 million m3 is considered readily available for
abstraction for Shidiya development phases. JPMC will drill 12 wells, 2 for
standby/reserve purposes, to intersect the aquifer. The total yield capacity
of the wells will be 24,000 m3 per day, well in excess of requirements. Tests
have confirmed that the water quality does not need treatment for industrial or
potable use. However, for potable use, the water will be treated in first and
second stage aeration tanks, and chlorinated if necessary.
4.30     Well water extraction will be by 12 pumps (28 litres/second) at an
average head of 275 m. The water will be pumped to Shidiya via a 600 mm.
pipeline to storage reservoirs. During the construction period, water will be
trucked from two existing wells and JPMC have already completed an access road



- 27 -
and an elevated water storage reservoir for this purpose, which is currently
serving mine development under the first loan. JPMC have signed a contract for
the installation of overhead transmission lines to the well sites and this work
is planned for completion January 1990, well ahead of schedule requirements.
4.31     Z91=i1te. Townsite development was initiated under the first loan to
provide for requirements of the mine development. Under the project, the
townsite will be expanded to cater for the requirements of the beneficiation
plant. Initially, construction will focus on development of single-status
accommodations to service personnel involved in the construction and for
expatriate staff. The previous policy of developing family-status blocks for
the longer-term will be continued. Under the project, 70 housing blocks with
420 individual flats will be developed. A local contractor has been in place
since September 1988 and is constructing units of a high quality by any
international standards. A town center development is included in the townsite
plan and will provide mosque, retail shops, multi-purpose center, canteens, a
clinic, and sports club and facilities. The townsite development encompasses
necessary roads, streets, water supply and distribution, sewage and rainwater
network, irrigation, electricity, lighting, and telephones. The townsite
layout has been adjusted following Bank recommendations to fit a long-term
development plan to reduce land use for roads, parking and to minimize townsite
infrastructure costs.
4. Manwer.
4.32     The manpower requirements of the project, including the requirements
for the mine development under the first loan) will be 1100 in an average year,
at full production. Recruitment has already been initiated for the mine
development and reached 393 persons at end-September 1989. Total manpower
requirements in the years 1989, 1990, and 1991 is expected to be 490, 750, and
1000 respectively. JPMC has already recruited experienced personnel from its
existing operations for management and skilled/semi-skilled levels at Shidiya.
Through the project construction period and initial beneficiation plant
operations, recruitment will continue progressively. JPMC face no difficulty
to recruit high calibre personnel. Salaries and fringe benefits are attractive
by Jordanian private sector standards. With the closure of Ruseifa mine, and
the planned phasing out of El Hassa and El Abiad mines starting in the mid-
1990's, JPMC have highly experienced and qualified personnel at all levels who
are, or will be available to join the expanding Shidiya operation. In
addition, excellent and established on-the-job training facilities exist in the
company. JPMC plan to recruit annual personnel requirements well ahead of
needs for appropriate orientation and training in existing mines. All project
equipment contracts will make provision for extensive training to be supplied
by suppliers and turnkev contractors. The technology to be used under the
project beneficiation component is in use at existing mines (with the exception
of flotation technology) and as a consequence new training will be limited to
flotation training by turnkey contractors and by overseas training.
4.33     Following rehabilitation and expansion of the fertilizer plant at
Aqaba, no additional manpower will be required; necessary training of existing
plant personnel will be provided by the rehabilitation turnkey contractor.

5. Envronmeta Ioacts
4.34     During appraisal of the first loan and of the Project, potential
environmental impacts relating to successive developments at Shidiya and at the
fertilizer plant at Aqaba were reviewed by environmental specialists.
Potential impacts considered were (i) environmental considerations to be
incorporated into the beneflication plant, (il) original environmental
provisions at the fertilizer plant, and monitoring of the environment and of
occupational health and safety. (LiL) dust emissions at Aqaba port, (iv)
environmental aspects of phosphate truck transport, and (v) environmental
aspects of the Shidiya townsite development.
4.35     Shidiya is in a barren desert region which is devoid of sedentary
population, vegetation, and water courses. No resettlement issue arises. The
region is part of a desert area that extends into Saudi Arabia covering
thousands of square kilometers. The area is traversed periodically by nomadlc
tribes and their sheep herds and project development will provide a source of
water and supplies to tribes people and a source of possible employment.
Wildlife ln the region is essentially non-existent. The fertilizer plant
component of the Project involves rehabilitation of an existing plant and no
resettlement issue arises.
4.36     Sat. The design of the beneficiation plant
has taken full account of the need to limit dust emissions, ,:ecover fine
particles, and dispose of slimes and effluents. All vibrating equipment,
screens, reclaimers, conveyors and conveyor transfer/discharge points will be
enclosed; conveyor speeds will be kept low (2.0 m/s); dust collection devices
will be an integral part of procuremuent packages for reclaimers, transfer
towers, silos, and drying kllns; and rail and truck loading facilities will be
specifically designed to minimsze dust emissions. Fugitive dust from
stockpiles Is not easy to control but, stockpiles have been located such that
any airborne dust will he carried away from the operating and residential
areas. Agreement was reached with JPMC during negotlations that JPMC will
enforce and monitor the same occunational health and safety standards at the
beneficiation plant as are in place at existing beneficiation plants, which
have been reviewed and found to be satisfactory.
4.37     Slimes from the flotation plant will be pumped 17 km. and discharged
into a natural, and totally barren, depression to the south-east of the project
area. The slimes will dry quickly in the ambient temperatures of the desert
area and the flocculents (polyacrylamides, sodium silicate and tall oil) mixed
with the phosphate rejects and clay particles will be absorbed by the
agglomerated solid particles and are biodegradable.
4.38     Agaba Fertilizer Plant. The existing plant was engineered to very
stringent emission and effluent criteria, based on EPA standards. Few plants
exist worldwide of this size with the same high level of environmental
protection provisions. The impact of the plant on the environment is minimal
and no improvements are considered necessary. Specific environmental
protection provisions include (i) dry discharge of phosphogypsum in a
controlled landfill 2 km from the plant; (ii) a high degree of water reuse
involving a system of interconnected close loops, eliminating industrial water



- 29 -
effluent discharge to the Gulf of Aqaba; (iii) a sea water loop designed to
permit a maximu temperature rise of 100 C between see water temperature and
returning sea water flow; (iv) a fluorine abatement unit, which reduces gaseous
emissions in the phosphoric acid plant to below 10 grams fluorine per tonne
P205; recovered fluorine is processed in the plant into aluminium fluoride for
export as a by-product; (v) a double conversion/absorption sulphuric acid plant
which, under normal atmospheric conditlons, limits S02 pollution in compliance
with EPA emission standards; and (vi) a DAP dust scrubbing system, which limits
the maximum dust content of air exhaust to 35 ug/m3 at normal operating
conditions. JPHC continously monitor environmental and occupational health and
safety provisions at the plant. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
JPMC will continue to enforce and monitor the environmental and occupational
health and safety standards at the plant, to ensure that the standards are
maintained in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
4.39    Aqaba Port. Under the first loan, the environmental issue of airborne
dust generated during the loadlng and unloading of phosphate was addressed and
actions agreed to monitor dust emissions and implement a program to reduce the
emissions to internationally acceptable levels by 1991. Consultants have been
hired, to terms of reference and conditions acceptable to the Bank, and
equipment procured, to monitor dust emissions as an i'rItl1P !nvestigatory step
in the program. Following physical research into increased vertical
integration of its mining and fertilizer operations, JPMC has initiated an
Action Plan to collect phosphate fines at its mines and to utilize those fines
in the Aqaba fertilizer plant. Research into the most economic method of
transporting and utilizing these phosphate fines will be completed by January
1990. The Action Plan program will not only assist to ensure the satlsfactory
environmental position at Aqaba port but will also improve the overall economic
configuration of the phosphate industry in Jordan. The relevant supplementary
letter under the first loan has been modified to embody the JPIC Action Plan to
collect fines at the mines and at the port site. JPMC are in full compliance
wLth the schedule embodied in the revised supplementary letter. Further
actions in relation to the environmental issue at Aqaba are, therefore, not
required under this Project.
4.40     Truck Transgort. Phosphate rock is transported to Aqaba by covered
trucks and in container trucks, effectively minimizing dust emission in
transit. Truck traffic bypasses the town of Aqaba.
4.41     Shidiya Townaite. Sewage from housing units will be collected and,
together with other waste effluents from the townsite, will be fed to a lagoon,
the location of which has been fixed with due consideration to Project
installation and wind direction. The lagoon system of waste treatment is
satisfactory in such a hot and arid climate.
4.42     Based on the above assessments, no serious environmental impacts or
worker hazards are expected to result from the Project.



- 30 -
6. Technical Assistance.
4.43     Under the first loan, extensive technical assistance is being provided
in a variety of technical, financial and institutional areas including
assistance with preliminary engineering and bid document preparation for the
second Project.
4.44     Specific technical assistance under the Project is limited to the
retention of Project Hanagement Advisors to assist with the implementation of
the turnkey fertilizer plant rehabilitation contract. An international
construction management company, Davy McKee, was commissioned by JPHC in 1988
to assist to define technical components of the proposed plant rehabilitation:
to prepare shortlists of eligible companies; to evaluate bids received; and to
assist in contract negotiations. JPKC are negotiating an extension to this
contract to provide for assistance under the Project to review detailed
engineering and design; oversee and expedite procurement; inspect the turnkey
contractor's design and fabrication work; to supervise the turnkey contract and
commissioning; and to provide on-the-job training to JPKC staff.
7. Prolct CosUt.
4.45     The estimated financing required for the Project is US$161.7 million
(JD105.1 million), including physical and price contingencies, working capital
and interest during construction, as summarized below. The base cost estimate
is in October 1989 prices. Physical contingencies for the beneficiation
component of the Project are calculated at 10% for foreign costs and at 5% for
local costs reflecting JPMC's extensive recent experience with local
contracting and the lower level of certainty regarding off-shore equipment
costs. Physical contingencies of 10% for local costs and 15% for foreign costs
have been applied to the fertilizer rehabilitation component of the project
reflecting the higher level of uncertainty regarding estimates of that turnkey
contract cost. Price escalation for the beneficiation component of the Project
has been based on the phasing of commitments and expenditures consistent with
the schedule for project implementation (see para. 4.59) and projected local
and international inflation rates, assuming that Jordan will maintain the
current exchange rate (JD 0.65-US$l.00) in real terms over the 1989-98 period.
A domestic inflation rate of 11.8% has been considered for 1990, 9.5% for 1991,
7.8* in 1992, 6.5% in 1993, 4.9% for 1994 and 1995, and 3.7% pa thereafter.
International inflation rates are projected at nil in 1989, 4.9% pa in 1990-95,
and 3.7% pa thereafter.

Sgurce: JPMC Feasibility Study and Bank estimates.
4.46     Cost estimates are based on JPMC's recent cost experience in procuring
similar equipment and works in recent years, updated to October 1989. The
estimated incremental working capital requirements are based on additional
product and consumables inventories at 14 days' sales and mining costs, and
additional receivables and payables amounting to 75 days' sales and 30 days
cash costs of production, respectively. The estimate is based on JPMC's actual
(1988) working capital structure.
4.47     The total capital cost for the beneficiation component of the project,
including physical but excluding price contingencies, working capital and
interest during construction is approximately US$60 per tonne phosphate rock
product which is in line with current cost estimates of typical developing
countries beneficiation experience worldwide. That component of the project
can be considered competitive with worldwide beneficiation plant investment
costs.

8. Fluancing Pl-n.
4.48     The financing plan for the project is shown below.  Total financing
required is US$161.7 million of which US$128.5 million or 79.58 constitutes the
direct foreign exchange component. The indirect foreign exchange component is
estimated to be US$19.9 or 12.3% of total cost. The proposed Bank Loan of
US$25 million represents 19.5% of the direct foreign exchange component, 16.8%
of the direct and indirect foreign exchange component, and 15.5% of the total
project cost.  The financing plan is tabulated below and will be finalized
during Negotiations.

Project (KD4.8 million). In addition the Government has secured a US$11.0
million loan from the Islamic Development Bank, of which US$2.0 million has
been allocated for equipment under the first project. The effective Arab Fund
loan is to the Government at an interest rate of 4.5% and carries a 5 year
grace period (starting from the date of first disbursement), followed by 35
semi-aznual repayments. The loan will be onlent by Government to JPNC at 6.0%

pa, the difference between the interest rates being held in a special account
for use by JPMC for phosphate/chemical research and development programs to be
agreed by the Fund. The loan carries a commitment fee of 0.5%, applied after
individual irrevocable letters of credit are established and will be charged on
a procurement package basis, on the undisbursed loan balance for each package.
4.50     The Kuwait Fund loan in to the Government at 4.0% (3.5% interest on
the disbursed amount and 0.5% management fee). Loan repayment starts from
September 1, 1993, over 12 years. The loan will be onlent to JPNC at 6.0%, the
difference in rates being held in the same special account with Arab Fund
monies. The Kuwait Fund loan carries a comuitaent fee of 0.5% on the
undisbursed balance for L/C's issued at the request of JPMC. The initialled
additional (KD4.8 million) loan from the Funds are on the same terms with the
exception that onlending rates are the same as the interest rate to Government.
4.51     The Islamic Development Bank loan is at 8.0% interest rate over 9
years (including 2 years grace - starting after the arrival of specific goods
at Aqaba or on completion of erection) and with no commitment or management
fee. The Islamic Bank loan offers a 15% discount on installments and interest
payments submitted on time.
4.52     The proposed Bank loan would be made to JPMC over 17 years including a
5-year grace period and the Government of Jordan would guarantee the loan, as
under Loan 2902-JO. JPMC would pay to the Government annually, a guarantee fee
equivalent to 10% of the Bank interest rate on the outstanding loan balance.
JPMC wouild bear the foreign exchange and variable interest risk of all loans.
4.53     The Kuwait/Arab Funds and the Bank will parallel finance beneficiation
plant turnkey contracts and will jointly finance a portion of the fertilizer
plant rehabilitation turnkey contract. The Kuwait/Arab Funds will finance also
support equipment, certain civil works and infrastructure requirements. The
Islamic Development Bank will finance dryers and the train loading station. The
risk of a shortfall of funds can be considered negligible. Agreement was
reached during negotiations with JPHC that the effectiveness of all project
related loans with the Kuwait and Arab Funds (which represent approximately 90%
of project cofinancing) will be a Condition of Effectiveness of the Bank loan.
9. Pro=urement and Disbursement.
4.54     Prgurement.  JPNC has procured all off-shore packages under the first
loan utllizing ICB procedures approved by the Bank and is familiar with the
Bank's procurement guidelines and procedures for services and goods. Bank
proceeds will be utilized to finance two of the five packages to be procured
for the beneficiation component of the project. Those two turnkey packages
will be procured by ICB following Bank guidelines. Procurement of the turnkey
contract for the fertilizer rehabilitation has been undertaken following ICB
procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines (para. 4.62). Packages which are
suitable for Bank financing (Annex 4-6) have been agreed with JPMC.



34 -
4.55     Contracts for a total of 3 offshore packages (US$20.8 million - list
of main items are given in Annex 4-6) would be awarded following ICB. All ICB
packages to be financed out of Bank loan proceeds, will be subject to prior
review. This constitutes 100% of the value of all goods to be financed out of
the loan.
4.56     Details of procurement of goods and services are shown in the table

4.57     DLabursements will be made against (i) 100% of the foreign and local
(ex-factory) costs and 90* of local expenditures for other items procured
locally of turnkey contracts for beneficiation plant packages; (ii) 100% of the
foreign cost of directly imported goods for the fertilizer turnkey
rehabilitation package. Disbursements would be made against full documentation
except for contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent, for which disbursement



- 35 -
would be made against statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure. JPMC would
retain the necessary back-up documentation. To facilitate disbursement, a
revolving fund would be established in a bank acceptable to the Bank with an
initial deposit of US$2.0 million to cover the e-timated average expenditures
of about 4 months. The estimated disbursement figures are shown at Annex 4-7,
together with comparison with Reeional and Bankwide industry project profiles.
The estimated disbursement profile is somewhat steeper than both Bank and
regional profiles, reflecting the facts that (i) B&nk financing is limited to
major turnkey contracts, and (ii) JPMC have demonstrated under the first loan,
its ability to process contract invoices in an expeditious manner. The Bank
loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1995, and the loan closing
date shall be December 31, 1995.
10. Project Management and Implementation
4.58     Prolect organization.  Project engineering and design of the
beneficiation component of the Project is being carried out by JPMC's Project
Department, with technical assistance mobilized under the first loan.
Procurement is being initiated by the Projects Department and will be processed
by JPMC's Supplies Department, which handles procurement for all goods and
services for the company and which effectively managed procurement under the
first loan. Qualified engineers from JPMC's existing operations have been
appointed as Construction and Mine Managers at Shidiya. The Shidiya Project
Director is accountable to a company Steering Committee comprising the Deputy
Managing Directors and other Directors (Technical, Production, Finance,
Supplies) of the company. The Project Director is assisted, as under the first
loan, by an Advisory Group which was formed to perform detailed engineering
tasks, assisted as necessary by local consultants.
4.59     The organization chart for construction management of the
beneficiation plant is given at Annex 4-8. A total of 234 personnel will be
involved in construction excluding personnel assigned by turnkey contractors.
A construction manager, operations manager, and deputy managers in charge of
mining, civil, mechanical, electrical, surveying, and administration divisions
have been appointed under the first loan and this construction management group
will be responsible also for construction and implementation of the Shidiya
beneficiation component of the project. All of these personnel have long
standing construction and operations experience within JPMC and will reside at
the project site and be fully supported by technical, skilled and semi-skilled
workforces. Arrangements for project implementation are satisfactory. JPMC
recognize that project control (scheduling, monitoring, expediting and cost
control) is critical to the success of project implementation and are
finalizing arrangements for the staffing of Project and Cost Control teams.
Agreement was reached during negotiations with JPNC that staffing of these
teams with personnel of experience and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank
will be a condition of Loan Effectiveness. JPMC has long experience in
effective construction management. Beneficiation plant contracts that are on
the project critical path will be undertaken by experienced international
turnkey contractors.



- 36 -
4.60     Rehabilitation of the fertilizer plant at Aqaba will be carried out
under a turnkey contract for the provision of all equipment and materials, and
services, for the design, construction, erection, and commissioning of the
facilities. JPNC recognize that their plant operations personnel, who are
production-oriented, have limited fertilizer plant construction management
capability or experience. JPMC will establish a Project Management Unit (PMU)
to effectively direct implementation of this component of the Project. JPMC
will assign a full-time senior technical staff member as Unit Manager and a
group of experienced engineers, qualified in the various relevant engineering
and other (financial/accounting) functions, to direct and supervise project
implementation. To assist the PMU and to develop an effective project
management team, JPMC will engage an engineering company to act as Project
Management Advisors (PNA). The responsibility of the PHA wi'l be to (i) assist
JPNC in contract negotiations, (ii.) assign specialists, as necessary, to the
turnkey contractor's office to review detailed engineering and design, to
oversee procurement, and to inspect vendor's design and fabrication work on
critical equipment items, (iii) provide on-the-Job training to JPMC staff
assigned to the PMU, and (iv) to assist JPAC staff to supervise the turnkey
construction, commissioning and performance guarantee test runs. The PMA will
consist initially of 2 project engineers supported by specialists such as a
process engineer, a planning engineer, and a MIS/progress report specialist.
About 75 man-months of work by the PMA are planned over a 30-month period at an
estimated foreign cost of US$1.0 million. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with JPMC that execution of a Project Management Services Agreement, to
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to supervise turnkey
rehabilitation of the fertilizer plant, will be a Condition of Disbursement for
the fertilizer component of the project.
4.61     Project Status.  The Project has been approved by the Ministry of
Planning and is an integral part of the Government's Five-Year plan. JPMC has
completed preliminary engineering and has developed design criteria for the
beneficiation plant component of the Project. A prequalification Notice for
beneficiation plant turnkey contracts was issued August 31, 1989. A
prequalification questionnaire, acceptable to the Bank, was issued October 1989
to contractors responding to the advertisement. JPMC will submit to the Bank,
its evaluation of companies seeking prequalification, in January 1990. JPMC is
in process of finalizing bidding documents for the beneficiation plant
contracts. These will be submitted for Bank review in February 1990 and issued
to prequalified companies in March 1990, according to the Project
implementation schedule. A procurement Notice for the fertilizer plant turnkey
contract was issued on April 30, 1989. Following ICB procedures, a lowest
evaluated, fully responsive, bidder has been identified. Commercial
negotiations with that bidder are being finalized.
4.62     IilementatLon Schedule.  JPMC has completed project preparation and
are proceeding with detailed engineering. Agreement on a realistic project
implementation schedule was reached during appraisal and updated during post-
appraisal (Annex 4-9) and forms the basis for financial and economic analysis.
The necessary land required for the project is already allocated to JPMC by
Government. Access roads and power supply have been completed under the first
loan. Procurement for water supply requirements (well drilling and supply
equipment) and power distribution facilities will be initiated January, 1990.



- 37 -
Procurement of beneficiation plant equipment will be Initiated In February
1990. CommissionLng of the beneflciation plant is scheduled October 1992.
Project completion (full productlon) ls planned starting 1995. Contract
slgnLng for the fertilizer plant rehabliltation contract is anticipated
February 1990, and commissioning of the rehabliltated plant is scheduled for
December 1991.
V. TRANSPORT AND PORT INFRASTRUCTURE
A. Land Trananort Ar&AUgM&.=
5.1      Phosphate rock is transported to Aqaba from existlng mlnes by both
rail and road. Rock destlned to the fertilizer plant at Wadl II ls transported
exclusively by truck, avoiding trans-shipment at Aqaba. Phosphate rock from
Shidlya will in the near-term be transported by truck, pending a decision on
the construction of a rail spur to project area. HistorLcally, truck transport
has been contracted by JPMC to the extent that rail c.pacLty has proved
inadequate. JPMC appreciate that economics favor phosphate transport by rail
and remained committed to utilize truck transport only to the extent that rail
capacity ls limited. Recent statistics for the transport of rock to Aqaba are
tabulated below.

Source: JPIC Annual Reports and Transport Department Statistics.
5.2      Transport by rail has proved erratic in terms of annual capacity, due
primarily to poor management performance of the Aqaba Railway Corporation
(ARC), the poor condition of existing track, and derallments. The overall
proportion of phosphate railed to Aqaba has declined steadlly.
5.3      Under the Bank's Multi-Mode Transport Project (Loan 2463-JO), track on
critical sectlons between existing phosphate mines and Aqaba has been renewed,
maintenance facilities have been revamped, and technical assistance and
training have been provided to ARC. This should enable phosphate transport by
rail to reach increased levels, on a sustainable basis. The proposed Transport
III Project could include for extension of the rail line to Shidiya.
5.4      Recognizing previous performance deficiencies in the rail operation
and that transport economics in Jordan favor the transport of phosphate rock by
rail as opposed to truck, the Government decided in 1988, to investigate



- 38 -
options to transfer responsibility for rail operations to JPMC. Since the rail
operation serves only the phosphate industry, this decision has substantial
rationale. Governmental inter-ministerial committees (including representation
from JPMC) have reviewed a variety of options in this respect. Although no
final decision has been reached, the Government appear presently to favor JPHC
purchasing outright ARC's current and movable assets and rental of fixed
assets. The issue of phosphate rail transport was discussed during
negotiations and agreement was reached that not later than June 30, 1990, or
such later date as mutually agreed, the Government will submit proposals for
the financial and institutional arrangements for the rail transport of
phosphate rock for Bank review and comment. To the extent that future rail
capacity falls short of phosphate rock transport requirements, JPMC will
maintain trucking contract arrangements.
B. Aqaba Part
5.5      The Port of Aqaba (see Nap 19921) is operated by The Aqaba Port
Corporation (TPC), an independent publlc corporation. Phosphate rock is
received at the port at two rail and six truck intakes and is loaded to ships
via two phosphate berths. The rail and truck intakes have receiving capacities
of 7.5 and 5.0 mtpy respectively, which far exceed requirements, even following
implementation of the Project. The two existing berths (A and B) have a
combined phosphate loading capacity in excess of 9 mtpy. This capacity exceeds
planned export levels (para 4.3 and Annex 4-1) after completion of the Project,
and provides a safety factor needed to accommodate seasonal variation in rock
demand and export, and variations in customer dispatching of vessels for
loading to Aqaba.
5.6      Phosphate storage at the port is accommodated in six storage sheds
with a combined capacity of 341,000 tonnes. The storage facilities have been
effectively managed through close communication between JPMC mine management
and JPMC staff located at the port. With the flexibility of the port
installation, the storage facilities have proved adequate. During recent years
however, JPMC have faced increasing difficulty to maintain the storage at or
close to capacity due to the erratic performance of incoming rail system.
Stores of phosphate were only 40-50% full, on average, during 1988. This
constrained JPMC's flexibility in terms of servicing customer needs in 1988 and
demurrage charges were incurred and some export opportunities lost. This
transport deficiency can be expected to be gradually removed as the rail
operations improve over the coming years following rehabilitation and training
under the Bank's Multi-Mode Transport Project. In addition, JPMC concluded
additional truck transport contract arrangements in 1988 which will balance any
ongoing rail deficiencies in the short-term.
5.7      Following completion of the Project, the number of grades of phosphate
rock to be stored at Aqaba will increase. However, in parallel, production
from existing mines will progressively decline and with the planned transport
arrangements, the storage facillties are adequate to handle variations in
phosphate product grade.



- 39 -
5.8      Port handling tariffs paid to TPC by JPKC are governed by Ministerial
Decree and are on a sliding scale, with a 650 fils per tonne tariff in excess
of 2 mtpy throughput. The tariff structure is consldered reasonable and has
been used in the financial analysis of the Project.
VI,- FIANCIAL ANASIS
A. Past and Present Financial Performance
6.1      Simmazy. JPXC has historically been a company with a sound financial
record. Following the absorption of JFI in early 1986 and through most of 1987,
JPMC's financial position deteriorated as a result of the impact of the
financial costs of the takeover, continuing losses at the fertilizer plant, and
declirning phosphate rock prices. However, the operating results of both units
recovered strongly in 1988. Phosphate rock and fertilizer prices continued to
strengthen and with product sales denominated in US Dollars, the October 1988
devaluation of the Dinar combined to place JPMC in a strong financial position
by year end, with a solid cash balance, no short-term debt, adequate debt
service coverage, a conservative debt-equity ratio, and good liquidity. The
mining unit returned to former levels of profitability with surplus liquidity
and a strong balance sheet. The fertilizer unit earned its first profit and
financed its own working capital, but still had to rely on the parent company
and government to service its debt and meet outstanding commitments to former
shareholders. Details of past unit and consolidated company financial
performance are provided in Annex 6-1 and summarized in the following table:

6.2      1986-1987 Results.  The average phosphate rock export price (fob Aqaba)
declined 6% in 1986 and a further 9% in 1987, reaching the lowest level since
1960. Historical phosphate rock and fertilizer export prices (fob Aqaba) are in
the Project File. Through tight cost control, the unit cost of phosphate rock
production declined by 38% in 1987, sustaining the profitability of the mining
unit. The unit's net profit margin increased from 10.7% (JD7.8 million) in 1986
to 18.2% (JD10.9 million) in 1987. However, profitability of the mining unit
was offset by combined 1986-1987 losses of JD12.2 million at the fertilizer
unit. Fertilizer prices continued their prolonged slump. Plagued by capacity
constraints and the modest appreciation of the Dinar against the US Dollar, the
fertilizer unit sold all products at a loss in 1986 and 1987; the loss on its
principal products (bulk and bagged DAP) ranged between negative 10% and
negative 23% of the sales price. Consolidated net profit of the company fell
from JD10.9 million in 1985, the year before the JFI absorption, to an average
JD2.2 million in 1986 and 1987. Return on gross fixed assets declined from
19.6% in 1985 to 1.8% on average in those two years. Due to increased debt
service and operating losses at the fertilizer unit, corporate liquidity dropped
sharply; the current ratio declined from 2.13 in 1985 to 1.37 in 1986 and 1987
on average. As a result of reduced cash generation, JPMC was unable to service
its new level of debt and short-term bank borrowings rose JD20 million during
the period. The debt service coverage ratio f3ll from 3.5 in 1985 to 0.7 in
1986 and 1987 on average.
6.3      1988 Results - Mining Unit.  1988  4xrked the beginning of a substantial
improvement in the company's performance. .he mining unit increased phosphate
rock exports (5%) and continued to gain world market share (to 13.8%) in 1988.
The average rock export price rose 13% in US dollar terms in 1988, but increased
31% in Dinar terms due to an 18% decline in the average JD/US$ exchange rate
during the year. The average unit cost of sales rose only 12% for the principal
grades of rock exports, so that pre-tax profitability doubled to JD21.7 million
compared to 1987. With only about 35% of cash production costs imported,
further depreciation of the Dinar through 1989 has had a positive impact on
profits. Through September 1989, the average rock export price rose only 5%
above the average 1988 export price, but average revenue rose 40% in Dinar terms
as a result of a further 36% decline in the value of the local currency against
the US Dollar. In contrast, devaluation has as yet had only a limited impact on
local operating costs: road transport contracts were renegotiated in early 1989
at levels about 10% above 1988 rates, and medium-term contracts with contractors
for overburden removal and mining at El Hassa and El Abaid were renewed at 14%
above 1988 levels, due solely to the increased cost of imported fuels,
lubricants and spare parts. Other local costs affecting mine operations,
including labor, construction services and civil works, have been stable during
the first 10 months of 1989, though more of the inflationary effects of
devaluation are expected to pass into operating costs in 1990.
6.4      1988 Results - Fertilizer Unit.  The fertilizer unit achieved its first
year of profitable operation in 1988. Production of bulk DAP rose only 2% from
1987 to 614,400 tons DAP. However, revenues increased 60% (in JD terms), due
largely to devaluation, but also to price increases (in US Dollar terms) ranging
from 7% to 16% for major fertilizer products. Nevertheless, bulk DAP, which
accounted for 63% of revenues, continued to sell at a nominal loss of about 3%
of its selling price, despite a 16% increase in the average export price over

1987. Bagged DAP, which accounted for a further 26% of the sales, earned only a
nominal profit of 2.7% on its average selling price. The only consistently
profitable product, aluminum fluoride more than covered the loss on DAP
products. Unit costs of production rose from 14% to 26% on major products. As
a conseqnence of the major price increases, the operating margin improved
sharply from negative 10.9% in 1987 to 11.8% in 1988, but operating profit just
covered interest payments and the added cost of the unit's foreign currency-
denominated debt caused by devaluation. Overall profitability was modest at
1.3% of sales. Imported raw materials and consumables constitute about two-
thirds of cash production costs, so devaluation has had a less positive impact
on the unit's profitability in 1989. However, the unit was able to sell all of
its expected DAP production at the high prices prevailing during the first half
of 1989 (up 9% over 1988) and is expected to earn nearly JD12 million after tax.
6.5      Corporate Financial Position.  JPMC used the improved liquidity
resulting from profitable operations and the share capital increase of JD35
million in early 1988 to strengthen its financial position. It repaid all JDl9
million in outstanding short-term bank loans, reduced accounts payable by JD12
million, and increased cash to JD12 million. Net working capital rose to JD70
million from JD29 million in 1987. The current ratio rose from 1.41 in 1987 to
2.53 and the debt service coverage ratio improved from 0.68 in 1987 to 1.07 in
1988, after charging to income JD4.3 million for the revaluation of the long-
term debt maturing in 1989 and all of the underwriting discount resulting from
the equity issued during the year. JPNC further improved the liquidity of its
working capital by reducing excess inventories of phosphate rock 36% (JD5
million) in 1988. It also negotiated repayment of its largest outstanding
receivable over the 1989-91 period, which will reduce receivables by one-third.
Under the first loan, the company is upgrading its materials management system
and is developing an Action Plan to reduce the high spare parts inventory levels
held by the company.
B. Financial Projections
6.6      Financial projections for the 1989-98 period have been prepared
separately for the mining and fertilizer units in order to assess each unit's
profitability, and for JPNC as a whole (Annex 6-2), to assess the company's
long-term financial viability in view of the capital expenditures planned. The
projections are based on: (i) conservative assumptions about phosphate rock and
fertilizer product export prices and fertilizer input costs; (ii) a long-term
mine development and phosphate rock sales program, with rock exports limited to
6.1 mt in 1990 and 7.8 mt in 1998; and (iii) forecast mining unit production
costs. The long-term mine development and phosphate rock sales program and
forecast mining unit production costs are in the Project file. All projections
have been made in constant Jordanian Dinars based on actual prices in the last
quarter of 1989 at an exchange rate of US$1 - JDO.65, the mid-point exchange
rate prevailing in late October 1989. Local operating costs have been increased
by 14% in 1990 and than held constant to take into account the anticipated
impact of the 20% Dinar depreciation between early and late 1989. Inflation
rates used in the calculation of capital costs are those projected by the IMF
for local inflation (1990 - 11.8%, 1991 - 9.5%, 1992 - 7.8%, 1993 - 6.5% and
1994-1988 -5* p.a.) and the NUV as calculated by the Bank's International



- 43 -
Economics Department (1990 to 1995 - 4.93% p.a., 1996 to 1998 - 3.68% p.a.).
Price escalation has been taken out of asset values and long-term debt for
financial projections. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to estimate
the Impact of lower phosphate rock and fertilizer prices on JPKC's financial
position.
1. Mining Unit
6.7      The mining unit is expected to generate solid profitability and strong
cashflow over the 1989-1998 period. This will be due primarily to the continued
substantial effect of Dinar devaluation on JPMC's US dollar-denominated product
sales. Since October 1988, the Dinar has declined 50% against the US Dollar and
this relative valuation is expected to be maintained by the Government to
preserve the improvement in the country's external competitive position.
Second, world phosphate rock prices are expected to continue a modes; recovery
in real terms through 1998, growing at 0.3% in 1990, 0.6% p.a. from 1991 to
1995, and 0.46% p.a. from 1996 to 1998. A third factor in the unit's improved
profitability will be slow growth in domestic production costs, due to the
Government's tight economic management and the gradual replacement of the higher
cost existing mines at El Hassa and El Abiad by the relatively low cost mines at
Shidiya. Cash generation is expected to be sufficient to enable JPMC to finance
about 20% of the mining unit's capital investment from internally generated
funds, build a reserve for potential capital expenditures related to joint
venture projects under discussion and provide a comfortable margin to service
its debt, while retaining a conservative debt/equity ratio below 50:50 and
excellent liquidity. The financial statements for the mining unit for the
1988-1998 period are summarized in the following table:

6.8      Revenues.  Following JPMC's revised and more conservative warketing
strategy (see para 2.21), rock exports are planned to remain at the 5.8 million
ton level in 1989 and to increase progressively to 7.8 million tons in 1998.
Transfers to the fertilizer unit are expected to grow from 1 million tons in
1989 to 1.4 million by 1994 once the fertilizer plant rehabilitation is
completed. Revenues (exclusive of transfers to the fertilizer unit) are
projected to increase from JD84.9 million in 1988 to JD129.5 million in 1989, a
52% increase, due largely to the beneficial effects of devaluation for a full
year on operations. Thereafter, revenues are projected to grow at 5.1% p.a. to
JD203 million in 1998. Revenue growth will come primarily from the expected
growth in rock exports (3% p.a.), and continued recovery in phosphate rock
export prices which are expected to increase 1.3% p.a. in real terms between
1989 and 1998. The following table summarizes the projected growth in rock
sales and export prices during the period:

6.9      Mining Costs.  Cash costs of production are projected to increase by 2%
p.a. between 1988 and 1998, slower than the growth of sales revenues, for two
reasons: first, only one-third of production inputs are imported so that
operating costs will be less affected by the decline in the value of the Dinar,
adding to unit profitability. Local cost increases in 1989 have been only on
the foreign components of costs and are running at a level of 10%-14%. Domestic
costs, for items such as civil works and construction have been flat or have
actually declined in some cases due to substantial overcapacity and sluggish
demand. Second, development of new, lower cost ore bodies at Shidiya will slow
the rise in average production costs. For example, the projected average cash
cost of production of phosphate rock produced at Shidiya (in constant 1989
prices and excluding a JD5 per ton production tax imposed in 1989) is calculated
to be JD4.18 (FOB mine) per ton, some 40% less than the average cash cost of
production at existing mines in 1988 of JD6.90 per ton. The average cash cost
of production (ex-mine) is projected to decline gradually from JD7.20 per ton in
1988 to JD4.80 by 1998 as low-cost Shidiya production replaces existing mines.
6.10     Profitability and Cash Generation.  The profitability of the mining
unit is expected to improve sharply in 1989 as a result of devaluation and to
remain robust through 1998. The operating margin is expected to rise from 25%
in 1988 to 38% in 1989 and to remain at the 1989 level for the balance of the

1990-1998 period. The net profit margin is expected to rise from 14.7% in 1988
and 1989 to a respectable 22.7% in 1990 and remain around that level throughout
the 1990-1998 period, the difference being attributable to substantial Interest
and tax expenses. Cash generation (after taxes) is projected to rise 35%, from
JD16.7 million in 1988 to JD24.4 million in 1989, after charging to income the
further increase In the value of JPMC's foreign currency-denominated debt, and
then to average JD55 million p.a. between 1990-1998.
6.11     Capital Exnenditures.  The mining unit is planning capital expenditures
between 1989-1998 amounting to approximately JD240 million, in constant 1989
prices, to finance the Project, modest replacement investments and the
subsequent development of two additional phases, each 3.2 million tons per annum
capacity, at Shidiya (see Annex 4-1). JPMC is expecting to finance about 20% of
this projected capital expenditure through internally generated funds and to
borrow JDl90 million, including JD58 million for the Project. The Company
expects to utilize an additional JD117 million (23% of aggregate projected cash
flow) for debt service of the mining unit during the period. Finally, dividends
are expected to amount to JD230 million during the 1989-1998 (44% of aggregate
cash generation). This will provide a reasonable dividend of 15% o0i average
shareholders' equity, while enabling the company to add JD50 million to reserves
and JDl1O million to retained earnings in order to provide for its possible
share of joint venture projects currently under discussion between JPNC and
various fertilizer producing countries.
6.12     In the event that these joint venture fertilizer plant projects
materiLlize in the mid-1990's, future mine development at Shidiya would need to
be accelerated (Annex 4-1) beyond the levels anticipated in the projections and
would require additional investment. The additional costs of further mine
development to support phosphate rock input to such potential joint venture
projects, and the potential benefits that would result from such expanded
operations, have not been taken into account in the unit or consolidated
projections.
6.13     Working Canital Management. The mining unit year-end 1988 accounts
show a high level of net working capital (JD70 million) which is less liquid
than it appears. The mining unit has historically carried high levels of
phosphate rock inventory and accounts receivable, about 2-3 months of sales on
average since 1983. The unit reduced excess finished product inventory by
approximately 1.0 mt in 1988. However, accounts receivable increased from an
average 3 months of sales in the 1982-86 period to 5 months in 1987 and further
to 6.4 months of sales in 1988, due largely to delays in payment by one
customer, representing 30% of accounts receivable. Payment of this receivable
during the 1989-91 period has been arranged through an offset arrangement. The
relatively high level of receivables is due to the fact that rock is sold on
credit terms of up to six months, due in part to its nature as an industrial
input: 60% of the mining unit's sales are on terms of 60 days or less, but 25%
are on 120-180 day terms. As a result, the weighted average accounts receivable
for the mining unit in 1988 was 2.4 months, but only 1.1 months for the
fertilizer unit. JPMC is reviewing the classification of its accounts
receivable with the objective of reclassifying as along-term" assets those
unlikely to be collected in the next twelve-month period. Such a
reclassification could affect as much as JD15-20 million of receivables, about
15% of current assets.

6.14     Sensitivitv Analysis.  Because of the importance of the mining unit to
overall corporate financial performance, the unit's projected profitability has
been subjected to several sensitivity tests: (i) a 10% decline in rock export
prices from 1990; (ii) a 20% increase in the cost of sales from 1990,
representing a full pass through of devaluation in 1989 to increased operating
costs; and (iii) a combination of a 10% decline in rock prices and a 208
increase in the cost of sales. The following table summarizes the effect of
these sensitivities in 1996, the first year of full production for the
beneficiation plant component of the Project:

Source: Bank estimates.
Under any of these scenarios, the mining unit would continue to generate
sufficient funds to service its debt and provide the level of funding required
for projected capital investments. Under the worst case scenario, debt would
approach 60% of capitalization in 1994 and debt service coverage would drop to
1.70 in 1997. However, the company would still have adequate funds to finance
capital expenditures and could reduce its dividend payment to conserve funds.
2. Fertilizer Unit
6.15     At the current restricted level of production, the profitability of the
fertilizer unit is expected to improve significantly in 1989, due to the recent
devaluation of the Dinar. The unit is forecast to remain profitable, following
completion of the fertilizer plant rehabilitation, through 1998. The net profit
margin is expected to jump from 1.3% in 1988 to 13.1% in 1989 and to average 13%
through 1998. The unit is projected to generate sufficient cash during the
period to more than cover projected capital investment and debt service and to
fully repay the debt and shareholder obligations incurred in establishing the
company and as a result of its transfer to JPMC in 1986. These obligations,
carried off balance sheet in a "Special Account", have been serviced previously
by JPMC and the Government in lieu of fertilizer unit profitability. Pro-forma
projected financial statements for the fertilizer unit for the 1988-1998 period
are in the Projec; File and summarized below:

6.16     Aggregate carh generation during the 1989-1998 period is projected at
JD205 million. Of this, JD86 million will be required to discharge the
company's obligations to the Special Account, liquidating the current balance
and initiating a 15% dividend to the government out of future profits. An
additional JD31 million each will be needed for planned capital investment and
principal repayments, leaving uncommitted cashflow, during the period, of about
JD60 million, which will be sufficient to fully repay the net advance from the
parent company and provide a small cushion of liquidity for possible capital
investment. This projection is based on JPKC's plan to finance about 30% of the
proposed fertilizer plant rehabilitation from its own resources and borrow the
remaining 70%.
6.17     Revenues.  Revenues are projected to increase from JD56.1 million in
1988 to JD92.3 million in 1989, a 64% gain, primarily as a result of
devaluation. Thereafter, revenues are expected to rise to JD101 million in
1991. Once the fertilizer rehabilitation is completed in 1992, revenues are
projected to rise a further 28% and to an average JD128 million p.a. from 1994
through 1998, the consequence of a 37% increase in phosphoric acid production
due to debottlenecking at the fertilizer unit. Future selling prices for
fertilizer and intermediate products are based on conservative assumptions and
actual export prices realized during 1989 by JPMC, and are lower than those
forecast by the Bank.l/

Product prices include a bulk DAP price of US$215 in 1989, equivalent to the
average price realized by JPMC on first half of 1989, with no increase in 1990,
and then a decline of 0.1% p.a. between 1991-1995 and a decline of 0.71% p.a.
between 1996-1998. A US$15 per ton differential for bagged DAP has been
utilized, conforming to the average differential between bulk and bagged DAP
realized by the fertilizer unit in the 1986-88 period. A relatively
conservative price of US$350 per ton for 54% phosphoric acid has been projected,
based on the estimated long-run marginal replacement cost of phosphoric acid

production adjusted for the modest decline ln real terms projected for DAP
fertilizer during the 1991-1998 period. A price for aluminum hydroxide of
US$805 per ton has been projected in 1989 and 1990, based on company estimates,
8% above the average 1988 export price. Thereafter, this price has been
adjusted to take lnto account the cyclical nature of aluminum prices projected
by the Bank's International Economics Department during the 1991-1998 period (an
increase of 0.9% p.a. in 1991-1995 and a decline of 1.6% p.a. in 1996-1998). In
aggregate, the fertilizer unit is projected to benefit from an extended perlod
of relatively stable prices as fertilizer prices climb back toward the
historical trend line after a period of prolonged depression.
6.19     Onerating Costs.  Unit costs of production for fertilizer and
intermediate products are expected to increase between 6%-8% p.a. in real terms,
during the 1988-1998 period, largely reflecting the substantial jump in the cost
of imported inputs to production in 1989 as a result of devaluation. The price
of most product exports and the cost of most major raw material inputs
(phosphate rock, ammonia, sulphur and aluminum hydroxide) are projected to be
fairly stable in US Dollar terms as summarized in the following table:

Anmonia is expected to move in line with the price of urea, rising 0.4% p.a.
between 1991-1995 and declining 1.6% p.a. in 1996-1998. The price of sulphur is
expected to remain weak becau e of regional over-supply due to sour gas and oil
stripping in Iraq and Kuwait, and to follow the priee of crude oil, falling 7%
in 1990, then rising 1.8% p.a. from 1991-1995, and 4.5% p.a. from 1996-1998.
Aluminum hydroxide is expected to fluctuate in a narrow price level in real
terms, essentially following aluminum prices, rising 0.9% p.a. in 1991-1995 and
declining 1.6% p.a. in 1996-1998. Phosphate rock prices are expected to
increase 1.95% p.a. in 1989 over 1988, 0.3% in 1990, 0.6% p.a. between
1991-1995, and 0.46% p.a. between 1996-1998. The rock input price is based on
the actual transfer price formula utilized by JPMC, which is equivalent to 80%
of the lowest export price realized in the previous three-month period, plus

adjustments for the average cost of transport to Aqaba port and the fertilizer
plant, port charges and the Government's new production tax of JD5 per ton of
phosphate produced. Following rehabilitation of the fertilizer plant in 1992,
improved plant efficiencies are projected to reduce the unit production cost of
phosphoric acid by a modest 1.8% (JD3.18 ton). The principal benefit to the
company will be from higher volumes for export, not operating cost efficiencies,
and greater production flexibility to meet changing market requirements.
6.20     Profitability and Cash Generation.  Operating profit of the fertilizer
unit is projected to jump from JD6.6 million in 1988 to JD25.8 million in 1989,
declining gradually to JD22.8 million in 1992, as operating costs rise faster
than selling prices. Following completion of the plant rehabilitation,
operating profit is expected to rise to JD29.3 million in 1993 due to the
enhanced profitability of additional phosphoric acid production and higher
tonnages available for sale. Phosphoric acid exports following rehabilitation
are expected to add an annual net benefit of approximately JD1.4 million to pre-
tax income. Cash generation is expected to increase from JD5.5 million in 1988
to JD16.6 million in 1989, and to average JD22 million p.a. during the 1993-1998
period after plant rehabilitation.
6.21     Working Capital Management.  The fertilizer unit has historically
demonstrated efficient working capital management. Accounts receivable in 1988
were less than 60 days' sales; finished product inventory was approximately 2
1/2 weeks' sales; and raw materials inventory was about two months of
consumption. These levels are reasonable and are expected to continue.
However, the fertilizer unit has some JD5.6 million in spare parts, more than
five years consumption at current levels. Under the first loan, the company is
upgrading its materials management system and is developing an Action Plan to
reduce the high spare parts inventory levels held.
6.22     Sensitivity Analvsis.  The projected profitability of the fertilizer
unit has been subjected to several sensitivity tests: (i) a phosphate rock
input price equivalent to the opportunity cost of exports for the mining unit
(i.e. without the 20% discount from the export price or US$45.69 per ton in
1990); (ii) continued production at current levels without the capital
investment for plant rehabilitation; (iii) diversion of all increased phosphoric
acid capacity to bulk DAP manufacture instead of phosphoric acid exports from
1993. The following table highlights the impact of these alternative
assumptions on the projected profitability and cash generation of the fertilizer
unit in 1994, the year after the rehabilitated plant comes on line:

6.24     Based on the profitable financial performance of the mining and
fertilizer units, JPMC is projected to have adequate cash generation to meet
planned capital Investments, projected debt service, a healthy dividend payment
to shareholders and other cash requirements, while maintaining a strong balance
sheet, Including reserves for possible financial participation in joint venture
projects under discussion, takeover of the Aqaba Railway Corporation (see para.
6.28) and a cushion of working capital. JPMC will be able to continue to meet
the financial covenants established under the first loan.
6.25     Cash Generation. Cash generation Is expected to rise sharply from JD22
million in 1988 to JD41 million in 1989, largely as a result of the added
profitabillty cau-ed by Dinar devaluation since October 1988. Following
completion of the Project components in 1993, cash generation is projected to
increase further to an average level of JD82 million p.a. between 1993-98.
Aggregate cash generation is projected at JD725 million during the 1989-1998
period. The achievement of projected cash flow targets is important for JPMC to
be able to service its existing and future debts and to contribute to its future
investment. Agreement was reached with JPMC during negotiations that the
working ratio, which determines the available cash flow, will be maintained
below 0.8.
6.26     Investment and Debt Service. Capital expenditures on fixed assets
associated with the first loan, the Project, and further phased development at
Shidiya in the mid-1990's are projected to total some JD270 million between
1989-1998. The company expects to finance about 25% of this sum from internally
generated funds and to borrow 75%, about JD205 million. Servicing of existing
and planned long-term debt is projected to require an additional JD150 million
over the 1989-98 period. Dividends, at a payout ratio of 15% on average
shareholders' equity, are projected to require an additional JD315 million and
payments to the Special Account (paras. 6.15 and 6.16) will amount to JD86
million. Long-term uses of funds are expected to total an estimated JD820
million, between 1989-89. Agreement was reached with JPHC during negotiations,
that the company's overall debt service ratio will be maintained at less than
1.5.
6.27     Financial Position. JPMC's substantial cash flow will not be
sufficient to meet all of the above commitments from internally generated funds
and maintain an adequate cash reserve, given the planned investment in
devalopment of the successive places of the Shidiya mine through 1999 and the
possibility of joint venture projects which may require a financial
participation by JPMC. JPMC is planning to borrow JD205 million to fund part of
its capital requirements, with borrowings concentrated in the 1990-1994 period.
However, the Company's balance sheet will remain conservative, with reserve for
further borrowings and considerable liquidity: the debt/equity ratio is not
expected to exceed 45:55 during the 1990-1998 period and the current ratio
should remain above 2:0. Debt service coverage will be sufficient, remaining at
3.0 or better throughout the period. To malntain a sound financial structure
and to avoid excessive debt service increase, JPMC should limit future
investments to those which have been discussed during project appraisal (paras.
6.11 and 6.16). Agreement was reached with JPMC during negotiations that the
investment plan be updated annually in consultation with the Bank at least six
months before the beginning of each fiscal year, and that the overall



- 55 -
debt/equity ratio be maintained below 60/40. From 1993, JPMC is projected to
enjoy a progressively stronger financial position, as cash generation improves
following project completion. The current ratio is projected to rise from 2.5
in 1993 to 3.5 in 1998. The debt/equity ratio is projected to decline rapidly
from 41:59 in 1993 to 32:68 in 1998 and the debt service coverage ratio will
rise somewhat from 3.6 to 3.7. Profitability, as measured by return on gross
fixed assets, will drop from a high of 32% in 1991 to 19% in 1998 as the largely
depreciated assets at the existing mines are replaced by the new mines at
Shidiya. However, the operating margin will remain highly positive, averaging
33% during the 1989-1998 period, due to the replacement of the higher cost
existing mines by the lower cost mines at Shidiya.
6.28     A final decision transferring all or part of the assets of the Aqaba
Railway Corporation (ARC) to JPMC has not been reached (see para. 5.4). Among
the many options being considered, the Government appears presently to favor the
one whereby JPMC would assume full financial responsibility for the future
operations of ARC and partial responsibility for future debt servicing. Under
this option, JPNC would purchase ARC's current assets and rolling stock for a
sum of JD12.2 million and pay an annual rent of JD8.525 million for use of the
rail line. The rental fee would cover all operating and administrative costs,
including depreciation, and interest on ARC's outstanding debt. It is proposed
that JPMC pay an additional amount to cover future changes in the principal
value of ARC's debt, which is largely denominated in foreign currencies. This
amount would fluctuate with changes in exchange rates, but in the first year
would amount to an estimated JDl.9 million. Assuming that the transaction is
completed in 1990, the overall financial cost of this option to JPMC would
amount to JD22.6 million in 1990 and about JD10 million in 1991, assuming no
further change in exchange rates. The rental fee portion (JD10 million) would
thus be equivalett to a fee for rail transport of about JD4 per ton, based on
the average annual rail f:eight volume of 2.57 million tons carried by rail
between 1984 and 1988, an increase of about 90% from the present level of rail
tariffs. The financial impact of this proposal on JPKC would be felt primarily
in 1990, with some reduction in profitability and liquidity. Consolidated net
working capital would be essentially unchanged, instead of rising by about JD15
million. Thereafter, there would be a minimal impact on the profitability or
financial position of JPMC. Assuming that forecast increases in rail freight
capacity materialize, unit freight transport costs would actually decline
somewhat from 1994 onwards. In addition, JPHC would bear the cost of
constructing the rail spur at Shidiya during the 1991-1993 period, at an
estimated cost of some JD13.5 million at current exchange rates. This amount
would utilize about 20% of the company's projected build-up of surplus cash
balances during that period.
C. Financial Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
1. Beneficiation Plant Component
6.29     Financial Rate of Return.  The estimated financial rate of return (FRR)
for the beneficiation plant component of the Project (Annex 6-3), in constant
terms, including a Government production tax of JD5/ton, is 17.4%. Without the
production tax, the FRR is 25.1%. The FRR has been calculated using standard



- 56 -
incremental cost-benefit methodology, over a 20-year operating period, beginning
in 1993 with no salvage value on project fixed assets or incremental working
capital. Total project cost, for financial purposes, is estimated at US$98.2
million, including physical contingencies of US$7.1 million and incremental
working capital of US$9.5 million. Project implementation is spread over a 4
year period to year end 1992, based on the project implementation schedule.
6.30     Operating costs have been calculated based on JPMC's experience with
operation of beneficiation plants at El Hassa and El Abiad. A 10% contingency
on production costs has been added in the base case to reflect JPKC's lack of
experience in the operation of flotation technology. All input prices for
financial analysis were taken at their market values in October 1989. A
combined road/rail transport cost from Shidiya to Aqaba has been calculated at
JD2.39/ton and the current mid-range port charge of JDO.75/ton has been used.
Future selling prices for phosphate rock are based on conservative assumptions
and aetual export prices realized during 1989 by JPNC, and are lower than those
forecast by the Bank.2/
6.31    The acceptable financial rate of return (17.4%) in the base case is due
to the low capital intensity (investment cost of US$13.17 per ton at a 15%
discount rate) and low operating costs (US$21.59 per ton) relative to the
average revenue per ton of US$37.61 in 1996, the first year of full production.
The analysis reflects the fact that investment for mine development to provide
phosphate rock feed to the beneficiation plant was primarily catered for under
the first loan and has been considered as a sunk cost. The low incremental mine
operating costs of phosphate rock input to -he beneficiation plant are due to
favorable stripping ratios, and the allocation of certain operating costs
(overburd&n removal) to the mining of the A2 phosphate ore under the first loan.
6.32     Sensitivitv Analnyis. The main project risks are uncertainties
concerning future phosphate rock prices, the ability of the market to absorb the
additional rock output, project capital costs, and future operating costs,
including land transport. The following table deownstrates that the FRR of the
beneficiation plant project component remains acceptable under a range of
adverse assumptions:

6.33     Phosphate Prices.  The principal uncertainty is the future level of
phosphate rock prices. Although currently firm and rising, prices have varied
sharply in the past. The base case conservatively projects the growth in rock
prices at 0.66% p.a. in real terms between 1989-1998. The project returns are
sensitive to changes in selling prices. At a price 10% below the levels in the
base case, the FRR falls to 13.1%. The recently instituted Government
production tax of JD5 per ton of phosphate rock produced, acts as a windfall
profits tax, and could be reversed in all or part in the event of a sustained
downturn in phosphate prices, which is not anticipated, protecting JPMC's
financial viability. Assuming no real price increase at all after 1989, the FRR
is still 15.7%. Assuming price increases in accordance with the Bank's
International Economics Department forecasts, the FRR rises to 29.8%.

6.34     Capital and Onerating Costs.  The total project cost is estimated at
US$98.2 million (JD 63.8 million), including physical contingencies. If actual
investment costs were 10% higher (in real terms), the FRR would be 16%. Average
operating costs, including the costs of mine production, transport to port,
marketing and overheads, and already including a 10% contingency on all
production costs, are estimated to be US$13.89 (JD9.03) per ton over the life of
the project, excluding the production tax, and US$21.59 (JD14.03) per ton
including the tax. If operating costs were 10% higher than anticipated, the FRR
would fall to 16.5%.
6.35     Trasngort Cost.  There is some uncertainty about future transport costs
due to concern about the success of the current Aqaba railway (ARC)
rehabilitation program, ARC's need to earn enough to cover its operating costs
and debt service requirements and the final terms of JPMC's possible takeover of
some of the assets of ARC. Moreover, reduced back-haul opportunities from Iraq
and strict enforcement of axle load limits could increase road transport costs.
However, even if land transport costs were to increase JD1 per ton to JD3.39, a
42% increase, the FRR would still be 15.7%.
2. Fertilizer Plat Rehabilitation Component
6.36     The estimated financial rate of return for the rehabilitation of the
fertilizer unit (Annex 6-4) is 26.3%. For purposes of financial and econonaic



- 58 -
rate of return calculation, the total project cost is estimated at US$35.0
million, including US$3.5 million of physical contingencies and US$6.7 million
of incremental working capital. The FRR was calculated over a 12-year operating
period from completion of the rehabilitation (1993 through 2004), with no
salvage value for the project fixed assets or incremental working capital. The
average annual net benefit at steady state production is projected as US$10.4
million pa, and the net present value of the project benefits at a 10% discount
rate is US$29.1 million.
6.37     The favorable rate of return in the base case is due primarily to the
substantial increase in production (36% from 1994 on) of phosphoric acid for
fertilizer manufacture or direct sale and, to a far lesser extent, nominal
savings in the unit cost of production as a result of modestly improved
production efficiencies. Rehabilitation is expected to result in a small
decline in the amount of phosphate rock (0.5%), sulphur (1.6%) and sulphuric
acid (1.4%) required to produce a ton of phosphoric acid.
6.38     Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project remains attractive
under a range of adverse assumptions regarding capital and operating costs,
selling prices and capacity utilization, as the following table shows:

*D. Capacity utilization @ 80% from 1993      14.4%

6.39     Fertilizer Prices.  The major uncertainty is the future level of
phosphate fertilizer and intermediate product prices. Although currently strong
and rising, DAP and phosphoric acid prices have varied widely in the past and
were in a long-term downtrend from 1960-1987. JPMC adopted a flexible marketing
strategy during the past few years to lessen its dependence on bulk DAP sales
when prices were at their weakest, increasing the proportion of bagged DAP sales
in order to benefit from the higher margins available on this more retail-
oriented product. An objective of the fertilizer rehabilitation is to enhance
JPNC's marketing flexibility and further reduce its dependence on bulk DAP sales
by giving it substantial additional phosphoric acid capacity to sell as such or
convert into DAP, depending on the relative profitability of each product. The
base case assumes that all additional phosphoric acid production is sold as acid
at a base price of US$350 per ton in 1989 and 1990, equivalent to the estimated
long-term marginal replacement cost of phosphoric acid production, and declining
by 0.13% p.a. between 1991-1995 and by 0.71% p.a. between 1996-1998, in real
terms. This price is about 15% below the average selling price during the first
5 months of 1989 (US$421 per ton fob), though that price was based on special
factors concerning the availability of phosphoric acid in the Indian market and



- 59 -
is not considered a representative long-term price. At a price 10% below the
projected price level - and about 25% below the current selling price - the FRR
drops to 15.7%. Such a decline is considered unlikely given the conservative
prices for DAP fertilizer and phosphoric acid used in the projections. Assuming
no real price change after 1989, compared to a modest decline in the base case,
the FRR rises to 31.7%. Assuming price increases in accordance with the Bank's
International Economics Department forecasts, the FRR increases to 41.5%.

6.40     Capital and Cperating Costs.  The capital cost of the project is
estimated at US$28.3 million, including physical contingencies of 14%, plus
incremental working capital of US$6.7 million. If the project cost (excluding
working capital) were 20% higher, the FRR would only decline to 22.2%.
Estimated operating costs are based on the experience of JPNC's fertilizer unit,
adjusted for the expected modest gains in production efficiencies as a result of
rehabilitation, and conservative forecasts of raw material input prices. As a
result of these efficiencies, average unit operating costs are expected to
decline 1.8%, or US$3.18 per ton. If, however, operating costs were to increase
10%, the FRR would fall to 14.6%.
6.41     Capacit! Utilization.  The principal reason for the unprofitable past
operation of the fertilizer plant has been its inability to produce near design
capacity. Output in 1988 was 73.5% of design capacity and is not expected to
exceed that level without rehabilitation. Design capacity of the rehabilitated
plant is expected to increase 9% to 450,000 tpa. Utilization is expected to
decline to 70% in 1992 as the plant is closed down temporarily to bring the new
facilities on stream, to increase to 85% in 1993 as plant technicians become
familiar with its operation, and to operate at 92% of capacity from 1994, in the
middle of the normal range (90%-95%) of capacity utilization of such plants
worldwide. Should the investment in rehabilitation not prove effective at
debottlenecking the plant, and utilization remain only at the 80% level from
1993, the FRR would fall to 14.4%.
D. Project Risks
6.42     The beneficiation plant component of the Project faces no higher
technical risks than those normally associated with mineral beneficiation. All
project activities involve proven technology that has been in regular use in the



- 60 -
industrialized world and, with the exception of flotation technology, in Jordan.
JPNC has considerable experience vith the construction management of
beneficiation plants at existing operations. The fertilizer plant component of
the Project faces no major additional technical risk; similar rehabilitation has
proved necessary at other plants in different parts of the world and the
rehabilitation involves technology that is well developed and proven. The main
risk lies in projections of phosphate rock and fertilizer product prices and
sensitivity analysis has demonstrated that under worst case assumptions, the
project is not exposed to serious risk in this respect.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.1      The economic analysis demonstrates that the project components are each
economically justified, with economic rates of returns (ERR) of 26.18 on the
beneficiation plant component (Annex 7-1) and 28.3% on the fertilizer
rehabilitation (Annex 7-2). The ERRs deviate substantially from the FRR's
because of the JD5 per ton production tax levied on phosphate production
beginning in August 1989. Sensitivity tests carried out (para. 7.6 and 7.10)
indicate that within a large margin of uncertainty regarding prices, demand,
project costs, and land transport charges, the project components remain
economically attractive. The macroeconomic impact of the project in terms of
the foreign exchange balance is presented at para. 7.13.
A. Economic Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
1. Beneficiation Plant Conmonent
7.2      Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of return (ERR) was derived
from the financial costs of the project and calculated following standard cost-
benefit methodology. Total project cost for economic purposes is US$98.1
million, including physical contingencies US$7.1 million, and incremental
working capital of US$9.5 million. All inputs are taken at market prices,
except input costs of electricity and fuel imports which were corrected to
international prices to eliminate cross-subsidization of different types of
petroleum products. Electricity has been calculated at its long-run marginal
cost. Tariffs on imports have been removed. The following corrections were
used in calculating economic costs:

7.3      Since no additional investment at the port is necessary for the
additional 1.5 mpty rock throughput, the port charge for economic analysis of
the beneficiation plant component has bnen taken as the marginal port operating
cost for an additional 1.5 mtpy, calculated at 14.3 file/ton (Annex 7-1).
7.4      Due to uncertainty about the  level of future rock production at
Shidiya to be moved by railroad, the cost of trucking has been taken as the
economic cost of land transport. Since a final decision regarding the road
extension to Aqaba from Shidiya, through Disi, has not been made by Government,
the road transport cost is calculated via the existing road through Ma'an at
JD2.39/ton, including incremental road damage, but excluding taxes paid for
imports. Because current rates are based on substantial truck overloading and
back-haul opportunities for Iraq-bound traffic, which are expected to diminish
over the life of the project, the sensitivity analysis examines the impact of
higher transport charges.
7.5      The high economic rate of returr in the base case of the beneficiation
component of the Project (26.1%) is due to the relatively low unit investment
cost (US$13.17 per ton at a 15% discount rate and low operating costs (US$12.78
per ton) relative to the average revenue (US$37.61 per ton) in 1996, the first
year of full production of Al and A3 ore. The low capital cost is partially due
to the fact that many of the raw material input costs to the beneficiation plant
were included under the first loan and have been treated as sunk costs. The low
operating costs are due to relatively low stripping ratios at the mine site and
the allocation of certain mine operating costs to A2 production under the first
loan.
7.6      Sensitivitv Analysis.  The main project uncertainties for economic
analysis are future prices, the ability of the market to absorb the additional
rock production, project capital and operating costs, and transport costs. The
corresponding sensitivities were calculated:
Jordan - Beneficiation Plant Component - ERR - Sensitivity Apalysis

Base Case                                26.1
A. Phosphate Rock Price 20% lower            19.1
B. Capital Cost 20% higher                   22.7
C. Operating Costs 20% higher               24.0
D. Transport Costs 1JD higher                24.6
Source: Bank estimates.
7.7      The switching price for an ERR of 10% was calculated, indicating by how
much the rock price could drop before endangering the viability of the project.
For the ERR to fall to 10%, the assumed long-run cost of capital, the phosphate
price would have to fall 40% from its current level and remain at that depressed
level, relative to the prices assumed in the base case, through the life of the
project.

7.8      Market Absorptive Cagacity. The projects benefits are based on an
export tonnage of 1.5 mtpy. Although the analysls in Section III indicates that
JPHC will be able to market this additional tonnage without difficulty, there is
a minor risk of slower growth in world demand than that projected. Under this
scenario, Jordan's exports might expand more slowly than anticipated, and the
project might reach full production two years later than forecast. Under a
"slow growth" scenario, project production might develop as follows:
Jordan - Boneficiation Plant Proiect Comonent - Base Case.
Lower Demand Scenarios
(Million tons)
1.993    1994        .122k        1996
Base Case Exports           0.945       1.232       1.413        1.479
Lower Demand Case Exports   0.4&2       1.010       1.413        1.479
Source: Bank estimates.
With slower growth of production, the project benefits would be reduced
slightly, but the ERR would still be 24.0%.
2. Fertilizer Plant Rehabilitation Component
7.9      Economic Rate of Return. The estimated economic rate of return is
28.3%. The average annmal net benefit of plant rehabilitation, for economic
purposes is US$12.81 million at steady state production from 1998, and the net
present value of the project benefits at a 10% discount rate is US$37.9 million.
Project cost and analytical methodology were identical for financial and
economic rate of return calculations with these exceptions: (i) the Government
production tax of JD5/ton on phosphate rock and import tariffs of 22% on amonia
and 3S on sulphur and aluminum hydroxide, to which JPIC will be susceptible
beginning in 1994, have been deducted from operating costs; (ii) the "economic"
port tariff for phosphate rock exports of JD 0.143 per ton has been applied to
the transfer price calculation of phosphate rock.
7.10     Sensitivity Analysis. The results of sensitivity analysis for economic
purposes are shown below:

7.11     The switching price for an ERR of 10% was calculated, indicating how
much average export prices would have to fall below the prices used in the
base case for the component ERR to drop to 10%. Analysis shows that prices
would have to drop about 18%, to an equivalent US$180 per ton of bulk DAP and
US$294 per ton of phosphoric acid, in constant 1989 terms, before the ERR would
decline to 10%. These prices would be within about 7% of the lowest prices for
DAP and phosphoric acid reached (1986-1987) during the period since 1960, and
are considered unlikely to occur.
7.12     Market Absorptive Casacity.  Jordan's DAP exports in 1988, amounting to
626,398 tons to some 20 countries, represented about 2% of world DAP exports in
that year. Rehabilitation will increase combined DAP and phosphoric acid export
potential to less than 3% of current world DAP exports. JPMC is not anticipated
to have any difficulty selling the moderate additional amount of fertilizer or
phosphoric acid produced.
B. Foreign Exchange Balance and Employment
7.13     The benefits of the two project components accrue in direct foreign
exchange earnings and the profitability of these components translates directly
into foreign current benefits for the country. The foreign currency balance of
the project is extremely favorable. The cumulative foreign currency balance for
the beneficiation plant component (Annex 7-4), discounted at 10%, is JD132
million, equivalent to US$203 million, and JD65.0 million, equivalent to
US$100.0 million, for the fertilizer rehabilitation component (Annex 7-5). The
beneficiation plant component of the project will generate 350 jobs and, in
addition, 100 jobs in the transport sector.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.1       During negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
(a) With JPMC that it will:
(i)  maintain separate accounts for the Mining and Fertilizer units, as
well as consolidated accounts (para. 2.30);
(ii)  continue to have its annual audits completed by auditors
acceptable to the Bank and that audited financial statements
continue to be presented to the Bank within 6 months of the end of
each fiscal year (para. 2.30);
(iii) enforce and monitor the environmental and occupational health and
safety standards at the beneficiation plant and fertilizer plant
and ensure that the standards are maintained in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 4.36 and 4.38);
(iv) establish Project and Cost Control Units with company personnel of
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank (para.
4.59);



- 64 -
(v)  execute a contract, to terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank,
for Project management services for the rehabilitation of the
fertilizer plant (para. 4.60);
(vi) maintain a working ratio (working expenditures/current revenues)
below 0.8 (para. 6.25), and satisfactory debt service and long-term
debt/equity ratios of above 1.5 and 60/40 respectively (paras. 6.26
and 6.27); and
(viii) update annually its five-year investment plan in consultation with
the Bank at least six months prior to the beginning of the fiscal
year (para. 6.27);
(b) With the Government that it will, not later than June 30, 1990, or
such latar date as mutually agreed, submit proposals for the
financial and institutional arrangements for the rail transport of
phosphate rock for Bank review and comment (para. 5.4).
8.2      The proposed loan will become effective only upon receipt of
satisfactory evidence that all project-related loans with the Kuwait and Arab
Funds become effective (para. 4.53) and that JPHC has established Project and
Cost Control Units with company personnel of qualifications and experience
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.59). The execution of a Project Management
Services Agreement, to terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to assist
supervision of rehabilitation of the fertilizer plant will be a Condition of
Disbursement for the fertilizer component of the project (para. 4.60).
Recommendation
8.3      Subject to the foregoing, the Project would be suitable for a Bank loan
of US$25 million equivalent for a term of 17 years, including a grace period of
5 years, at standard variable interest rate.
