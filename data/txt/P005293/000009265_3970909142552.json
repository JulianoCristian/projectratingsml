Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: (a) with\n            relatively complex project designs, implementation schedules\n            must allow for finalization of technical aspects of a\n            two-stage International Commodity Body (ICB) process and\n            pre-qualification procedures; (b) even with complex project\n            components, substantial benefits can be realized if the\n            enterprise is run on an autonomous basis and along\n            quasi-commercial lines, has a committed management team and\n            experienced operational staff, and gets sufficient support\n            from the government as the major shareholder; (c) under\n            present governance, the Borrower faces substantial financing\n            constraints on its investment program; (d) mining is a high\n            risk business that is best suited for private investors who\n            can assume such risks, and not for using scarce fiscal\n            resources under uncertain conditions; (e) since the Borrower\n            is one of Jordan's leading companies and is engaged in\n            producing an internationally traded commodity, partial or\n            full privatization of the company can and should be\n            considered which could yield substantial financial and\n            economic benefits; and (f) corporate management must be\n            flexible enough in such cases to quickly adjust corporate\n            strategy to market fluctuations."}, "docdt": "1997-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
