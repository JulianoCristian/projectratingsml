million (US$\n            28 million equivalent) on the terms and conditions as set\n            out in the President's Memorandum. Directors commended\n            the authorities for continued efforts in improving\n            governance and efficiency in public financial management\n            including structural reforms to strengthen the phosphates,\n            cotton and energy sectors. They noted that the grant builds\n            upon reforms initiated under the three previous ERGGs but\n            acknowledged the capacity constraints and the need to\n            accelerate ongoing reforms in key economic sectors.\n            Directors also stressed the need for enhanced budget\n            formulation and execution, as well as, public procurement,\n            including the implementation of the new procurement law.\n            Finally, Directors welcomed the close coordination with\n            other donors, and noted the operation's relevance to\n            continued sustainable economic recovery and poverty reduction."}, "docdt": "2011-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
