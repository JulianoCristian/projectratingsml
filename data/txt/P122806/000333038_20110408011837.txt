The Executive Directors approved the Fourth Economic Recovery and Governance Grant to the Republic
of Togo in the amount of SDR 18 million (US$ 28 million equivalent) on the terms and conditions as set
out in the President's Memorandum.

Directors commended the authorities for continued efforts in improving governance and efficiency in
public financial management including structural reforms to strengthen the phosphates, cotton and energy
sectors. They noted that the grant builds upon reforms initiated under the three previous ERGGs but
acknowledged the capacity constraints and the need to accelerate ongoing reforms in key economic
sectors. Directors also stressed the need for enhanced budget formulation and execution, as well as, public
procurement, including the implementation of the new procurement law. Finally, Directors welcomed the
close coordination with other donors, and noted the operation's relevance to continued sustainable
economic recovery and poverty reduction.
