    FOURTH ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GOVERNANCE GRANT (ERGG-4)


                        GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY


Recipient:           Republic of Togo.

Implementing         The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) coordinates the
Agency:              implementation in close association with several line ministries.

Financing Data:      IDA Grant Amount: SDR 18 million (US$28 million equivalent).


Operation Type:      Stand-alone, IDA grant to be available upon effectiveness.

Main Policy Areas: The proposed grant focuses on two main policy areas: (i) public finance
                   management; and (ii) governance, transparency and efficiency in key
                   sectors of the economy (cotton, phosphates and energy).

Key Results          By December 2011: (i) spending units receive ceilings on expenditure
Indicator:           commitments two months in advance; (ii) all procurement notices and
                     contract awards reviewed by the General Procurement Department are
                     publicly available; (iii) NSCT's unit cost per ton reduced by 5 percent; (iv)
                     all criteria towards becoming an EITI candidate country are met; and (v)
                     CEET's turnover increased by 7 percent.

                     The proposed grant supports Government-owned reforms to improve
Program              governance, transparency and efficiency in public financial management as
Development          well as advance structural reforms aimed at strengthening key sectors of
Objective(s) and     economy (phosphates, cotton and energy).
Contribution to
Interim Strategy     The operation directly supports two pillars of the ISN and provides
Note (ISN):          financing for budgeted fiscal needs during 2011. The reforms supported by
                     the operation are critical to the Government's ability to use public
                     resources efficiently and effectively to support the country's economic and
                     social recovery. The grant is closely coordinated with assistance provided
                     to the Government's reform program through the LICUS TF Grant for
                     Economic Recovery and International Reengagement, the Enhanced HIPC
                     Initiative, the AfDB and EU budget support operations, and the IMF ECF
                     program.

Risks and risk   The main risks associated with the ERGG-4 are:
Mitigation:
                 Political risk. The peaceful outturn of the 2010 presidential elections has
                 clearly improved the socio-political outlook and hence reduced the
                 political risk presented by Togo. The main opposition party is represented
                 in the Government which is expected to promote the broad acceptance of
                 critical reforms. The PRSP process provided additional support to foster a
                 national consensus across Togolese society and among Government
                 representatives on a medium-term reform agenda.

                 Vested interests risks: Reform efforts aimed at improving governance of
                 the public sector and public enterprises could still face resistance. More
                 transparent and accountable practices in the phosphates, energy and cotton
                 sectors will enhance governance and reduce the scope for vested interests
                 to undermine reform effort in these critical sectors. In addition, the
                 proposed prior actions focus on areas in which the Government has already
                 demonstrated its commitment and ownership in the previous ERGGs.
                 Close coordination with the IMF, AfDB, EU, and bilateral donors and
                 intensified sector dialogue will help ensure that the Government continues
                 with its determination to implement the reforms in these sectors.

                 Macroeconomic risks to the economic recovery could stem from the
                 vulnerability of the Togolese economy to exogenous shocks (mostly
                 climate and commodity price shocks), or from a slower than expected
                 rebound from the global economic recovery. Fiscal sustainability can be
                 jeopardized if authorities do not resist the strong pressures to increase
                 public spending after the HIPC completion point. Pursuing sustainable
                 fiscal policies will require discipline and a targeted public communication
                 effort. There is also the risk that ongoing revenue mobilization reforms
                 will not generate the expected increase in revenues and that investments in
                 infrastructure will be pursued with excessive domestic financing, thus
                 driving up borrowing costs and crowding out private investment. In
                 addition, the extent to which the restructuring of the Togolese banking
                 sector will lead to increased lending to the economy remains uncertain.
                 Togo is also exposed to the impact of the euro appreciation on its major
                 international exports, phosphates and cotton. To mitigate the
                 macroeconomic risks, the IMF, through the ECF program, and IDA will
                 continue to closely monitor Togo's macroeconomic performance,
                 including providing ongoing assistance to the financial sector reform
                 program through the IDA-financed Financial Reform and Governance TA
                 Project.

                 Fiduciary risks. Despite recent reforms, fiduciary risk remains from
                 possible corruption or Government's failure to make effective and efficient
                 use of the public resources. After improvements through measures taken
                 under the previous ERGGs, including the creation of an internal audit unit



                                         vii
               and the Court of Accounts, improvement in fiduciary standards remains a
               central objective of the proposed operation. The prior actions of the
               present operation are expected to mitigate the fiduciary risk, and effective
               implementation will be closely monitored.

               Implementation capacity. Risks arise from the lack of sufficient
               professional staff and weak institutional capacity and coordination in the
               wake of the long recent history of socio-political instability and suspended
               foreign assistance. IDA projects and TF grants (Financial Sector and
               Governance TA Project supporting financial sector reform, LICUS grant
               for Economic Recovery and International Reengagement) have contributed
               to capacity enhancement. The IMF continues to provide assistance in
               public financial management and other donors (AfDB, EC and France) are
               also supporting capacity building efforts in various sectors.

           FOURTH ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GOVERNANCE GRANT


                                    1. INTRODUCTION

1.1     This program document proposes a Fourth Economic Recovery and Governance
Grant (ERGG-4) to the Republic of Togo in the amount of SDR 18 million (US$28 million
equivalent). This stand-alone, one-tranche development policy grant supports the Government's
efforts to pursue the implementation of governance reforms initiated under the ERGG, ERGG -2
and ERGG-3 operations approved by the Board in May 2008, April 2009, and May 2010
respectively. Specifically, the ERGG-4 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms to
improve public financial management (PFM) and governance of key sectors of the economy.

1.2    The reform policies supported by this grant are closely aligned with Togo's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) covering the period 2009-2011. The PRSP was adopted by
the Government in July 6, 2009 and presented to the IMF and IDA Boards in November and
December 2009, respectively. A first annual progress report (APR) of the PRSP, prepared by the
Government through a participatory progress and covering the July 2009 - June 2010 period, was
published in October 2010. A Joint Staff Advisory Note was discussed by the IMF Board on
December 10, 2010 and by the IDA Board on December 14, 2010 (jointly with the HIPC
Completion Point document). The proposed grant is also in line with the Bank's Interim Strategy
Note for Togo for the period FY08-10 presented to the IDA Board on May 29, 2008 and
complements the assistance provided through the IMF ECF program, the AfDB and the EU
budget support operations, and the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.

1.3     The implementation of the PRSP is expected to consolidate Togo's recovery from a
prolonged socio-political crisis which had a very negative impact on the country's economic
performance. Following the installation of Faure Gnassingbé in 2005, upon the death of
President Gnassingbé Eyadéma, a comprehensive political agreement (Accord Politique Global)
was reached among the main parties which eventually led to fair and transparent legislative
elections held on October 14, 2007. The relatively inclusive cabinet (but without the major
opposition party UFC) resulting from these elections has implemented political and economic
reforms to consolidate the reconciliation of the society and launch the recovery of the economy.
But just as the country tried to emerge from the one and a half decades long socio-political crisis,
its economy has been severely affected by the succession since 2008 of severe external and
internal shocks culminating with the negative impact of the 2009 global crisis on the country's
economic growth and public finances. On the political front, the organization of the presidential
elections which took place on March 4, 2010, was judged to be fair and transparent according to
the regional election observers, and the incumbent President Faure Gnassingbé was reelected
with 61 percent of the votes. The peaceful elections opened the way for an inclusive
Government, including cabinet members of the main opposition party UFC.

1.4   It is in this climate of renewed hope that the proposed grant aims to assist the
Togolese Government in continuing the implementation of its reform agenda to support the
country's economic and social recovery and lay the foundation for sustained pro-poor


                                                 1
growth. The recent shocks have exposed the fragility of Togo's institutions of economic and
financial management but also the resolve of policy makers to sustain their reform program.
Progress has been achieved during the first year of PRSP implementation in several areas. The
grant would continue to support Government-owned reforms to improve governance,
transparency and efficiency in public financial management as well as further advance structural
reforms aimed at strengthening governance and transparency in key sectors of the economy
(phosphates, cotton, and energy) launched under the previous ERGGs. These reforms would
achieve strengthened fiscal sustainability, improved economic governance and enhanced
transparency of State institutions and processes--critical elements for the country's economic
and social recovery.

1.5     The operation would provide financial support to the Government at a crucial
juncture, after the country has reached the HIPC completion point in December 2010. Full
delivery of HIPC and MDRI debt relief, and additional multilateral and bilateral debt relief,
reduced Togo's external debt burden significantly, and created fiscal space to improve progress
towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The proposed amount of this
grant is SDR 18 million (US$28 million equivalent). As Togo was at high risk of debt distress at
the time of the stipulations of the grant allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 15
period (FY09-FY11), the ERGG-4 is provided on grant terms.

         2. TOGO'S DEVELOPMENT CHALL ENGES AND PROSPECTS

                                             A.     B ACK GROUND

2.1     Togo is a small country in West Africa with a population of 6.8 million (2009). Its
main economic potential has been based on mining, agriculture, and transit trade. Togo's
highest export-earning sector is clinker/cement, produced from local limestone. The country's
next important exports are phosphates and cotton, processed and marketed by public enterprises.1
As recently as 2000, phosphate and cotton exports together accounted for over 50 percent of total
export revenue. However, since then, their share has declined dramatically. The phosphate
sector's exports dropped by more than 50 percent in a few years, from FCFA 33 billion in 2001
to FCFA 15 billion in 2007.2 The cotton sector's exports fell from a peak of FCFA 52 billion in
2003 to FCFA 12 billion in 2007. Lost export revenue has been offset through increased exports
to the West African sub-region by firms benefiting from free zone status. Togo is a member of
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS). As a small country, another aspect of its successful
development lies in its ability to capitalize on greater integration with its neighbors, notably by
further developing its deep-water port (the only one in the region) as a shipping hub through
private investments.

2.2    Togo's current economic situation has been significantly affected by its recent
history. The prolonged period of political instability, the weak economic and public financial

  They recovered in 2008 and reached 51 billion FCFA due to a short -lived 4-fold increase in world prices. Togo
was unable to take full advantage of this windfall due to the deterioration of production capacity. Phosphate export
revenues dropped again in 2009 and 2010.


                                                         2
management, and the related withdrawal of donor support 3 have negatively affected the
country's economic performance and dramatically reduced living standards for large segments of
the population. To support the government's financing needs, arrears were accumulated over
many years and the large state-owned companies were tapped to provide advances to the
Treasury. The situation was aggravated by pervasive mismanagement leading to large losses by
these state-owned enterprises (SOEs), in particular, in the cotton and phosphate sectors. As a
result of the dire financial situation of the main parastatals, several banks were burdened by an
excessive share of nonperforming loans­­in addition to being severely undercapitalized.

2.3     The 2007 parliamentary elections,4 deemed free and transparent by the
international community, marked a milestone in Togo's democratization process. They
were followed by donors' reengagement and support. After the resumption of EU cooperation
in November 2007 and the government's launching of economic reforms, several others donors
actively reengaged with the country. In this context, the first Economic Recovery and
Governance Grant (ERGG) formed part of a coordinated and interlinked strategy with the IMF,
the African Development Bank (AfDB), and other donor agencies to clear Togo's arrears;
resume normal relations with the country; and support the government's program of economic
reforms. The clearance of arrears and the economic reforms paved the way for Togo to advance
toward debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI, and strengthened the foundation for
economic and social recovery.

2.4      The rise in oil and food prices and the severe flooding in 2008 and 2010 and the
global recession in 2009 adversely impacted the performance of the Togolese economy.
These forces held down growth just as it was poised to improve in response to the economic
program and donor reengagement. As a result, although per capita GDP growth had begun to
rise, it stayed low (-0.1 percent and 0.7 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively). Despite the
recent economic reforms, Togo continues to be among the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Income per capita (US$440 in 2009 according to the Bank's Atlas methodology) is low
compared to Sub-Saharan Africa (US$1,1135) and Low-Income Countries (US$512) averages. 5
Progress has been achieved in certain areas toward reaching the Millennium Development Goals,
notably, the goals of universal primary education and the combat of HIV/AIDS. However, Togo
is unlikely to meet 6 of the 8 goals by the 2015 deadline.6

2.5     Togo's business environment is still constrained by two decades of underinvestment
in infrastructure, notably, transport and energy. The underinvestment led to high
production costs. The capacity of the administration to create an environment conducive to
private sector development clearly declined during the long sociopolitical crisis and donor
disengagement. Simultaneously, according to certain indicators, corruption increased, further
straining business operations.7 The lack of political and economic stability also had prompted the

  Donors disengaged in the 1990s. They began reengaging in 2007 following the 2007 Parliamentary elections.
4
  After the death in 2005 of President Gnassingbé Eyadéma, who had led Togo for 38 years, Togo undertook a
national reconciliation that culminated in multiparty parliamentary elections on October 14, 2007. International
observers considered the elections free and transparent.

private sector to adopt a wait-and-see attitude and postpone new investments. The country's
financial sector strategy and planned privatization of ailing state-owned banks is expected to
boost investor confidence and to improve the banking sector's capacity to finance the economy.
In the meantime, the clearance of government arrears to the private sector will provide some
much needed relief.

2.6     Recent reforms in public finance management (PFM) and in key sectors have
enhanced governance and paved the way for broader sector reforms. The Togolese
authorities have implemented a wide range of PFM reforms in budget preparation, budget
execution, budget controls, and public procurement. Measures to improve governance and
prepare reforms in the cotton, phosphate and energy sectors8, include:

         A strategic audit of the cotton sector and two financial audits of the former state-owned
         cotton company were carried out. The audits were followed by clearance of the cotton
         company's payment arrears to farmers, as well as the introduction of internal controls and
         cost savings.
         In the electricity sector, a Board of Directors for the electricity utility company have been
         established, new statutes harmonized with WAEMU corporate law have been adopted,
         and a five-year contract between CEET and the government has been signed.
         Important milestones were achieved in the phosphate sector, including the finalization of
         a strategic audit, preparation of a three-year-business plan, and adoption in March 2010
         of the phosphate sector strategy. In October 2010, after fulfilling all the required criteria,
         Togo was granted EITI candidate status.

2.7     Overall, Togo has achieved considerable progress during the past three years.
Nevertheless, going forward, significant institutional and economic challenges remain. They
include (i) continued strengthening of PFM and of economic governance, especially in
parastatals; (ii) creating an environment conducive to private sector investment, including
adequate infrastructure; and (iii) pursuing sustainable fiscal policies. The latter will imply
resisting pressures to increase government spending after the completion point, as public
expectations have risen. After reaching the HIPC decision point in November 2008, Togo arrived
at the completion point in December 2010, a milestone which significantly reduced its debt
burden and will free up fiscal space over time. To revive the economy and reduce poverty, the
Togolese authorities are seeking to consolidate macroeconomic stability and implement
structural reforms, while securing stepped-up technical and financial assistance from
development partners.

2.8    Real GDP growth showed a modest acceleration in 2009 and 2010 but remains
below potential due to the external environment. Economic growth in 2008 was depressed by
flood damage and surges in international oil and food prices. As a result of the countercyclical

  Other important reform includes the preparation of a strategy to strengthen Togo's fragile state-owned banks. The
restructuring of the financial sector is advancing: the largest bank has been placed under new management and
oversight; preparations are on track for the final call for bids for privatization of four banks; and a new privatization
law was passed by the National Assembly in October 2010

fiscal policies, real GDP growth started to recover in 2009. It reached 3.2 percent ­­above earlier
estimations (2.5 percent)- but lower than projected before the crisis unfolded (4 percent). GDP
growth in 2010 is estimated at 3.4 percent, driven mainly by the extractive industries, especially
clinker/cement, commerce and public works linked to public investment. The external
environment continues to impede and delay the expected recovery following Togo's protracted
domestic crisis.

2.9     Despite the steep increase in public investment, the government maintained a
prudent fiscal stance anchored by targets on the domestic primary balance, which was
slightly negative in 2009 and 2010 (-0.4 and -0.1 percent, respectively). The overall fiscal deficit
(on payment order basis) as a share of GDP reached 2.8 percent in 2009 and is estimated to be at
the same level in 2010. Public investment rose sharply in 2009 and 2010 to reach 5.5 percent and
6.7 percent of GDP, respectively, compared to 2.8 percent on average for 2005­08. This increase
was possible due to the implementation of measures to improve project planning and executi on,
particularly by speeding up steps in the expenditure chain, which greatly contributed to increase
the investment execution rate. This increase in public investment will contribute to reduce the
enormous infrastructure deficit while supporting economic activity during a period of recession.
This countercyclical fiscal policy has not compromised debt sustainability due to Togo's fiscal
discipline and access to external financing on grant or concessional terms. Current expenditures
increased in 2009 due to spending for emergency needs, largely as a response to the global
economic slowdown, but declined in 2010 (as a percentage of GDP) and are expected to continue
to decline.

2.10 The 2011 budget continues to have a pro-growth fiscal stance by emphasizing public
investment without compromising fiscal and debt sustainability. Public investment is
expected to reach 9.9 percent of GDP. Improved revenue collection­­thanks to the ongoing
reforms in the tax administration9 and disciplined current spending­­are expected to create space
for additional public investment.10 Nonetheless, in the event that revenues fall short, the
government is committed to ensure that expenditure execution is consistent with available
resources and prepared to cut spending if adequate financing is not forthcoming. While the pro-
growth fiscal policy is well rooted, there are risks that warrant close monitoring of fiscal
development. Other fiscal risks include the (i) public expectations for increased public spending
after the completion point; (ii) delicate financial situation of CEET (Togo's Electric Energy
Company), which has been exacerbated by the fixed charges required for the new Contour
Global thermal plant but somewhat mitigated by the recent adjustment in electricity tariffs; and
(iii) mismanagement of public companies and public banks in general, including the phosphate
company (SNPT). The latter's high operating costs are close to international prices, threatening
the financial situation of the company.

2.11 The current account deficit is estimated to increase in 2010 to 7.7 percent of GDP
(from 7.1 percent in 2009 and 6.4 percent in 2008) as imports continue to rise faster than
exports due to large public investment. Export performance continues to be subdued due to

important one-off contributing factor.

problems in the management of the cotton and phosphate sectors. 11 Exports in 2009 and 2010
(estimated) represented approximately 34 percent of GDP. On the other hand, imports increased
from 49.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 51.4 percent in 2010 (estimated). Remittances are
rebounding strongly after the global economic slowdown, increasing by 14 percent in the first
semester of 2010, compared to the first semester of 2009 (after falling 1.3 percent in 2009). FDI
also is estimated to have recovered, although it is not expected to reach its pre-crisis level until
2012. FDI is estimated to have increased by 3.3 percent in 2010, compared to 15 percent in 2009.
Gross international reserves (months of imports) are estimated to have decreased to 4.4 months
of prospective imports by end-December 2010, compared to 5.2 months in 2009 and 4.9 months
in 2008.

2.12 Monetary developments have been favorable in 2009 and 2010. After a sharp increase
in prices linked to global surges in food and oil prices in 2008, inflation decelerated sharply to
around 2 percent in 2009 and is projected to remain stable around that level. Following the
rehabilitation of the banking sector, undertaken in end-2008, both deposits and credit to the
private sector have grown, reflecting increased confidence in the financial system and a
resumption of financial intermediation. The increases in money supply have not led to
inflationary pressures.

2.13 The Government continues to successfully implement the three-year IMF-supported
ECF arrangement and the IMF Board completed the fifth review on December 10, 2010. All
the quantitative targets through June 2010 were achieved, and good progress was made with the
structural reforms launched under the ECF-supported program which will end in August 2010.
The ECF-supported program aims to revive economic growth and improve living conditions
within a stable macroeconomic environment by (i) bringing public debt to a sustainable level
through gradual fiscal adjustment and HIPC/MDRI debt relief; (ii) facilitating the resumption of
external assistance; (iii) increasing resources for infrastructure, health, and education;
(iv) strengthening fiscal governance; (v) restructuring fragile banks; and (vi) reforming the
business environment and state-owned enterprises.

              C.    M ACROECONOMIC O UTLOOK AND D EB T S USTAINABILITY

2.14 A modest rebound is expected in 2011-13 (see Table 2.1 and Annex 6) driven largely
by the lagged effects of the countercyclical fiscal policies and continued implementation of the
large public investment program. Growth is expected to be around 4 percent in 2011-13. A
further economic revival will require improved business confidence, growing regional trade, and
a rebound in cotton and phosphate production after the collapse of recent years. Over the
medium-term, growth would be sustained by higher foreign direct investment (e.g. in banking,
telecoms and phosphate sectors, and the port), improved financial intermediation and upgrades to
public infrastructure.

2.15 Inflation is expected to be contained over the medium term, anchored in the
WAEMU currency union and fiscal prudence consistent with the regional monetary policy
stance. The regional monetary-exchange rate arrangement is expected to ensure monetary and
price stability with inflation at about 1.5 to 2.0 percent in the medium-term. Nonetheless,
inflation could be erratic in the event of unfavorable weather conditions (droughts or heavy
floods) or further volatility in world food and oil prices.

2.16 External conditions are likely to remain challenging in the medium-term. Togo's
current account deficit is projected at about 7 percent of GDP over the period 2011-13, with
imports projected to remain high at approximately 51 percent of GDP driven by public
investment. The balance of payments will stay vulnerable to terms of trade shocks (in particular
from oil prices) and further exchange rate volatility of the Euro (to which Togo's currency value
is fixed) vis-à-vis the US dollar. Exports are expected to remain at approximately 33 percent of
GDP in the medium term due to the weaker global growth and demand despite the expected
recovery of Togo's phosphate and cotton sectors. FDI and private medium- and long-term capital
inflows are expected to begin to recover, as economic confidence benefits from a continuing
commitment to economic and political reform.

2.17 Despite an increase in domestically-financed investment Togo's fiscal balances are
expected to remain consistent with fiscal and debt sustainability. While capital expenditures
are expected to increase from 6.7 percent in 2010 to around 10 percent during 2011 -13, current
expenditures are expected to remain at approximately 15 percent. The envisaged primary fiscal
deficit in the order of 0.3 percent of GDP would be possible thanks to the ongoing measures to
improve revenue mobilization. Revenues are expected to increase from 17 percent of GDP in
2010 to approximately 19 during 2011-13. Pursuing a sustainable medium-term fiscal position


                                               7
will require managing the pressures to increase Government spending after the HIPC completion
point, as public expectations may surpass resource availability.

2.18 The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed
operation. The Government has generally demonstrated a satisfactory track record in
maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies that are sustainable over the medium term. The
framework is supported by an IMF ECF program which has been on-track since the ECF
arrangement was approved in April 2008.

Debt Sustainability

2.19 Togolese authorities successfully implemented all the triggers for reaching the
completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative (see Annex 5). The first Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was approved by the Council of Ministers on July 6, 2009 and
its implementation has been satisfactory. The fifth review under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) arrangement was completed on December 10, 2010, with all quantitative criteria met. All
other triggers, including those in the areas of public financial management, governance, debt
management and social sectors were fully implemented. The Completion Point Document and
the JSAN were approved by the World Bank Board on December 14, 2010. The HIPC assistance
in PV terms was estimated at the completion point at US$282 million, of which US$155 million
was delivered by multilateral creditors and US$127 million by bilateral and commercial
creditors. Togo did not qualify for topping-up under the enhanced HIPC Initiative based on end-
2009 debt data. This relief represented an overall reduction of 19 percent in the PV of all public
and publicly guaranteed external debt as of end-December 2007, after application of traditional
debt relief mechanisms.

2.20 Upon reaching the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, Togo also
qualified for additional debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
Debt relief under the MDRI covered almost all remaining debt service obligations to IDA and
the African Development Fund (AfDF). MDRI relief reduced nominal debt service by
US$749 million over a period of 39 years. 12 Full delivery of HIPC, additional multilateral and
bilateral assistance beyond HIPC, and MDRI debt relief at the completion point reduced Togo's
external debt burden significantly. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio fell from 272.0 percent at
end-2009 to 77.2 percent at end-2010. Subsequently, the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio is expected
to increase gradually to 114.6 percent at end-2029 due to new borrowing. Togo's debt service
ratios are projected to improve as well. The debt service-to-revenue ratio would decrease from
11.9 percent in 2010 to 5.1 percent in 2012. Thereafter it would rise to 7.9 percent in 2015­17
due to debt service associated with the IMF's ECF and expected repayment of commercial loans.
From 2020 onwards it will rise gradually due to debt service associated with projected new
borrowing. The debt service-to-exports ratio is projected to fall from 6.0 percent to an average of
3.9 percent in 2010­19 and 3.0 percent in 2020­29. However, the future evolution of these
indicators will be sensitive to the macroeconomic assumptions, particularly exports and the terms
of new external financing.

   Debt relief assistance provided by the World Bank totaled to US$665.7 million of which US$129.1 million were
arrears clearance and US$536.6 corresponded to MDRI.

2.21 The LIC DSA indicates that Togo is at moderate risk of debt distress post-HIPC
completion point and debt vulnerability will depend on strong and continued efforts to
mitigate the risk of adverse shocks and prudent debt management. While Togo's debt
burden was substantially reduced following the HIPC completion point, it remains vulnerable to
a number of shocks. Togo's debt dynamics are particularly sensitive to lower growth and lower
concessionality of new financing. These results highlight that positive debt dynamics after the
completion point depend on pursuing sound fiscal policies, especially a prudent debt strategy and
sustainable fiscal balances, and on promoting economic growth, especially exports, through
reforms of the business climate and key sectors.

                   3. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM

3.1     In July 2009, Togo adopted the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which
builds on the strategy laid out in the Interim Strategy for Poverty Reduction (I-PRSP). The
PRSP was presented to the Boards of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International
Development Association (IDA) in November and December, 2009, respectively. Drawing on
lessons learnt from the implementation of the I-PRSP, the full PRSP lays out the strategy for
growth and poverty reduction for the period 2009-2011. The PRSP is coupled with a Plan of
Priority Actions (PAP) which details the pluri-annual planning of actions, programs and
measures. The ultimate objective of the PRSP is to achieve effective and sustainable
improvement of people's living conditions by addressing the principal causes of poverty.




                                                 9
3.2     The PRSP is a comprehensive strategy covering most of the challenges and areas of
action to foster growth and reduce poverty. It is based on four strategic pillars, with the first
three common to the I-PRSP, which are supported by the ISN:13

     (i)    the strengthening of governance, with a focus on political, institutional and economic
            governance;
     (ii)   consolidation of the bases for strong and sustained growth with measures to reform
            state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, improve the business environment,
            strengthen regional integration and trade, revive agricultural production, rehabilitate
            infrastructure, and improve management of natural resources and the environment;
     (iii) development of human capital with a focus on improving access to and the quality of
           basic education and health services; and
     (iv) reduction of regional imbalances and promotion of community development.

For these pillars, the PRSP integrates cross-cutting themes related to the environment,
HIV/AIDS, gender and human rights.

3.3     The process of preparation of the PRSP encompassed the participation of all
development actors and regions, thus ensuring that the PRSP articulates the identified
country's priorities to reduce poverty and promote sustainable growth. It involved the
private sector, religious groups, the non-Government organizations, the Parliament and the
technical and financial partners. There were three main levels of expanded consultation: (i)
drafting and adoption of the road map of the process; (ii) diagnostic phase; and (iii) final drafting
of the PRSP. The development partners, including the World Bank and IMF, were consulted at
these various stages in order to facilitate implementation of the principle of alignment advocated
in the Paris Declaration.

3.4     The ERGG-4 will continue to support the implementation of the Government
reform agenda. The proposed operation would continue to engage the Bank in policy and
technical dialogue in the same two pillars as previous operations: (i) the strengthening of
governance with the aim of improving budget formulation, execution and controls, and public
procurement; and (ii) consolidation of the bases for strong and sustained growth including
through reforms in key sectors of the economy (phosphate, cotton and energy sectors). ERGG
and ERGG-2 also supported reforms in the financial sector. Based on the principle of avoiding
cross-conditionality, this sector is not covered by the ERGG-4 (as it was not by the ERGG-3) as
it is currently supported by the IMF ECF program. It is also being supported through the IDA-
financed Financial Sector and Governance TA project approved by the Board in March 2009.
The financial support provided through the ERGG-4 will further narrow the gap between the cost
of implementing key elements of the PRSP and resources available from the Government's own
domestic revenues and other donor support. The next sections highlight the salient features of
the current situation in these areas of reform as well as the Government's main areas of policy
efforts and specific measures supported by the proposed grant. The Government's policy matrix
is presented in Annex 2.

13
  The ISN is based on three interrelated pillars: (i) improving economic governance and transp arency; (ii)
promoting economic recovery and sustainable development; and (iii) addressing urgent social needs.

Current issues

3.5    Since mid-2006 the government has taken critical steps to strengthen public
expenditure management. Nonetheless, important challenges remain, as identified by key
analytical work. Togo has established a track record on fiscal management and accounting
reforms under IDA-financed ERGGs and the IMF Staff Monitored Program. Recent analytical
work­­the 2009 Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR)­­notes that the budget performance has improved since the 2006 PEMFAR, driven
primarily by reforms of tax and customs administration and better expenditure management.
Nevertheless, the analytical work also pointed to outstanding public expenditure management
challenges that should be addressed. Key recommendations of the report include (i) enhance the
quality of the budget and its preparation; (ii) improve the prioritization of expenditures by
gradually instituting sectoral MTEFs that are coherent with the central MTFF and the PRSP; (ii)
disseminate information on financial operations of the state (iii) ensure a better monitoring of the
public entities other than the state; (iv) enhance treasury management planning; (v) improve the
operationalization of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (SIGFIP); (vi)
improve the dissemination of information on the budget and its execution; (vii) strengthen the
capacity of the Court of Accounts; and (viii) strengthen the internal audit and inspection unit.

3.6    Since the completion of the 2009 PEMFAR several important measures have been
taken to improve the institutional framework for budget preparation and for budget
execution and external controls. These measures include (i) setting up a committee to follow
up the implementation of the new set of WAEMU Directives adopted in 2009 by the regional
council of ministers of finance; (ii) gradually introducing MTEFs for Health, Education and
Agriculture; (iii) operationalizing SIGFIP on a pilot basis at the central level and five regional
Treasury offices; (iv) initiating the rationalization and simplification of the expenditure chain by
reducing redundant controls and the use of exceptional expenditure execution procedures; and
(v) operationalizing the Court of Accounts, which initiated functions in the last quarter of 2009. 14
The Treasury accounts and drafts of the Budget Execution Laws (Lois de Règlement) for 2007
and 2008 have been transmitted to the Court of Accounts for review. However, delay in training
the judges is hampering their ability to competently audit the documents.

3.7     Progress was also achieved in reporting, cash management, and accounting. Monthly
tables of fiscal operations (Tableaux de Bord) have been regularly elaborated since January
2009. The Government Financial Statistics (TOFE) and budget execution reports are published
on the website of the Permanent Secretariat for the M onitoring of Reforms (SP-PRPF). With
regard to cash management, significant progress has been achieved. Toward creating a single
treasury account, the number of bank accounts held by public administration entities has been
considerably reduced. Based on the results of the April 2010 survey of treasury accounts, 1,117
accounts, or over 88 percent of the 1,259 accounts, have been closed. Domestic arrears clearance
also has advanced, although less than initially planned, because many eligible creditors have no t
come forward to make claims. As of end-August, 2010, the Treasury had paid approximately 65
percent of the value of the arrears and 37 percent of the claimants.

14
     The judges were nominated in July 2009 and took office in September 2009.


                                                         11
3.8   In public procurement, the major weaknesses identified by the 2009 PEMFAR
were:

       Access by public to information on procurement outcomes is insufficient.
       The legal and regulatory framework in force did not permit strict observance of the
       fundamental principles of transparency, equitable treatment, and economy applicable to
       public procurement. More specifically, the framework encouraged the use of
       noncompetitive and sole-source methods.
       The institutional framework was ineffective and the national tender board (CNM) had too
       broad a role, combining both the regulatory and the control functions, and inadequate
       capacity.
       The audits, internal and external controls, and anticorruption measures were nonexistent
       or ineffective, and none of the procurement-related information was disseminated.

3.9    Acknowledging the need to improve the procurement system, the government has
taken steps to address the most urgent issues. As a first step, the government adopted a
procurement reform action plan, based on the assessment provided in the 2009 PEMFAR. Key
reforms implemented since then include the (a) adoption of a new procurement law and a new
procurement code, which are now in line with WAEMU Procurement Guidelines, in June and
November 2009, respectively; and (b) establishment in December 2009 of the Procurement
Regulatory Authority and the National Directorate for the Audit of Public Procurement; (c)
monthly publication of summaries of procurement contracts, including sole-source contracts,
since June 2009, on the Chamber of Commerce newsletter and on the SP-PRPF website
(www.togoreforme.com); and (d) creation of a procurement newspaper and website in December
2010, where all procurement notices and contract awards are published. The latter was an
important step to further increase transparency in the purchase of goods and services with public
resources.

Medium Term Government's reform program

3.10 Despite the several reforms initiated, many weaknesses remain in the public finance
management system. To address them, a three-year Action Plan covering 2010­12 was
adopted by the council of ministers on September 29, 2010. Building on the 2009 PEMFAR
and with the objective of aligning the Togolese PFM system with the international standards the
Action Plan includes the following priorities: (i) adoption and transposition of the WAEMU new
PFM directives into the national legislation; (ii) improvement of domestic revenue collection and
external resources mobilization; (iii) preparation by all line ministries of sectoral MTEFs on the
basis of the ceilings determined by the MTFF; (iv) further simplification and shortening of the
expenditure chain, while strengthening the capacity of entities for internal and external control;
(v) the full roll-out of the SIGFIP in all its functionalities, including its accounting module, to all
ministries, institutions, and regions, to improve coordination between line ministries and the
Treasury and to better track priority spending; and (vi) improvement of quality and timeliness of
the within-year budget reports and the annual financial statements.

3.11 Moreover, the government plans to implement additional actions to further
strengthen the public procurement system. During the preparation of the PEMFAR report, the


                                                  12
government agreed to base the procurement reform on a medium - and long-term vision to
improve transparency and efficiency of the system in line with the WAEMU Procurement
Guidelines and international good practices. Specific actions planned by the government are:

          Publish the outcomes of all public tenders including the state enterprises and
          concessions in the procurement journal and on the website;
          Development of a Roadmap to implement the information management system for
          public procurement (SIGMAP) and connection to the SIGFIP system;
          Elaboration of procurement standards document; and
          Development of a legal framework for Public and Private Partnership.

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-4

3.12 The proposed ERGG-4 would support policy actions critical to deepening PFM
reforms, including reforms to improve public procurement, as identified in the
Government's medium term action plan. The prior actions are the following:

   (i)    Preparation of draft decrees and laws to implement the 6 UEMOA Directives pertaining
          to public finances;
   (ii)   Publication of the 2010 quarterly budget execution reports and submission to
          Parliament of the draft 2011 budget law with a medium-term expenditure framework
          (MTEF) for each of the education, health and agriculture sectors;
   (iii) Adoption of a treasury management planning order;
   (iv) Submission by the SOTOCO's liquidator, CEET, SNPT, and Togo télécom of their
        respective 2007 and 2008 financial statements to the Court of Accounts; and
   (v)    Development and operation of the procurement website, and publication and circulation
          of the Procurement Newspaper.

3.13 The prior actions supported by the ERGG-4 will contribute to (i) the harmonization
of the public finance management framework within the WAEMU directives; (ii) the
consolidation of the practice of preparing and disseminating quarterly budget execution reports
as well as building technical expertise on budget execution reporting; (iii) adequate treasury
planning, with spending units being timely informed on the ceiling for expenditure
commitments; (iv) external auditing of public enterprises; and (v) the enhancement of
procurement controls.

3.14 Other critical PFM actions were identified as HIPC completion triggers, aimed at
further enhancing transparency in budget formulation and budget controls, including on
poverty-reducing expenditures. Specifically, these were: (i) adoption of a mechanism to track
public expenditures for poverty reduction on the basis of a functional expenditure classification
and publication of at least two quarterly reports on these expenditures covering a period of at
least two consecutive quarters preceding the completion point; (ii) appointment of judges for the
Court of Accounts, provided with work space, equipment and materials, and submission of the
draft Budget Execution law and draft General Treasury Balance to the Court of Accounts and


                                               13
Parliament for at least one fiscal year preceding the completion point; (iii) adoption of a decree
creating the Procurement Regulatory Authority in conformity with the WAEMU Procurement
Directives, nomination of its managerial staff, and providing them with an adequate budget; and
monthly publication in a public procurement gazette or on a government website of a summary
of all signed contracts, including sole source contracts and concessions, for at least six months
immediately preceding the completion point; (iv) consolidation of external and domestic debt
data under a single unit charged with all public debt; and (v) publication of an annual report
providing accurate and complete data on external and domestic public debt, within six months
after the end of the year for at least one year immediately preceding the completion point. The
triggers were met (see Annex 5).

Current issues

3.15 After the significant fall in cotton's production in recent past years, with potential
important impact on rural poverty, production in 2010­11 is expected to rebound
significantly, thanks to the higher international prices and adequate and timely supply of
inputs by the Cotton Company (NSCT). Cotton is the country's main cash crop. Its share in
exports accounted for 19.3 percent of total exports in 2003, but declined to 4.4 percent in 2009
and 2.8 percent in 2010 (estimated). The decline in cotton production was the result of weak
management and governance in the sector, in addition to lower international cotton prices and
reduced producer prices. The latter also were affected by the appreciation of the Euro (to which
the CFAF is pegged) versus the US dollar, the unit in which cotton prices are quoted.
Nevertheless, cotton is potentially an important source of income. In the early 2000s, 300,000
farmers (50 percent of the rural labor force) used to cultivate cotton. Many of them are expected
to return to the cotton as the sector organization improves, especially in northern Togo, which
has few alternatives. As most of these cotton farmers are in the poorer northern and central parts
of the country, the impact on poverty could be substantial. Cotton also can have a strong impact
on the development of food crops cultivated in association or in rotation with cotton and
benefitting from residual fertilizer used for cotton. As a result of higher international prices (and
parallel rise in producer price) and adequate and timely supply of inputs by NSCT, the 2010­11
campaign is promising, and production is expected to reach 50,000 tons.

3.16 To restore the confidence of farmers and creditors in the cotton sector important
reforms are ongoing since 2008, most notably the dissolution of SOTOCO (effective in
2009) and the creation, in 2009, of a new cotton company, the New Cotton Society of Togo
(NSCT). Weak governance and poor management in the SOTOCO (Société Togolaise de
Coton) company led to the accumulation of arrears to producers, discouraging production. 15 The
weak management of SOTOCO and poor procurement procedures and governance contributed to
major losses and resulted in accumulation of arrears to producers. Moreover, the cotton
parastatal's financial losses were a drain on the public Treasury, and its nonperforming loans
with local banks undermined the banking sector's overall capacity to finance the economy . As a
result the government decided to liquidate SOTOCO and created the NSCT , with a capital of 2

15
   SOTOCO had a monopoly on ginning and marketing, and was in charge of distributing agricultural inputs to
farmer groups on a credit scheme repaid with the sale of seed cotton.


                                                    14
billion FCFA. Of this, 60 percent is held by the government and 40 percent by the producers
association, Fédération Nationale des Groupements de Producteurs de Coton (FNGPC). The
new company inherited the assets of the former SOTOCO and has taken over its activities.
NSCT's first year of operation (2009­10) was rather disappointing, as production fell to 28,000
tons, mainly due to the difficult transition from SOTOCO to NSCT. The second campaign
(2010­11) is promising, with production expected to reach 40,000 tons.

3.17 Despite this rebound, the situation of NSCT is fragile. The entry of a private
operator in the capital of NSCT, as planned in the government's reform program for the
sector, is seen as critical to bring to the new company the technical and managerial
expertise required and to recapitalize it. The company is oversized, entailing fixed costs
considerably higher than in most West African cotton companies. Despite the rise in world
prices, NSCT is not able to generate sufficient cash flow to upgrade its equipment and finance
the sector's development. Finally, its technical expertise needs to be strengthened.

Medium Term Government's reform program

3.18 Following the financial audits of SOTOCO and the strategic audit undertaken in
2007-8 the government adopted a medium-term cotton sector reform program. The findings
of the financial audits highlighted pervasive commercial and financial mismanagement across all
layers of the company, notably in procurement, which led to large financial losses and mounting
debts, including arrears to cotton farmers. On the basis of these audits, the authorities adopted a
medium-term cotton sector reform program, which included the dissolution of SOTOCO and
creation of NSCT, with the government and FNGPC as the shareholders in the first stage. The
entry in the capital of a strategic industrial private partner is planned for the second stage,
resulting in the privatization of NSCT. The upcoming IDA-funded PASA (Agriculture Sector
Support Project) will finance the NSCT privatization study. To improve the financial
management of the company the audit report also recommended the implementation of an
analytical accounting system.

3.19      Actions recently taken or ongoing include:

           Adoption in January 2009 of a new cotton purchase price mechanism linked to world
           cotton fiber prices to ensure that farmers receive a fair proportion (61 ­63 percent,
           depending on the volume of production) of the FOB value of the cotton fiber.
           Development of a regulatory framework for the cotton sector that specifies the roles,
           responsibilities, and obligations of sector stakeholders.
           Introduction of a cost accounting system to reinforce the financial management.
           Strengthening the producers association (FNGPC), weakened by the past years' cotton
           crisis. This should contribute to the (i) improvement in the distribution of agricultural
           inputs among its members and; (ii) recover of the corresponding price without
           generating internal debts within farmer groups. In the recent past, such debts
           discouraged farmers from cultivating cotton.




                                                 15
      The following planned steps in the reform process are the entry of a private operator and the
      creation of an interprofession (grouping NSCT and FNGPC) in charge of the sector
      coordination.

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-4

3.20 The proposed ERGG-4 would support two policy actions judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the cotton sector:

     (i)    Implementation of an analytical accounting system for NSCT which is consistent with
            the recommendations of the Assessment Report.
     (ii)   Provision of training to farmer leaders toward a better participation within the NSCT
            board.

3.21 The prior actions supported by the ERGG-4 will contribute to: (i) the improvement
of the financial management of NSCT by having in place an accounting system that delivers
information on the cost structure thus contributing to the rationalization of NSCT's costs; and (ii)
strengthening farmers' representational abilities on the Board of NSCT to ensure their
participation in the decision-making process, with the objective of preventing the accumulation
of arrears to farmers or the taking of decisions that may discourage farmers from cultivating
cotton. Strengthening FNGPC, including by providing training, 16 started through an EU-funded
project in 2009 and 2010 and will be continued by the PASA.

Current issues

3.22 The recently achieved EITI candidate status was an important step to improve
governance in the sector. Nonetheless, poor sector governance still hampers performance
and raises production costs. The company faces productivity problems due to outdated
equipment, electricity shortages, and major governance problems in its equipment and spare
parts procurement practices. As a result, despite the significant investments during the first phase
of the rehabilitation process investments yielded only modest production gains. The state-owned
Société Nouvelle des Phosphates du Togo (SNPT) has made substantial investments in the
acquisition of new equipment and spare parts aiming to restore production to approximately 1
million metric tons (mt) of phosphate. 17 However, the year-to-year increase from August 2009 to
August 2010 was 8.5 percent, from an already low base. In the 1990s, Togo was among the 5
largest phosphate producers in Africa, exporting more than 3 million tons. Current producti on is
only 25 percent of capacity, at approximately 800,000 tons.

   SNTP was created in May 2007 following the demise of the International Fertilizer Group Togo (IFG-TG). SNTP
operates two phosphate mines. The mine ore is transported by train on a 46km railway system owned by SNPT to
the ore treatment plant located in Kpémé.

3.23 The sector's weaknesses and the fall in international prices have led to a significant
drop in the value of phosphate exports. Phosphate prices fell from the boom-period average of
US$125.90 to approximately US$79.30 per mt in 2010. As a result, phosphate exports fell from
CFAF 40.3 billion in 2009 to CFAF 28.1 billion in 2010, corresponding to 6.5 percent of the
total exports in 2010, compared to 10 percent in 2009. As a result of the inefficiencies of the
sector, Togo's phosphates are ranked in the high quartile of the global cost curve for the current
level of production, with total costs ranging from US$70 to US$80, just slightly below the
international price. It is critical to rapidly address these inefficiencies to ensure the economic and
financial viability of SNPT as well as to cushion the national budget against potential contingent
liabilities.

3.24 Significant capital investments are needed to further develop the phosphate sector
and to renew its potential as a growth pole for Togo. While current reserves are nearing
exhaustion, new untapped carbonated reserves could last for 100 years. However, a shift to
exploit carbonated reserves would require new technological skills and significant improvements
in managerial capability, as well as funding. The shift also would require that the government
place greater emphasis on strengthening social and human resources as well as environmental
management skills to compete effectively in an international market. The government has
commissioned a strategic and financial audit of the phosphate sector to examine various options
for further development.

3.25 Based on the audit results, an estimated US$430­US$480 million of new investment
is needed to revive the sector and develop its potential. The strategic options considered
included partial-to-full privatization, restructuring, and spinning off non-core operations. The
recovery of production would be achieved in three phases. The first phase, which has started, is
focusing on rehabilitating the production system to restore the nominal capacity of 3 million tons
of phosphate rock. The second phase would shift production from the declining reserves of
siliceous rock toward the extensive resources of carbonated phosphate ore to double output. The
third phase would establish the basis for an integrated system with a target of 10 million mt of
treated phosphate rock, some of which would be transformed into 1 million tons of phosphoric
acid. Key to the implementation of this strategy is the government's ability to attract a strategic
partner in the medium term that could facilitate the modernization and expansion of the
phosphate sector.

3.26 Despite the recognition of the valued added that a strategic private partner could
bring to the sector, unsuccessful past private participation is holding back the opening of
the SNPT's capital to the private sector. Togo's relatively high quality phosphates, the upside
potential provided by the significant resources of carbonate phosphates and the easy access
continue to attract private sector interest. Private-public partnerships in phosphate mining date
back to 1957 when Compagnie Togolaise des Mines du Benin (CTMB) was established with
majority private ownership. In 1974, responding to a wave of nationalism, the State increased its
shareholding and eventually took full ownership, creating the state-owned Office Togolais des
Phosphates (OTP) which fully controlled production and marketing of phosphates until poor
governance and mismanagement drove the company to near bankruptcy in the late 1990s. In
2001, the government attempted a rehabilitation program of OTP emphasizing private
participation and management for a quick turn-around of the sector performance. Through a
noncompetitive and nontransparent process, the International Fertiliser Group-Togo (IFG-Togo)


                                                 17
was formed as a 50­50 joint venture between the Togolese state and Brifco.18 Once again, the
targets of the restoration program remained elusive. In 2003, following a dispute with Brifco , the
government broke off the partnership and eventually liquidated IFG -Togo and created the
Société Nouvelle des Phosphates du Togo (SNPT) as a fully state-owned entity.

3.27 While reluctant to immediately launch a second attempt, there is the recognition
that a private partner would be needed to step up production to the 6­10 million mt range
and move to the industrial phase of phosphoric acid production. Past negative experiences
have made the government wary of private participation and as a result, the government is trying
to implement the new phosphate sector reform strategy by using internal resources and a loan
from the local bank, BTCI. However, reserving privatization for downstream processing
activities will prove challenging as it will be difficult for a private partner to be interested in the
downstream processing if they do not control the upstream source. As yet, no concrete and
specific plans have been made. However, the government is in informal discussions with three
industrial operators about an eventual partnership. The World Bank has offered to accompany
the authorities with technical advice, if requested.

Medium Term Government's reform program

3.28 During the past years, the government has initiated some reforms to address legal
institutional issues affecting investors' risk perceptions about the phosphate sector. To
strengthen the sector's management and development prospects, the government has launched
some initiatives to address the legal gaps and institutional challenges of the mining sector. The
government completed a strategic audit of the phosphate sector and prepared a three -year
business plan that served as input in the formulation of a phosphate sector strategy. The strategy
was formally adopted by the Cabinet in March 2010 and the first phase has started. A new
mining regulation has been drafted and is being reviewed before submission to the Cabinet. The
old OPT-era operational manual is being updated to provide better guidance on human resources
and procurement issues. Concurrently, a Staff Manual has been drafted and is under review.
Financial controls are being put in place and the role of the Comptroller is being reinforced. A
consultant has drafted a computerization program of procurement, inventory control, and
maintenance-scheduling activities. To strengthen corporate social responsibility, the Ministry of
Mines has drafted mine-driven community development guidelines, which were approved by
Cabinet and are being examined by a parliamentary commission.

3.29 Important milestones were reached to increase the transparency and governance in
the sector. The government prepared a detailed action plan and a budget for the activities that
are to be implemented under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), thus
meeting the last criteria to become an EITI candidate. Togo's application was formally accepted.
On October 19, 2010, Togo was granted Candidate Status by the International EITI Board and
has two years to achieve EITI Validation Status. This is expected to significantly promote and
support improved governance in the sector through the full publication and verification of
company payments and government revenues. The audit exercise has already commenced with

18
   IFG-Togo signed a 40-month management agreement with a mission to restore production to 3 million tons,
reduce production costs, service OTP's debt, and prepare the sector for an injection of additional private capital into
a phosphoric acid plant project.

the publication of the reconciliation results of the 2008 and 2009 revenues generated from
phosphate sales with payments received by the public Treasury as an introduction to the EITI
program.

3.30 To address the challenges of the sector, it is important to properly carry out and
deepen the initiated reforms. Proper execution and completion of the reforms initiated could
address many of the concerns of potential strategic partners. Therefore, the immediate areas of
sector reform would involve firm- and sector-level measures including (i) updating the
regulatory framework (in particular, modernizing the existing Mining Code, harmonizing it with
the guiding principles of ECOWAS and WAEMU, and preparing the attendant regulations); (ii)
improving internal controls and corporate governance by clarifying and implementing
operational policies and regulations with respect to financial management, i nventory control, and
procurement of spare parts; (iii) streamlining the organizational structure and optimizing the
utilization of human resources; (iv) introducing CSR standards to address the social and
environmental concerns of affected populations; and (v) concurrently conducting a competitive
search for a strategic partner for investment in the second and third phase of SNPT rehabilitation.

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-4

3.31 The proposed ERGG-4 would support a policy action judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the phosphate sector that is the adoption of a detailed action plan and
budget for the activities that are to be implemented under EITI-Togo. This prior action is
expected to strengthen governance by improving transparency and accountability thus
contributing to greater private sector and donor confidence.

3.32 In addition, the HIPC completion point triggers included an action in the phosphate
sector to ensure the transparency of the financial flows in the sector. The implementation of
regular public reporting of payments to, and revenues received by, the government for the
phosphate sector in line with this aspect of the EITI criteria, with a recent annual report during at
least the year immediately preceding the year in which the completion point is reached. This was
implemented.

Current issues

3.33 Progress has been made in ensuring energy security with the purchasing power
agreement for 100 MW from Contour Global with support from IFC. The distribution of
electricity is handled by the state-owned power utility, Compagnie d'Energie Electrique de Togo
(CEET).19 Until recently, imported electricity was provided only by the Communauté Electrique
du Benin (CEB), a joint venture between Benin and Togo.20 Under this arrangement, Togo's
power supply depended up to 80 percent on power imports through Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, and,

19
   CEET has been a state-owned company since its foundation. Between 2000 and 2006, it was operated under a
private concession by the consortium, Elyo/Hydro Quebec. This concession ended in 2006 as a result of lack of
financing for investments and institutional inconsistencies in the sector, in which day-to-day politics superseded
long-term planning considerations.
20
   CEB is an import, generation, and transmission company jointly owned by Togo and Benin.


                                                       19
most recently, Nigeria. When power imports had to be curtailed, energy crises would emerge.
This often happened when the generation of electricity from Ghana's hydropower dam,
Akosombo, fell short due to years of low hydrology. To resolve such shortfalls, the Togolese
government adopted two strategies: (i) purchasing emergency diesel generators to be operated at
the level of CEET or purchasing kerosene-fired gas turbines at the level of CEB; and (ii)
pursuing the setting up of independent power producers (IPPs) to supply this shortfall. The
purchasing power agreement for a 100 MW heavy fuel oil fired gas turbine IPP, owned and
operated by Contour Global, was a key step to secure energy supply.

3.34 However, in the near future, the negative financial impact on CEET will be
significant, and the already fragile financial viability of the company will need to be
addressed. The strategy to address supply shortfalls uses power options that exhibit high
operating costs. In the case of Contour Global, this independent producer can utilize heavy fuel
or gas. As gas supply has not been secured, even though the arrival of natural gas in Lomé was
expected in 2010 under contract with the West African Gas Pipeline Company, 21 the producer is
operating with heavy fuel with a production cost of CFAF 100/Kwh (including fixed costs). 22
CEET's take-or-pay contract with Contour Global with fixed charges of US$32 million year plus
variable costs (the fuel) is putting additional pressure on the delicate financial situation of CEET.
It is critical to assess adequately CEET's financial position and implement a plan to ensure its
long-term viability. Such a plan should include efficiency gains and the export of electricity. The
World Bank is financing a Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) study, which
will finance the development of a financial model for CEET and an organizational audit. Both
are expected to contribute to the identification of measures to improve the financial situation of
CEET.

3.35 The recent adjustment in the electricity tariff is expected to enhance the financial
situation of the company. Nonetheless, its financial situation will continue to be delicate. In
June 2009 CEB increased its electricity tariffs by 10 percent 23 through a bi-statal decision of both
Benin and Togo and thus stabilized its financial situation. CEET, however, was not permitted to
pass through this increase, except to industrial customers. As a result, as of October 2010, CEET
estimated a loss of CFAF 6 billion for the year, which assumed a tariff adjustment in October.
This loss occurred despite the subsidy of CFAF 3 billion (to cover July 2009­June 2010). In
early December 2010 the government announced a tariff adjustment of 10 percent for low
voltage, on average (to reflect the CEB tariff adjustment of June 2009) and a 20 percent increase
in the tariff for medium voltage, on average. The tariff increase for the low-income bracket
(tranche sociale) is 5 percent. The tariff adjustment was effective as of January 1st 2011, thus the
CEET's loss is expected to be greater.

3.36 Other issues that affect the sector's financial sustainability also must be addressed .
These issues include the inadequate bill recovery ratio (which fell from 93.9 percent in 2009 to
88.1 percent in 2010); the low recovery of para-public entities' payments to the utility for

21
   The company is a consortium comprising the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (25 percent), Chevron
Nigeria Ltd (37 percent), Shell Nigeria (18 percent), Société beninoise de gas (2 percent), Société togolaise de gas (2
percent), and the Volta River Authority of Ghana (16 percent).
22
   CEB has contracted with the West African Gas Pipeline Company, for CEB's two 25-MW gas-fired plants in
Benin and Togo.
23
   From 50 to 55 CFAF/kwh.

delivery of electricity services;24 and the very old age of some of the equipment (dating to the
1950s and 1960s), which renders the electricity system inefficient and unreliable. A
comprehensive approach is required to adequately pursue the supply, managerial efficiency and
financial sustainability objectives.

3.37 Access to electricity in Togo is low, even when compared to the rest of the Sub-
Saharan Africa region. As in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the energy sector in Togo
is dominated by the use of biomass-based energy sources, especially for cooking. The use of
electricity is limited to only 13 percent of Togo's population. This coverage is significantly
lower than the Sub-Saharan African average of 25 percent and reflects the fact that the extension
of electricity access in the past 10 years has lagged behind demand. Togo's electricity coverage
is lagging far behind the access rate in Ghana (approximately 60 percent), as well as that in
Benin (25 percent). Electricity demand in large cities is not met, especially in peri-urban areas,
and the minority who have access to electricity complain of poor quality of supply. Access to
electricity in urban areas is 15­20 percent. However, in rural areas, only 2-4 percent of the
population has access to electricity. Although some power generation sites are located in rural
areas, the transmission lines generally bypass nearby communities in favor of transmitting power
directly to urban centers. During consultations held with rural and peri -urban communities in
July 2010 in the context of the World Bank's new energy strategy, it became clear that gaining
access to electricity ranks among the top priorities for Togo's population.

3.38 CEET's management problems contributed to the existing power outages, with
negative effects on the production capacity of the economy. CEET has been in charge of retail
distribution and sale of electricity in Togo since the early 1970s. With the exception of the period
in which CEET was under private management (2000­06), the company has been under public
management. A management committee was set up for a transitional period of 6 months, which
was extended several times. In March 2008, permanent structures were established, comprising
appointment of a Board of Directors, appointment of a General Manager, and adoption of
regulations for CEET consistent with those of the Organization for the Harmonization of
Business Law in Africa (OHADA). However, since February 2009, following a negative
assessment by the Supervisory Board of the progress made in implementing the Action Plan and
reducing energy losses, the position of General Manager again has been vacant. The Deputy
General Manager fills the position. A five-year performance contract has also been signed
between CEET and the government.

Medium Term Government's reform program

3.39 In the short term, the government aims to increase supply while strengthening
efficiency in the sector. Recent actions taken or ongoing include:




24
  All central administration arrears to CEET were settled through a securitization operation in February 2010 . The
government issued securities in the amount of CFAF 16.57 billion, of which 5.2 billion corresponded to central
administration arrears. As a result of a compensation operation with CEB, the amount of arrears from para -public
entities that remains to be settled with CEET is CFAF 837 million.

            development of a 330kv transmission backbone to enhance power trade across countries
            in the sub-region.
            Developing domestic power resources to enhance energy sector resilience. It includes the
            construction of a 100-MW thermal power plant (Contour Global) and a hydropower plant
            at Adjarala.
            Commissioning a sector strategic review financed by the Low-Income Countries Under
            Stress (LICUS) Trust Fund (TF) grant for Economic Recovery and International
            Reengagement. The review will lay the foundation for the preparation of the electricity
            sector strategy.
            Developing a financial model for CEET financed by the PPIAF.
            Commissioning an organizational audit of CEET to enhance efficiency.

3.40 Over the medium term, the government plans to implement actions to (i) strengthen
private participation in the development of energy generation capacity; (ii) intensify regional
cooperation in the production, purchase, sale, and transport of energy; (iii) create a rural
electrification fund; (iv) establish a financing mechanism for the sector, including participation
of external donors and the domestic financial system; and (v) undertake an awareness-raising
campaign for the efficient use of all forms of energy.

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-4

3.41 The proposed ERGG-4 would support one policy action judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the energy sector, namely, the adoption of the Utility Tariffs Adjustment
Order. This prior action will contribute to the improvement of the financial situation of CEET as
it passes-through to the consumers the tariff adjustment that CEB made in June 2009.

       4. BANK GROUP'S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                            A.     L INK TO THE I NTERIM S TRATEGY N OTE

4.1    The Interim Strategy Note (ISN), discussed by the Board on May 29, 2008, sets out
the Bank Group's support to the Government's reform program for the period FY08-
FY10.26 The ISN is closely aligned with the I-PRSP (on which the PRSP builds) and has the
following three main pillars:

     (i)    improve governance and transparency, through a focus on public finance management
            and key sectors of the economy (phosphates, energy, cotton and financial sectors);
     (ii)   promote economic recovery and sustainable development by helping the Government
            rehabilitate critical infrastructure and restore productive capacity in the phosphate and
            cotton sectors. The Bank will also support the Government in addressing the challenges

25
   The WAPP falls within the framework of the ECOWAS Energy Protocol, which establishes third-party access;
and the WAPP Master Plan, which defines regional priority projects.
26
   The World Bank Group plans to complete a new ISN (FY11-13) by the end of this fiscal year. This will bridge the
gap until a new Country Partnership Strategy is prepared in FY12, in response to the Government's new PRSP.


                                                       22
       and obstacles to, and potential entry points for, private sector investment as a catalyst for
       growth in Togo; and
 (iii) address urgent social needs, through expanding the community-driven development
       approach implemented through LICUS TF grants including a second series of three
       LICUS TF Grants to provide quality public services and income-generating opportunities
       to the residents of poorest communities in Togo, especially in rural areas.

4.2     The proposed ERGG-4 is closely aligned with the ISN's strategic objectives and its
expected outcome indicators. The operation directly supports the first two ISN pillars of the
ISN, which also corresponds to the first two pillars of the I-PRSP and PRSP, by focusing
specifically on continuing and deepening the reform of public financial management as well as
further advancing structural reforms aimed at strengthening governance, transparency and
efficiency in the key sectors of the economy (phosphates, cotton, and energy sectors). The
proposed reforms are essential to the Government's ability to use the public resources freed up
by debt reduction efficiently and effectively to support the country's economic and social
recovery. It provides financial support to the Government's efforts to bolster economic recovery
in the aftermath of the protracted domestic crisis and the 2009 global economic slowdown.

             B.    C OMPLEMENTARITY        WITH   O THER B ANK G ROUP A CTIVITIES

4.3     The proposed ERGG-4 is closely coordinated with and complements several of the
Bank's ongoing or planned operations and advisory services in the areas of its focus. The
Government's program of reforms in the procurement, phosphate, cotton and energy sectors is
supported by IDA under a LICUS grant (US$1.6 million approved in FY08) which lays the
groundwork for economic recovery. The Financial Sector and Governance Project (US$12
million, approved in March 2009) supports the restructuring of the banking sector, the
strengthening of the microfinance sector, the reform of the pension sector, and other financial
and private sector reforms. A Private Sector Development Support Project (US$13 million) is
under preparation in FY11 and will build upon the Private Sector Revitalization Trust Fund
(US$1.1 million) approved in May 2010. The Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and
Energy project approved in June 2009 (US$25 million) and complemented by the GEF Efficient
Lighting Program (US$1.82 million), supports access to improved infrastructure services in
Lomé, focusing on urban roads rehabilitation, drainage, urban water supply, energy equipment
rehabilitation and provision of energy-efficient light bulbs, as well as institutional strengthening.
In FY11, an additional financing (US$15 million) will be prepared to provide for expansion of
drainage works in the flood-affected areas of Lomé. A regional Abidjan-Lagos Transport and
Trade Facilitation Project approved in March 2010 will facilitate movement of goods and people
along the coastal corridor through road infrastructure and transit facilitation components. An
Agriculture Sector Support Project (FY11, US$37 million) is also under preparation which
would focus, in partnership with other donors, on supporting the first three years of the
Government's national agriculture investment program with the aim of improving agricultural
productivity and diversification, including the cotton sector.

4.4    Other projects support rural development and education. A Community
Development Project (US$17.2 million) approved in June 2008 enabled the scale up of the
LICUS TF-funded Emergency Program for Poverty Reduction (closed in June 2010) to address
urgent social needs, particularly in the rural areas. In October 2008, IDA approved an additional


                                                  23
US$7 million grant under the Global Food Crisis Response Program to complement the
Community Development Project (CDP), and in order to respond to the negative impact of the
global economic slowdown, an additional financing to the CDP of US$8.7 million was approved
in June 2010.27 A grant under the Education for All/ Fast Track Initiative (EFA/FTI) Catalytic
Fund approved in September 2010 focuses explicitly on increasing coverage and improving the
quality of primary education. The grant will contribute to the attainment of the education
Millennium Development Goal as well as to the achievement of the PRSP pillar on developing
human capital.

4.5    Complementary support is provided by IDA through various non lending
instruments. A Country Economic Memorandum/ Diagnostic Trade Integration Study
completed in FY10 provides in-depth analysis of the sources of economic growth, including
transport, mining, agriculture, and the export processing zone, and produced an action plan that
was validated at a workshop in July 2010. An Investment Climate Assessment completed in
FY10 provides a crucial diagnostic of the business environment to the Togolese Government and
provided inputs to the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and the Private Sector
Development Support Project under preparation in FY11. A PEMFAR completed in mid 2009
has provided input to developing the Government's public finance management reform program.
In the energy sector, the ERGG-4 complements the ongoing dialogue and advisory assistance
provided by the Bank to the authorities in the context of support to the West Africa Regional
Power Pool. A study to help reform the electricity sector is under preparation (FY12).

        C.     C OMPLEMENTARITY           WITH   O THER D EVELOPMENT P ARTNER P ROGRAMS

4.6     The proposed ERGG-4 complements or leverages the support of other development
partners. The specific areas of IDA support have been identified in collaboration with the IMF
and in consultation with other development partners, aiming for synergy with their respective
interventions and building on IDA's value added and comparative advantage in these areas. It is
expected that these institutions will continue to collaborate closely duri ng implementation of the
program supported by the proposed ERGG-4, especially through joint dialogue with the
authorities, and joint missions and analytical work. Ongoing donor assistance includes a n IMF
ECF (adopted in April 2008, to end in mid-2011), and AfDB and EU budget support operations.

4.7     IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely their advice on governance and other
economic issues and reforms, and worked on the HIPC process, including in a joint HIPC
decision point document and a joint HIPC completion point document (approved by the IMF
and IDA boards on December 10 and December 14, 2010, respectively). Responsibility for
public financial management is shared between the two institutions, with sharing of analytical
work and coordinated provision of technical assistance to the country. The two institutions work
closely together on the restructuring of the banking sector, with the Bank taking the lead on the
technical discussions. The two institutions endeavor to avoid duplication of policy measures
where feasible. Both institutions have also supported the preparation of the full PRSP which was

  The objective will be to further develop the nascent safety nets system in Togo, and in particular: (i) expand the
scope and impact of the CDP by creating temporary employment opportunities to 25,000 poor, and young people in
particular; and (ii) expand the current School Feeding Emergency Operation from the current 92 schools to 200
schools and run the program for two additional school years (2010-2011 and 2011-2012) benefitting some 80,000
children.

discussed by the respective Boards in November and December 2009 on the basis of a Joint Staff
Advisory Note (JSAN). The first PRSP Annual Progress Report covering the July 2009-June
2010 period was also reviewed in a JSAN in November 2010. In addition, the IMF provided
technical assistance in helping the authorities set up a mechanism for monitoring budget
execution, and implementing a functional budget classification.

4.8     The AfDB, EU and IDA staffs are coordinating closely on supporting the
Government's public financial management reform program, including procurement.
Specifically, the three institutions have jointly prepared the recently completed PEMFAR, w hich
also draws on the ratings of an EC-financed Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) review. The AfDB is providing assistance for strengthening Government capacity in the
area of governance and public management reforms. Furthermore, the IDA and EU staffs have
collaborated closely in their dialogue with the Government on public finance management
reforms.

4.9     Donors are supporting various elements of the authorities' efforts towards economic
recovery. The EU is supporting the cotton sector reform program by financing the capital share
(40 percent) of the National Federation of Cotton Producer Groups (NFCPG) in the new cotton
company created on January 23, 2009. Other EU support includes the COM-STABEX that
financed the reinforcement of capacities of the NFCPG producers, the rehabilitation of the
cotton-coffee-cocoa roads and the diversification of agriculture. The AfDB is supporting the
rehabilitation of rural infrastructure. France is supporting several reforms in the area of
governance as well as the Fast Track Program in Education.

                              D.   A NALYTICAL U NDERPINNINGS

4.10 The design of the ERGG-4, as of the previous budget support operations, has
benefited from recent or ongoing analytical work, as well as close policy dialogue on the
key sectors covered by the operation. These include a Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) prepared at end-2003, a PEFA (2008), and a PEMFAR (2009) conducted in
close cooperation with the Government and other development partners including the EU and
AfDB, French Cooperation and the UNDP. The PEMFAR provides (i) a diagnostic analysis of
the current strengths and weaknesses in the country's public financial management system and
practices; (ii) input for the design and preparation of the PFM reform strategy, includi ng a time-
bound sequenced action plan of priority reforms; and (iii) benchmarks enabling the assessment
of future progress of PFM reforms. It also provides specific input into the identification of
further key reforms to be supported by the proposed grant, beyond those already implemented
under the previous ERGGs.

4.11 In addition, the Bank's recent analysis, and dialogue with the authorities on the
phosphates, cotton, and energy sectors as part of recent missions, have further advanced the
structural policy dialogue in these sectors and laid the basis for the proposed grant, as well as
restarted regular reporting of key sector data to the Bank. In May 2009, a Bank mission reviewed
the findings of the strategic audit of the phosphate sector (financed under the L ICUS Trust Fund)
and made recommendations; the Bank then participated in a workshop to discuss the audit and
next steps in November 2009. The Bank has also reviewed the cotton and financial sector
strategies and contributed to updates. A full environmental analysis was carried out in 2010,


                                                25
including the mining (phosphate), agricultural (cotton) and electricity sectors. The country's
macroeconomic performance and planned policies have been assessed in the context of joint
IMF-Bank missions, the most recent being in October 2010 for the preparation of the HIPC
completion point. On this basis, a joint HIPC completion point document and a JSAN were
prepared in November and discussed by both Boards in December 2010.

4.12 The Country Economic Memorandum/Diagnostic Trade Integration Study provides
in-depth analysis of several economic sectors, as well as cross-cutting issues such as transport,
trade policy, re-exports, the export processing zone, and vocational training. It includes a
sources of growth analysis to identify the potential drivers of growth of the Togolese economy
and an assessment of the investment climate, based on an enterprise survey conducted in 2009.
Building on this analysis, the Bank has provided advice in several areas, including on the reform
of the investment code and the free zone law.

4.13 The following lessons are drawn from the experience of the three previous
operations and have been taken into account in preparing the proposed operation:

       In the first and second ERGGs, the policy reforms in the prior actions were embedded in
       the Government's own reform agenda articulated in the Interim Poverty Reduction
       Strategy, leading to strong ownership of the reforms. The ERGG -3 as well as the
       proposed operation have the added benefit of being closely aligned with two major pillars
       of the full PRSP which lays out the Government's reform agenda for the period 2009-
       2011. The PRSP is coupled with a Plan of Priority Actions (PAP) which details the pluri -
       annual planning of programs, reform measures and activities. It is complemented by a
       reform strategy presented in 2010 by the Ministry of Economy and Finance which goes
       into even greater detail regarding the public finance management measures. Considering
       the Government's good track record of reforms to date, this combination of clear
       commitment and detailed planning will help to ensure the implementation of the reforms
       supported by this operation.
       Given the generally limited capacity within the public sector in fragile countries such as
       Togo, it is important to be selective in the choice of policy and institutional reforms.
       Operations that are simple in design and have fewer actions that have significant positive
       leverage effect are likely to be more effective than operations that attempt overly broad
       coverage. As with the previous operations, the design of the ERGG-4 reflects this lesson;
       it continues and deepens the reforms in public financial management and in the country's
       critical sectors (phosphates, cotton, energy sectors) that are deemed critical for the overall
       governance reform program and will lay the foundation for medium term growth and
       poverty reduction.
       It is important to carefully choose prior actions that are likely to open the door for other
       important policy and institutional reforms. For example, the adoption of a sound
       legislative framework, like the procurement law and associated code under the ERGG-3,
       was the basis for stepping up the effective implementation of the procurement reform
       under the present operation. Creation of the General Procurement Department will enable



                                                26
       the subsequent review of contracts processed by key parastatals like the phosphate, cotton
       and electricity companies and thereby contribute to improved economic governance.
       An important lesson for this operation drawn from the implementation of other
       development policy operations is the need to assess the key risks faced by specific policy
       and institutional reform measures and to be proactive in the application of mitigating
       measures. This operation has not only benefited from an upfront assessment of the key
       risks but has also identified mitigating measures that are being, or need to be, applied to
       address these risks. The political risk identified in previous operations has diminished for
       the present operation.
       The effectiveness of Bank-supported development policy operations can be enhanced by
       its complementarities with other Bank-financed operation and the efforts of other active
       donors in the reform areas. The design of this proposed operation reflects this lesson in
       the choice of prior actions, which are closely coordinated with policy reforms supported
       by other donors (IMF, AfDB, and EU) and through the Bank's lending and non-lending
       portfolio.

            5. THE PROPOSED FOURTH ECONOMIC RECOVERY
                      AND GOVERNANCE GR ANT

                           A.    D ESCRIPTION OF    THE   O PERATION

5.1    The Government's broad economic recovery program is outlined above in Section 3.
This program constitutes the reference framework behind the Government's policy matrix
(Annex 2). The Government has requested that IDA continue supporting, through the proposed
ERGG-4, critical reforms outlined in its strategy, primarily in the economic governance and
transparency area.

5.2      The main objective of the ERGG-4 is to support Government-owned reforms to
improve public financial management and restore performance in key sectors of the
economy. Specifically, the ERGG-4 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms
initiated by the Government under the ERGG, ERGG-2 and ERGG-3 to strengthen budget
preparation, execution, controls and public procurement. It would also contribute to creating the
conditions for increased private sector confidence through measures to improve governance,
transparency and efficiency in the phosphate, cotton, and energy sectors. The inclusion of actions
to improve management in selected public enterprises is highly relevant to the operation, as this
is likely to provide additional fiscal space and increase investments in those sectors. This would
lead over time to strengthened fiscal sustainability, improved economic governance and growth,
and enhanced transparency of State institutions and processes. The resources made available by
this grant will provide financial support to the Government to implement activities that would
otherwise be beyond its fiscal capabilities, including financing the provision of basic public
services.

5.3     The proposed grant would support selected reforms in the Government's program
described in Section 3 that are deemed essential for its successful implementation. Table 5.1
below details these prior actions and their implementation status. The rationale for their selection
has been discussed in Section 3, namely their centrality to the program and expressed
Government commitment and feasibility. The prior actions for ERGG-4 are derived from
indicative policy measures that were identified during preparation of the ERGG-3. Annex 3 also
includes the expected results and result indicators.

                        Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
 Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
 The ERGG-4 is fully aligned with the Government's reform program focusing on improving public expenditure
 management and strengthening governance and transparency in the phosphates, cotton and energy sectors. This
 broad program of reforms is reflected in the 2009 PRSP whose process of preparation involved the participation of
 all development actors (private sector, religious groups, non -Governmental organizations, Parliament and the
 technical and financial partners) and regions, thus ensuring that the PRSP fully articulates the country's own
 priorities to reduce poverty and promote sustainable growth. The PRSC framework underlies the policy dialogue
 with the Bank, the IMF, and the AfDB, which closely coordinate their programs of support to Togo. The unit
 responsible for the ERGG-4 program within the Government is the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which has
 championed these reforms over the past years during the three previous ERGGs. In order to reinforce ownership at
 the sectoral level, the Ministry of Economy and Finance has coordinated the dialogue with working groups and
 task teams including other Government agencies and relevant organizations (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry
 of Mines and Energy, BCEAO).

 Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
 framework
 The Government's reform program supported by the ERGG-4 is summarized in the policy matrix in Annex 2. The
 core of the program builds on the findings of the PEFA, PEMFAR, CPAR, LICUS grants and the IMF ECF, on
 previous ERGG operations, and on the analysis of p reliminary results and weaknesses of ongoing reform efforts. It
 was further strengthened during intensive policy dialogue with the authorities in 2010. The program has been
 closely coordinated with and supported by other development partners such as the IM F, AfDB, and the EU
 (especially in the areas on which these organizations have focused, notably public financial management) and
 bilateral donors. The expected results of the program supported by the proposed grant are detailed in Table 5.2.

 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
 The program's focus remains on governance in the public and private sectors, through a series of actions aimed at
 improving public financial management, and transparency and efficiency in critical sectors for the economy
 (namely, phosphates, cotton and energy) which are crucial to promote sustainable growth and thus reduce poverty.
 However, the policy matrix was customized to the country circumstances, taking into account the difficult task of
 sustaining economic recovery in an exceptionally unfavorable international environment.

 Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
 The policy matrix uses a limited set of nine prior actions for Board presentation and disbursement of the proposed
 ERGG-4. The chosen policy measures were identified jointly with the Government and in close consultation with
 other development partners. Conditionality is focused only on key action s which are critical to the strengthening of
 public financial management and reform in key economic sectors. The conditionality of the ERGG -4 is also
 coordinated with and is complementary to the Government reform program supported by the IMF ECF.

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance -based financial
 support
 In preparing and monitoring the previous three ERGGs, the Bank has worked in close coordination with the IMF,
 AfDB, EC and bilateral donors in supporting the Government's reform program. Under this operation, the Bank
 will continue to coordinate closely with these institutions to support and monitor program implementation to
 contribute to predictable and performance based financial support in the futur e.

                            C.     A NTICIPATED R ESULTS OF THE PROGRAM

5.4    The program supported by the ERGG-4 targets the underlying structure for long-
term reforms. Within this structure, there are specific results that are expected by the grant
closing date of December 31, 2011, as outlined in Table 5.2. These outcome indicators will be
monitored by the Ministry of Economy and Finance whose staff will prepare quarterly reports on
progress in implementation.

6.1    The proposed operation is supported and owned by the authorities. The specific
reforms are critical elements of the Government's strategy to consolidate growth and further
enhance governance and transparency in public resource management. These reforms were
designed with the full contribution of the Government's relevant ministries and agencies under
the championship of the Minister of Economy and Finance. They are embedded in the country's
PRSP (pillars I and II) whose preparation process involved participation of all development
actors and regions and has provided an opportunity to foster national consensus across the
Togolese society and among Government representatives on this reform agenda.

6.2     Although the Government has made encouraging progress under previous ERGGs
in implementing measures to strengthen public financial management and transparency,
the improvement in fiduciary standards remains a central objective of the proposed
operation. Among reform measures already implemented are: (i) the full reinstatement and
application of normal budget preparation and execution procedures (timely budget preparation
and submission to the Parliament, quarterly publication of budget execution reports);
(ii) organization of the Treasury in line with WAEMU Directive; (iii) closing over one thousand
existing separate treasury accounts with a view to creating a single treasury account; (iv) creation
of internal audit and inspection units at the Ministry of Finance; (v) adoption of a procurement
law and code; establishment of a General Procurement Department and a Procurement
Regulatory Authority; establishment of ex ante procurement control commissions in five
ministries; and (vi) establishment of the Court of Accounts. The proposed operation will build on
these earlier measures to deepen reforms and improve the country's fiduciary management
system.

6.3     Concerning the safeguards of the BCEAO, the latest assessment was completed on
March 2010 and found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at th e
operational level. The overall governance framework should nonetheless be strengthened by the
addition of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate
oversight over the control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements.
The implementation of the Institutional Reform of the WAEMU and the BCEAO should help
correct that situation.

6.4     Durable gains in transparency, effectiveness of the financial management systems,
and accountability will require sustained and coordinated engagement of Togo's
international partners in support of the Government's reform process. The IMF, through the
West Africa AFRITAC, is providing technical assistance in public financial management and tax
administration to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The recent PEMFAR (2009) has
identified areas in particular need of remedial action, and a comprehensive Action Plan to
address those has been prepared by the Government. A baseline of current procurement practices
using the OECD/DAC guidelines, established as part of the PEMFAR, is also enabling evidence-


                                                32
based monitoring of improvements in the near future. As a result of the PEMFAR, priority
technical assistance to strengthen public financial management is being identified for additional
coordinated donor support. IDA is providing strong support to this process through a LICUS
Trust Fund grant and the Financial Sector and Governance TA Project approved in March 2009.
Continued donor assistance will help the Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary
standards are applied to provide reasonable assurance that resources are used for the in tended
purposes. An important objective is to achieve compliance with international standards of
financial management, such as those agreed in the context of the OECD/DAC guidance on
quality and performance of national procurement systems.

procedures for development policy grants. Upon approval of the grant and effectiveness of the
Financing Agreement, and provided the Association is satisfied with the program being carried
out by the Recipient and with the appropriateness of the Recipient's macroeconomic policy
framework, the proceeds of the grant would be disbursed by IDA into a dedicated account at the
central bank of Togo and forming part of the official foreign exchange reserves of Togo. The
proceeds of the grant would not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the Agree ment.
The recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit of the Grant into that account an equivalent

The Recipient will report to IDA on the amounts deposited in the dedicated foreign currency
account and credited in local currency to the budget management system. Assuming that the
withdrawal request is in Euro, the equivalent amount in CFAF reported in the budgetary system
will be based on the market rate at the date of the transfer. The Recipient will promptly notify the

6.9    The reforms supported by the proposed development policy grant are part of a
broader program of actions to promote governance, including strengthening of public
financial management systems, and the recovery of key sectors of the economy, notably
cotton, phosphates and energy. The governance reforms, dealing mainly with economic and




                                                33
institutional issues, are not likely to have significant negative impacts on the country's
environment and natural resources; no direct effects on the environment are expected:

   (i)    first, as regards the cotton sector, the analytical accounting system and the
          strengthening of the farmers' representation at the board of NSCT merely enhances
          transparency in the accounting system and promotes the representation of the producers
          at the Board of the new company;
   (ii)   second, the phosphate sector measure to prepare a detailed action plan and budget of
          the activities that are to be implemented under the EITI have the objective of enhancing
          governance by improving transparency and accountability; and
   (iii) third, as regards the energy sector, the adjustment of electricity tariffs aims at
         improving the financial situation of CEET.

6.10 In order to facilitate the integration of environmental considerations into the
implementation of development policies, the Bank helped the Government to prepare a
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA). The CEA identifies the main environmental
challenges that will need to be addressed in order to maximize the welfare impact of the poverty
reduction strategy. In particular, the CEA addresses the potential adverse environmental and
social impacts that could be associated with increased investment and production in the cotton,
mining and energy sectors, and recommends measures that will help to eliminate or mitigate
these effects.

Summary of environmental and social impacts and mitigation measures

Impacts

6.11 Cotton production faces two main environmental problems. The first one is land
degradation due to soil fertility depletion and soil erosion. Although this problem is common to
the whole agricultural sector, cotton production areas are inherently prone to land degradation.
There is evidence that the depletion of soil fertility and the associated decline in cotton yields
have led some farmers to encroach on protected areas and national forest reserves. The second
source of environmental concern is the uncontrolled imports and misuse of pesticides.
Occupational health hazards for farmers and for the broader communities, as well as
environmental degradation due to the pollution of land and (surface and ground) water resources
are among the main problems uncovered in the production areas.

6.12 Phosphate mining is associated with three main social and environmental problems.
First and foremost is the involuntary resettlement of the affected populations without proper
compensation in many cases, or the fact of depriving these populations of their livelihood
through claiming their farm land. Second, mining operations cause noticeable land degradation
and permanent soil loss in many areas due to uncontrolled soil movement on-site and offsite, and
inadequate land reclamation and restoration operations after the mines ceased operations.
Finally, phosphate mining operations contribute to the degradation of water resources through
soil erosion and the sedimentation of water bodies caused by uncontrolled earth-moving
operations, and the disposal of effluents into the coastal waters.




                                                34
6.13 Energy production and distribution entails both positive and negative
environmental and social effects: The most remarkable positive effect is the improvement of
the living conditions of the populations with new access to electricity: lighting in homes
(reducing the emission of petroleum lamps), improved operation of local health clinics, and
security (street lighting in urban and semi-urban areas). The main negative effects associated
with the increased production and distribution of electricity are related to the acquisition of land
and the resettlement of populations for the construction of infrastructure, especially the planned
hydropower dam, and for the right-of-way for transmission lines.

Mitigation opportunities

6.14 The CEA proposes management tools and capacity development measures in these
productive sectors that will help the Government minimize negative effects and optimize positive
ones.

6.15 The newly created cotton company would provide crucial advisory services in the
following areas: (i) a more efficient and safer use of inputs, mainly fertilizers and pesticides, by
cotton farmers; using inputs in recommended doses and according to established norms would
reduce soil contamination and pesticide-induced health hazards, and save water resources; (ii)
stepping up cultivation and productivity in areas with a proven strong potential for cotton,
thereby reducing the need to expand production into marginal lands and existing forest areas;
(iii) a more integrated approach to soil fertility management that emphasizes sustainable land
management while increasing yields. In parallel, reinforcing research capacity in order to
develop cultivars with high fiber yield and improved parasite resistance will help increase
profitability for farmers and make a further decrease in pesticide use possible.

6.16 Much of the current effects of phosphate extraction and processing activities on
land, water, and air, as well as their effects on the livelihood of local communities are due
to the obsolete technology, limited capital, and lack of awareness of the potential public
health and environmental hazards associated with these effects. The new phosphate company
SNPT would aim to modernize the mining equipment to adopt technological innovation that will
not only increase the technical efficiency of operations, but also reduce the adverse
environmental and social costs. Other measures to mitigate the negative environmental effect
have been identified in the strategic audit and the CEA and include (i) extending the scope of the
existing Land Issues and Environment Unit within the SNPT's organizational chart (at present
mostly focused on the ­ albeit important ­ land use compensation problems) to encompass all
Environment ­ Health ­ Security issues which need to be addressed in a pro-active manner; (ii)
making internal and external environmental audits mandatory; (iii) encouraging the company to
seek ISO 14001 certification. The combination of the above measures with a switch to modern
equipment and production techniques will curtail permanent soil loss and subsequent degradation
of water resources through soil erosion. As part of its social responsibilities towards the
population, the SNPT will continue working on identifying satisfactory solutions for the land
issues stemming from compensation for resettlement and use of farm land, in a participatory
approach with local communities and under the authority of the State. It will also step up land
reclamation and restoration efforts after the mines have ceased operations in a geographical area,
to make the land ready again for future farming use.



                                                35
6.17 In the energy sector, to mitigate any potential negative environmental effects of the
planned Adjarala dam, a key element of the country's modern energy production plan, the
Government would draw from the lessons learned from the construction of the Nangbeto
hydropower dam to ensure better planning in the design phase and improved management of the
construction phase.

Capacity assessment for effective environmental mainstreaming

6.18 The Government took aggressive measures aimed to strengthen its environmental
management system and institutions in recent years, including the adoption of a new
environmental law in 2008. Although some further changes in the institutional arrangements
may be justified in order to provide a better fit with the new environmental law, the overall
regulatory and institutional framework for environmental management can now be considered as
broadly adequate. However, the implementation of environmental policies and regulati ons faces
enormous challenges. These challenges include (i) the lack of appropriate mechanisms to support
the effective integration of environmental considerations into sector policy formulation and
implementation; (ii) the weak enforcement and compliance with key environmental regulations
(e.g., environmental impact assessment, involuntary resettlement of populations, etc.); and (iii)
the lack of adequate technical capacity in the public and private sectors to ensure effective
environment and natural resource management.

6.19 The lack of technical and operational capacity is particularly acute within the
ministry of environment and forest resources where 80 percent of the staff consists of forestry
engineers and technicians with little or no training in environmental management, especially
environmental assessment. The technical unit dedicated to environmental impact assessment and
environmental audit has 6 staff (only one has a graduate degree). The ministry has very limited
resources (the average yearly investment budget over the 2001 - 2009 period is under
US$200,000). To mitigate these constraints, the CEB has benefitted from capacity building on
environmental and social safeguards under the ongoing Benin Energy Services Delivery Project
(ESDP) as its highly qualified environmental and social safeguards staff are well versed in the
World Bank safeguard requirements. In addition, the Togo Emergency Infrastructure
Rehabilitation and Energy Project includes the Environmental and Social Monitoring Framework
(ESMF). With regard to the mining sector, as part of the effort to update its legal and regulatory
framework, the Government will review the environmental and social provisions of the Mining
Code and address any regulatory gaps with the aim of bringing Togo closer to international best
practices with respect to social, community, and environmental standards.

Recommended capacity building activities

6.20 Remedying the current and future adverse environmental and social effects
associated with the activities of the targeted sectors, and effectively integrating
environmental considerations into the implementation of the reforms will require active
collaboration between the Government, the private sector and civil society groups. This
collaboration should focus on filling the technical capacity and information/awareness gaps that
prevent effective collective action to control the adverse effects of sectoral investments on the
environment, natural resources, and the livelihood of affected communities. The capacity
building activities should consist both of short term measures aimed to restore environmental


                                               36
stewardship in the on-going activities of the three sectors, and of medium term measures
focusing on building durable capabilities in Government for mainstreaming environment into
development policies and programs. The findings and recommendations of the CEA will
underpin further possible capacity building support in the environmental sector that would be
identified in the context of the new CAS.

                                      E.     P OVERTY AND SOCIAL I MPACT

6.21 Togo remains one of the world's poorest countries, ranking 139 out of 169 in the
2010 UNDP Human Development Report, although this ranking constitutes a marked
improvement over the 2009 ranking (159 out of 182 countries). Based on the QUIBB28 survey, in
2006, an estimated 62 percent of Togo's population lived below the poverty line, with the rural
areas showing the highest share of poor people (74 percent versus 37 percent in urban areas ).
These 2006 findings do not reflect the shocks that affected the country in 2008 and 2009, in
particular the rise in food and oil prices, as well as the flooding and the financial crisis and global
economic slowdown. Furthermore, economic growth has not been strong relative to population
growth and, as a result, GDP per capita only grew by 0.7 percent in 2009 (and it is estimated to
grow by 0.8 percent in 2010).29 Partial poverty estimates in the city of Lomé, based on the 2008
Household Expenditure Survey, indicate that there was a small increase in poverty in Lomé from
24.5 percent in 2006 to 25.1 percent in 2008.

6.22 It is expected that the upcoming Poverty Assessment would provide more accurate
information on recent poverty developments, especially regarding regional poverty and
inequality. Meanwhile, the 2010 UNDP indicators for multi-dimensional poverty (not strictly
comparable with the above methodology) show the following poverty situation for Togo:

6.23 The improvements in budget planning and execution, and especially the
introduction of the functional classification of budget expenditures, will also contribute to
improve information about poverty developments, by successfully monitoring the linkages
between the policy actions identified in the PRSP and poverty outcomes.

6.24 The measures supported by the proposed ERGG-4 are expected to have significant
positive employment and distributional effects with a positive impact on poverty reduction.
Specifically, expected benefits include:

29
     GDP per capita actually fell by 1.4 and 0.1 percent in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

   (i)    contributing to overall economic growth and hence employment creation;
   (ii)   strengthening of public expenditure management, which would enhance efficiency,
          transparency and accountability in public resource use, including for social sectors;
   (iii) strengthening governance in the cotton sector through measures to improve the
         accounting system and increase the representation of producers in the Board of the
         company. This should help producers earn a larger share of revenues;
   (iv) enhancing governance in the phosphate sector by improving transparency and
        accountability of the sector, thereby improving its financial contribution to the
        economy and public finances; and
   (v)    contributing to improve the financial situation of CEET and thus reduce the drain on
          the Government budget, thereby freeing up resources that can be directed to poverty
          reduction expenditures. According to the results of the Poverty and Social Impact
          Analysis (PSIA) the increase in tariffs that took effect in January will have a very
          limited impact on the poor (see Box 6.1) due to the low access rate to electricity among
          the poor.

6.25 While the ERGG-4 does not have a special focus on rural poverty, it supports
measures that will be particularly beneficial to the rural poor. In the cotton sector, improving
governance is expected to further increase confidence of farmers and thereby facilitate a rebound
in cotton production and improve the livelihood of a large sector of the population. Indeed, about
300,000 people rely on this cash crop as a dominant source of earnings. Enhancing the financial
situation of CEET will allow for the stepping up of electricity distribution with positive impacts
on the poor population's health and security (replaces use of kerosene lamps for lighting,
facilitates operations of health clinics including storage of medicines, and provides public
lighting in urban and semi-urban areas). Furthermore, as a budget support operation, the ERGG-
4 would also help fund the provision of basic public services with a beneficial impact on the
poor, in complement to the ongoing implementation of the Togo Community Development
Project (approved in FY08), and the additional financing approved in FY09 under the Global
Food Crisis Response Program and in FY10 through Pilot Crisis Response Window resources.

6.26 Given the overall thrust of the ERGG-4, no negative impacts on vulnerable groups
are envisaged. On the contrary, all the measures considered should result in improved overall
well-being because of better governance and more efficient and equitable Government services.
As with previous ERGG operations, the Government has made considerable efforts to ensure that
planned actions involve specific stakeholders and citizens at large through a participatory
process.

       Box 6.1: Poverty and Social Impact of the Increase in the Electricity Tariffs

 Simulations based on the data from the QUIBB survey suggest that the impact of the increase in tariff
 that took effect in January 2011 will have a very limited impact on the poor. The increase in unit cost is
 limited, and it is significantly higher for households located in the upper brackets of electricity
 consumption than for the lower brackets. This implicitly protects some of the poorest households who
 are connected to the grid. The increase in the unit cost per kilowatt hour in the lowest bracket of the
 tariff structure is at five percent, versus more than thirty percent for the highest bracket of consumption
 where richer households tend to be located. Also, according to the data from the 2006 QUIBB survey,
 the share of households who are connected to the electricity grid is much lower f or the poor (rising from
 4.6 percent in the bottom decile to 38.4 percent in the seventh decile). This means that on average, at
 most one in seven poor households could potentially be affected by the increase in electricity tariff,
 while the likelihood of being affected is much higher for better off households. It also means that
 subsidies for increasing access to the network would be better targeted in all likelihood than existing
 subsidies embedded in the existing tariff structure. Furthermore, the share of total consumption of
 households allocated to electricity is important, at 6 percent of total consumption on average for
 households with a connection, but given the limited increase in the tariffs, the impact on poverty is
 likely to be small in comparison to the overall level of consumption of many households.



                                F.    M ONITORING AND E VALUATION

6.27 The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall
implementation of the proposed ERGG-4. Day-to-day monitoring of the program will be the
responsibility of the Permanent Secretariat for Policy Reform (Comité de Suivi des Programmes
et Réformes), an existing high-level team within the Ministry, headed by the Secretary General.
This arrangement is justified by the strength and continuity of this team during the previous
operations and their close involvement in the ongoing policy reform dialogue, including with the
IMF and other development partners. The main technical responsibility for implementation of
the public financial management reforms will stay with the Budget and Treasury Departments,
whose representatives are part of the Public Finance Steering Committee (Comité de pilotage des
finances publiques) created in 2005. The sector reforms will be implemented by the respective
technical departments in the sector ministries, under the oversight of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries (cotton sector), and the Ministry of Mines and Energy (phosphates and energy) and
the overall coordination of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

6.28 The MEF economic team will also be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the
results of the program. The Government will provide quarterly reports to IDA on
implementation progress measured against the established timetables and the agreed performance
indicators. The overall reform effort will be reviewed by the Government in close coordination
with regular Bank supervision to ensure continued implementation of the program within an
adequate macroeconomic policy framework.

6.29      The following risks and risk mitigation strategies have been identified.
   (i)     Political risk. The March 2010 presidential elections were organized by an independent
           electoral Commission (CEI) and were perceived by the international community as fair
           and inclusive. Incumbent president Faure Gnassingbé was reelected with 61 percent of
           the votes. The peaceful outturn of the 2010 presidential elections has clearly improved
           the socio-political outlook and hence reduced the political risk presented by Togo. The
           main opposition party is represented in the Government which is expected to promote
           the broad acceptance of critical reforms. The PRSP process which was officially
           launched in May 2008 and culminated in a national validation workshop in April 2009
           presented an additional opportunity to foster national consensus across the Togolese
           society (including the private sector and CSOs) and among Government representatives
           on a medium-term reform agenda.
   (ii)    Vested Interests risk. There are reasonable expectations that more transparent and
           accountable practices in the phosphates, energy and cotton sectors will enhance
           governance and reduce the scope for vested interests to undermine reform effort in
           these critical sectors. In addition, the proposed prior actions focus on areas in which the
           Government has already demonstrated its commitment and ownership in the previous
           ERGG operations. Close coordination with the IMF, AfDB, EU, and bilateral donors
           and intensified sector dialogue will help ensure that the Government continues to give
           top priority to the reform of these sectors.
   (iii) Macroeconomic risks to the economic recovery could stem from the vulnerability of
         the Togolese economy to exogenous shocks and/or from a slower than expected
         rebound from the global economic recovery. Pursuing sustainable fiscal policies will
         require discipline and a targeted public communication effort. There is also the risk that
         ongoing revenue mobilization reforms will not generate the expected increase in
         revenues and that investments in infrastructure will be pursued with excessive domestic
         financing, thus driving up borrowing costs and crowding out private investment. In
         addition, the extent to which the restructuring of the Togolese banking sector will lead
         to increased lending to the economy remains uncertain. Togo is also exposed to the
         impact of the Euro appreciation on its major international exports, phosphates and
         cotton. Some of these shocks or a combination of them could result in a risk of falling
         back into arrears or exacerbating the precarious financial situation of several banks.
         Furthermore, given Togo's role as a hub for regional trade, shocks in neighboring
         countries could hurt Togo's economic prospects. To mitigate the macroeconomic risks,
         the IMF and IDA will continue to closely monitor Togo's macroeconomic
         performance, including providing ongoing assistance to the financial sector reform
         program through the IDA-financed Financial Reform and Governance TA Project.
   (iv) Fiduciary risk. Despite recent reforms, fiduciary risk remains from possible corruption
        or Government's failure to make effective and efficient use of the fiscal space made
        available by budget support and debt relief. After improvements through measures
        taken under the previous ERGGs, the improvement in fiduciary standards remains a
        central objective of the proposed operation. The prior actions of the present operation



                                                  40
         are expected to mitigate the fiduciary risk, and effective implementation will be closely
         monitored.
   (v)   Implementation capacity risk arises from the lack of sufficient professional staff and
         weak institutional capacity and coordination in the wake of the long recent history of
         socio-political instability and suspended foreign assistance. Capacity required for
         taking budget planning and execution to the next level is still scarce and needs to be
         reinforced. In the domain of governance, strengthening the capacity of staff in charge
         of internal controls and of the entities entrusted with external controls will requi re
         additional training and financial resources for equipment and day-to-day operations.
         The capacity risk have been mitigated through the provision of technical assistance
         under IDA projects and TF grants (Financial Sector and Governance TA Project
         supporting financial sector reform, LICUS grant for Economic Recovery and
         International Reengagement providing support to reforms in public procurement,
         cotton, coffee, cocoa, energy sectors and port). The IMF continues to provide assistance
         in public financial management and to key financial administrations like the Customs
         and Tax Departments through its West AFRITAC based in Bamako. Other donors
         (AfDB, EC and France) are supporting, or plan to support, capacity building efforts in
         various sectors. But ultimately it will be up to the Government to fully recognize the
         existing capacity constraints (some but not all of which can be solved through increased
         financial resources) and address them vigorously, including through establishing
         performance indicators for Government departments and holding senior staff
         accountable.

6.30 In IDA's assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA's assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

         AND FINANCES


       N°544/MEF/CAB                                         Lomé, February 8, 2011


The Minister of Economy and Finance

Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President of the World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20433
United States of America

Mr. President,

1.      This Letter of Development Policy (LDP) presents the progress made and outlines the
current socioeconomic situation and trends for the 2011-2013 period. It describes the
development policies and objectives identified by the authorities with the aim of cont inuing their
budget support program started in 2008, which seeks to strengthen economic growth and reduce
poverty. To achieve these objectives, the authorities are continuing to seek assistance from the
international community and in particular the World Bank, through the Fourth Economic
Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG-4).

I.     Political and Socioeconomic Context

2.     The tranquil political climate facilitated the convening of peaceful legislative elections in
October 2007 and presidential elections in March 2010, the results of which were accepted by
the international community. To strengthen political cohesion, a political agreement was
concluded between the two main political parties. The conclusion of this agreement led to the
formation of a national unity Government shortly after the March 4, 2010 elections, a move that
helped solidify the peaceful political situation in Togo.

3.      Following the full restoration of cooperation with the technical and financial partners and
the establishment of major democratic and economic institutions, the Government turned its
attention to achieving economic recovery through economic development and poverty reduction
programs, while continuing to foster a peaceful political climate.

4.      The Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission, established to investigate the
political violence that has plagued the country since independence, conducted outstanding on -site
work. It took more than 18,000 depositions, which will be reviewed by national and international
experts. It plans to continue social dialogue with the aim of strengthening the progress achieved
through the Comprehensive Political Agreement (CPA) concluded in August 2006.


                                                42
5. The economic recovery and poverty reduction program seeks to restore macroeconomic
stability, establish sound public finances, improve the public procurement system, and strengthen
public enterprise governance with a view to promoting economic growth and raising the standard
of living of the population. This program is set forth in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), which the Government approved on June 20, 2009, after a lengthy national consultation
process, implementation of which started through the Priority Action Program (PAP).

6.    The three-year program (2008-2010), supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility concluded with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Extended Credit Facility,
has been satisfactorily executed thus far, despite the difficult economic situation created by the
global financial crisis. Moreover, the financial situation has improved, owing to sustained
efforts to make public finance management rigorous and transparent. Based on the
macroeconomic framework, which was updated following the IMF mission in September 2010,
estimates of 2010 total revenue stood at CFAF 267.6 billion compared to revenue of CFAF
252.39 billion in 2009. The State has adopted a plan to settle domestic arrears, implementation of
which has been under way since 2009. Sector reform, particularly in the banking, cotton,
energy, and phosphate sectors is continuing. All measures related to triggers have thus far been
met, as a result of which Togo was able to reach the completion point under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative on December 14, 2010.

7.    The growth registered following the Government's efforts to jump start the economy was
positive but remains inadequate relative to poverty reduction needs. In 2010, based on
preliminary information, growth is projected at 3.4 percent, a rate higher than 2009 (3.2 percent).
It should be noted that growth in 2009 was led by the agricultural sector. Signs of slippage in the
sector's performance in 2010 are attributable to unpredictable rainfall patterns during the second
quarter of the year. In addition, inflation was brought under control in 2010, with average
indexes for the first half of 2010 being 1.2 percent higher than the second quarter of 2009.

8.      The recent economic outlook has been changed by the end of the recession in most
industrialized countries and an acceleration of growth in emerging countries, among them Asia
and, in particular, China. Prospects for global economic recovery are fueling optimism which,
though cautious, is sufficient to raise hopes in Togo for the robust economic growth anticipated
by the Togolese people, particularly after reaching the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative.

9.     Signs of economic recovery are becoming clearer in Togo and the projected growth rate
for 2011 stands at 3.7 percent. This modest growth is attributable to the long wait periods for the
tangible effects of the various economic reforms implemented by the Government in all sectors
of the economy.

II. The 2011­2012 Program

General Objectives

10.    During the 2011­2012 period, the Government expects to step up its economic recovery
program by continuing and strengthening the economic reforms that have already been started.
These reforms target maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework conducive to sustainable


                                                43
economic growth capable of improving the population's living conditions. The goals for 2011 are
to (i) continue the economic reform program, which focuses on achieving greater transparency by
combating fraud and corruption; (ii) improve public finance management; (iii) adhere closely to
the financial orthodoxy in budget execution; (iv) honor the commitments made to international
financial institutions (IMF, World Bank, and African Development Bank, in particular) and
bilateral donors with a view to strengthening relations; (v) further strengthen the audit system (the
Court of Accounts [Cour des Comptes], the General State Inspectorate [Inspection Générale d'Etat
IGE], and the General Finance Inspectorate [Inspection Générale des Finances IGF]); and (vi)
make all the new public procurement entities operational, in accordance with WAEMU Directives.
The measures planned to boost agricultural productivity, settle domestic debt, and increase
absorptive capacity as well as the level of public investment expenditure will pave the way for
achieving a real GDP growth rate of over 3.7 percent in 2011 and for increasing the growth rate in
the years ahead. Special emphasis will be placed on the promising economic growth sectors,
among them the agricultural and mining sectors, in particular the phosphate sector. To this end,
the National Agricultural Investment and Food Security Program [Programme National
d'Investissement Agricole et la Sécurité Alimentaire PNIA-SA] adopted by the Government is
being executed, and some projects linked to this program are being finalized with technical and
financial partners (among them, the World Bank, the West African Development Bank, the
Economic Community of West African States Bank for Investment, and the International Fund for
Agricultural Development), who are assisting the Government with this program. All these
activities are aimed at lending renewed impetus to the agricultural sector. Togo became an
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Candidate and intends to implement its action
plan for the next two years in order to become an EITI member country.

11.     Togo's full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for the 2009-2011 period, which
sets forth the medium-term plans of the Government, will probably be revised to provide the
country with a medium-term vision prior to drafting a new generation document corresponding
to Togo's outlook spanning the same timeframe. A reform program is included in the current
document. These reforms essentially target (i) strengthening public finance management; (ii)
improving the investment climate so as to foster private sector growth; (iii) expanding access to
health and education; (iv) building and rehabilitating road and energy sector infrastructure; and
(v) continuing the financial sector restructuring process. The Government will continue its work
with the aim of achieving its objectives set forth in the PRSP.

Governance and Structural Reforms

12.     The Government is firm in its resolve to continue to improve public finance management
in the context of economic and financial governance. To this end, a Reform Strategy was
adopted by the Government in September 2010 by Presidential Decree. It places special
emphasis on public finance management reforms and undertakes to continue work to combat
corruption and fraud and to create an economic and regulatory clim ate conducive to economic
activity.

13.      The Government has proceeded with the establishment and operationalization of audit
institutions, namely the General Finance Inspectorate and the Court of Accounts, among others.
It plans to strengthen these entities in 2011. The 2010 budget was executed in a rigorous,
transparent, and efficient manner, with no accumulation of domestic or foreign arrears or


                                                 44
recourse to special public expenditure execution procedures. Revenue and expenditure
procedures reflect implementation of the reforms started by the Government. The 2010 budget
was executed using the Integrated System for Public Finance Management [Système Intégré de
Gestion de Finances Publiques SIGFiP]. The 2011 draft budget was adopted by the Council of
Ministers and approved by the National Assembly on December 22, 2010. This budget, like the
previous one, accords priority to expenditures on education, health, infrastructure rehabilitation,
agriculture and energy, water and sanitation, and the settlement of domestic debt.

14.     In 2011, the Government will continue implementation of the reforms that facilitated
achievement of the completion point, in particular (i) continuing implementation of the full
PRSP; (ii) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (iii) tracking public expenditure on poverty
reduction; (iv) submitting draft budget review laws to the Court of Accounts; (v) strengthening
public finance management transparency; (vi) continuing implementation of t he domestic debt
settlement strategy and the securitization of arrears owed to its suppliers; (vii) continuing
publication of data on foreign and domestic debt; (viii) preserving the viability of public debt by
giving priority to grants or loans on highly concessional terms; (ix) strengthening
implementation of the National Education Sector Plan; (x) adopting a plan of action to
strengthen, in the short term, capacity for rapid and efficient project execution; (xi) continuing
reform of the public procurement system; and (xii) finalizing public enterprise reform.

15.     In addition to these measures, the Government undertakes to (i) incorporate the six
WAEMU public finance Directives into domestic legislation; (ii) draft the implementing
documents for the WAEMU public finance management Directives; (iii) continue publication of
quarterly budget execution reports; (iv) continue to submit the draft budget to the National
Assembly along with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework for the sectoral departments by
the statutory deadlines; (v) institute the updated provisional cash flow management process by
preparing new monthly revenue and expenditure forecasting charts; (vi) establish an effective
mechanism for following up on the recommendations of audit missions; (vii) provide risk-based
approach and performance audit training (IGF and IGE); and (viii) study the feasibility of the
Integrated System for Public Procurement Management [Système Intégré de Gestion des Marchés
Publics (SIGMAP)]. The Government has adopted these measures in the areas of public finance,
the financial sector, the phosphate sector, the cotton sector, the energy sector, the transport
sector, and the social sectors. This LDP goes on to describe the key actions that we have taken
in each of the foregoing sectors as well as the actions planned for 2010-2011.

Reestablishment of the Financial Orthodoxy

16.      Public expenditure management has improved considerably owing to the (i) sound
execution of the 2010 budget; (ii) effective implementation of a cash flow plan based on a
monthly budget execution performance chart; and (iii) strengthening of internal budget execution
audits. The Government will continue to improve cash flow management and procurement
procedures and will publish budget execution reports periodically. The activities listed below
illustrate the Government's reform efforts in the area of public finance:

       Eighty percent of budget allocations for current and investment expenditures for all the
       priority ministries were authorized since the beginning of the year, and 100 percent by
       July 2010.


                                                45
   The draft budget for 2011, accompanied by the MTEF of the Ministries of Education,
   Health, and Agriculture, was submitted to the National Assembly on November 12, 2010,
   which approved it on December 22, 2010.
   2010 budget execution reports are produced quarterly and submitted to Togolese news
   agents, the World Bank, and the IMF within two months of the review period. This
   information is also available on the website of the Permanent Secretariat for Policy
   Reform and Financial Program Monitoring (www.togoreforme.com).
   The performance chart for the monthly tracking of budget execution was introduced and
   continues to be prepared and transmitted each month to the development partners and
   published on the website www.togoreforme.com. This performance chart serves as a true
   decision-making tool of the Treasury Planning Committee and the Government as a
   whole.
   The Government has continued with implementation of the strategy to settle domestic
   debt arrears with a view to restoring the confidence of suppliers. The strategy applies to
   all domestic debt arrears included in the 2007 audit conducted by the firm KPMG and
   updated in subsequent years, which was validated by the Government.
   The Government has adopted a public procurement reform action plan, based on the 2003
   CPAR, by establishing the General Procurement Department [Direction Nationale du
   Contrôle des Marchés Publics DNCMP], the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority
   [Autorité de Régulation des Marchés Publics ARMP], and the Public Procurement
   Oversight Offices [Services de Contrôle des Marchés Publics SCMP] in the five priority
   ministries and the municipality of Lomé. The authorities for the first two entities were
   established by appointing a Director General for Public Procurement Oversight and a
   Director General of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority. These entities will be
   fully staffed in 2011. The public procurement website has been created
   (www.marchespublics-togo.com) and the first issue of the Public Procurement Journal
   [Journal des marchés publics] was published in December 2010.
   The Integrated System for Public Finance Management (SIGFiP) has been operational
   since 2009 and was used for execution of the 2010 budget in order to enhance efficiency
   and transparency.
   The preliminary draft Decree-Laws and draft Decrees related to the adoption of the six
   WAEMU Directives were prepared and transmitted to the Secrétariat Général du
   Gouvernement on December 15, 2010.
   The November 2010 cash balance was generated by SIGFiP.
   An Interministerial Committee and Technical Secretariat for Forecasting tasked with
   assisting the Treasury Committee have been established by means of Decree.
   The draft budget review laws for FY 2007 and 2008 have been prepared and submitted to
   the Court of Accounts. Preparation of the draft 2009 budget review law is under way as
   FY 2010 draws to a close.
   The 2007 and 2008 financial statements for the cotton and phosphate public enterprises
   as well as the Togo télécom company and the Togo Electricity Company [Compagnie


                                           46
       d'énergie électrique du Togo CEET] have been submitted to the Court of Accounts. In
       addition, plans have been made to begin drafting of the Court of Accounts's Manual of
       Procedures, with work covering a six-month period.
       The cost accounting system is being set up at the New Cotton Company of Togo
       [Nouvelle Société Cotonnière du Togo NSCT], pursuant to the recommendations
       contained in the assessment report of an international firm.
       Cotton producer federations and groups have been trained with assistance from the
       European Union, under the guidance of COM-STABEX, in several areas that have the
       potential to strengthen their capacity for representation on the Administrative Council of
       the NSCT. This entails training members in cooperative principles. Small farmers in
       leadership roles have also been introduced to the changes in the entities, joint leadership
       and cooperative principles, the roles and responsibilities of decision-making entities, and
       administrative procedures. Several other training sessions, which were wrapped up on
       October 31, 2010, were also provided to this group. Specific documentation was
       provided to the National Federation of Cotton Producer Groups [Fédération Nationale
       des Groupements des Producteurs de Coton FNGPC] on OHADA legislation. Training
       will be continued in the context of the National Agricultural Investment and Food
       Security Program [Programme National d'Investissement Agricoles et de Sécurité
       Alimentaire PNIASA].
       The EITI detailed action plan for Togo was adopted by the Steering Committee and
       transmitted to the EITI International Secretariat, which made it possible for Togo to join
       the EITI following the EITI International Board Meeting in Tanzania on October 20,
       2010.
       The results of the reconciliation of the sales revenue of the phosphate sector with its
       royalties and fees paid to the public treasury in 2009 were prepared and published on
       October 8, 2010 and then implemented.
       An Interministerial Decree revising low-tension electricity tariffs was adopted on
       November 26, 2010.

17.     During the 2011­2012 period, the Togolese authorities intend to take further action to
strengthen public finance management.

18.     The Government will continue to improve PEFA scores through the implementation of
the reform strategy for public finance management. It will also continue to address the
challenges pertaining to public expenditure management, which was highlighted in the recent
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) report. This
includes (i) improving budget programming; (ii) observing the budget schedule; (iii) aligning, in
a more effective manner, expenditures on the line items initially approved while maintaining the
priorities identified in Togo's poverty reduction strategy; (iv) increasing the share of
expenditures on the priority sectors; (v) applying and expanding use of all SIGFiP modules; (vi)
continuing publication of budget-related information; (vii) continuing efforts to train Court of
Accounts judges and boost the staff complement, as well as provide them with the tools and
materials needed for their work; and (viii) strengthening the internal audit and inspection unit,
the General Finance Inspectorate (IGF), and the General State Inspectorate (IGE).


                                               47
To that end, the Government intends to:

         Incorporate the six WAEMU public finance Directives into domestic legislation (2011)
         and draft the implementing documents for the WAEMU public finance management
         Directives (2012).
         Publish quarterly budget execution reports for 2011 (the first three quarters);
         Submit the 2012 draft budget along with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework for
         the education, health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and infrastructure sectors to the
         National Assembly by the statutory deadlines.
         Close the annual accounts for the 2010 financial year by using the SIGFiP system .
         Institute the updated provisional cash flow management process by preparing revenue
         and expenditure forecasting charts on a monthly basis.
         Establish an effective mechanism for following up on the recommendations of audit
         missions, provide risk-based approach and performance audit training (IGF and IGE),
         boost IGF personnel, increase the Court of Accounts's personnel (assistant auditors,
         clerks of the court, accountants, and other positions), and provide training for Court of
         Accounts judges in examining draft budget review laws.
         Develop standard procurement documents (supplies, works, and the consultant), conduct
         contract audits for 2010 in five key ministries, seven major companies (Togo télécom,
         NSCT, LONATO, CEET, TdE, SALT, and PAL), and the municipality of Lomé, as well
         as a feasibility study on the Integrated System for Public Procurement Management
         (SIGMAP), introduce the implementing regulation defining the limits of the authority of
         the Public Procurement Oversight Commissions (CCMP) and procurement thresholds.
         Adopt terms of reference, hire the consultant, and launch the study for the private sector
         participation in the capital of the New Cotton Company of Togo (NSCT).
         Prepare a strategic plan for the implementation of phases 2 and 3 of the recovery strategy
         for the phosphate sector, including the search for a strategic partner, update the mining
         sector's political, legal, and regulatory framework, improve corporate governance of the
         New Phosphate Company of Togo (SNPT), computerize the spare parts storage and
         inventory system, adopt social responsibility norms.
         Formulate and implement a plan to safeguard the financial equilibrium of the electricity
         subsector, and implement the recommendations of the CEET's organizational audit.

Financial Sector Reforms

19.    Significant progress has been made with the restructuring of the banking system so that it
can perform its role with respect to financial intermediation and financing the economy, with a
view to contributing to sustainable growth.


20.      The Government remains committed to privatizing the public banks (BTCI, UTB, BTD,



                                                  48
and BIA-TOGO). The law on the privatization of public enterprises was adopted by the Council
of Ministers and approved by the National Assembly on October 4, 2010. This law is a top
legislative priority of the Government. A committee for privatizations has already been
established, and will review the various strategic choices related to the privatization of banks and
submit recommendations for adoption by the Council of Ministers, thus authorizing the Minister
of Economy and Finance to continue the bank privatization process.

21.     The process to establish a recovery mechanism for non-performing loans acquired by the
State during the bank restructuring exercise is proceeding smoothly. Technical assistance is
being provided by BMet and the IMF. The technical advisors submitted their report on
alternatives to the mechanism, and the Government opted for the establishment of a new debt
collection company. The advisors are preparing a business plan for the company. The
Government's bank restructuring process is intended to avoid a recurrence of the problems that
led to the difficulties encountered.

22.     The institutional restructuring process includes the development of internal procedures,
strengthening of internal controls and loan procedures, and the preparation of procedures
manuals. In addition, an oversight committee that has been instituted will supervise the
management-related activities of the banks, along with the Central Bank, until the bank
privatization process has been completed. These measures, which are supplemented by
monitoring and evaluation conducted by World Bank and IMF staff, the Financial Sector and
Governance Project (PSFG), and the FEC, will improve governance.

23.    The Government is committed to actively seeking reference partners with a solid capital
base and renowned expertise in order to proceed with the privatization process.

24.    The medium-term objective of these reforms is to restructure the banks that will
contribute once again to financing the economy.

25.    The microfinance sector plays a key role in efforts to reduce poverty, create jobs, and
finance the economy in Togo. As a result, the Government intends to continue its work in this
sector with a view to its development.

26.     The problems experienced with Togo's pension systems are a source of concern for the
Government. Consequently, a financial and organizational audit of Togo's Pension Fund [Caisse
de Retraite du Togo CRT] was conducted and the actuarial study was launched in September
2010. A number of actuarial studies on the Social Security Administration [Caisse Nationale de
Sécurité Sociale] have also been planned in the context of the Financial Sector and Governance
Project.

27.    The Government intends to consolidate gains made in the financial system for the 2010 ­
2011 period by using a specific strategy for each component, namely the banking sector, the
pension system, and the microfinance sector.




                                                49
Phosphate Sector Reforms

28.    The Government has made significant strides in meeting the eligibility criteria for
becoming a candidate to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Togo
became a Candidate country on October 20, 2010 and is expecting to implement the detailed action
plan over the next two years in order to become a member country.

29.     The Government will continue to ensure transparency in the sector, publish the financial
flows from the sector, in particular the reconciliation of data on revenues from phosphate sales and
from royalties and fees paid to the State, in accordance with EITI criteria. This operation will be
extended to cover other mining resources for the implementation of the EITI action plan.

30.    The Government is also implementing the development strategy for the phosphate sector,
adopted in April 2010 for the recovery of this sector. A boost in phosphate production is
expected in 2011.

31.    The restoration of good governance, supported by a sound strategic vision for the
development of the mining sector as a whole, is the Government's primary objective and the
challenge that still lies ahead.

Cotton Sector Reforms

32.     In the cotton sector, pursuant to the recommendations made in the strategic audit,
SOTOCO was liquidated, and a new cotton company was established and reorganized to ensure
its financial viability. Major reforms were implemented and the Government intends to put
mechanisms in place in order to exploit the potential of the upturn in global prices. Cotton
production is projected to increase in 2011. However, problems pertaining to the financing of
inputs persist. The Government also intends to launch feasibility studies to facilitate the gradual
deregulation of the cotton industry.

33.     Other reforms are under way. They relate to (i) the introduction of a cost accounting
system in accordance with the recommendations set forth in the evaluation report; and (ii) the
strengthening of the representational capacities of small farmer leaders serving on the
Administrative Council of the NSCT.

34.      The other programs being executed in the cotton sector pertain to:

         Decision making aimed at reducing production costs at all levels;

         Financing of research and rehabilitation of roads in cotton growing areas, cotton
         warehouses, and ginning mills; and

         The conduct of an external audit of each financial year.

35.    The ultimate goal is to establish, as quickly as possible, a sector comprising a private
cotton company in which the State and producers hold a minority stake.




                                                 50
Energy Sector Reforms

36.     Continuing to strengthen the financial position of the Togo Electricity Company (CEET)
is a priority for the Government. We have adjusted electricity rates in order to take cost prices for
the CEET into account and help maintain its viability. Other major reforms have been instituted,
in particular the settlement of debt owed to the CEET by the State, local governments,
government offices, and public entities with independent budgets.

37.    With World Bank support, the Government launched an organizational audit of the CEET,
and the implementation of the ensuing recommendations will help enhance the company's
performance.

38.    The performance contract concluded between the Government and the CEET is being
executed, and the State intends to provide support to the CEET to ensure its successful outcome.

39.     With a view to boosting energy capacity, a contract was concluded with the Contour Global
company for the production of 100 MW of thermal energy. This company commenced production
in October 2010, which has eased energy supply constraints, and helped enhance the reliability of
the energy supply, thus boosting the competitiveness of enterprises. In addition, a plan to construct
a hydroelectric power plant in Adjarala is currently under consideration. The Government also
equipped the CEET with another 20 MGW thermal power plant in 2009. Along with Benin and
Ghana, Togo is also a member of the West African Power Pool (WAPP), which is working to
construct the 330 KV line aimed at significantly increasing the electricity supply in the countries
in the subregion. The Sodigaz company was also established in 2010 to provide domestic gas to
households.

40.     The Government will proceed with the following actions already under way: (i)
strengthening private sector participation in the development of energy production; (ii) increasing
subregional cooperation in the production, purchase, sale, and transport of energy; (iii) promoting
the general use of domestic gas (LPG); (iv) establishing a fund for rural electrification; (v)
introducing a financing mechanism for the sector with the participation of external donors and the
domestic financial system; (vi) building awareness among households of the efficient use of all
forms of energy; (vii) ensuring the sector's financial sustainability by improving collection rates,
replacing certain equipment, and systematically paying public consumption costs; and (viii)
developing, in the longer term, a sector plan designed to provide low-cost electricity to consumers.
Transport Sector Reforms
41.     In the area of land transport, the Government intends to improve the road infrastructure
by rehabilitating highways and roads, and building new highways and roads. There are plans to
construct bypasses for two geological obstacles--the Faille d'Aledjo and the Faille de Défalé.
Several other segments in Lomé and in the country's inland areas are being rehabilitated or even
rebuilt. We have secured funding for several works in the port area and the construction of a
bypass for the city of Lomé. In the 2011 budget, considerable resources have been allocated for
the construction and rehabilitation of roads in Lomé. In view of this sector's tremendous needs,
the Government will make a bond issue, and the funds will be channeled to this sector as a
priority. Furthermore, the Government is counting on support from donors in this road sector
over the next five years.


                                                 51
42.     Since 2005, the Government has undertaken to revitalize road maintenance programs,
notably through the Road Maintenance Fund [Fonds d'Entretien Routier FER]. As the FER
failed to meet expectations, the Government opted to dissolve it in 2008 and replace it with the
Road Fund [Fonds Routier FR], the Autonomous Toll and Road Maintenance Company
[Compagnie Autonome de Péage et pour l'Entretien des Routes CAPER], and the National Road
Council [Conseil National des Routes CNR]. The Government intends to continue (i) the
construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of rural and agricultural roads, urban roads,
bridges, and national and inter-State highways; (ii) the expansion or division of sections of the
major access roads to the capital; (iii) the improvement of the layout of the road network; (iv)
support of the private organization of mass transport; and (v) the resumption of the
implementation of common policies and regional projects within ECOWAS and WAEMU in
order to improve the circulation of goods and persons.

43.     With respect to maritime transport, major reforms aimed at improving the quality of
services offered at the Autonomous Port Authority of Lomé [Port Autonome de Lomé PAL] have
been under way for several years. To that end, handling services were contracted to three private
enterprises (Manuport, SE2M, and SE3M). In addition, the installation of the ASYCUDA ++
software in the Port Authority's customs offices helped enhance the efficiency and speed of port
operations. A preliminary assessment to ascertain the progress of concessions and adopt measures
to enhance efficiency will be conducted in the short term. In that regard, the Port Authority, which
seeks to provide quality services to its customers, designed a port development program that
includes, inter alia, the construction of a third dock, which should begin very shortly, and a harbor
basin to transform the Lomé port into a hub for the subregion through increased port capacity, the
development of several parking areas, the construction of an inland dry port, and the introduction,
in the near future, of a one-stop shop, whose primary objective is to facilitate and expedite the
various formalities and the implementation of a transit monitoring program. With a view to
improving the security, speed, and the efficiency of port operations, the port community formed an
association known as the Alliance for the Promotion of the Lomé Port [Alliance pour la Promotion
du Port de Lomé A2PL], whose primary objective is to provide a discussion forum for all actors in
Togo's maritime transport chain.

44.     The Government also intends to define a long-term vision for the development and
positioning of PAL. Plans are therefore afoot to conduct a strategic study.

Social Sector Reforms

45.    With respect to the health sector, the Government intends to step up implementation of the
national health development plan in the medium term (2008-2012), including a medium-term
human resource development component for the health sector adopted in July 2009. The health
code was adopted by the Government and approved by the National Assembly in May 2009.
The Government also intends to conduct an institutional audit of the Ministry of Healt h. In
addition to these measures, the Government will carry out other actions, including (i) the
continued strengthening of infrastructure and equipment, and of human resources, and the
preparation of a health map to accord greater priority to areas poorly covered by the health
system; (ii) the promotion of child and maternal health through access to preventive and curative
services, the implementation of an Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), the prevention of
sexually transmitted diseases and the implementation of primary health care for newborns, infants,


                                                 52
and children; (iii) the continued prevention and treatment of malaria through the provision and
distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), the reduction of the price of anti-malaria
medication and the implementation of a malaria treatment policy; (iv) the ongoing strengthening
of tuberculosis screening and treatment through increased capacity to detect new cases of
pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB+) and improvements in the quality of therapeutic care; (v) continued
prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS through awareness building among young people and sex
workers, condom distribution, STI prevention, blood safety, counseling for voluntary and
anonymous testing, and capacity building for patient care; and (vi) the formulation and
implementation of a national health insurance strategy. The Government therefore adopted a
decree on health insurance for government employees. The Government is stepping up measures
in this area in order to reduce the neonatal mortality rate and achieve one of the MDGs (and
launch CARMA).

46.      In the education sector, as part of the implementation of the National Education Sector
Plan, the Government provided initial training to at least 500 newly recruited teachers and
continuing training to at least 4,000 current teachers. It intends to continue efforts to incorporate
volunteer and assistant teachers as well into the public service and (i) construct and rehabilitate
educational infrastructure; (ii) train trainers and educators; (iii) incorporate, in the short term, all
of these actions into a sector program related to the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative for
which a financing agreement was concluded between the Government and the World Bank; (iv)
continue improving teaching conditions in technical training and professional training; (iv)
continue promoting the education of girls by reducing school expenses; (v) further improve the
quality of higher education and promote gender equality in this sphere; and (vi) strengthen
facilities to accommodate the increasingly large number of students enrolled in the country's
universities.

47.      The water and sanitation sector remains a priority for the Government, which intends to
continue its efforts to improve access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure. To that end,
the Government designed and adopted the national water policy and prepared the draft policy
letter for potable water supply in urban areas. A draft action plan for the Integrated Management
of Water Resources (GIRE) and the water code were developed. Several potable water supply
projects are being executed, significantly increasing the rate of access by the population to water
with the construction and rehabilitation of boreholes. The lagoon in Lomé is current ly being
cleaned and standing water is being drained. We will continue to carry out emergency rainwater
purification works for Lomé and the development of sanitation master plans for all other towns.
The Government will continue to build awareness among households in the area of water and
sanitation.

48.     Support for community development. With a view to improving the living conditions of
the poorest populations, the Government, with World Bank support through the emergency
project for community development, undertook to provide these poor population segments with
better access to quality public services and economic opportunities.




                                                  53
III. Other Activities

The PRSP Process and HIPC

49.     The Government adopted its poverty reduction strategy (PRSP) in June 2009. It intends to
implement the measures set forth in the full PRSP with a view to achieving the completion point in
2010. Against this backdrop, the Priority Action Program (PAP) was validated in November
2009, thus reflecting PRSP implementation. It bears noting that provision was made for the PAP in
the 2011 budget. On September 29, 2010, the Government also adopted a reform strategy that
accords priority to public finance management, along with a policy matrix.

Monitoring and Evaluation

50.    The Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for the overall implementation of
the program supported by the Fourth Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG -4). The
Permanent Secretariat for Policy Reform and Financial Program Monitoring (PS-PRPF) is tasked
with the day-to-day monitoring and evaluation of the program. This entity coordinates the
implementation of the Government's program and is assisted by a Program and Reform
Monitoring Committee. The Government will provide quarterly reports to the World Bank on
the program's implementation progress, which is measured against the timetables and agreed
performance indicators.

51.     It is the Government's hope that these political, economic, and social reforms will help
strengthen its relations with the World Bank and all other bilateral and multilateral partners in
order to mobilize the resources needed to reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium
Development Goals by 2015.

Request for Financing

52.     The Government is determined to strengthen gains in political stability, continue the
structural reforms initiated in 2006, and benefit from the impact of the reduction of the country's
debt. To that end, the Togolese authorities are committed to implementing the program presented
above and detailed in the matrix in the attached annex. The Government is therefore requesting
technical and financial assistance from the World Bank to execute its ambitious program through
the Fourth Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG-4), and that consideration be
given to the possibility of providing IDA-funded loans for the reconstruction of damaged road
infrastructure following more than 15 years of social and political turmoil.

Very truly yours,

                             Lettre de Politique de Développement




Monsieur le Président,


1.     La présente Lettre de Politique de Développement (LPD) présente les avancées
enregistrées et retrace la situation socio-économique actuelle ainsi que les tendances pour 2011-
2013. Elle décrit les objectifs et les politiques de développement définis par les autorités pour la
poursuite de leur programme d'appui budgétaire démarré en 2008 et qui vise à consolider la
croissance économique et à réduire la pauvreté. Pour atteindre ces objectifs, les autorités
continuent de rechercher l'appui de la communauté internationale et notamment celui de la
Banque Mondiale à travers le quatrième Don pour la Relance Economique et la Gouvernance
(DREG-4).

I.     Contexte politique et socio-économique

2.     Le climat politique apaisé a permis des élections législative en octobre 2007 et
présidentielles en mars 2010 pacifiques et acceptés par la communauté internationale. Pour
consolider la détente de la situation politique, un accord politique entre les deux (2) principaux
partis politiques a été signé. La signature de cet accord à conduit à la formation d'un
Gouvernement d'union nationale au lendemain de cette élection du 04 mars 2010 qui a contribué
a consolider l'apaisement du climat politique au Togo.

3.       Après la pleine reprise de la coopération avec les Partenaires Techniques et Financiers et
l'installation des institutions démocratiques et économiques majeures, le Gouvernement s'est


                                                55
appesanti à la relance économique avec des programmes de développement économique et de
réduction de la pauvreté tout en continuant l'apaisement politique.

4.     La mise en place par de la Commission Vérité Justice et Réconciliation chargée de faire
la lumière sur les violences d'ordre politique que le pays a connues depuis son in dépendance a
fait un travail remarquable sur le terrain avec plus de dix huit milles dépositions qui seront
analysées par les experts nationaux et internationaux. Il compte poursuivre le dialogue social en
vue de consolider les acquis de l'Accord Politique Global (APG) signé en août 2006.

5.       Le programme de relance économique et de la réduction de la pauvreté vise à rétablir la
stabilité macroéconomique, assainir les finances publiques, améliorer le système de passation des
marchés publics et à renforcer la gouvernance dans les entreprises publiques en vue promouvoir
la croissance économique et améliorer le niveau de vie de la population. Ce programme est
contenu dans le Document de Stratégie de Réduction de la Pauvreté (DSRP) que le
Gouvernement a approuvé le 20 juin 2009 après une longue consultation nationale et dont la
mise en oeuvre a démarré à travers le Programme d'Actions Prioritaires (PAP).

6.      Le programme triennal (2008-2010) appuyé par la Facilité pour la Réduction de la
Pauvreté et la Croissance conclu avec le Fonds Monétaire International (FMI) et la Facilité
Elargie de Crédit a connu une exécution satisfaisante jusqu'alors malgré la conjoncture
économique difficile liée à la crise financière mondiale. Par ailleurs, grâce aux efforts soutenus
de rigueur et de transparence dans la gestion des finances publiques, la situation financière s'est
améliorée. Sur la base du cadre macroéconomique mis à jour après la mission du FMI du
septembre 2010, les estimations des recettes totales sont de 267,6milliards de F CFA en 2010
contre une réalisation de 252,39 milliards de F CFA en 2009. L'Etat a adopté un plan
d'apurement des arriérés intérieurs qui est en cours de mise en oeuvre depuis 2009. Les réformes
des secteurs notamment bancaire, cotonnier, énergétique et des phosphates se sont poursuivies.
Toutes les mesures portant sur les déclencheurs sont à présent réalisées, ce qui a permis au pays
d'atteindre le point d'achèvement de l'initiative PPTE les 10 et 14 décembre 2010.

7.      La croissance enregistrée suite aux efforts du Gouvernement pour relancer l'économie a
été positive mais reste insuffisante face aux besoins de réduction de la pauvreté. En 2010, sur la
base des informations préliminaires, la croissance atteindrait 3,4 pour cent, soit un taux plus
élevé qu'en 2009 (3,2 pour cent). Il est à noter que la croissance de 2009 a été tirée par le secteur
agricole. La moins bonne performance apparente de 2010 dans le secteur s'explique par une
pluviométrie capricieuse au cours du deuxième trimestre 2010. Par ailleurs, l'inflation a été
maitrisée au cours de l'année 2010, la moyenne des indices sur les six premiers mois de l'année
2010 est en hausse de 1,2% par rapport au deuxième trimestre 2009.

8.       La situation économique récente est caractérisée par la fin de la récession dans la plupart
des pays industrialisés et une accélération de la croissance dans les pays émergeants notamment
en Asie et surtout en Chine. Les perspectives d'un redressement de la situation économique
mondiale invite à un optimisme mesuré mais suffisant pour permettre d'espérer une croissance
forte attendue par la population togolaise surtout après l'atteinte du point d'achèvement de
l'Initiative PPTE.




                                                 56
9.      La relance économique commence à se confirmer au Togo et les perspectives de
croissance en 2011 donnent un taux estimé à 3,7 pour cent. Cette croissance modeste est
attribuable au long délais d'effet des différentes réformes que le Gouvernement a mises en oeuvre
dans tous les secteurs de l'économie.

II. Le programme 2011-2012

Objectifs généraux

10.     Le Gouvernement attend renforcer au cours de la période 2011-2012 son programme de
relance économique à travers la poursuite et la consolidation des réformes économiques déjà
entamées. Ces réformes visent le maintien d'un cadre macroéconomique stable favorable à une
croissance économique durable susceptible d'améliorer les conditions de vie des populations.
L'objectif de 2011 est: (i) de poursuivre le programme de réformes économiques axé sur
l'amélioration de la transparence à travers la lutte contre la fraude et la corruption; (ii)
d'améliorer de la gestion des finances publiques; (iii) d'exécuter le budget dans le respect strict
de l'orthodoxie financière; et (iv) de respecter les engagements pris vis-à-vis des institutions
financières internationales (FMI, Banque Mondiale et Banque Africaine de Développement
notamment) et les donateurs bilatéraux dans le but de renforcer les relations; (v) de consolider le
renforcement du système de contrôle (la Cour des Comptes, l'Inspection Générale d'Etat et
l'Inspection Générale des Finances); (vi) de rendre opérationnelles, toutes les nouvelles
structures de passation des marchés publics conformément aux directives de l'UEMOA. Les
mesures prévues pour augmenter la productivité agricole, apurer la dette i ntérieure et améliorer
la capacité d'absorption ainsi que le niveau des dépenses d'investissements publics permettront
d'atteindre une croissance réelle du PIB de plus de 3,7 pour cent en 2011 et d'améliorer le taux
de croissance pour les années à venir. Nous mettrons un accent particulier sur les secteurs
porteurs de croissance économique notamment les secteurs de l'agriculture et minier notamment
les phosphates. A cet effet, le Programme National d'Investissement Agricole et la Sécurité
Alimentaire (PNIA-SA) adopté par le Gouvernement en phase d'exécution, certains projets liés à
ce programme sont en phase de finalisation avec des partenaires techniques et financiers
(notamment la Banque Mondiale, la Banque Ouest Africaine de Développement, la Banque
d'Investissement de la Communauté Economique des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest, le Fonds
International du Développement Agricole) qui accompagnent le Gouvernement dans ce
programme. Tout ceci pour donner un nouveau dynamisme au secteur agricole. Le Togo a été
admis comme pays candidat à l'Initiative de Transparence dans les Industries Extractives (ITIE)
dont il attend mettre en oeuvre son plan d'actions pour les deux (02) années à venir en vue
d'atteindre le statut de pays membre de l'Initiative.

11.     Le Document Complet de Stratégie de Réduction de la Pauvreté au Togo 2009-2011
(DSRP), document qui donne les ambitions du Gouvernement à moyen terme va probablement
être révisé pour permettre au pays de disposer d'une vision à moyen terme avant l'élaboration
d'une nouvelle génération de document de perspective à moyen terme du Togo. Le document
actuel est assorti d'un programme de réformes. Ces reformes visent essentiellement à
poursuivre: (i) le renforcement de la gestion des finances publiques; (ii) l'amélioration du climat
des investissements pour favoriser la croissance du secteur privé; (iii) l'amélioration de l'accès à
la santé et à l'éducation; (iv). La construction et la réhabilitation des infrastructures routières et


                                                 57
du secteur énergétique; (v) la poursuite du redressement du secteur financier. Le Gouvernement
poursuivra ses efforts dans l'atteinte de ses objectifs contenu de le DSRP.

Gouvernance et réformes structurelles

12.     Le Gouvernement est déterminé à poursuivre l'amélioration de la gestion des finances
publiques dans le cadre de la gouvernance économique et financière. A cet effet, une Stratégie
des Réformes a été adoptée par le Gouvernement en septembre 2010 par décret du Président de
la République et qui met un accent particulier sur les réformes de la gestion des finances
publiques. Il s'engage à poursuivre la lutte contre la corruption, et la fraude ainsi que
l'établissement d'un environnement économique et réglementaire propice à l'activité
économique.

13.     Le Gouvernement a procédé à la mise place et à l'opérationnalisation des institutions de
contrôle à savoir l'Inspection Générale des Finances (IGF) et la Cour des Comptes (CC) entre
autres. Il compte renforcer ces structures au cours de l'année 2011. Le budget 2010 a été exécuté
avec rigueur, transparence et efficacité sans accumulation d'arriérés intérieurs et extérieurs ni
recours aux procédures exceptionnelles d'exécution des dépenses publiques. La réalisation des
recettes et l'exécution des dépenses reflètent la mise en oeuvre des réformes engagées p ar le
Gouvernement. Le budget 2010 a été exécuté à partir du Système Intégré de Gestion de Finances
Publiques (SIGFIP). Le projet de budget 2011 a été adopté en Conseil des Ministres et voté par
l'Assemblée Nationale le 22 décembre 2010. Ce budget comme le précédent donne la priorité
aux dépenses d'éducation, de santé, de réhabilitation des infrastructures, de l'agriculture de
l'énergie, de l'eau et assainissement, d'apurement de la dette intérieure.

14.     Au cours de l'année 2011, le Gouvernement va poursuivre la mise en oeuvre des réformes
qui ont permis d'atteindre le point d'achèvement, notamment (i) poursuivre la mise en oeuvre du

         un arrêté interministériel portant modification des tarifs d'électricité basse tension a été
         pris le 26 novembre 2010.

17.     Au cours de la période 2011-2012, les autorités togolaises entendent mettre en oeuvre des
actions additionnelles pour renforcer la gestion des finances publiques. Le Gouvernement
continuera à améliorer les notes obtenues dans le cadre du PEFA à travers la mise en oeuvre de la
stratégie de réforme de la gestion des finances publiques. Il continuera aussi à relever les défis de
la gestion des dépenses publiques soulignée dans le rapport récent de la Revue de la Gestion des
Dépenses Publiques et de la Responsabilité Financière (PEMFA R): ceci inclut (i) l'amélioration
de la programmation budgétaire; (ii) le respect du calendrier budgétaire; (iii) un meilleur
alignement de la composition des dépenses sur les lignes budgétaires initialement approuvées

Réformes du secteur financier

19.     Des progrès notables ont été enregistrés dans la restructuration du système bancaire afin
qu'il puisse jouer son rôle dans l'intermédiation financière et financement de l'économie en vue
de contribuer à une croissance durable.

20.     Le Gouvernement reste déterminer à privatiser les banques publiques (BTCI, UTB, BTD
et BIA-TOGO). La loi sur la privatisation des entreprises publiques a été adoptée en Conseil des
Ministres et voté par l'Assemblée Nationale le 4 octobre 2010. Cette loi constitue une priorité
législative de premier plan pour le gouvernement. Une commission des privatisations a été mise
en place. Elle examinera les différents choix stratégiques liés à la privatisation des banques et
transmettra des recommandations qui feront l'objet d'une adoption en conseil des ministres
donnant mandat au Ministre de l'Economie et des Finances de poursuivre le processus devant
aboutir à la privatisation effective des banques.

21.     Le processus devant mener à la mise sur pied d'une structure de recouvrement des prêts
improductifs acquis par l'Etat dans le cadre de l'assainissement des banques est en bonne voie.
Le processus est appuyé par une assistance technique de la BMet du FMI. Les conseillers
techniques ont présenté leur rapport sur les alternatives pour la structure et le gouvernement a
retenu l'adoption proposée de mettre en place une nouvelle société de recouvrement des
créances. Les conseilleurs préparent un business plan de la société. 17. Le processus de
restructuration des banques entamées par le Gouvernement a pour objectif de s'assurer que les
problèmes ayant conduit aux difficultés ne se répéteront plus.

22.    La restructuration institutionnelle comprend le développement de procédures internes, le
renforcement des contrôles internes et des procédures de prêts et l'élaboration de manuels de
procédures. En outre, un comité de supervision mis en place procédera au contrôle des actions du
management des banques avec l'appui de la Banque Centrale jusqu'à la privatisation totale de ces
banques. Ces mesures, complétées par l'action de suivi et évaluation du staff de la Banque et du
Fonds Monétaire International, le Projet Secteur Financier et Gouvernance (PSFG) et la FEC
vont améliorer la gouvernance.




                                               62
23.     Le Gouvernement est déterminé à rechercher activement des partenaires de référence
disposant d'une assise financière solide et d'un savoir-faire reconnu en vue de procéder à la
privatisation.

24.    L'objectif de ces réformes sur le moyen terme est de restructurer les banques qui
contribueront de nouveau au financement de l'économie.

25.     Le secteur de la micro finance joue un rôle important dans la réduction de la pauvreté, la
création de l'emploi et le financement de l'économie au Togo. C'est pourquoi le gouvernement
entend poursuivre ses efforts dans ce secteur en vue de son développement.

26.    Les difficultés qu'a connu le système des pensions au Togo préoccupent le
gouvernement. A cet effet, un audit financier et organisationnel de la Caisse de Retraites du
Togo (CRT) a été réalisé et l'étude actuarielle a démarré en septembre 2010. Il est prévu
également dans le cadre du Projet Secteur Financier et Gouvernance, des études actuarielles de la
Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale.

27.   Le gouvernement compte consolider les acquis du système financier pour la période
2010-2011 par une stratégie spécifique à chaque composante à savoir le secteur bancaire, le
système des pensions de retraites et le secteur de la micro finance.

Réformes dans le secteur des phosphates

28.     Le Gouvernement a réalisé des progrès considérables pour satisfaire les critères
d'éligibilité à la candidature à l'Initiative pour la Transparence dans les Industries Extractives
(ITIE). Le Togo est devenu pays candidat depuis le 20 octobre 2010 et attend mettre en oeuvre le
plan d'actions détaillé dans les deux années à venir afin de devenir pays membre.

29.     Le gouvernement continuera dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre de la transparence dans le
secteur, la publication des flux financiers issus du secteur notamment la réconciliation des
données sur les recettes des ventes des phosphates ainsi que celles des redevances et taxes
versées à l'Etat selon les critères de l'ITIE. Cette opération sera étendue à d'autres ressources
minières dans la mise en oeuvre du plan d'action de l'ITIE.

30.     Le Gouvernement est également en train de mettre en oeuvre la stratégie du
développement de la filière des phosphates qu'elle a adopté en avril 2010 pour la relance du
secteur des phosphates. Une accélération de la production de phosphates est attendue en 2011.

31.     La restauration de la bonne gouvernance soutenue par une vision stratégique forte pour le
développement du secteur minier dans sa globalité est l'objectif clé du gouvernement et le défi
qui reste à relever.

Réformes dans le secteur du coton

32.  Dans la filière coton, conformément aux recommandations de l'audit stratégique, la
SOTOCO a été liquidée et une nouvelle société de coton a été créée et redimensionnée pour



                                               63
assurer sa viabilité financière. Des réformes majeures ont été m ises en place et le gouvernement
entend mettre en place des mécanismes afin de profiter du potentiel de l'embellie des cours
mondiaux. Une croissance de la production du coton est attendue en 2011. Néanmoins, des
difficultés pour le financement des intrants sont toujours d'actualité. Le gouvernement envisage
entamer des études de faisabilité pour la libéralisation progressive de la filière cotonnière.

33.    D'autres réformes sont en cours. Elles portent sur: (i) la mise en place d'un système de
comptabilité analytique en conformité avec les recommandations du rapport d'évaluation; et (ii)
le renforcement des capacités de représentation des leaders paysans au sein du Conseil
d'Administration de la Nouvelle Société Cotonnière du Togo.

34.      Les autres programmes en cours d'exécution au niveau de la filière cotonnière portent sur:

         la prise de décisions visant la réduction des coûts de production à tous les niveaux;
         le financement de la recherche et la réhabilitation des pistes cotonnières, des magasins de
         stockage du coton et des usines d'égrenage;
         la mise en place d'un audit externe pour chaque exercice.

35.     L'objectif final est de parvenir, le plus rapidement possible, à une filière constituée d'une
société cotonnière privée avec une participation minoritaire de l'Etat et des producteurs.

Réformes du secteur énergétique

36.     La poursuite de l'assainissement de la situation financière de la Compagnie Energie
Electrique du Togo (CEET) est une priorité pour le gouvernement. Nous avons procédé à
l'ajustement des tarifs de l'électricité pour tenir compte des coûts de revient pour la CEET et
contribuer à préserver sa viabilité. D'autres importantes réformes ont été mises en place
notamment l'apurement des arriérés de l'Etat, les Collectivités Locales, les Hôtels étatiques et les
entités publiques à budget autonome envers la CEET.

37.   Le gouvernement a lancé, avec l'appui de la Banque, un audit organisationnel de la
CEET, la mise en oeuvre des recommandations qui seront issue de cet audit permettra
d'augmenter la performance de la compagnie.

38.     Le contrat de performance signé par le Gouvernement et la Compagnie est en cours
d'exécution et l'Etat attend accompagné la compagnie pour un heureux aboutissement de ce
contrat.

39.     En vue du renforcement de la capacité énergétique, un contrat a été signé avec la société
CONTOUR GLOBAL pour la production de 100 MW d'énergie thermique. Cette production de
CONTOUR GLOBAL a démarré en octobre 2010, réduisant ainsi les contraintes d'offre
d'énergie et permettant ainsi de renforcer la fiabilité de la fourniture améliorant la compétitivité
des entreprises. Par ailleurs, un plan de construction d'une centrale hydraulique a Adjarala est en
étude. Le Gouvernement a, en outre, doté la CEET d'une centrale thermique supplémentaire de
20 MGW de puissance en 2009. Avec le Benin et le Ghana, le Togo est également membre du



                                                  64
« West African Power Pool (WAPP)» pour le développement de 330 KV en vue de
l'augmentation substantielle de l'électricité dans les pays de la sous région. La Société
SODIGAZ a été inauguré également en 2010 pour la fourniture du gaz domestique aux ménages.

40.     Le Gouvernement va poursuivre les actions déjà entamées en: (i) renforçant la
participation du secteur privé au développement de la production d'énergie; (ii) intensifiant la
coopération sous-régionale dans le domaine de la production, de l'achat, de la vente et du
transport de l'énergie; (iii) promouvant la vulgarisation de l'utilisation du gaz domestique (GPL);
(iv) créant un Fonds destiné à l'électrification des localités rurales; (v) mettant en place un
mécanisme de financement du secteur avec la participation des bailleurs extérieurs et du système
financier national; (vi) sensibilisant les ménages pour l'utilisation rationnelle de toutes les
formes d'énergie; (vii) recherchant la soutenabilité financière du secteur par l'amélioration du
taux de recouvrement, le renouvellement de certains équipements et le règlement systématique
des coûts de la consommation publique; et (viii) en développant à plus long terme, un plan du
secteur visant a assurer aux clients, la fourniture à moindre coût de l'électricité.

Réformes du secteur des transports

41.     Dans le domaine du transport terrestre, le Gouvernement entend développer les
infrastructures routières par la réhabilitation des routes et pistes, la construction de nouvelles
routes et pistes. Il est prévu le contournement de deux obstacles montagneux voix notamment la
faille d'Alédjo et celle de Défalé. Plusieurs autres tronçons tant à Lomé qu'à l'intérieur du pays
sont entrain d'être réhabilités voire reconstruites. Nous avons obtenu des ressources pour le
financement de plusieurs travaux dans la zone portuaire et la construction d'une route de
contournement de la ville de Lomé. Dans le budget 2011, d'importantes ressources sont prévues
pour la construction et la réhabilitation des routes à Lomé. Compte tenu des besoins énormes que
nécessite ce secteur, le Gouvernement va lancer un emprunt obligataire dont les ressources iront
en priorité vers ce secteur. En outre, le Gouvernement attend le soutien des bail leurs de fonds
dans ce secteur des routes pour les cinq prochaines années.

42.     Depuis 2005, le Gouvernement a entrepris une redynamisation des programmes
d'entretien routier notamment à travers le Fonds d'Entretien Routier (FER). Cette structure
n'ayant pas pu répondre aux attentes, le Gouvernement a décidé de dissoudre le FER en 2008
et le remplacé par le Fonds Routier (FR), la Compagnie Autonome de Péage et pour l'Entretien
des Routes (CAPER) et le Conseil National des Routes (CNR). Le Gouvernement entend
poursuivre: (i) la construction, la réhabilitation et l'entretien des pistes rurales et agricoles, des
voies urbaines, des ponts, des routes nationales et nationales inter-Etats; (ii) l'élargissement ou le
dédoublement des tronçons sur les grands axes d'accès à la capitale; (iii) l'amélioration de
l'ossature du réseau routier; (iv) le soutien de l'organisation privée du transport de masse; et (v)
la redynamisation de la mise en oeuvre des politiques communes et de projets régionaux au sein
de la CEDEAO et de l'UEMOA en vue d'améliorer la circulation des biens et des personnes.

43.     Dans le cadre du transport maritime, des réformes importantes ont été engagées depuis
plusieurs années pour améliorer la qualité des services au Port Autonome de Lomé (PAL). A cet
égard, les services de manutention ont été concédés à trois entreprises privées à savoir Manuport,
SE2M et SE3M. En outre, l'introduction du logiciel Sydonia++ au poste de douanes du Port, a



                                                 65
permis de contribuer à l'amélioration de l'efficacité et de la célérité des opérations portuaires. A
court terme, il sera procédé à une évaluation préliminaire pour apprécier l'état d'avancement des
concessions et prendre des mesures pour plus d'efficacité. A moyen terme, des efforts
supplémentaires seront faits dans le cadre de l'amélioration de la compétitivité du PAL. Dans
cette perspective, le Port, en quête de service de qualité pour ses clients, a élaboré un programme
de développement portuaire qui comprend entre autres, la construction d'un troisième quai dont
les travaux vont démarré incessamment et d'une darse pour faire du port de Lomé un hub pour la
sous-région en augmentant la capacité du port, l'aménagement de plusieurs aires de
stationnement, la construction d'un port sec à l'intérieur du pays, la mise en place prochaine d'un
guichet unique dont l'objectif principal est de faciliter et d'accélérer les différentes formalités et
la mise en place d'un programme de suivi du transit. Afin de renforcer la sécurité, la rapidité et
l'efficacité des opérations portuaires, la communauté portuaire s'est regroupée en une association
dénommée «Alliance pour la Promotion du Port de Lomé» (A2PL) dont le but principal est
d'offrir un cadre de concertation pour tous les acteurs de la chaîne de transport maritime au
Togo.

44.    Par ailleurs, le Gouvernement entend définir une vision à long terme pour le
développement et le positionnement du PAL. A cet effet, il est prévu une étude stratégique à cet
effet.

Réformes des secteurs sociaux

45.     Pour le secteur de la santé, le Gouvernement va consolider la mise en oeuvre du plan
national de développement sanitaire à moyen terme (2008-2012) incluant un plan à moyen terme
de développement des ressources humaines pour le secteur de la santé adopté en juillet 2009. Le
code de la santé a été adopté par le gouvernement et voté par l'Assemblée Nationale en mai 2009.
Par ailleurs, le Gouvernement entend mener un audit institutionnel du Ministère de la santé.
Outre ces mesures, le Gouvernement veillera à d'autres actions telles que: (i) la poursuite du
renforcement des infrastructures et équipements, du renforcement des ressources humaines,
d'élaboration d'une carte sanitaire en vue de favoriser davantage les zones mal couvertes par le
système sanitaire; (ii) la promotion de la santé maternelle et infantile à travers l'accès aux
services préventifs et curatifs, la mise en oeuvre d'un Programme Elargi de Vaccination (PEV), la
prévention des infections sexuellement transmissibles et la mise en oeuvre des soins de santé
primaire infantiles et néonataux; (iii) la poursuite de la prévention et du traitement du paludisme
à travers l'approvisionnement et la distribution de la Moustiquaire Imprégnée d'Insecticide
(MII), la réduction des prix des médicaments antipaludéens et la mise en oeuvre d'une politique
de traitement du paludisme; (iv) la poursuite du renforcement du dépistage et du traitement de la
tuberculose à travers l'accroissement des capacités de détection de nouveaux cas de Tuberculose
Pulmonaire (TPM+) et l'amélioration de la qualité de la prise en charge thérapeutique; et (v) la
poursuite de la prévention et le traitement du VIH/SIDA à travers la sensibilisation des jeunes et
des travailleuses de sexe, la distribution des préservatifs, la prévention des IST, la sécurité du
sang, le conseil pour le dépistage volontaire et anonyme et le renforcement des capacités de prise
en charge des malades; et (vi) l'élaboration et la mise en oeuvre d'une stratégie nationale
d'assurance maladie. De ce fait, le gouvernement a adopté un décret portant assurance maladie
aux agents publics. En vue de réduire la mortalité néonatale et d'atteindre l'un des objectifs des
OMD (et lancé la CARMA) le Gouvernement a entrepris d'accélérer les mesures dans ce
domaine.

46.     Dans le secteur de l'éducation, le Gouvernement a, dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre du
Plan National du Secteur de l'Education, assuré la formation initiale d'au moins 500 enseignants
nouvellement recrutés et la formation continue d'au moins 4 000 anciens enseignants. Il entend
poursuivre l'intégration dans la fonction publique des enseignants volontaires et auxiliaires aussi
et assurer: (i) la construction et la réhabilitation des infrastructures éducatives; (ii) la formation
des formateurs et éducateurs; (iii) l'intégration à court terme, de toutes ces actions dans un
programme sectoriel relatif à l'Initiative de Mise en Accélération de l'Education Pour Tous (Fast
Track) pour lequel une convention de financement a été signée entre le Gouvernement et la
Banque Mondiale; (iv) poursuite de l'amélioration des conditions d'encadrement dans
l'enseignement technique et la formation professionnelle; (vi) continuité de la promotion de
l'éducation de la jeune fille à travers la réduction des frais de scolarité; (v) la consolidation de
l'amélioration de la qualité et de la promotion de l'équité genre dans l'enseignement supérieur;
(vi) la poursuite du renforcement des structures d'accueil pour faire face à l'augmentation de
plus en plus importante des inscrits dans les Universités du pays.

47.     Secteurs de l'eau et de l'assainissement: ce secteur demeure une priorité pour le
gouvernement qui entend poursuivre l'amélioration de l'accès à l'eau potable et aux
infrastructures d'assainissement. Pour ce faire, le gouvernement a élaboré et adopté la politique
nationale de l'eau et élaboré le projet de lettre de politique d'alimentation en eau potable en
milieu urbain. Un projet de plan d'actions de la Gestion Intégrée des Ressources en Eau (GIRE)
a été élaboré ainsi que le code de l'eau. Concernant l'approvisionnement en eau potable,
plusieurs projets sont en cours d'exécution. Ceci a augmenté considérablement le taux de
desserte de la population en eau avec la réalisation et la réhabilitation des forages. La lagune de
la ville de Lomé est en train d'être curée et les eaux stagnantes sont pompées. Nous allons
continuer l'exécution des travaux d'urgence en matière d'assainissement pluvial de la ville de
Lomé et l'élaboration des schémas directeurs d'assainissement des villes autres que Lomé. Le
Gouvernement poursuivra la sensibilisation des ménages en matière de l'eau et de
l'assainissement.

48.    Soutien au développement communautaire: en vue d'améliorer les conditions de vie
des populations les plus démunies, le gouvernement s'est engagé avec l'appui de la Banque
Mondiale à travers le projet d'urgence de développement communautaire à assurer à ces couches
pauvres du pays, un meilleur accès aux services publics de qualité et aux opportunités
économiques.

III. Autres activités

Le processus DSRP et PPTE

49.     Le gouvernement a adopté sa stratégie de réduction de la pauvreté (DSRP) en juin 2009.
Il est déterminé à mettre en oeuvre les mesures contenues dans le DSRP complet en vue
d'atteindre le point d'achèvement en 2010. Dans ce cadre, le Programme d'Actions Prioritaires
(PAP) a été validé en novembre 2009 traduisant ainsi la mise en oeuvre du DSRP. Il est à noter
que le PAP a été pris en compte par le budget 2011. Le Gouvernement a également adopté une
stratégie de réformes accordant une priorité à la gestion des finances publiques le 29 septembre
2010 assortie d'une matrice de mesures.



                                                 67
Suivi et évaluation

50.     Le Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances est chargé de la mise en oeuvre générale du
programme soutenu par le quatrième Don pour la Relance Economique et la Gouvernance
(DREG-4). Le suivi quotidien et l'évaluation du programme sont de la responsabilité du
Secrétariat Permanent pour le suivi des Politiques de Réformes et des Programmes Financiers
(SP-PRPF). Cette structure coordonne la mise en oeuvre du programme du Gouvernement et est
assisté par un comité de suivi des programmes et des réformes. Le Gouvernement fournira des
rapports trimestriels à la Banque Mondiale sur les progrès dans la réalisation du programme,
mesurés par rapport aux calendriers et aux indicateurs de performance convenus.

51.     Le Gouvernement souhaite que ces réformes politique, économique et sociale permettent
de consolider les relations qu'il existe entre lui et la Banque Mondiale et l'ensemble des autres
partenaires bilatéraux et multilatéraux afin de mobiliser les ressources nécessaires à la réduction
de la pauvreté et à l'atteinte des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le Développement d'ici 2015.

Requête de financement

52.      Le Gouvernement est déterminé à consolider les acquis de la stabilité politique, et à
poursuivre les réformes structurelles engagées depuis 2006 et à profiter des retombées de
l'allègement de sa dette. Pour y parvenir, les autorités togolaises s'engagent à mettre en oeuvre le
programme présenté ci-dessus et détaillé dans la matrice ci-jointe en annexe. Le Gouvernement
sollicite donc l'assistance technique et financière de la Banque Mondiale dans la réalisation de
son ambitieux programme à travers le quatrième Don pour la Relance Economique et la
Gouvernance (DREG-4) et une possibilité d'emprunts au guichet IDA pour financer la
reconstruction des infrastructures routières dégradées après plus de 15 ans de troubles socio -
politiques.

Veuillez agréer, Monsieur le Président, l'assurance de ma considération distinguée.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under the Extended Credit Facility for Togo and
Approves US$22 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 10/485
December 10, 2010

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fif th review of
Togo's economic performance under a program supported by the three-year arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The Executive Board approved a request for a modification of a
performance criterion related to net domestic financing and an extension of the program to end-August
2011. Completion of the review enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR
14.3 million (about US$22 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 86.61
million (about US$133.24 million).
The Executive Board approved a three-year SDR ECF arrangement with an access amount equivalent to
SDR 66.06 million (about US$101.62 million) for Togo on April 21, 2008 to support the government's
economic program (see Press Release No. 08/90). The Board later approved two augmentations on
September 22, 2008 and June 25, 2010 totaling SDR 29.35 million (about US$45.15 million)
The Executive Board also agreed that Togo has taken the steps necessary to reach its completion point
under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This decision on the HIPC
completion point is contingent upon the Executive Board of the World Bank reaching a similar decis ion,
after which a joint press release will be issued.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Togo, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:
The Togolese authorities are to be commended for continued strong implementation of their economic
reform program under the ECF arrangement, which has contributed to strengthened public finances and
macroeconomic stability. Countercyclical fiscal policy in 2010 has helped support a modest economic
recovery.
The 2011 budget appropriately emphasizes increasing public investment to support medium-term
growth and poverty reduction, to be financed largely by raising domestic revenue. The authorities are
committed to limiting growth in current spending and to curtailing lower priority spending in case of
shortfalls in revenue or available concessional financing. Continued strong budget execution, including
in priority social spending, will be key.
Enhancing growth prospects will also depend on sustaining the momentum of reforms, particula rly in
public finance, debt management, and the investment climate. The clearance of domestic arrears is
expected to be completed. Implementation of the recently adopted automatic pricing mechanism for
petroleum products will minimize distortions, cushion the social impact of price shocks, and safeguard
public finances. It will be important to proceed with the privatization process for state-owned banks.
Togo has taken the steps necessary to reach completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. To
reap lasting benefits from the considerable debt relief, judicious use of opportunities is important. The
authorities will need to increase investment in physical and human capital and pursue growth-enhancing
structural reforms while maintaining prudent fiscal and debt policies. Continued support from donors will
be crucial, Mr. Portugal added.
