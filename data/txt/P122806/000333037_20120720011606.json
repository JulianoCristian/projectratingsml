          development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            one lesson is that ensuring progress in a stand-alone\n            Development Policy Operation (DPO), in an environment with\n            low capacity by the recipient, requires the ability to\n            supervise closely. A second lesson is that, in the face of\n            low recipient capacity, the Bank's team needs to remind\n            the authorities about the importance of the results\n            framework and the implications of not meeting indicators. A\n            third lesson regards the care that needs to be extended at\n            the definition of prior actions and results indicators. A\n            final lesson is that meaningful reforms (such as in cotton)\n            may take years to complete and are hard to support by annual\n            stand-alone DPOs."}, "docdt": "2012-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
