The main lessons learned from the project are:\n            1) Designing a project that fits government implementation\n            capacity will help ensure its effectiveness and timely\n            implementation. 2) Intensively supervising projects with\n            innovative designs and a dynamic context is critical to\n            address issues that are not foreseen at the time of\n            preparation. 3) Setting procurement thresholds too low can\n            delay implementation of infrastructure projects. 4)\n            Intensive supervision of the design and implementation of\n            urban government\u0092s infrastructure projects is essential in\n            the early years to ensure that works are of adequate quality\n            and that funds are used effectively. 5) Conducting periodic\n            client satisfaction surveys at facilities can both focus\n            staff on enhancing quality of service delivery and help them\n            to understand and overcome obstacles in doing so. 6)\n            Thoroughly preparing a project monitoring and evaluation\n            system prior to the start of a project will ensure that\n            stakeholders can track progress towards the project\n            objectives as soon as implementation starts."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
