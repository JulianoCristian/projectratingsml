1.     Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance)

Country and sector background. At the time when the project was being prepared in the early-
2000s, Ethiopia was in the process of a major political transformation. The Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in 1991 had defeated the previous government after a
protracted civil war and formed a transitional government. The country adopted a new
constitution in 1994 that established Ethiopia as federal republic and granted considerable
powers to nine semi-autonomous ethnically-based regional authorities. Ethiopia held its first
multi-party elections the following year, leading to large victories for the EPRDF. The EPRDF
in 2000 again achieved a broad electoral victory. This gave it the mandate to move forward with
comprehensive reforms aimed at rapidly improving the delivery of public services, enhancing
capacity of regional and local authorities to execute their new responsibilities, and unleashing the
potential of the private sector to drive economic growth essential to reduce poverty.
Recognizing that such a radical departure from the central planning model of the previous regime
would require considerable institutional change and capacity building, the authorities in 2001
launched a comprehensive National Capacity Building Program--a wide-ranging and ambitious
program backed by the highest levels of government--and established the Ministry of Capacity
Building in 2003 to lead implementation of the program. They also sought advice and financial
assistance from development partners, including the World Bank, to design and support
implementation of the program.

The government originally envisaged the Bank-financed Capacity Building for Decentralized
Service Delivery (CBDSD) project as laying the foundation for the much larger Public Sector
Capacity Building Program (PSCAP), which would rapidly follow. Specifically, the CBDSD
project would develop prototypes for policies and institutions (which regional administrations
and urban local governments could adapt for their own circumstances) and pilot various
approaches to building capacity of local administrations for delivering services. The lessons
learned from the CBDSD project would then inform the design of the PSCAP, which would
follow within a few years.

Rationale for World Bank involvement. The World Bank's involvement in the project was valuable
for several reasons. First, the Bank's global experience with public sector capacity building and
decentralized service delivery helped to inform the overall design of the project. Second, the
Bank's knowledge of country-specific issues gained through the preparation of several important
pieces of analytical work--the 1999 regionalization study, the 2000 review of the Civil Service
Reform Program, the 2000 public expenditure review, the 2001 rapid assessment of municipal
decentralization, and the 2001 woreda study--assisted in ensuring that the project suited
Ethiopian circumstances. Third, the Bank's experience in Ethiopia with demand-driven models
for providing assistance, particularly at the local level (for example, through the Ethiopia Social
Rehabilitation and Development Fund and the Emergency Recovery Program), helped in
persuading the authorities to include funds to be made available to municipalities upon
presentation of an acceptable proposal. Fourth, the Bank's involvement helped to leverage
assistance for government's program from other development partners, including the U.K.
Department for International Development (DFID), the European Commission, United Nations
Development Program, United States Agency for International Development, Canadian
International Development Agency, German Technical Cooperation, the Government of Italy,
and Swedish International Development Agency. Indeed, DFID contributed to the preparation of
the CBDSD project.

Contribution to higher-level objectives. The project was a key element of the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the World Bank's Board of Directors on April 17,
2003, which was built around four pillars: pro-poor growth, human development, governance,
and vulnerability. In particular, it supported the CAS pillar to improve governance, which was to
be achieved by, among other things, supporting the reform of the public sector systems
(including financial management and justice system reforms) and capacity building, and
deepening and strengthening decentralization to shift decision making closer to the citizens. The
Bank's CAS was itself aligned with the government's development program, known as the
Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program. This was built around four pillars:
(a) agricultural development-led industrialization and food security; (b) governance,
decentralization, and empowerment; (c) reform of the justice system and the civil service; and
(d) capacity building.

The project was again a major element of the Interim Strategy Note, discussed by the Bank's
Board of Directors on May 25, 2006. This specified deepening of Ethiopia's core governance
program as a major objective of the Bank's engagement in the country.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The development objective of the project was to enhance decentralized service delivery
performance by initiating long-term public sector capacity building at the federal, regional, and
local levels. The project was envisaged as a first phase of long-term support from the
International Development Association to enhance service delivery performance through a
coordinated program of: (a) implementing civil service reforms, (b) restructuring and
empowering local governments, and (c) strengthening of the Ministry of Capacity Building.

The Project Appraisal Document and the Development Credit Agreement specified four key
performance indicators. These were:

       Improved prioritization of public expenditures at the federal level and in participating
       local governments.

       Increased cost-efficiency and financial sustainability in participating federal and regional
       ministries, agencies and bureaus, and local governments.

       Improved client satisfaction with services delivered by participating federal and regional
       ministries, agencies and bureaus, and local governments.

       Fifty percent of the subprograms in the National Capacity Building Program are fully
       financed and under implementation.

                                                 2
A table in annex 1 further elaborates the project's logical framework. The table however does
not contain quantitative baseline or target values for the first three of the key indicators. This
was not unusual for projects prepared before 2004, when the detailed results framework replaced
the logframe in Project Appraisal Documents.

1.3    Revised Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

Neither the project's development objectives nor key performance indicators were formally
revised during implementation. However, the intermediate outcome/output indicators were
revised following the QAG quality of supervision review in September 2004 to include more
detailed and measurable indicators. The revised intermediate outcome indicators are presented
in annex 1, table b.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised; briefly describe the "the primary target group" identified in the PAD and
as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit
from the project)

The primary target beneficiaries were the civil servants and their respective agencies at the
federal, regional, and local levels; civil society groups interested in enhancing good governance;
public and private training institutions; and providers of local public services. Over the longer
term, the people receiving services from the entities participating in the project were expected to
benefit from more efficient and effective service delivery.

1.5    Original Components (as approved)

The project comprised three components: (a) implementing civil service reforms, (b)
restructuring and empowering local governments, and (c) strengthening the Ministry of Capacity
Building.

Component 1: Implementing civil service reforms (US$13.1 million). This component was to
finance the implementation of the government's Civil Service Reform Program at the federal,
regional, and local levels. Subcomponents included:

Civil Service Reform Program coordination and change management. This subcomponent was
to provide technical assistance and capacity building support for the newly-established
coordinating office in the Ministry of Capacity Building. It also supported local and
international training events and study tours for key civil servants on issues related to public
sector reform and decentralization, and dissemination of information related to the Civil Service
Reform Program.

Resource management and control. This subcomponent was to finance the roll-out of the budget
information system and the interim budget, disbursement, and accounts system in federal
institutions and regional finance bureaus to serve as a transitional step in the development of an
integrated financial management information system. It also was to finance procurement
training at the regional and federal levels, strengthening of existing treasury operations, advisory
                                                 3
support to strengthen management of human resources, and the development of a federal-level
human resource information management system.

Performance and service delivery improvement. This subcomponent was to finance the
development of a basic framework for a performance and service delivery improvement
program. In addition, it was intended to support the implementation of the program in ten pilot
government entities (five federal and five regional entities) and the preparation of an operational
manual for scale-up that was based on the experiences of the entities participating in the pilot
program.

Accountability and transparency. This subcomponent was to finance the development and
testing of models for accountability and transparency (such as parliamentary oversight, and the
development of the accounting and auditing profession). Eligible activities included training in
techniques of monitoring and evaluation, such as expenditure tracking surveys, cost efficiency
studies, service delivery report cards, and governance surveys. This subcomponent also was to
support the development of an operational manual to assist in the running of a performance
tracking facility. Finally, the subcomponent was to finance piloting of innovative mechanisms of
community and civil society participation in public sector performance.

Component 2: Restructuring and empowering local government (US$14.9 million). This
component was to finance activities to build the capacity of local governments to improve
delivery of services. Assistance was targeted to local governments that were already financially
sound and that had some capacity to deliver services. Strengthened municipalities could then
serve as models for others. Subcomponents included:

Federal and regional policy and analysis. This subcomponent was to support technical
assistance for formulation of policies and strategies to strengthen local governments. It also was
to provide financial support and technical assistance for implementation of the policies and
strategies.

Regional technical assistance for deepening decentralization. This subcomponent was to
finance activities to enable two to four regions to fulfill their responsibilities in a decentralized
system. Specifically, it was to cover the design and establishment of regional-level legislative,
administrative, fiscal, and institutional frameworks, with an emphasis on clarifying
intergovernmental fiscal relations. This subcomponent also was to finance training in basic skills
for staff of regional and local government entities.

Local government restructuring and capacity building. This subcomponent financed activities
aimed at building capacity of pilot local governments (municipalities and woredas) in the target
regions to deliver services in an efficient, accountable, and financially sustainable manner.

Pilot investments for infrastructure rehabilitation. This subcomponent was to finance
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure at the local level to facilitate capacity building through
learning-by-doing. Lessons learned from the experiences would also inform the design of a
follow-on operation.



                                                   4
Component 3. Strengthening the Ministry of Capacity Building (US$1.2 million). This
component was to finance technical assistance to help the Ministry of Capacity Building--a
ministry created in 2001 to coordinate the development and implementation of the government's
National Capacity Building Program--fulfill its responsibilities. Aspects included expertise to
help design capacity building programs and strategies; expertise to design and help implement
ministry human resource, financial management, and other systems; study tours and training for
ministry staff in all aspects of program management; and equipment to operate the ministry.

1.6    Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7     Other Significant Changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The project's design, implementation arrangements, schedule, and funding allocations were
adjusted during the course of implementation to reflect changing country priorities and lessons
learned from the early years of project execution. Of great importance was the government's
decision announced in May 2003 to rapidly scale up the implementation of its core reform and
capacity building interventions under the PSCAP. This program was a much larger initiative
than the CBDSD intervention (US$400 million, of which the World Bank provided US$100
million) and absorbed many of the activities originally included in component 1 of the CBDSD
project. These included the rollout of budgetary and personnel management systems,
consultancies for job classification and grading and the development of a medium-term pay and
employment policy, the dissemination of materials on the civil service reform program, and
others. New activities were added for financing under the CBDSD project, including the
preparation of a government property asset management manual and related training, production
of satellite images and base maps for 15 towns, training of front-line providers of services to
micro and small enterprises, additional infrastructure, and others. All new activities were part of
the government's National Capacity Development Program and support for them was conceived
of as part of an overall sectorwide approach.

The project closing date was extended twice. The first extension of two years from December
31, 2005 to December 31, 2007 was granted to allow completion of major technical assistance
contracts (specifically, deepening decentralization), for infrastructure rehabilitation activities to
be designed and constructed, and for performance and service delivery improvement program
(PSIP) proposals to be implemented. The second extension to December 31, 2008 was given to
enable towns to complete civil works and benefit from the experience of participating in all
phases of infrastructure project implementation (execution of civil works was delayed due to a
limited number of interested bidders, the lack of competitive bids, and the need to renegotiate the
scope of works with the cities, given rising costs of fuel, cement, and other critical inputs).

The Development Credit Agreement was amended twice. The first amendment of April 2006
reallocated credit proceeds from component 1 (implementing civil service reforms) and
component 3 (strengthening the ministry of capacity building) to component 2 (restructuring and

                                                 5
empowering local governments), in recognition that many of the activities under component 1
and 3 were being financed under PSCAP and related projects, while activities for urban
development could effectively absorb additional resources for municipal infrastructure to
enhance opportunities for learning by doing.1 Reflecting the increasing share of funding being
managed by the Urban Development Capacity Building Office (UDCBO) (US$24 million of
some US$30 million by May 2006), the 2006 amendments gave full responsibility to this office
for execution of component 2 activities and established a second special account to allow it to
manage component 2 funds. The second amendment of December 2007 reallocated more funds
to component 2 (by this time, most component 1 and 3 activities had been completed and any
funds not already committed were made available to component 2). This amendment also
granted responsibility to the UDCBO for overall coordination of project activities, including
submission of consolidated audit reports and financial monitoring reports. The Ministry of
Capacity Building retained responsibility for components 1 and 3, which by the end of 2007
were largely complete. The changes were widely discussed with the stakeholders and were
approved by Bank management, because they strengthened the ability of the project to meet its
objectives.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigation identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

QAG­No QAG at entry.

Several factors of the preparation and design positively affected implementation. The
background analysis was sound. The project was based on several pieces of analytical work
focusing on Ethiopia (such as the rapid assessment of municipal decentralization and the woreda
decentralization study) in addition to studies by global experts in decentralization and public
sector capacity building. These studies led to the decision to concentrate support on a relatively
few well-performing local governments, which could then receive the critical support they
needed to rapidly improve services and serve as models for others. They also supported an
approach of strengthening local governments in relation to regional and federal government
entities to bring service delivery closer to the citizens. The design recognized that empowering
local governments to effectively deliver services would require a sequenced set of reforms: first
policy reform, second institutional strengthening, and third training, capacity support, and
opportunities for learning by doing.

The Project Appraisal Document noted alternative approaches, the trade-offs between them, and
the rationale for the final decisions. The document generally foresaw the risks the project would
face and identified adequate mitigation measures, although it underestimated the risks associated
with the project's complex design and its short implementation period. A thorough appraisal of
procurement and financial management arrangements helped to ensure that resources were used

1
         The amendment also explicitly named infrastructure rehabilitation works as eligible subprojects (in
addition to training and capacity building activities), since the development credit agreement had inadvertently
omitted them as eligible subprojects, although it explicitly included them in the project description.

                                                          6
as intended. The project was classified appropriately as environmental category Financial
Intermediary (FI), because of the potential environment risks associated with the as-yet to be
identified municipal infrastructure. Procedures were put into place to ensure that such risks were
properly identified and that measures to mitigate them were put into place. By the time of Board
presentation the project implementation plan had been appraised and found to be realistic and of
satisfactory quality. Conditions of effectiveness were appropriate.2 The Development Credit
Agreement included only the standard financial covenants, which was suitable.

In summary, the design was generally appropriate to address the profound changes in
government structure brought about with the adoption of the 1995 Ethiopian constitution. The
urban policies developed and implemented under this project--the national urban development
policy, the new urban planning law, and the preparation and issuance of city proclamations
establishing 120 municipal governments--are seminal reforms that have laid the foundation for
restructured and empowered local governments to respond effectively to the challenges and
opportunities of urbanization.

However, the project design suffered from several weaknesses at entry. The first was the
project's unrealistically short implementation period, which was just three years. Although the
project was originally designed with a five-year implementation period, the government
proposed keeping the implementation period extremely short in recognition that PSCAP, once
approved, would be the government's primary vehicle for building public sector capacity.
However, implementing such a complex project as the CBDSD project in just three years proved
optimistic, leading to two extensions of the closing date and a total implementation period of six
years.

A second major weakness was a design that was too complex given the implementation capacity
in Ethiopia. The project included two implementing agencies (the Ministry of Capacity Building
and the UDCBO of the Ministry of Federal Affairs) and hundreds of relatively small
consultancies and activities, which overwhelmed capacity of the implementing agencies to
procure goods and services, to manage contracts, to disseminate and make use of the findings of
studies and technical assistance, to coordinate activities across ministries, and to monitor and
evaluate implementation and results.

A third weakness was the lack of specificity of a large proportion of project activities. Over 75
percent of project funds were targeted for subprojects that would be implemented by government
entities on a demand-driven basis. Yet, three years is much too short a time to develop and
disseminate information about eligibility criteria, invite and evaluate proposals, and ensure that
projects are implemented in compliance with World Bank safeguard policies and Ethiopian rules

     Conditions of effectiveness were: (a) the Borrower has established an accounting and financial management
system for the project opened the Project Account and has deposited the required initial amount; (c) the Borrower
has adopted the project implementation plan in form and substance satisfactory to the Association; (d) the Borrower
has prepared the procurement plan for the first year of Project implementation, satisfactory in form and substance to
the Association; (e) the Borrower has appointed to the staff of Ministry of Capacity Building at least one
procurement specialist and one financial management officer with experience and qualifications satisfactory to the
Association; and (f) the letter of undertaking for the implementation of component 2 of the Project has been entered
into between Ministry of Capacity Building and the Ministry Federal Affairs in the form and substance satisfactory
to the Association.

                                                          7
and procedures. Other activities were not well defined. For example, the options for training of
regional and local government staff were still being appraised at the time of Board presentation.

A fourth deficiency relates to weaknesses in the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework.
Although the project incorporated an M&E framework to track project implementation progress
and outcomes, the project logframe contained poorly-specified indicators and lacked baseline
and target values. The 2004 QAG assessment of quality of supervision noted the weaknesses in
the project's M&E framework, and proposed that the Bank team identify more specific and
practical indicators that would provide a more robust basis for discussions about improvements
in implementation progress.

2.2     Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, midterm review, project at risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

The Bank responded to start-up challenges with intensive supervision, and downgraded the
project's rating for implementation progress to unsatisfactory in October 2003. This led to the
government accepting the need for external assistance for project management and for help with
technical issues. Once the specialists had been hired, performance improved.

However, implementation arrangements, despite improvements following the midterm review,
were never optimal. The division of responsibilities between the Ministry of Capacity Building
and the UDCBO made coordination of overall project management cumbersome. Moreover, the
Ministry of Capacity Building did not prioritize the CBDSD project, focusing instead on the
preparation and implementation of PSCAP. During the first three and a half years of its life the
project was moved between three directorates at the ministry and had five coordinators. The
changeovers were not accompanied by proper briefings and new coordinators typically had to ask
the Bank team for the key project documents. The ministry also failed in the early years to fulfill
its agreements to hire financial management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and other
project specialists. Although these issues were discussed at length during the midterm review, and
the Bank advised the government to give full management and coordination responsibility to the
UDCBO (which by then was managing 80 percent of the project funds), the government instead
offered to (finally) fully staff the project implementation team at the Ministry of Capacity Building
and to give UDCBO control of all aspects of component 2. However, despite the personal
assurances of the minister, the Ministry of Capacity Building was never able to effectively carry
out its responsibilities as overall project coordinator and manager. The project's success is due to a
large extent to the consistently good performance of the UDCBO.

The midterm review provided a comprehensive analysis of implementation challenges and
presented a detailed action plan to address them. It also appropriately recommended that overall
project management responsibility be shifted to the UDCBO, a recommendation that the Ministry
of Capacity Building rejected. However, it did not recommend a formal restructuring, although the
project may have benefited from dropping components 1 and 3, whose activities could be funded
by PSCAP, and shifting resources to component 2. The team decided to continue with all three
components because several activities were underway at the time of the midterm review
(particularly the performance and service delivery improvement program) that would have been

                                                  8
disrupted if components 1 and 3 were cut. Revisions to project design following the midterm
review were made through amendments to the Development Credit Agreement, because the
project's development objectives and components did not change.

Several positive aspects of implementation are worth noting. The government and Bank teams
proactively tackled issues as they emerged. For example, once PSCAP became effective and
absorbed many of the activities identified for funding under component 1 of the CBDSD project,
the teams identified new activities for funding consistent with a sectorwide approach. In
addition, the Bank appropriately responded to the government's request to reallocate credit
proceeds to measures to strengthen local government and to give full responsibility for
implementation of component 2 to the UDCBO. Supervision from the Bank's country office in
Addis Ababa was critical in providing the government with timely advice on procurement,
financial management, monitoring and evaluation, and other project management issues. The
procurement, financial management, and reporting performance of the UDCBO was consistently
highly satisfactory. The Bank's collaborative relationship with GTZ's urban specialists ensured
that the resources of both organizations were directed at achieving common objectives. Thus,
GTZ advisors based in the four regional capitals helped to provide day-to-day support for
development of cities' capacity to deliver services. This close partnership is continuing under
the new Urban Local Government Development Project.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Design. The Project Appraisal Document included a logframe in annex 1 with both outcome and
intermediate output indicators. However, the logframe reflects several weaknesses. For
example, it does not contain baseline or target values for three of four outcome indicators. Nor
does it adequately specify the sources of information for tracking the indicators, instead offering
the types of documents that might contain useful information (such as public expenditure
tracking reviews, client and household surveys, and cost-efficiency surveys). Moreover, the
logframe does not indicate the agencies that would be responsible for collecting and analyzing
data. The Project Appraisal Document does not discuss monitoring and evaluation
arrangements, nor does it include the administration of surveys or other data collection
instruments as activities to be covered under project finance. It does however include funding
for the preparation of an operations manual for a performance tracking facility and the hiring of a
performance tracking specialist as part of the project team in the Ministry of Capacity Building.
Outputs were not initially well-specified, because so many of the activities were not known prior
to Board approval.

Implementation. Recognizing the lack of specificity in the outcome indicators and sources of
information, and based on the recommendations of the QAG review of the quality of supervision,
the project team identified and reported on reasonable proxies during the course of
implementation. Although not financed under the CBDSD project, the teams were able to draw
on information from client satisfaction surveys conducted under PSCAP and other initiatives to
assess improvements in delivery of services by entities benefiting from the project. The team
also tracked a set of output indicators that is more comprehensive than that presented in the
logframe of the Project Appraisal Document, presenting the values in quarterly and annual



                                                9
progress reports. The Bank team reported the findings in the aide memoires and implementation
supervision reports.

Utilization. The government and Bank teams used the monitoring information to identify areas
of particular challenge and to develop measures to address them. Specifically, the teams noted
the challenges in implementing many of the activities under components 1 and 3. As a result,
they intensified their dialogue with the Minister of Capacity Building and, ultimately, reallocated
project funds away from the management of the ministry. They also improved their coordination
with the PSCAP team to ensure that activities complemented each other. In addition, they
observed the lags in initiating and completing many of the small infrastructure projects, and
stepped up supervision in this area. The government agencies that carried out client satisfaction
surveys or other methods to assess performance consistently used the information to enhance
service delivery. For example, St. Stephen's Tuberculosis Hospital used the results to improve
its procedures for registering patients upon arrival and directing them to appropriate offices.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project complied with all safeguard and fiduciary policies. Project accounting and auditing
have consistently been conducted in accordance with the Development Credit Agreement,
although with some delays. The most recent audit report was submitted on time and was
unqualified. The team satisfactorily managed the environmental and social aspects of the
project. The local governments included in their project application forms an assessment of the
potential adverse environmental and social impacts of the proposed interventions and measures
to be taken to mitigate the impacts. The regional governments and the UDCBO reviewed this
information before approving the projects, seeking more information and stronger mitigation
measures where necessary. Contracts included mitigation measures. The local governments
monitored their implementation, reporting on compliance in their periodic progress reports. The
project complied with all social safeguards. One challenging issue arose as a result of a project-
financed survey of settlements in Makelle that revealed the presence of about 13,600 families
living informally on public land. In response to the information, the municipal government
initially agreed to formally recognize the right to occupy the plots of only those households that
could prove they had been living there prior to 2004. This left the status of 600 in doubt.
Following extensive discussions with the Bank team regarding their status, the government
decided to formally grant all the families the right to occupy the plots.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, operation & maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

As intended, the CBDSD project has served as the basis for two Bank-financed follow-on
projects: the PSCAP approved in fiscal 2004 (US$400 million) and the Urban Local Government
Development Project (US$150 million) approved in fiscal 2008. The PSCAP, which is being
managed by the Ministry of Capacity Building, is a nationwide program that supports civil
service reform, decentralization, urban management and development, tax system reform, justice
sector reform, and information and communications technology. It is leveraging significant

                                                10
development partner assistance, which is being harmonized under a sectorwide approach. The
Urban Local Government Development Project, managed by the UDCBO, is further
strengthening the 18 urban local governments that were the focus of the CBDSD project through
the provision of grants based on achieving specific performance criteria. Both projects are aimed
at ensuring the gains achieved so far in public sector capacity building are sustained and scaled
up.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Objectives. The project's overall objectives were, and remain, relevant. They reflect the
importance of strong public sector capacity at all levels of government to effectively deliver
services and to achieve development results. As mentioned in section 1.1, the project's
objectives are consistent with the objectives of Ethiopia's 2001 National Capacity Building
Program, itself a central element of Ethiopia's Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction
Program. They are also in conformity with the objectives of the Bank's 2003 CAS and its 2006
Interim Strategy Note, both of which explicitly identify capacity building as a critical goal.

Design. The design was and remains relevant. Despite the design weaknesses noted in section
2.1, the overall design was appropriate to support the substantial institutional reform and
capacity building required to enable local governments to successfully deliver the services for
which they were newly responsible and to support the initial phase of a long-term public sector
capacity building at the federal, regional, and local levels. The design was based on analytical
work carried out in Ethiopia (the 1999 regionalization study, the 2001 woreda decentralization
study, and others) and in other countries. These studies show that strengthening decentralized
service delivery requires civil service reforms at all levels of government (supported under
component 1), and strengthening of capacity at the municipal level through learning by doing
(supported under component 2). Thus, activities supported under component 1--the overarching
strategic plan for civil service reform, the development of the PSIP manual, the development of a
results oriented performance management system for the different tiers of government, and the
design and adoption of standard bidding documents to be used at all tiers of government as part
of the implementation of the new national procurement law--created the foundation for
decentralized service delivery. In addition, studies indicate that providing some resources on a
demand-driven basis is an effective approach to building capacity of local governments operating
in a decentralized system. Finally, analytical work demonstrates that focusing limited resources
on a few relatively strong municipalities is more likely to achieve results than spreading the
resources thinly over many cities and towns.

Implementation. Implementation arrangements were relevant at the time the project was
prepared and were appropriately adjusted during implementation in response to changing
circumstances. The new Ministry of Capacity Building established to lead the implementation of
the government's National Capacity Building Program was the obvious choice to manage the
CBDSD project in its early years. Including the UDCBO as the agency to implement activities
aimed at urban development also made sense, because this agency had considerable experience

                                               11
in working with local governments, even though UDCBO was housed in a different ministry (the
Ministry of Federal Affairs, and subsequently in late 2005, in the newly created Ministry of
Works and Urban Development). Implementation arrangements were changed several years
after the start of the project to give a greater role for the UDCBO in executing the project. This
reflected both the strong performance of the UDCBO and the project's increasing focus on
component 2 activities. Adapting the project's implementation arrangements, extending its
closing date, and shifting resources to component 2 ensured that the design remained relevant
throughout the project's implementation period in supporting decentralized service delivery.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in annex 4)

The project broadly achieved its development objectives of enhancing decentralized service
delivery performance by initiating long-term public sector capacity building at the federal,
regional, and local levels. Activities aimed at reforming institutions; developing operational,
financial management, and procurement systems; and building staff skills have been completed,
and most targets met. The national urban development policy and urban planning law are under
implementation nationwide. Some 120 urban local governments have been created in a context
where autonomous local urban authorities were virtually nonexistent. Through participation in all
aspects of the project cycle, the 17 participating cities have gained experience through learning-by
-doing in planning, prioritizing options with public participation, and appraisal of proposed
projects. They have also benefited from close collaboration with the UDCBO in all stages of
project implementation (issuing requests for proposals, selecting consultants, procuring
contractors, managing contracts, and the like). The outcome indicators have been substantially
achieved. Specifically:

       Prioritization of expenditures. Participating federal ministries and bureaus and local
       government entities are now prioritizing their expenditures, something they had not done
       prior to the project. For example, the Ministry of Capacity Building and all regional
       governments prioritized their public expenditures for capacity building activities through
       extensive consultations with local governments and with sectors. The 17 cities
       undertaking small infrastructure investments have prioritized their choices through a
       participatory process that included consultations with stakeholder groups (women, youth,
       elders, teachers' associations, and others) of each kebele in the cities. In addition, 18
       cities prepared prioritized 5-year and then 3-year capital investment plans, which they are
       implementing under the Urban Local Government Development Project.

       Financial sustainability and cost-efficiency. The federal government and all regional
       governments now use the standard bidding documents and procurement procedures for
       all public procurement. It is generally accepted that use of standard bidding documents
       results in greater transparency and value for money in procurement. Some 18 cities have
       prepared revenue enhancement plans, undertaken public asset inventories, developed
       property management manuals, and established a unified financial management system to
       increase revenues and ensure financial sustainability. In addition, the 18 cities have
       prepared municipal restructuring and performance improvement plans under the project,

                                                 12
        which are being implemented under the government-financed Urban Good Governance
        Program. Revenues in the participating cities have already risen substantially. For
        example, revenues mobilized by the city of Hawassa have risen from 12 million birr in
        2005 to 25 million birr in 2007. Revenues of Arba Minch have risen from 16.1 million
        birr in fiscal 2008 to 20.1 million birr in 2009. This picture is similar for each of the 18
        cities. Services are also being delivered more cost efficiently. For example, each staff
        member of the Addis Ababa Transport Authority is serving an average of 7 customers a
        day, compared with an average of 2.5 customers in 2005. Moreover, monthly revenue of
        the authority has increased from 14 million birr in 2005 to 16 million birr in 2008.

        Improved service delivery. Service delivery performance in all the agencies for which
        data are available has improved, in some cases dramatically so. For example the Federal
        Revenue and Customs Authority, which registers new businesses, reports that the average
        time taken to register a new business has fallen substantially. This improvement is
        corroborated by the World Bank/IFC Doing Business reports, which show that the time
        required to start a business dropped from 32 days in 2005 to 16 days in 2008.3 Doing
        Business also shows that the time taken to register a property has decreased from 56 days
        in 2005 to 43 days in 2008. In addition, the customs authority has reduced the time
        needed for customs clearance from eight hours to one hour by establishing satellite
        offices at key import points. Improvements in service delivery are equally impressive in
        the Addis Ababa Transport Authority. The time required to obtain a license has declined
        from four hours in 2005 to 20 minutes in 2008 and the time needed to register a new
        vehicle has fallen from one day to one hour over the same period. In addition, the
        number of customers that the authority serves has risen to 3,000 per day in 2008
        compared with 1,000 per day in 2005 (staff have risen from 400 to 440 over the same
        period). The National Archives and Library also demonstrates improved services,
        according to interviews of staff and clients carried out during the final supervision
        mission of the project. As one example, the time required to check out a book has
        declined over time. Although causality is not possible to prove, the improved services
        have likely contributed to an increase in users from 80,000 in 2006/07 to 120,000 users in
        2008.

        Client satisfaction surveys for agencies that have carried them out show rising customer
        contentment. For example, surveys of patients of St. Peter's tuberculosis hospital
        demonstrate that the average time required to see a medical professional has dropped and
        that patients are generally more satisfied with services than in the past. The Drug
        Administration and Control Authority has reduced the time required to issue and renew a
        license from eight days to one day by decentralizing its operations to five regional
        offices. Although not necessarily representative of all users, comments left in suggestion
        boxes of agencies that have received support under the project show a marked increase in
        satisfaction. For example, 90 percent of the comments provided to a one-stop-shop for
        micro small and medium size enterprises in Hawassa expressed great pleasure with the
        quality of services offered. The owner of a medical clinic came to the one-stop-shop to
        renew his license, and wrote that he had received "exceptional treatment;" another client

         Financing and implementation of subprograms of the National Capacity Building
         Program. This is an indicator intended to demonstrate that support to the Ministry of
         Capacity to enable it to coordinate the National Capacity Building Program has been
         effective. Capacity of the ministry has indeed been created, and by end of December 11
         of 14 subprograms in the Borrower's National Capacity Building Program are fully
         financed and under implementation--six under PSCAP, four under other the Bank-
         financed projects (Financial Sector Capacity Building, Rural Capacity Building, Private
         Sector Development Capacity Building, and Post Secondary Education). GTZ is
         supporting capacity building of the construction industry.

The project's substantial intermediate outcomes and outputs are described in detail in annex 3.

3.3    Efficiency
(Net present value/economic rate of return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and financial rate of return)

Not applicable. The Project Appraisal Document did not present economic or financial analyses
for the project. This is appropriate since the project focused on capacity building and technical
assistance.

3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating       S

Achievement of the objectives of the project is rated satisfactory. The project objectives, design,
and implementation arrangements were and remain relevant. This is demonstrated through the
scaling up of efforts to strengthen decentralized service delivery through two Bank-financed
follow-on projects, PSCAP and Urban Local Government Development. The project largely
achieved its development objective, although with delays. High relevance and satisfactory
achievement of objectives justifies an overall outcome rating of satisfactory for the project.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

In the process of planning and implementing small infrastructure projects, 17 urban local
governments have gained experience through learning-by-doing in investment planning, in
prioritizing of expenditures through public consultation, in procurement, and in contract
administration. This experience has enabled the cities to undertake larger infrastructure projects
using the funds under their responsibility (including contributions of the Urban Local
Government Development Project). For example, Wolayita Sodo and Dilla are currently
upgrading over ten kilometers of local roads each. Shire, Axum, Arba Minch, and Dessie are
constructing improved drainage systems. Arba Minch and Bishoftu are upgrading their markets.
                                                 14
Most cities are constructing cobblestone roads through labor-intensive techniques. The
managers of cities visited by the Bank team emphasized that the capacity built under the CBDSD
is the main reason why cities are now able to undertake these projects. They also noted that a
wide range of city staff--including the cities' managers, planners, engineers, economists,
procurement specialists, accountants, and auditors--developed new skills through their
participation in the various aspects of project management, which they are now using in the
service of their cities' development. Prior to undertaking these investments, none of the 17 cities
had had experience implementing large infrastructure projects.

(a)    Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

The Project Appraisal Document noted the importance of improving services for the poor and for
women, two disadvantaged groups in Ethiopia. However, the project did not target these groups
in selecting beneficiary entities or project activities. None-the-less, improved public services
will certainly benefit low-income people and women, as these groups are least able to afford
private substitutes. The project's measures to promote broad citizen participation in selecting
projects and in overseeing their implementation is likely increasing the transparency and
accountability of resource use, and social development more broadly.

(b)    Institutional change/strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development)

The project helped to bring about key policy and institutional reforms aimed at increasing the
effectiveness and efficiency of public sector service delivery. It supported the formulation and
adoption of several important laws and implementing regulations. These included the national
urban development policy approved by the Council of Ministers and now under implementation
in all nine regions and the two chartered cities. It also comprised the urban planning law, which
was gazetted in May 2008, and the federal framework for a land information system, which in
April 2009 was being reviewed by the Office of the Prime Minister. It is expected to be
submitted to parliament for approval in September 2009. The project supported the preparation
of the integrated infrastructure policy and the federal housing policy, which are in the final stages
of approval. In addition, it assisted the preparation and issuance of city proclamations that lay
out the roles and responsibilities of 120 municipal governments.

The project also brought about important institutional changes. It supported the restructuring of
the current Federal Urban Planning Coordination Bureau to clarify its responsibilities in relation
to those of the regional urban planning institutes and increase its effectiveness. It played a key
role in establishing the accredited master's program in urban management at the Ethiopian Civil
Service College, which by end 2008 had conferred graduate degrees to some 400 students, nearly
all of whom are serving as specialists in the city, regional, or federal government. Another 1,000
students are currently enrolled in the program. This is one of the project's notable achievements.
Students are required to serve in a local government's administration for five years following
successful completion of the program, and the vast majority of graduates are doing so. The State
Minister of Works and Urban Development in May 2009 stated that he would like to see further
expansion of the graduate program because of its clear effectiveness in developing skills
essential for management of decentralized local governments.

                                                 15
Other important institutional reforms prompted by the project include the development and
testing of the PSIP, which is now being implemented nationwide under PSCAP to improve
organization work flow and effectiveness. This initiative, known as business process
reengineering, has resulted in rapid improvements in service delivery in participating entities by
eliminating unnecessary procedures and introducing time-saving technology in offices serving
the public. Interestingly, more efficient delivery of services has not resulted in job redundancies
in the affected entities that generate revenues, because the unmet demand for services is so high
in Ethiopia. This has made resistance to the changes much lower than would otherwise have
been expected.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

The project financed a large technical assistance package, Deepening Decentralization (US$4.6
million) under component 2, which became the basis for the Urban Good Governance Program.
The government's establishment of the program to implement the recommendations of the
technical assistance package was not foreseen at the time the CBDSD project was prepared. The
Bank is now supporting the implementation of the government's Urban Good Governance
Program through the Urban Local Government Development Project.

(optional for core ICR, details in annexes)

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating     L

The risk to development outcomes is rated low.

The government has demonstrated its commitment to public sector capacity building and
decentralization for nearly 15 years, starting with the launch in 1996 of the Civil Service Reform
Program, followed in 2001 by the start of the National Capacity Building Program, continuing in
2004 with the initiation of PSCAP and in 2008 with the commencement of the Urban Local
Government Development Program. PSCAP, as a national program, has institutionalized a grant
transfer mechanism to support capacity building, in which the government has committed to put
US$137 million of treasury resources. The Urban Local Government Program is scaling up
demand-driven approaches by providing resources to municipalities to improve performance in
service delivery. Support for the capacity building agenda in Ethiopia is broad; the cabinet of
ministers and the parliament have played key roles in approving legislation designed to
strengthen public sector performance and decentralization. These include the urban planning law
and the federal framework for a land information system. Entities at all levels of government
and in all regions have embraced the reform agenda.

Sustainability of the infrastructure investments is assured. The 17 cities that benefited from the
infrastructure subprojects are contributing at least 10 percent (in practice, many are contributing
up to 40 percent) of the cost of their infrastructure projects, which strengthens ownership. All

                                                 16
cities benefiting from the project have prepared asset management plans, which lay out a
schedule for operations and maintenance and identify the sources of finance and institutional
arrangements for doing so (preparation of the plans is a performance criteria under the Urban
Local Government Development Project). All have also prepared and are implementing revenue
enhancement plans to ensure resources are available to operate and maintain their investments.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)

 Rating     MS

The Bank's overall performance in ensuring quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. The
Bank's performance in identification was satisfactory. Strengthening public sector capacity for
decentralized service delivery was a priority for the government and citizens of Ethiopia who
were striving to fundamentally transform the state from one of centralized control to one in
which power is much more broadly shared. The government prepared its civil service reform
and national capacity building programs and established in 2001 the Ministry of Capacity
Building to lead the effort. It requested the participation of the World Bank in financing a first
phase of the program that would prepare and test prototypes and approaches in preparation for
the nationwide roll-out of the program. The Bank responded appropriately, preparing a technical
assistance loan, and providing extensive advice with design and safeguard issues. The project's
design reflected lessons learned from experience in Ethiopia and in other countries undertaking
major institutional change, decentralization, and capacity building.

The Bank's performance in preparation and appraisal was satisfactory in most respects. The
project implementation plan had been appraised and found to be realistic and of satisfactory
quality. Procedures for environmental screening of small infrastructure projects had been
agreed. Processes for procurement and fiduciary management had been assessed and steps
agreed to ensure that funds were used as intended. Appraisal of implementation arrangements
was satisfactory and agreements reached on the division of responsibility between the overall
executing agency, the Ministry of Capacity Building, and the agency in charge of urban and local
government strengthening, the Ministry of Federal Affairs.

However, greater realism with respect to implementation capacity would have led the team to
design a smaller, less complex project with a smaller number of activities and fewer
implementers. Persuading the government to accept a longer implementation timeframe, for
example, by explaining that if the funds are exhausted early, the government can seek additional
financing, would have allowed the team to avoid extending the project closing date. More effort
should have been to identify the activities that would be financed under the project, and certainly
to specify eligibility criteria for municipal subprojects, rather than leaving this for
implementation. More care should also have been taken to specify key performance indicators



                                                17
and to name baseline and target values for them. These deficiencies result in a moderately
satisfactory rating for Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry.

The project did not benefit from a quality effective review prior to appraisal. Such a review may
have helped bring about a better match between the scope of activities and the time allowed for
implementation. It may also have helped in developing the project's logframe to ensure that it
served as a useful tool for monitoring implementation and results.

(b)    Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

 Rating     S

Bank performance in supervision was satisfactory. Supervision was intense throughout the project
implementation period, even though three Bank staff served in the role of task team leader. It
helped that the two most recent task team leaders managed the project from the Bank's Addis
office, and could address issues as soon as they arose. The two country directors, the sector
manager, and the sector leader have actively overseen project implementation to help ensure that
the project remained on track to meet its objectives.

The Bank fielded 15 supervision missions during the project's six years of implementation.
Missions generally took place two times a year. Missions lasted about two weeks each and
typically comprised nine or more members, including foreign and local consultants investigating a
wide range of technical and operational issues. Aide memoires consistently highlighted key issues
and presented detailed action plans to help the implementing agencies address obstacles.

During the early years, supervision missions focused primarily on progress with implementation of
the civil service reform program, performance of the Ministry of Capacity Building to manage the
project and measures to enhance capacity, and elaboration of eligibility criteria for the funds being
provided on a demand-driven basis. In the later years, supervision focused increasingly on outputs
and progress towards outcomes rather than processes. Supervision also concentrated on
coordinating with the PSCAP team to ensure that the two projects worked collaboratively to
achieve shared goals. Members of the CBDSD and PSCAP project teams consistently participated
in each other's missions. Supervision also involved consulting with development partners
involved in supporting enhancing decentralized service delivery, especially GTZ. This helped
ensure a harmonized approach of development partners. In addition, supervision involved
consideration of proposals of activities for funding in lieu of those absorbed by PSCAP.
Supervision consistently paid attention to fiduciary and safeguard aspects of the project. A
comprehensive and detailed midterm review highlighted the poor performance of the Ministry of
Capacity Building in managing the activities under its responsibility and proposed measures to
overcome them. This led to an increase in staffing at the Ministry of Capacity Building to manage
the project. However, the Bank team missed an opportunity to restructure the project following the
midterm review, which may have resulted in a narrower project focus and more effective
implementation arrangements. Restructuring of the project, however, would not likely have
resulted in speedier implementation. Despite the good performance of the UDCBO, many of the
physical works added to the urban component to utilize funds freed from the other two components
had not been completed by the close of the project.


                                                 18
The project performance indicators were consistently rated realistically. Implementation
performance was rated unsatisfactory six months after effectiveness. The rating was upgraded to
satisfactory only in April 2005 when the project demonstrated clear improvement in performance.
Implementation performance was downgraded to moderately satisfactory in July 2008, due to
some of the infrastructure contracts still not having been awarded six months prior to the project's
closing date. The rating was raised in December 2008 because adequate progress had been made
in executing the projects and because ratings for financial management and in project management
had been upgraded (from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory).

QAG in September 2004 assessed the quality of supervision to be satisfactory, giving a rating of
2 on a 6-point scale.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

 Rating     MS

The Bank's overall performance was moderately satisfactory. In lending, the Bank responded to
the government's request to support its national program to build public sector capacity at all
levels of government. Drawing on lessons learned from Ethiopian and global experience, it
assisted in designing a project that would serve as the foundation for a future nationwide
program. However, quality at entry suffered from a project design to did not fit government
implementation capacity, which resulted in a doubling of the implementation period, significant
reallocation of resources, and changes in implementation arrangements, and ultimately the
cancellation of 6.1 percent of credit proceeds. (Another US$2 million of the credit proceeds
were redeployed in late 2008 to finance the food crisis response program, which was the case for
most projects in the portfolio with surplus funds.) The project also suffered from weaknesses in
the design of the monitoring and evaluation framework. Supervision was thorough. In
supervision, the Bank played an important role in keeping the project on track. Bank supervision
missions also regularly reviewed compliance with fiduciary, environmental, and other
safeguards. The Bank maintained a close dialogue with policy makers, technical staff, and
development partners throughout implementation. The Bank responded flexibly and effectively
to requests to fund important areas of capacity building that were not envisioned at the time the
project was prepared, such as training of front-line providers of services to micro and small
enterprises.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

 Rating     MS

The government's performance in implementation was moderately satisfactory. Government
ownership and commitment to the National Capacity Building Program was high. In a clear sign
of commitment, it established a the Ministry of Capacity Building with the mandate to
coordinate the initiative. It also prepared the follow-on projects, PSCAP and the Urban Local
Government Project, to scale-up the work started under the CBDSD project. The government

                                                 19
provided its agreed counterpart funds, but with occasional delays. However, it appeared to be
more committed to the overall goals of the capacity building program than to addressing the
daily implementation challenges of procurement, contract management, financial management,
and monitoring and evaluation. Thus, it did not provide the newly created Ministry of Capacity
Building with the resources or authority it needed to operate effectively. It also chose to retain
this ministry as the overall project manager, despite the Bank's advice following the midterm
review to put the well-performing UDCBO in charge. The government also appeared to lack
commitment to a specific approach to capacity building, introducing major new initiatives (such
as business process reengineering) every few years. Staff of the entities expected to implement
the new initiatives expressed frustration and weariness with the rapid shifts in direction. All
these factors contributed to implementation delays. As the entity responsible for the policy,
planning, programming, and funding of services, the government is ultimately accountable for
performance.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

 Rating     MS

The performance of the Ministry of Capacity Building was moderately unsatisfactory. The
commitment of the ministry to the objectives of the National Capacity Building Program was
never in doubt. However, it lacked experience with project implementation, and was not able to
adhere to schedules for procurement, financial reporting, auditing, or preparation of quarterly
progress reports. In addition, the ministry's limited resources proved insufficient for it to
manage both the CBDSD and PSCAP projects, and it gave priority to the much-larger PSCAP.

The ministry did not maintain adequate channels of communication with the CBDSD project's
other implementing agency, the UDCBO, which led to delays in implementation of component 2.
To address this obstacle, the government and the Bank agreed to open a special account under
the management of the UDCBO to allow it to take full responsibility for implementation of the
urban component. The performance of the Ministry of Capacity Building improved marginally
following the midterm review, when it accepted the need for externally-contracted specialist staff
to handle procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation. However, it
never effectively fulfilled its role as overall project coordinator. The UDCBO took over the role
of overall project coordinator in November 2007, as specified in an amendment to the credit
agreement extending the project closing date to December 2008.

The performance of the UDCBO (under the Ministry of Federal Affairs) was satisfactory. The
UDCBO performed capably throughout the period of implementation. It complied with all
environmental, social, and fiduciary safeguards. It prepared quarterly project progress reports on
time, and used the monitoring information to tackle implementation challenges. It also complied
with the Bank's procurement, financial management, and reporting requirements. Although five
of 15 the urban infrastructure projects were still not complete when the project closed, due to
factors largely outside its control, the UDCBO is continuing to supervise their implementation to
ensure that they are executed and operated as expected. The good performance of the UDCBO
justifies the moderately satisfactory rating for implementing agency performance.



                                                20
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

 Rating     MS

The overall performance of the borrower was moderately satisfactory. The government
demonstrated its commitment to the project, from identification to completion, and met its
counterpart funding obligations. However, the Ministry of Capacity Building did not perform
adequately even after the midterm review, despite the assurances of the minister that he would
take personal responsibility to improve its performance. In the final three years of the project,
most of the funds and responsibilities had been transferred to the UDCBO, so the inadequate
performance of the Ministry of Capacity Building did not have significant impact on its overall
execution. The UDCBO performed capably throughout implementation. It handled procurement
and financial management in accordance with Bank guidelines, and ensured compliance with the
Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies. However, overall Borrower performance
was marred by the long delays in implementation and a lack of coordination between
implementing agencies.
6.     Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Designing a project that fits government implementation capacity will help ensure its
effectiveness and timely implementation. In its drive for state transformation, the government
of Ethiopia overestimated its capability to implement a complex project aimed at rapidly creating
public sector capacity at all levels of government. It also underestimated the time that would be
required to implement the project. The Bank with its global experience of institutional could
have suggested a more focused approach and a longer implementation period. Drawing on this
lesson, the Bank team was able to convince the government to accept a six-year timeframe for
the follow-on Urban Local Government Development Project by offering an understanding that
if the funds are exhausted early, the government can seek additional financing.

Intensively supervising projects with innovative designs and a dynamic context (in this case
the whole decentralization process being new and an evolving situation) is critical to
address issues that are not foreseen at the time of preparation. Intensive supervision by the
Bank, drawing on field-based staff to the extent possible, helped to address weaknesses in project
design and changes in the country context. Thus, when PSCAP became effective and took over
many of the project's component 1 activities, frequent interaction with the client helped in
identifying new activities to enhance decentralized service delivery.

Setting procurement thresholds too low can delay implementation of infrastructure
projects. Procurement thresholds for international competitive bidding were set at just
US$500,000. Yet, very few international firms are interested in bidding on projects below US$1
million. While the original project design envisaged that cities' infrastructure projects would be
below US$500,000, and therefore be executed by local contractors chosen under national
competitive bidding, the reallocation of funds made it possible for cities to undertake larger
projects. However, cities received few or no responses to their requests for proposals.
Moreover, the project's credit agreement did not allow project funds to be used for work done
under force account. Some cities had to advertise several times or divide the work into smaller

                                                21
contracts before finding contractors willing to do the work. The lack of ability to find qualified
contractors is a major reason for delayed implementation of cities' infrastructure projects. This
lesson has been reflected in the design of the Urban Local Governments Development Project,
which has a procurement threshold for international competitive bidding of US$1 million. Credit
proceeds of the new urban project may also be used for work done under force account.

Intensive supervision of the design and implementation of urban government's
infrastructure projects is essential in the early years to ensure that works are of adequate
quality and that funds are used effectively. Experience under the CBDSD project indicates
that urban administrations do not always have the expertise they need to ensure that design and
implementation of infrastructure projects at a minimum meets national standards. The federal
and regional agencies will have to supervise the projects carefully, and either contract themselves
or advise cities to contract expertise when necessary.

Conducting periodic client satisfaction surveys at facilities can both focus staff on
enhancing quality of service delivery and help them to understand and overcome obstacles
in doing so. Nearly all of the entities benefiting from capacity development interventions in
Ethiopia are requested to conduct periodic surveys on client satisfaction. These have proven
useful in orienting staff to deliver high quality services and in identifying areas that require
improvement.

Thoroughly preparing a project monitoring and evaluation system prior to the start of a
project will ensure that stakeholders can track progress towards the project objectives as
soon as implementation starts. Ensuring that baseline and target values and sources of

performance through a coordinated program of: (a) implementing civil service reforms, (b)
restructuring and empowering local governments, and (c) strengthening of the Ministry of
Capacity Building. Table (a) presents the project's key performance indicators and outcomes.

Component 1: Implementing civil service reforms. The outputs of this component are
satisfactory. Specific outputs include:

       Civil Service Reform Program coordination and change management. The Ministry of
       Capacity Building developed a strategic plan that clarified its mandate and specific
       responsibilities and that provided a blueprint of how to fulfill them. The Civil Service
       Reform Program coordinating office was restructured and is now staffed with 11
       permanent staff. In addition, 20 quality assurance team and 42 outreach support team
       members are seconded from the Ethiopian Management Institute and Ethiopian Civil
       Service College to support the full implementation of the civil service reform activities.
       Over 2,000 staff from federal and regional institutions participated in training on project
       management and monitoring and evaluation, human resources management, public
       service reform, accounting and auditing, procurement, information technology, records
       and warehouse management, and issues related to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. The
       ministry in collaboration with Radio Fana hosts live radio broadcasts to discuss issues
       related to public sector reform and delivery of public services to raise public awareness of
       the goals and achievements of the PSIP. These include news from the Ministry of
       Revenue and the Federal Inland Revenue Authority about the newly developed tax
       system and from the National Archives and Library Ethiopia about its improved services,
       broadcast on radio and television and disseminated through brochures and newspapers.
       Additional programs on business process reengineering have also been broadcast on
       Ethiopian radio and television.

       Resource management and control. All regions, except Somali, have rolled budget
       information systems and budget disbursement accounting. Some 300 staff of five
       ministries (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Transport and
       Communication, Ministry of Federal Affairs, Ministry of Information, and Ministry of
       Capacity Building) and 70 staff from regional governments (Oromia, Amahara, Tigray
       and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples regions) on the improved results
       oriented performance management system. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
       Development, Ministry of Transport and Communication, and the Ministry of Federal
       Affairs--including the agencies under their direct supervision--have implemented the
       system. The others have either started or will soon start implementing the system. All
       regions have closed their backlog accounts. Over 750 staff from federal and regional
       institutions have participated in training on the new procurement law and the new
       standard bidding documents. In addition eight staff from the Ministry of Capacity
       Building have benefited from training in Tanzania on international procurement
       standards. All are using their new skills as members of the ministry's procurement staff.

      Performance and service delivery improvement. Ten government entities have
      participated in the PSIP, including the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of
      Revenue, Federal Inland Revenue Authority, Customs Authority, Drug Administration
      and Control Authority, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, St. Peter's
      hospital, National Archives and Library, Amhara Investment Office, and Amhara
      Educational Bureau. Those visited during the Bank's final supervision mission explained
      how they brought about improved services and how they are collecting information
      through client satisfaction surveys or through suggestion boxes to track progress and
      identify lagging areas. The PSIP has now been scaled up nationwide under the PSCAP.

      Accountability and transparency. Seven staff from the Ministry of Capacity Building
      received training in financial and performance audit at the United States Auditor
      General's office. Upon return the experts provided in-house training to other staff of the
      Office of the Federal Auditor General. All seven are continuing to provide services to the
      office. In addition, the internal reporting system for the anti-corruption commission was
      developed and put into place. Following a testing phase, it is now being refined under
      PSCAP to better meet the needs of the commission. A performance tracking framework
      was developed. The facility is now being established under PSCAP.

Component 2: Restructuring and empowering local government. The outputs of this
component are satisfactory. Specific outputs by component included:

      Federal and regional policy and analysis

      o National urban development policy approved by the Council of Ministers and now
        under implementation in all nine regions and the two chartered cities.

      o Urban planning law approved by the House of Peoples representatives and gazetted in
        May 2008 (proclamation 574/2008) and now under implementation in all regions.

      o Draft integrated infrastructure policy and the draft federal housing policy are in the
        final stages of approval.

      o Federal framework for a land information system was developed. In April 2009, it
        was under review by the Office of the Prime Minister. It is expected to be submitted
        to parliament in September 2009. Once approved, three regulations--real property
        registration organization, establishment of Ethiopia cadastral surveyor's regulatory
        board, and Ethiopian cadastral surveying regulation--will be sent to the regional
        governments for implementation.

      o Federal land lease proclamation reviewed and found adequate.

      o Prototype regional regulation of lease holding and urban land prepared and sent to
        regions and two city administrations for adaptation and implementation. The Urban
        Good Governance Program (financed under PSCAP and GTZ) is supporting the
        adaptation and implementation.

                                              30
   o Compensation law promulgated in 2005. Regulations issued in May 2007 and sent to
     regions. Regions have adapted the regulations to meet their needs and are
     implementing them.

   o Federal Urban Planning Coordination Bureau established in March 2008 as a result of
     restructuring the National Urban Planning Institute. The restructured bureau is now
     serving in the role as advisors to the regional urban planning institutes, rather than as
     planners. The new arrangements are working well.

   o Federal Urban Good Governance Program designed and under implementation in all
     regions and 432 cities including Addis and Dire Dawa. The program focuses on
     institutional and organizational aspects of good governance aimed at promoting
     efficiency, effectiveness, accountability, transparency, participation, sustainability,
     the rule o f law, equity, democratic government and security. The Urban
     Development Program--focused on delivery of urban based infrastructure, municipal
     services, housing, and the like--benefiting 120 cities.

   o Operational manual and training manual for development of urban infrastructure asset
     management plans finalized and distributed to all cities for implementation. Training
     provided to the four major regions and 18 cities. These 18 cities are now preparing
     their asset management plans (which is also a performance criterion under the Urban
     Local Government Development Program).

   o Training provided to: (a) 3,135 councilors in basic urban management, (b) 3,175
     micro and small enterprise front-line service providers, and (c) 2,400 staff of regional
     and municipal governments on technical aspects of urban management. Another 600
     people benefited from workshops to share experiences. This training is providing
     tangible benefits. For example, several business one-stop shops visited during the
     final supervision mission were staffed with specialists in business plan development,
     financing options, IT solutions, and the like. They also offered training in a variety of
     topics aimed at helping micro and small entrepreneurs establish and operate
     businesses. Written feedback from clients was universally positive. In addition,
     according to senior managerial and technical staff of the municipal government met
     during the mission, the training had helped them in many areas, such as public
     participation in infrastructure projects and the use of asset management plans for
     planning operations and maintenance and enhancing revenues.

   o Master's program in urban management established at the Ethiopian Civil Service
     College. Some 400 students have already graduated. Another 1,000 are currently
     enrolled in the program. To qualify for the training, students must agree to serve in
     regional or municipal governments for a minimum of five years. The graduates met
     during the mission expressed enthusiasm about receiving the opportunity to enhance
     their knowledge and their hopes for their future career development.

   Regional technical assistance for deepening decentralization.

                                           31
   o Four major regions revised city proclamations establishing approximately 120
     autonomous city administrations. Four emerging regions and Harari regional state
     issued city proclamations. Addis issued its chartered proclamations in 2003 and Dire
     Dawa issued its in 2004.

   o Draft regional housing strategies developed by the four major regions.

   o Prototype land lease regulations at regional level are approved and being
     implemented in four major regions. Some 65 cities in the four major regions (9 in
     Amhara, 20 in South, 12 in Tigray and 24 in Oromia) now under lease system, up
     from 28 in 2002.

   o Regional urban development strategies and implementation plans completed and
     under implementation in the four major regions and in Addis and Dire Dawa.

   o Financial management manual, accounting system procedures manual, and chart of
     accounts developed for four major regions. System now operational in 18 towns.
     Urban local governments and regions have received training. Use of the modern
     accounting system is a performance measure under the Urban Local Government
     Development Project.

   o Human resources management guidelines and procedures developed and adopted in
     the four major regions. Prototype guidelines adopted by the four emerging regions.
     Support for implementation is being provided under the Urban Good Governance
     Program.

   o Equipment and accessories provided to Addis Ababa Transport Authority to allow it
     to complete the automation of its licensing and vehicle registration system. This has
     led to greatly improved services. For example, citizens now receive a license an
     average of 15 minutes following a successful driving test, down from the previous 1­
     2 weeks.

   o Digital maps for Addis Ababa completed. These are being used to improve planning
     and service delivery.

   o First stage of preparation of Mekelle cadastre completed. The city is currently
     installing a local area network under support of PSCAP to link the cadastre to the
     land information system.

   o Performance improvement plans and operational manuals for 18 cities completed.
     Some 18 cities have used the manuals to prepared 3-year capital investment plans,
     which they have submitted to the Urban Local Government Development Project for
     financing.

   Local government restructuring and capacity building

                                          32
      o Restructuring and performance improvement plans prepared for all 18 cities, and
        under implementation under the Urban Good Governance Program and the Urban
        Local Government Development Project.

      o Some 18 cities have prepared and are implementing revenue enhancement plans,
        aimed at enabling them to improve local services.

      o Prototype financial regulations prepared and sent to regions for adaptation. Three
        major regions (Amhara, Tigray, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples) have
        approved financial regulations.

      o Guidelines for preparation of revenue enhancement plans developed and sent to the
        four major regions and 18 towns. A number of cities are preparing their revenue
        enhancement plans with support of the Urban Good Government Program. This is
        also a performance measure under the Urban Local Government Development
        Project.

      Pilot investments for infrastructure rehabilitation

      o Ten infrastructure project completed. They include project to rehabilitate drainage
        systems, local roads and bridges, and markets. Three contracts were cancelled. Four
        projects were ongoing as of May 2009. Cities are using their own funds to complete
        the projects, under the supervision of the federal and regional bureaus of work. The
        17 participating cities have gained experience through learning-by-doing in planning,
        prioritizing options with public participation, and appraisal of proposed projects.
        They have also benefited from close collaboration with the UDCBO in all stages of
        project implementation (issuing requests for proposals, selecting consultants,
        procuring contractors, managing contracts, and the like).

      o All cities are addressing sustainability through the preparation of the asset
        management plans and budgets that provide for operations and maintenance (this is
        an access criterion and performance measure under the Urban Local Government
        Development Project).

Component 3. Strengthening the Ministry of Capacity Building. The outputs of this
component are moderately satisfactory. Specific outputs included:

      Some 29 staff trained abroad (in Tanzania for procurement and in Italy for public sector
      management). Another 50 staff were trained locally on strategic planning, 170 staff on
      basic computer skills, and 8 staff on procurement. The great majority of these staff are
      still working at the ministry.

      Ministry of Capacity Building provided with equipment and expertise to assist with the
      preparation of the capacity building program, implementation plan, and operational


                                               33
manual. Support was also provided to help government entities implement the capacity
enhancement activities.

Annex 6: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Executive Summary of the Borrower's ICR

The project's development objective (PDO) is to enhance decentralized service delivery
performance by initiating long term public sector capacity at the federal, regional and local levels
through a coordinated program of: (a) implementing civil service reforms (Component 1); (b)
restructuring and empowering local governments (Component 2); and (c) strengthening of the
Ministry of Capacity Building, MCB (Component 3).

The PDO has been achieved through institutional reforms, systems development, and training
activities supported under the three components. Activities aimed at reforming institutions,
developing operational, financial management, and procurement systems, and building staff
skills have been completed, and most targets met. Some 120 urban local governments have been
created in a context where autonomous local urban authorities were virtually nonexistent.

The PDO outcome indicators on prioritization of expenditures, financial sustainability and
cost-efficiency and improved service delivery have been substantially achieved . Participating
federal ministries and bureaus and local government entities are now prioritizing their
expenditures, something they had not done well prior to the project. The federal government and
all regional governments now use the Standard Bidding Documents and procurement procedures
for all public procurement. This has resulted in greater transparency and value for money in
procurement. Some 18 cities have prepared revenue enhancement plans, undertaken public asset
inventories, developed property management manuals, and established a unified financial
management system to increase revenues and ensure financial sustainability. Revenues in the
participating cities have already risen substantially. Service delivery performance in all the
agencies for which data are available has improved, in some cases dramatically so. Client
satisfaction surveys, for agencies that have carried them out, show rising customer contentment.
City benchmarking surveys, undertaken under PSCAP, also show improvements in service
delivery at local level.

In regard to component objectives, the independent evaluators have concluded, for Component
1, that in spite of substantive budget reductions - the component's objectives have to a very
large extent been achieved. Most importantly, the component has introduced systems for
performance-oriented management in the Ethiopian public service. It has supported the
development of innovative concepts and systems such as the PSIP, BPR and BSC that presently
are being launched at wider scale through PSCAP. Component 2 has achieved its objectives
through various activities that have been carried out by the project which have enabled the
establishment of urban local governments, including setting up systems, guidelines, manuals,
technical assistance and training to enable cities to function as viable entities. The strategies,
recommendations, operational systems and procedures provided by the project under the
Deepening Decentralization Technical Assistance - DDTA (Window 2) have proved to be timely
as they have informed in a significant way national strategies and programs for urban reform,
governance and development, particularly the Ministry's Urban Good Governance Program
(UGGP) which is currently under implementation at federal, regional and local levels. These
have laid the foundation and built the capacity at federal, regional and local level that have been

                                                38
instrumental in the successful launching of the follow on project, the Urban Local Government
Development Project (ULGDP). Under Component 3, the Ministry of Capacity Building was
strengthened to enable it to coordinate the National Capacity Building Program and PSCAP.
The independent consultants for evaluation of CBDSD have concluded that since the project had
to be extended twice and substantive budget reallocations made it can retrospectively be argued
that the design had significant problems. However, given the requirements of the reform
processes at the start of the Project and the information available, the basic design was sound
although project period was overambitious and the agreed management structure was weak.
The Bank team that participated in the project preparation of CBDSD provided Government with
critical information on lessons learnt and experiences from Ethiopia and other countries on
public sector reform and efforts to strengthen local governments. The Bank team performed well
in that they advised the Government on the proper sequencing of public sector reforms and
capacity building activities and in coming up with the strategy to start with the CBDSD project,
followed by the scaled up PSCAP project and the larger scale infrastructure project which is
performance based, the ULGDP. However, the Bank team should have taken into account more
the views of Government, especially for Component 1, to have greater flexibility and less IDA
control especially on approval by IDA of procurement plans and on the requirement to use IDA
procurement procedures instead of Government procurement procedures for some of the
activities.

The project benefitted a lot from the decision by the Bank in 2004 to have the CBDSD Task
Team Leader based in Addis Ababa as this brought a more focused and strategic support by the
Bank team. This was one of the contributory factors in the project being upgraded from
unsatisfactory to satisfactory in 2005.

Most of the problems on the Bank side resulted from delays in obtaining "no objections" for
procurement decisions and this was partly caused by the fact that the staff at the resident mission
were clearly overwhelmed by the number of requests they had to deal with not only from the
CBDSD but other World Bank projects as well. The large number of requests going to the Bank
were due to the low prior review threshold that had been set by the Bank, although the
Government had recommended higher thresholds. The Bank justified the low thresholds on the
basis that the procurement capacity in the country was limited and was in the process of being
built up and that there was also limited experience with World Bank procurement procedures.
The other reason for delays was that some of the request submitted to the Bank were incomplete,
which meant the Bank had to take more time on the requests or they had to be referred back to
Government for further information /clarifications. Other significant problems from the Bank
were caused by the Bank's delay in processing withdrawal applications and replenishments to
the special account. Delays of up to 20 days were experienced. Other payment delays were
caused by the fact that the World Bank Resident Mission staff were either not updating or
properly updating the Bank system with some signed contracts submitted to them by UDCBO.

The Bank's ongoing support and advice (technical, procurement, safeguards, monitoring and
evaluation) during implementation, especially advice and recommendations given during the
frequent and timely IDA supervision missions contributed immensely to successful project
implementation and the achievement of project objectives.

In terms of overall management, the Government in many ways displayed significant flexibility
in dealing with the challenges that faced the CBDSD project, in that it twice agreed to reallocate
funds across main components and corresponding implementing agencies. Later in the project,
the Government agreed to transfer overall management responsibilities from MCB to MWUD.
The independent evaluators noted that such decisions are, in other countries, almost impossible
to effectuate, but in the case of CBDSD, Government has shown the necessary flexibility to
optimize implementation performance and management arrangements.
The preparations for, and implementation of PSCAP, which was happening at the same time as
CBDSD implementation, affected performance, especially for Component 1 and 3 since the same
senior officers in MCB responsible for these Components were also responsible for and heavily
involved in PSCAP (especially dealing with the many PSCAP management issues). At the same
time, the same officers were for a long time (2003-2007) also responsible for overall project
management of CBDSD.

Delays were experienced in bid and proposal evaluations especially were these involved
evaluators coming from different organizations. The evaluations took time partly due to
inexperience of the evaluators and partly due to the time taken to obtain their release from their
normal duties to carry out the evaluations.

There was a high turnover of staff especially at the city level and to a lesser extent at regional
and federal levels which eroded the benefits from the various capacity building and training
programs (including formal training and on the job training). Staff turnover resulted from either
people leaving due to poor salaries and conditions of service or staff being moved due to
continuous restructuring. There was some stability in UDCBO and the top positions in MCB
which was augmented by the selective and targeted use of international and local consultants
which contributed to the project being upgraded from unsatisfactory to satisfactory in 2005. This
was also an important factor in the completion of some of the major activities and
accomplishment of the project objectives.

On infrastructure, problems were experienced due to limited contractor capacity in the country
for the type and size of projects that the towns prioritized and implemented under CBDSD. There
were poor responses to invitation for bids, where either there were no responsive bidders and the
contracts had to be retendered or only one to three bids were evaluated which limited the
choices and quality available. Problems were also experienced due to the countrywide shortage
of cement, foreign exchange availability and the dramatic increase in prices of cement and other
material also affected the administration and implementation of the fixed price contracts.
