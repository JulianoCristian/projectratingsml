decentralized\n            service delivery performance by initiating long-term public\n            sector capacity building at the federal, regional, and local\n            levels. This project consists of three components. 1) This\n            component will complete the Civil Service Reform Program\n            (CSRP) activities and support the launch of the full\n            implementation phase of the CSRP at the federal, regional,\n            and local levels. As a basis for full implementation, the\n            government has acknowledged the need for stronger\n            coordination and change management, high-level commitment,\n            redesign of the CSRP architecture, and the development of a\n            process change modality. 2) Restructuring and empowering\n            local government will facilitate the process of building\n            local governments that are financially sound and have the\n            ability and incentives to improve service delivery,\n            especially to the poor. This component will address\n            financial constraints, capacity constraints, and unclear\n            mandate for local authorities. 3) This component will\n            strengthen the Ministry of Capacity Building as the lead\n            coordinating agency for the development and implementation\n            of National Capacity Building Program and sub-programs\n            related to public service delivery."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
