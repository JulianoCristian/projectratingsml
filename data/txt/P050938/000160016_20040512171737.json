the Capacity Building for Decentralized\n            Service Delivery Project for Ethiopia, which finances pilot\n            investments for infrastructure rehabilitation to facilitate\n            a learning-by-doing approach and to test the feasibility of\n            larger scale infrastructure investment components in future\n            operations. This report anticipates that soil and water\n            contamination, vegetation loss, soil erosion, dust, noise,\n            and accidents during rehabilitation activities will be\n            possible negative environmental impacts from sub-projects.\n            Sections of this report illustrate the specific steps\n            financial intermediaries will take in screening sub-projects\n            for environmental impacts and assigning them in the\n            appropriate environmental category. To determine the depth\n            of detail of the environmental impact assessment, the\n            potential impacts in the following areas will be considered:\n            social considerations such as tradition and sociao\n            organization, tenure rights, predominant attitudes toward\n            growth, patterns of interactions, and capacity of local\n            institutions; health issues; protected areas; cultural\n            heritage and archaeological sites; existing natural\n            resources such as forests, soils, wetlands, and water\n            resources; and wildlife or endangered species' habitats."}, "docdt": "2002-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
