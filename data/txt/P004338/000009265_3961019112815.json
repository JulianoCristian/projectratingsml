This\n            plan provided for the extension of the runway and expansion\n            of the terminal building and aircraft parking areas in\n            phased stages. The principle objective of the project was to\n            improve facilities at the Mal\u00e9 airport to meet the growth in\n            tourist traffic and strengthen Maldives Airport\n            Authority's (MAA) operating capabilities. Bank's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: a) the formation of a team specifically\n            assigned to manage project implementation is essential\n            towards ensuring effective and timely implementation; b)\n            delay in securing financing can jeopardise effective\n            implementation and can be costly in terms of demobilisation\n            and remobilisation costs incurred by contractors; c)\n            passenger or aircraft movements forecast for Mal\u00e9 Airport\n            has always been under-estimated; and d) consultants who are\n            in par with the Client's interests is essential to\n            ensure a quality project performance."}, "docdt": "1995-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
