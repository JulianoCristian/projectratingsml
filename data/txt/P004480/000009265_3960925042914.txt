PROJECT CC4PLPTION REPORT
Preface
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews implementation of the
Third Livestock and Fisheries Credit Project in the Philippines, for which
Loan 1894-PH, in the amount of US$45.0 million, was approved on July 15,
1980. The oviginal loan closing date of June 30, 1984, vas extended twice
for the non-credit component of the project only, to June 30, 1986. Due to
insolvency of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the
implementing agency for the credit component, the uncommitted balance of
the credit component, of US$20.4 million, was cancelled effective October
17, 1984. The final disbursement for the non-credit component was made on
January 17, 1987, when the unutilized balance of US$1.1 million was also
cancelled.
This Report consists of an Evaluation Summary, Basic Data Sheet
and Overview prepared by staff of the Bank's Asia Regional Office, and a
Borrower's PCR prepared by the Agricultural Supervision Department of the
DBP. The Borrower's PCR provides a detailed review of the project,
focussing on the credit component, which accounted for about 90X of total
project costs. The Overview agrees with the major findings of the PCR,
although it concludes that the project had a more negative Impact on DBP's
financial status than the PCR would suggest. The Overview also
incorporatits the findings of a separate report by the Bureau of Animal
Industry (BAI), concerning non-credit project activities in the livestock
subsector.
This PCR vas read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR wa sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
to the Report (Attachment I).

THIRD LIVESTOCK AND FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 1894-PH)
JCT' COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation SummarW
Pro1ect Objectives and Content
1.       The project aited to support the Philippine Government's  goal of
increasing animal protein supply, by providing medium and long-term credit
through the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for livestock and
fisheries, and institutional support to DBP and other official agencies
responsible for policy formulation in these subsectors. It followed seven
other agricultural and five industrial operations which the Bank had
channelled through DBP during 1971^79. The project was identified and
prepared by FAO/CP in October 1978 and March 1979, respectively, and was
appraised by the Bank in late-1979. Loan 1894-PH, of US$45.0 million, was
approved by the Executive Directors on July 15, 1980 and became effective
on November 5, 1980.
2.       The project was designed to allow DBP greater latitude in
allocating loan proceeds than had been the case under the Bank's preceding
.agricultural credit operations, thereby indicating increased delegation of
responsibility from the Bank to DBP. The Bank reserved the right tcw
approve detailed annual programs defining lending priorities for regions,
commodities and beneficiaries and to review DBP's annual lending rates, and
required an action plan for dealing with DBP arrears. This project also
went further than preceding credit operations for livestock and fisheries
by including financial and technical assistance for key subsectoral
agencies and institutional strengthening to DBP. It comprised two major
components:
(a) credit through DBP for small and medium-scale production
of pigs and other small livestock; cattle breeding and
fattening; construction and equipping of fishing vessels;
construction, rehabilitation and expansion of fishponds;
and other credit activities to be identified during
project implementation; and
(b) non-credit activities, including (i) livestock planning and
subsector studies and development programs to be implemented
by the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI); (ii) fisheries
subsector studies by the Fisheries Industry Development
Council; and (iii) technical assistance to DBP for studies
and promotion of provincial feed mills, development of a
project monitoring and evaluation system, and training
programs for agricultural staff and in-house trainers.



Project Costs and Pinancinj
3.       The project was to be implemented over three years, from mid-1980
to mid-1983, at a total cost of US$140.7 million, with a 16% foreign
exchange component. Bank Loan 1894-PH would finance 32% of the total cost,
with GOP/DBP providing US$81 million (58%), and sub-borrorers of the credit
component financing US$15 million (11%). Due to insolvency of DBP, only
US$19.6 million of the credit component was disbursed and the uncommitted
balance of US$20.4 million was cancelled on October .7, 1984.
The original loan closing date of June 30, 1984 was extended twice for the
non-credit component of the project only, to June 30, 1986. Total
disbursements for non-credit activitias were US$3.9 million; the unutilized
balance of US$1.1 million was cancelled on January 17, 1987. The total
project cost at completion was only US$81.2 million equivalent, or 58% of
the cost estimated at appraisal, with the Bank disbursing only 52% of the
original loan amount. Both the Bank's and DBP's shares of credit component
financing were lower than anticipated at appraisal because DBP later
decided to require a larger equity participation by sub-borrowers.
Project Results
4.       In May 1983 the Bank had to request DBP to refrain from making new
subloan commitments due to the intermediary's precarious financial
situation: DBP's liquidity had deteriorated to the extent that, beginning
in August 1982, it had practically ceased all lending operations other than
those financed under World Bank credit lines. DBP subsequently requested,
but the Bank did not agree, to resume subloan commitments. Finally, in
recognition of the gravity of DBP's financial crisis, it was decided during
the 1984 World Bank-IMF Annual Meeting to cancel the unconmitted balances
of the credit components of all ongoing Bank-financed DBP projects (Loan
1894-PH, one other agricultural credit line and an industrial credit line).
Despite this suspension and cancellation, the credit component achieved 71%
of the appraisal targets in terms of number of sub-projects and 85% of the
appraisal estimate in terms of volume of sub-project investment. The only
activity which fell substantially below appraisal expectations was lending
for marine fisheries, both because credit demand in that subsector was
slack and because DBP discouraged financing of fishing vessels due to its
poor sub-loan recovery experience.
5.       Implementation of the DBP technical assistance activities was very
successful. DBP's monitoring and evaluation effort was expanded to cover
not only project-financed credit, but also improvement and computerization
of DBP's overall management information system, which proved vital to
subsequent Bank-supported restructuring of DBP. On the other hand, the
FIDC fisheries studies were never carried out due to reorganization of GOP
fisheries agencies and eventual abolition of FIDC itself. Also,
implementation of livestock activities by BAI fell quite short of appraisal
expectations, principally because of BAI's inability to execute the cattle
dispersal program (which accounted for 50% of project support to BAI) on
the scale anticipated. Chronic budgetary problems also plagued BAI, which
was never able to procure the vehicles and facilities it needed.



- vi -
6.       Re-estimated ERRs for all credit sub-project categories were
positive and within the range of original ERR estimates in the SAR, except
for cattle and fishing vessel sub-projects for which original estimates
were a bit higher than actuals. The re-estimated FRRs for the sub-projects
were close to the corresponding ERRs and approximate appraisal PRR
estimates. The overall financial impact of the project on DBP is, however,
likely to be negative due to expected subloan defaults.
7.       Although the Borrower's PCR indicates losses on DBP's project-
funded livestock and fisheries portfolio only during 1980-81 and a profit
during 1982-84, the Region disputes these estimates, which implicitly
assume no subloan default. Based on data in the PCR, 722 of the number of
project accounts (involving 692 of total subloan principal outstanding)
were in arrears as of mid-1985. If only arrears of over one year were
considered, the ratios would still be 30S of accounts and 381 of
outstanding principal (the PCR shows 262, although the Region was unable to
replicate this computation). In any case, DBP's arrears ratio for the
project loan portfolio, although better than the corresponding ratio for
its overall agricultural loan portfolio and significantly better than its
industrial portfolio, far exceeds the 20X ceiling used by the Central Bank
in qualifying commercial banks for rediscounting.
Borrower Performance
8.       From the narrow standpoint of the project itself, DBP's
performance was highly professional. However, its overall management was
subject to severe political pressure and therefore demonstrated poor
judgement in dealing with the institution's basic structural and financial
problems. The economic crisis of 1983, which caused a severe liquidity
shortage in the Philippines, aggravated DBP's already grave financial
situation to the point where it required a GOP/Central Bank-out. To
forestall the closure of a large number of investments it had financed, DBP
took over their operations and ploughed in additional resources, further
increasing its exposure. To show operating profits, it resorted to
creative accounting and booking of a large proportion of non-cash income,
causing confusion, lack of confidence, and eventually loss of management
control over the financial information generated. The performance of BAI
was merely adequate in most instances, with the clear exception of the
research staff who succe-4fully carried out their tasks with impressive
dedication, despite severe budget constraints and adverse working
conditions.
Bank Performance
9.       By concentrating too narrowly on analysis of the expected project
cash flow and DBP's agricultural loan portfolio, rather than DBP's overall
financial situation, the Bank did not detect early enough the extent of the
intermediary's financial problems, stemming mainly from its numerous non-
performing large-scale industrial subloans. Subsequently, as the Bank
became aware of DBP's deteriorating financial position, it should have
moved more expeditiously and given more emphasis to serious restructuring
efforts. On the other hand, the Bank's decision to maintain support for



- vii -
the non-credit component, even when credit activities had to be cancelled,
was a good one, particularly as regards technical assistance to DBP which
later provided vital support to restructuring efforts.
Issues and Lessons
10.      Scope and Coverage of the Credit Component.  The scope and
coverage of the credit component should have included all agricultural
activities rather than only livestock and fisheries. Project focus on
these two subsectors led DBP staff to spend too much time on such
subprojects, at the expense of adequate-- evaluating, monitoring and
3upervising its overall agricultural loan portfolio.
11.      Institutional Issues.  The Bank did not sufficiently appraise
DBP's financial condition, BAI's implementation capability or the potential
delays in the budgetary process; consequently, problems which already
existed at the time of appraisal later surfaced and obstructed
implementation. Appraisal and supervision missions need to be more
diligent in their institutional analysis of implementing agencies, with
respect to financial performance, organizational capabilities, and the lead
time involved in obtaining budgetary approvals to undertake project
activities on the scale propo ed.
12.      Progect Financial Impact on Implementing Agency.  Appraisals of
credit operations should explicitly assess whether, and under what
conditions, project implementation might negatively impact on the
intermediary, and project design   suld ensure that such situations are
avoided. For DBP, a combination of subloan pricing policies (which charged
lower interest rates for smaller subloans that were more expensive to
administer), high operating expenses and high sublcan arrears and default
rates, all contributed to the institution's deepenirg financial crisis in
the early 1980s.

THIRD LIVESTOCK AND FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT (MOM_ 1094-PE)
PROJECT OtMPLETION REPORT
Overview
Introductir8n
1.       This Overview is based primarily on the PCR for the Third
Livestock and Fisheries Credit Project (Loan 1894-PH) prepared by the
Agriculture Supervision Department of the Development Bank of the
Phlippines (DBP), dated October 1986.  The PCR provides a detailed review
of the project, focusing on the credit component which accounted for about
90%X of the total pLoject cost. The Region agrees with the major findings
of the PCR with regard to project performance and results, although it
concludes that the project had a more negative Impact on DBP's financitA
atatus than does the PCR.  The Overview also incorporates the findings of a
report by the Bureau of Animal Industries (BAI), concerning non-credit
project activities in the livestock subsector, as well as information
available in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and Loan Agreement for this
project, and in other internal memoranda and documents in Bank project
files.
Proiect Backaround
2.       The Bank began lending to DBP through its loan to the Government
of the Philippines (GOP) in 1971 for the First Rice Processing and Storage
Project (Loan 720-PH). As of the appraisal of the Third Livestock and
Fisheries Project in 1979, DBP had been the channel for seven agricultural
and five industrial credit projects financed by the Bank (Loans 720, 823,
891, 998, 1048, 1120, 1190, 1225, 1269, 1270, 1,06 and 1572-PH), for a
total loan amount of US$317.8 million. Two of these previous Bark loans
had been for livestock (Loans 823 and 1225-PH) and two for fisheries (Loans
891 and 1270-PR). Concurrent with the Third Livestock and Fisheries
Project, DBP was also implementing three other Bank-financed credit liness
the Second Smallholder Tree Farming Project (Loan 1.506-PH), the Third
Industrial Investment Plroject (Loan 1572-PH), and the Third Small and
Medium Scale Industry Project (Loen 2169-PH).
3.       In mid-1978, when the outstanding balances under the then ongoing
livestock and fisheries development proSects were about to be fully
committed, GOPIDBP requested additional Bank financing for these
subsectors. Following internal review in the Bank, it was decided to widen
the scope of the new project from that of a simple credit operation, by
including some financial and technical assistance to the subsectoral line
agencies and institutional strengthening of DBP. The FAOICP identified the
project in October 1978 and assisted a joint GOP agency task force with
project preparation in March 1979.



- ix -
4.       The project was appraised as a broader livestock and fisheries
credit line (i.e., not limited to strictly prescribed subloan investments),
so as to allow DBP greater latitude in allocating loan proceeds, thereby
Indicating increased delegation of responsibility from the Bank to DBP.
The Bank would approve a detailed annual program which would define lending
priorities for the regions, commodities and beneficiaries. Long-term
institutional strengthening to improve sub-project appraisal, monitoring
and evaluation (M&E), and an action plan for dealing with arrears were also
included under the project. At the time, it was not foreseen that the
extent of these arrears would ultimately threaten DBP's creditworthiness.
5.       A proposed graduated disbursement schedule to provide DBP with
incentives to lend to smallholders was rejected by Bank management, which
also requested a revision of the project economic justification and better
definition of the DBP institutional strengthening component.  Consequently,
the initial project appraisal document, which had been completed in January
1980, was revised with regard to both farm models (to reflect lesser
reliance on imported feedgrains for livestock and to lower construction
standards for animal housing and fishponds) and DBP institutional
strengthening (modification and clarification of DBP arrears action
program, training plan and lending policy, etc., including annual Bank
review of DBP onlending rates). Based on the revised SAR of June 13, 1980
(Report No. 2828-PH), the Board approved a loan of US$45.0 million on July
15, 1980, which became effective on November 5, 1980.
Prolect Obiectives
6.       The project was designed to support GOP's goal of increasing
animal protein supply, by providing medium and long-term credit through DBP
for livestock and fisheries, and institutional support to DBP and other GOP
agencies responsible for policy formulation in these subsectors. The
project would also promote better coordination between these agencies and
DBP. The project included two major components, the credit component
implemented by DBP and the non-credit component implemented by DBP, the
Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and the Fisheries Industry Development
Council (FIDC). Credit through DBP was for: (a) small and medium-scale
production of pigs and other small livestock; (b) cattle breeding and
fattening; (c) construction and equipping of fishing vessels; (d)
construction, rehabilitation and expansion of fishponds; and (e) other sub-
projects in the livestock and fisheries subsectors to be identified in the
course of project implementation. The non-credit component comprised: (a)
livestock planning and other subsector studies, and livestock development
programs including BAI cattle dispersal, cattle markets development, cattle
breed stock upgrading, small livestock nutrition research, and pasture and
legume seed propagation schemes; (b) fisheries subsector studies including
FIDC fishing gear technology and review of marine regulations; and (c)
technical assistance to DBP for studies and promotion of provincial feed
mills, cevelopment of a project M&E system, and development of agriculture
staff training programs and training of tn-house trainers.

Lrotect Costs and Financing
7.       The project was to be Implemented over three years, from mid-1980
to mid-1983. Total project cost was estimated at Pesos 1.04 billion
(US$140.7 million equivalent), with a 161 foreign exchange component. The
Bank loan of US$45 million was to finance 321 of the total project cost,
with GOPIDBP providing US$81 million to finance 582, and the balance of
US$15 million, equivalent to 11 of total project cost, to be financed by
project beneficiaries as sub-borrowers of the credit component.
8.       Table 1 below compares estimated and actual financing of the
project components:

Total           66.6  (100%)           14.6  (1001)      81.2 (1001)
The total project cost at completion was only US$81.2 million equivalent,
or 581 of the cost estimated at appraisal. The shortfall was primarily due
to the cancellation of the balance of the credit component (para. 9) and
the low volume of marine fisheries subloans prior to the cancellation.
Although investment in the non-credit component also fell short of
appraisal estimates, the effect on overall project status at completion was
less significant (since the non-credit component accounted for only 131 of
total project cost at appraisal and 181 of the actual total project cost).
The Bank's and DBP's shares of credit component financing were lower than
anticipated at appraisal, due to DBP's subsequent requirement that sub-
borrowers have a larger equity participation.

ImDlementation Hxverience
9.       Implementation of the credit component began promptly and
proceeded on target until May 1983, when the Bank requested DBP to refrain
from making new subloan commitments due to DBP's precarious financial
situation. DBP's solvency was in doubt and its liquidity had deteriorated
to the extent that, beginning in August 1982, it had practically ceased all
lending operations other than those under World Bank-financed credit lines.
After the Bank's denial of repeated GOP requests for permission for DBP to
resume subloan commitments, and in recognition of the gravity ^f DBP's
financial crisis, it was agreed d-aring the 1984 Bank-IMF Annual Meeting
that the unc*mmitted balances of the credit components of all ongoing Bank-
financed DBP projects (including two agricultural credit lines, Loans 1506
and 1894-PH, and one industrial credit line, Loan 2169-PH) should be
cancelled. Therefore, effective October 17, 1984, US$20.4 million of the
uncommitted balance of the credit component of Loan 1894-PH was cancelled,
reducing the total loan to US$24.6 million and leaving an undisbursed
balance of US$4 million.
10.      Implementation of DBP non-credit component activities was slower
than expected due to delays in consultant selection and negotiation, and
changes In project concept (expansion of project M&E activitios to include
improvement and computerization of DBP's overall management information
system). Livestock studies and development programs Implemented by BAI
were delayed by over two years due primarily to budgetary constraints. The
proposed FIDC fisheries studies underwent numerous reviews and changes in
concept and were then delayed because of a reorganization of the GOP
fisheries agencies, which led to their transfer from the Ministry of
Natural Resources (MNR) to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAP) and
the abolition of FIDC Itself. Ultimately, the fisheries studies were not
undertaken due to dolayed budget releases. The loan closing date for the
non-credit component of the project was extended twice, from June 30, 1984
to June 30, 1986. The final loan disbursement was made on January 17,
1987, resulting in a total disbursement of US$23.5 million and cancellation
of a final US$1.1 million of the unutilized balance of the loan.
11.      Credit Component.  Despite the suspension of DIP commitment
auchority in early 1983 and the eventual cancellation of 51t of the credit
component, the project accomplished most of its sub-project investment
targetst 711 of the appraisal estimate in terms of number of projects and
85X of the appraisal estimate in terms of volume of sub-project investment,
as illustrated in Table 2 below. Specifically, at project completion, sub-
project investment in the livestock subsector was 122% of the appraisal
estimate of number of sub-projects and 1081 of the estimated volume of
investment. Sub-project investment in inland fisheries was 1561 of the
appraisal estimate of number of sub-projects, but was only 62X in terms of
amount of investment, indicating much smaller sub-projects and sub-loans
than expected. The one activity for which the sub-project investment
target was not met was marine fisheries, where only 31 of the estimated
number of sub-projects was actually financed, in ar. amount equivalent to
about 16% of the estimated investment (reflecting. larger sub-projects than



- xii -
anticipated). The shortfall in marine fisheries investment was caused by
both a slack in credit demand in that subsector and DBP's policy of
discouraging the financing of fishing vessels due to its poor sub-loan
recovery experience.

12.      Non-Credit Component.  Appraisal targets for the non-credit
component were not met in spite of the two-year extension of the loan
closing date (para. 10). The consolidated cost of the non-credit
component, US$13.9 million, or 801 of the appraisal estimate, somewhat
obscures the variable performance of individual sub-components. The DBP
technical assistance activities were very successful, especially with
regard to improvement of the management information system, which proved
indispensable to the subsequent Bank-supported restructuring of DBP. On
the other hand, the FIDC fisheries studies were never implemented due to
reorganization of the GOP fisheries agencies and bureaus and abolition of
FIDC. Finally, investment in and implementation of livestock development
activities by BAI fell far short of appraisal targets, due to extensive
delays and shortfalls in budgetary allocations, as well as BAI's limited
capacity to implement the cattle dispersal program (which accounted for
about 50% ot total project-supported BAI activities) on the scale

anticipated. Table 3 below compares estimated and actual loan utilization
of the non-credit component. As data on the total cost of the non-credit
component was not included in the PCR, the actual cost figures used in this
Overview were derived from disbursement records available at the Bank,
assuming the same project cost-sharing arrangements as at appraisal (e.g.,
73S GOPIDBP and 27% IBRD).

13.      Chantes in Proiect Scope and DesiRn.  The project credit component
was originally based on indicative amnual lending programs prepared by DBP
in consultation with other GOP agencies involved in the subsectors. These
programs served only as broad guidelines and were not binding, so that no
real change in project design was required in the course of implementation.
Actual lending operations were, thus, responsive and tended to reflect the
changing economic environment and expectations in the country. In an
effort to attract backyard and small commercial producers to participate
under the project, DBP reduced the minimum equity requirement, liberalized
collateral appraisal and lowered interest rates for smaller sub-projects.
As a result of the annual reviews of its lending program, DBP made some
minor alterations in lending strategy (e.g., reorientation from financing
of small piggery and poultry commercial producers, who became increasingly
less competitive because of rising prices for imported feedgrains, to
expawtion of medium and large-scale enterprises; promotion of piggery and
poultry producers in corn-producing areas, in addition to major consumption
centers; increasd emphasis on financing of cattle financing sub-projects;
and promotion of polyculture, instead of monoculture, fishfarming).
14.      There were several changes in the non-credit component.  Support
for DBP's project M&E effort was expanded to cover improvement and
computerization of DBP's overall management information system, which
included, in addition to agricultural loan monitoring and evaluation, the
design and installation of an automated billing system and computerized
loan management in support of the arrears reduction program. Also, some
US$0.4 million of the unutilized balance of US$1.2 million for the cattle



- xiv -
dispersal progran was reallocated to supplement the originally very small
allocation (US$0.15 million) for breed stock upgrading.
Protect Mnsaement Performance
15.      DBP's performance in managing both the credit and non-credit
components of this project was highly professional and should be commended.
DBP's overall management was, however, subject to severe political pressure
and therefore demonstrated poor judgement in dealing with the institution's
basic structural problems and financial crisis. DBP's portfolio of
subloans as measured by the arrears ratio and loan recovery was very poor.
Nevertheless, according to DBP records, subloans financed under the project
performed better than DBP's agricultural loan portfolio which, in turn, was
better than DBP's total loan portfolio (netting out the effect of
restructuring of many large industrial accounts, which involved booking of
account income and collection without actual cash inflow to DBP). The
performance of BAI 'ias merely adequate in most instances, with the clear
exception of the BAI research staff who successfully carried out their
tasks with impressive dedication, despite severe budget constraints and
adverse working conditions.
Bank Performance
16.      The Bank should have detected the extent of DBP's financial
problems, stemming mainly from its numerous non-performing large-scale
industrial subloans and investments at an earlier stage and these should
have been brought to the attention of Bank Management, prior to or at
appraisal of this project. By concentrating too narrowly on the analysis
of the expected project cash flow and DIP's agricultural loan portfolio,
rather than DBP's overall financial situation, the preparation and
appraisal missions failed to eppreciate the seriousness of the agency's
rapidly deteriorating position. Subsequently, the Bank's supervision of
the project itself was satisfactory, and the decision to maintain support
for the non-credit component, even when credit activities had to be
suspended and later cancelled, was a good one. In particular, the
continuation of technical assistance to DBP proved vital. A total of nine
missions supervised the project (twice a year during the peak of project
implementation). The skill mix of credit specialist, financial analyst,
livestock specialist and management specialist on the various supervision
missions was appropriate. However, given the Bank's intimate knowledge of
DBP's weak financial position, its efforts to assist DBP in improving its
overall financial structure and condition could have been better, i.e.,
should have started much earlier and been given more emphasis, even before
suspension of the credit component.
Institutional Impact
17.      Credit Component.  As indicated above, the extent of DBP's weak
financial condition, i.e., the fact that DIP was insolvent, was not fully
grasped at appraisal. The project technical assistance component to
strengthen DBP's staff training and management information system, and the



- xv -
Bank's insistence on an arrears reduction plan, although beneficial, were
far from adequate in addressing DBP's poor and rapidly deteriorating loan
and investment portfolio. Based on Bank estimates derived from data In the
Borrower's PCR, as of June 30, 1985, 722 of the number of project accounts
(involving 69S of the total subloan principal outstanding) was in arrears.
If only arrears of over one year were considered, the ratios would be 302
of the accounts and 382 of the outstanding principal. The DBP-computed
ratio of arrears (262 for both) is presented in the PCR separately for
livtRtock and fisheries subprojects, but the Region was unable to replicate
DBP's computation from the given data. the closest proxy (see Annex III,
Working Papers 2-4) was the ratio of total past due amount, including
principal and interest past due plus penalty and other charges, over total
principal outstanding--which comes to 252 for the livestock and 282 for the
fisheries sub-projects, or an overall ratio of 262.
18.      Although this ratio indicates the amount of overdue collection, it
does not provide a meaningful indication of portfolio quality. However,
since no data are available on actual cash collection, ratios of current
collectionlcurrent collectible and past due collection/past due
collectible, and recovery from foreclosure accounts, etc., no further
analysis of the portfolio and arrears situation is possible. In any case,
DBP's arrears ratio for the Third Livestock and Fisheries loan portfolio
(according to both Bank's and DBP's own calculations), although
significantly better than the corresponding ratio for its overall
agricultural loan portfolio, far exceeds the 202 ceiling used by the
Central Bank in qualifying commercial banks for rediscounting, i.e., for
qualifying commercial banks as being reasonably sound. The poor portfolio
quality implies a correspondingly low collection ratio and, ultimately, a
high subloan default rate.
19.      The economic crisis of 1983, which caused a severe liquidity
shortage in in the Philippines, aggravated DtP's already grave financial
condition to the point where it became illiquid, requiring a GOP/Central
Bank bail-out. But for this economic and liquidity crisis, DBP might have
been able to continue with the semblance of normalcy for a while longer.
However, as a consequence of its attempt to appear healthy despite its
insolvency, DBP's operation was quite unsound and generally detrimental to
the economy. To forestall the closure of a large number of the operations
financed by its loans and investments, DBP took over their operations and
had to plough in additional resources, further increasing its exposure,
despite the bleak potential for business and loan recovery. To show
operating profits, DBP had to resort to creative accounting and booking of
a large proportion of non-cash income, causing confusion, lack of
confidence, and eventually loss of management control over the financial
information generated. Staff morale worsened, which had an adverse impact
on its day-to-day operations, as evidenced by extended leaves taken and
disappearances of files, loans, security documents, etc.
20.      Non-credit Component.  The project overestimated BAI's
implementation eapacity, especially with regard to the cattle dispersal
program, which was the single largest non-credit activity. Although the



- xvi -
loan included financing for vehicles and facilities for field staff
involved in this program, BSI could not procure the needed vehicles and
facilities and was therefore able to execute only about 10% of the
estimated program. In fact, BAI activities did not receive budget approval
until the third year of the project. Further, there was a temporary
informal ban on capital expenditure, and thus BAI could not procure items
which it needed for implementation of the cattle dispersal program.
Project design did not anticipate these problems, hence the project made no
impact on the budget process and received no special treatment. The
project was, however, successful in introducing an M&E system for BAI'e
cattle dispersal and breed stock upgrading programs, laying the essential
groundwork for program evaluation and future expansion.
Economic and Financial Imiact
21.      It is estimated that, at full development, the livestock and
poultry sub-projects financed under Loan 1894-PH would supply about 28,500
MT of meat, 61 million chicken and duck eggs, and 293,500 liters of milk
annually. Output from the fisheries sub-projecto is estimated at about
34,600 MT of marine fish, 7,600 MT of farm fish and prawns, and 12,600 MT
of salt annually. Incremental employment is estimated at 4,100 jobs, or
53% of the appraisal forecast. Sub-project ERR is estimated at 182 for
piggeries, 33% for cattle, 40% for fishing vessels (trawlers), 302 for ice
plants, between 40-54% for fishponds, 202 for layers, and 62% for contract
broilers. These are within the range of ERR estimates in the SAR, except
for cattle and fishing vessel sub-projects for which the ERR estimates in
the SAR ranged from 30-1002.
22.      The FRRs for the sub-projects are close to the corresponding ERRs
and approximate appraisal FRR estimates. The financial impact of the
project on DBP is, however, likely to be negative due to expected subloan
defaults (based on the high proportion of arrears as of mid-1986).
According to the PCR, DBP incurred losses on its project-funded livestock
and fisheries portfolio in 1980-81, the first two years of operations, but
thereafter showed a profit during 1982-84. The pro forma statement of
earnings and expenses for the portfolio also showed a profit throughout,
with an expected IRR of 112. The Region disputes these estimates, which
implicitly assume no subloan default, and predicts an overall negative
financial impact on DBP based on its analysis of the loar portfolio (paras.
17-18). The extent of the financial impact of the project on DBP depends
on its spread and, most importantly, the cost of default, which the Region
believes to be relatively large. As data on subloan collection are not
available, the Region has not attempted to estimate the exact Cost of the
default or the magnitude of the expected negative financial impact.

Issues and Lessons
23.      Scope and Coverag, of the Credit Comnonent.  With the benefit of
hindsight, the scope and coverage of the credit component should not have
been liited to livestock and fisheries, but should have included all
agricultural activities.  Project focus on these subsectors led DBP staff
to spend more time and effort on evaluation, monitoring and supervision of
such sub-projects, at the expense of its overall agricultural loan
portfolio. Annual lending programs were prepared for the livestock and
fisheries sub-projects only, as required under the Loan Agreement. However,
it would have been preferable to promote an overall agricultural lending
strategy which could be trwaslated into lending programs and targets for
each subsector, including livestock and fisheries, rather than to focus
attention narrowly on these subsectors.
24.      Institutional Issues.  As mentioned in paras. 17-20 on
institutlonal impact, the Bank did not sufficiently appraise DBP's
financial condition, BAI's implementation capability or the potential
delays in the budgetary process. Consequently, institutional problems
which already existed at the time of appraisal later surfaced and
obstructed implementation. Future project appraisals and supervisions
should be more diligent In their institutional analysis of implementing
agencies, with respect to their financial performance and condition,
institutional constraints and capabilities, and the lead time required for
them to obtain the necessary budgetary approvals to undertake project
Implementation on the scale proposed.
25.      Financial Impact on Implementing Atency.  Appraisals of credit
operations should explicitly assess whether, and under what conditions,
project implementation would have a negative financial impact on the
intermediary. Project design should ensure that such situations are
avoided. For DBP, a combination of subloan pricing (which charged lower
interests for smaller subloans that were more expensive to administer),
high operating expenses and, most importantly, high subloan arrear and
default rates caused the project to impact negatively on DBP, thereby
contributing, although only marginally so, to its financial woes.

/b  According to the PCR, the Bank financed 100X of the noncredit
components. This is inaccurate. Although the Bank financed 100X of the
studies and consultancy contracts, it fLnanced only a proportion of DBP
computerization, breeding stock upgrading, cattle dispersal and livestock
market development programs. It is estimated that the overheads and other
expenses associated with these programs came to 252 of total Bank
financing of the noncredit components. Therefore, the costs shown here
are based on Table 3, page A-4 of the PCR and adjusted for the DBP and
Government contribution to the components.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PRILIPPINES THIRD LIVESTOCK DEVEWPMENT/
FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT (IDAN NO. 1894-PH)
I. DNIRODUCTION
A. BACKGROUND
1.01   The World Bank (WB) granted the Government of the Philippines
(GOP) four (4) credit lines for the development of its
livestock and fisheries industries. These loans were the
Livestock Development Projects I (Loan No. 823-PH) and II
(Loan No. 1225-PB) and Fisheries Credit Projects I (Loan No.
891-PH) and II (Loan No. 1270-PH).
1.02   The Third Livestock Development/Fisheries Credit Project
(Loan No. 1894-PH) was the outcome of the request of
Philippine Government for assistance to the Development Bank
of tne Philippines (DBP) to finance the promotion of
livestock and fisheries development in the country. It was
designed to support over a period of three years the
Government's policy of increasing the animal protein supply
through the provision of medium- and long-term credit to tne
livestock and fisheries sub-sctors (Part A). At the same
time provisions for strengthening planning and implemen-
.tation of the Project, as well as of other projects, were
included for the two subsectors' specialized agencies within
-the Government, namely, the Bureau of Animal Industry or AI,
Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources or BFAR, and
Fishery Industry Development Council or FIDC; and DBP (Part
B).
1.03   This completion report evaluates the results of the implemen-
tation of the Project, highlighting Part A.
B. IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION
1.04   Ix mid-1978, while Loan Nos. 1225-PH and 1270-PH were still
under implementation, a proposal for additional financial
-.    assistance from WB for further development of the livestock
and fishery industry was prepared by the Development Bank
of the Philippines with the assistance of a task force com-
posed of representatives- from the following government agen-
cies:
a.  Livestock Development Council (LDC)
b. Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI)
c. Ministry of Natural Resources (MRR)
d.  Fishery Industry Development Council (FIDC)
e. Bureau of Forest Development (BFD)
f. Philippine Fisheries Marketing Authority (PFHA)

Re: Phil. 3rd IDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
In October-November 1978 an FAO/WB Cooperative Program
Mission visited the Poilippines to assist the Government in
identifying livestock and fisheries projects suitable for WB
financing. The mission was comprised of P.R. Crossing, C.M.
Giles, P.J. Pryke, T. Vessel Dase and E. Oswald.
1.05   Another mission composed of P.R. Crossing, J. Fyson, C.
Giles, P. Wilson, P. Pryke, and J. Maynard in March-April
1979 helped in the preparation of the credit line aspects of
the proposed Project.
The proposal was revised in line with the concept of WB that
the Project would be the first in a series of project pre-
parations for broader lending programs for agriculture. As
finalized, the Project broadened the scope for lending and
provided for intensified institutional and infrastructural
development. Moreover, it required closer and more formal-
ized involvement of the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry
of Natural Resources in the establishment of DBP's overall
agricultural lending priorities and regional agricultural
lending program.
C. APPRAISAL, NEGOTIATION, AND APPROVAL
1.06   The Project was appraised in August-September 1979 by a WB
team headed by Mr. J. Gregor with the assistance of Messrs.
B. Berman, S. Dase, L. Sprague, and T. Yip. The final review
of the Project's economic aspects was conducted by Mr. G.
Ablasser of WB. The WB team was assisted by a team of
Consultants, namely, Messrs. R Ayre-Smith, G Irvin, K. Neils
and P. Wilson.
1.07  A delegation from the GOP composed of J.V.  de Ocampo,
M. M.Songco, L.G. Cabling, A. J. Arquenza, M. del Rosario,
Z. Santos, D. Trinidad, P. Tan and D. Tadeo negotiated with
the World Bank panel in June 1980 for the Project. During
the negotiation the Philippine Delegation requested IBRD to
increase the loan from US $ 45 Million to US $ 60 Million to
cover approximately 501 of total project cost (excluding
sub-borrower equity). However, the World Bank was unable
to grant the request because of resource constraints. In
view of this, the GOP agreed to provide DBP part of the pro-
ceeds of the Yen Bond 8eries No. 1 Issue an equivalent amount
of US $ 15 Million to constitute part of the foreign
financing for the project.
1.08   The wan Agreement between GOP and WB for the Project was
signed on 4 August 1980 and became effective on 5 November
1980. The Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOP and DBP was
executed on 10 October 1980. The target closing date of
withdrawal from the IBRD loan was 30 June 1984.

D. PROJECT AT APPRAISAL
1.09   Of the Total Project Cost, US $ 45 M was proposed for WB
assistance to finance the following:
(a) 372 of total sub-loans;
(b) 1002 of foreign expenditures for equipment, vehicles and
materials, consultancy; and
(c) 501 of local procurements.
Of the IBRD loan, US $ 42.220 M was earmarked as a subsidiary
loan for agricultural credit (Part A) and technical
assistance (portions of Part B) to be administered by DBP.
The balance of US $ 2.78 M was allocated for the sub-projects
of SAI and BFAR/FIDC under the Project.
1.10. The Subsidiary Loan Agreement empowered DBP to administer
US $ 42.22 M for the following purposes:

Re: Phil. 3rd lDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
E     PROCUREMENT
1.11 Consistent with WB guidelines and/or Government procedures,
procurement criteria for the Project follow:
a   International competitive bidding for fishing vessels
constructed from material other than wood and any single
item of equipment estimated to cost more than 7300,000
under Part A;
b   International competitive bidding for cattle breeding stock
on quotations from at least three countries accredited by
Government and WS as free from hoof-and-mouth disease under
Part B;
c    International/domestic competitive bidding for vehicles
and materials under Part B; and
d    International prudent shopping for pasture and legume seeds
under Part B.
P.   IPLEME!TING AGENCIES
1.12 The DBP implemented Part A within the scope of the following
activities:
a    Small and medium-scale production of pigs and other small
livestock;
b    Expansion of the national cattle herd through development
of cattle breeding in pasture and transfer of young stock
to the village for fattening and/or breeding;
c    Construction and equipping of fishing vessels to supply
both domestic and export markets;
t    Rehabilitation and expansion of inland fishponds, and
establishment of fishpond estates; and
a    Other sub-projects in both sub-sectors identified during the
course of the Project period.
1.13  Under Part B, technical assistance to DBP was realized through
the following activities:
a    Conduct of a study on provincial feedmills;
b    Conduct of a study on the viability of fishpond projects
in Samar and Leyte;
c    Establishment of a Management information System;



Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-Pi)
d    Establishment of a Monitoring and Evaluation System; and
e    Formulation of an agriculture staff training program.
1.14  The participating Government agencies were to implement the
following programs under Part 8 of the Project:
a    Sectoral Development Program, Cattle (SAI)
i     Cattle Dispersal Program
ii    Breed stock Upgrading
b    Other SAI Programs
i     Small Livestock Nutrition Research
ii    Pasture and Legume Seed Production
iii   Cattle Markets
c    FIDC and BFAR Programs
i - Fishing Gear Technology and other studies
ii    Review of Marine Regulations
G.   LENDING TERMS
1.15 The common repayment period for the WB loan and the subsidiary
loan spans 20 years (including 5 years grace), during which
semi-annual amortizations are made by GOP to WB. Repayments
include the following:
a    Interest oan the loan at 8.252 per annum on the principel
amount of the loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to
time;
b    Principal amount of the loan, starting 15 February 1986 and
ending 15 August 2000; and
c    Comituent charges at the rate of 3/4 of 1  oan the prin-
cipal amount of the loan not withdrawn from time to time.
R.  BNSEFITS, JUSTIPICATION, AD RISKS
1.16  Based on an indicative lending program, the composite economic
rate of return was tentatively calculated by the WB at 282. The
alternative use of an indicative lending program was prompted by
uncertainty in the final mix of sub-projects to be financed as
DBP was granted flexibility in its lending program.



-6-
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP. (Loan No. 1894-PU)
The realization of returns on the project further implied the
need for DBP to:
a.    continue to apply stringent appraisal criteria;
b.    strengthen its analytical capability in the economic field;
and
C.    take into account in its lending policies weasures to
counter risks against high cost of feeds and/or availabi-
lity of feeds for the livestock sub-sector.
1.17  The involvement of various government agencies in the formulation
of lending programs for the Project was expected to minimize the
risk of inadequate coordination that may arise among the
interactors.
1.18  Another risk foreseen for the Project was the narrowing profit
margin for small and medium-scale enterprises because of the
price ceilings imposed by the government on certain product
prices.

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
II. D4PIEMENTATION
A.   START-UP
2.01   The agricultural credit component of the subsidiary loan
was implemented upon completion of the Annual Lending
Program (ALP) for September to Decembe- 1980 and Calendar
Year 1981. Nevertheless, retroactive financing under the
project startqd with approved sub-loans that could-no
longer be accomodated in LDP II and FCP IT but had been
scheduled for first release on or after 4 August 1980.
Tha ALP had been a pre-implementation condition set by both
;.greements for DBP to detail the broad scope of the project
and provide a prescribed lending program in terms of sub-
project categories. Its preparation involved consultations
among DSP, the participating agencies, Technical Board for
Agricultural Credit (TBAC) and National Economic and
Development Authotiry (NEDA).
2.02   Implementation was ordered temporarily suspended by the
World Bank (WB) in May 1983 amid reports on the merging of
the Philippine National Bank (PNB), Land Bank of the
Philippines (LBP) and DSP. Suspension was to last until
such time as the effect of the DBP reorganization could be
determined, as the proposed merger had been envisioned as a
Government reform for the financial system during the
nationwide economic crisis.
Nevertheless, even after the suspension of implementation,
DBP continued releasing funds to sub-projects already
approved as of May 1963. Releases to these sub-projects
vere reimbursed by the World Bank in accordance with the
Loan Agreement.
The suspension created a shortage of loan fund for
livestock and fisheries sectors.
2.03   Financial constraints led the Development Bank of the
Pbilippines to sake representation with the Minister of
Finance and Prime Minister of the Philippines to request
IBRD the cancellation of the unavailed balance of the
credit line.  IBiD approv,d&the eancellation of US $20.44 M
on 17 October 1984.



le: Phil. 3rd LDPIFCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
L.04  TIplementation of LDP/FCP ttt was covered by a special
financing program approved by the DBP Board of Governors
under Board tesolutioa No. 2591 dated 9 July 1980.
Tnvolved in implementation were 48 branches, and 7 compact
branches, the Agricultural loans Department (ALD) and the
Agricultural Supervision Department (ASD). Of the total
number of branches and compact branches that implemented
the agricultural credit program, 20 are in Luzon; 15 in thie
Visyas, and 20 in Miodanao.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DBP
2.05   Implementation of the Son-credit Component was delayed from
the start-up date of 1 January 1981. The earliest program
to be implemented was the agriculture staff training of !BP
in mid-1981. Delays for DBP were due to loog processes
involved in negotiations with consultancy firms.
2.06   A consultancy firm, Technosphere, was engaged by DBP to
conduct a study promoting feedmill construction and opera-
tion in rural areas. The contract between DBP and
Technosphere was signed on 26 may 1982, enforced until
December 1982, and renewed for another three (3) months
ending in Mfarch 1983. Because of additional research
required by DBP, however, the study was completed only in
1985.
2.07   Tne study on the viability of fishpond projects in Samar
and Leyte was undertaken to determine the issues and
problems confronting the fishpond industry in those pro-
vinces. It was conducted by DBP jointly with.-the Technical
Board for Agricultural Credit (TBAC) ind the now defunct
Fishery Industry Development Council (FIDC) in February to
September 1983.
2.08   Consultancy services for the development of agriculture
staff training program and training of in-house trainors
were provided by-the Canada-based firm CEGIR, INTER SA
contracted for the purpose by DSP in December 1980 through
the  anpower Development Center (later Development Banking
Institute, now Department of Manpower Development).
.  .   ;'.*-   Formulation of the program and implementation of pilot
trainings were undertaken in mid-1981 and 1982 bj the firm
jointly with DBP. lbe program and trainings since then
have been integrated into the regular operations of DBP.

Re:  Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
2.09   Establishment of a Management liformation System (MIS)
under the Project was realized in the operationalization of
the DBP Data Center Inc. (DCI) in 1983. The sub-projects
implemented by DCI included the following:
a.  Computer Hardware and Software System. TLe Project
financed the acquisition/development of computer hard-
ware  to expmid the Uaited capacity- of facilities
existing in 1982.  As implemented, this sub-project
enabled the replacement of the existing IBN S/360 with
an IBM 4361 and the purchase of additional tapes and
disk drives and eight nits of IBM S/34 mi4icomputers
installed moatly in the Branches.
T- support the implementation of the MIS the Data Base
Management System and the NSA General Ledger System
were acquired while the Loan Management System was
developed in-house.
b.  Data Base Management System (DBMS). ADABAS was acquired
for the Loan Management System (LMS) to facilitate
efficient storage and retrieval of loan information to
support day-to-day lending operations of Head Office.
The IMS was expected to be implemented in the third
quarter of 1986.  On the other hand, two other systems
using ADABAS are now being implemented to support
general administrative services. These systems are,
namely, (1) DBP Personnel Information System; and (2)
DBP Equipment, Furniture, and Fixtures Inventory System.
c. MSA General Ledgar System (MSA/GLS). The system was
intended for reducing to minimum level the problems
previously inherent in the manual system.
d.  SGV Consultancy.  The Sycip, GorTes and Velayo
Consultancy Group (SGV) provided the initial design on
which the development of the LX1 by the D8P Data Center
was based.
Total disbursements procure4 for the MIS has been esti-
mated at US $1.5 Million, including costs of consultancy,
equipment, software and peripheral, as of 30 June i986.
v.2,10   A farm-level Monitoring and Evaluation System (MES) for
LDP/FCP III was established by the Agricultural Supervision
Department (ASD) in 1984 using DBP funds. The IBRD loan
for this purpose was utilized for the partial procurement
of computer hardware for the MIS.



-10-
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
The MES had been conceived as a systematically organized
information and monitoring network with the capacity to
assist Project Management in the following:
a. Supervising Project implementation;
b. Taking corrective action, as need arises;
c. Reacting to unanticipated consequences; and
d. Planning future projects.
It constitutes continuous reporting, recording, and analy-
sis of predesigned Key wAnagement Indicators for randomly
selected sample sub-loat*s with farm records as data collec-
tion instrument. Data processing and analysis, and report
preparation are centralized at ASD.
The MES covers a pilot area comprising the jurisdiction of
AID and six branches, namely, Dagupan, Cabanatuan, Masbate,
Roxas, Bacolod and Butuan. Coverage will be expanded and
operations, decentralized as soon as experience in the
system can sufficiently provide the basis for operating
guidelines in the Branches.
BAI AND BPAR/FIDC PROGRAMS
2.11   Most of the programs of the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAT)
were started in the fourth quarter of 1983 while those of
the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
(BFAR)/Fishery Industry Development Council (FIDC) nave
not been started. The drawbacks in implementation of
programs were difficulty of GOP in raising cbunterpart
funds, abolition of agency (viz, FIDC) and/or delay in
releasing funds. So as not to disrupt Project implemen-
tation the closing date for Part B was initially extended
from 30 June 1984 to 30 June 1985 and finally to 31
December 1986.
2.12   With the abolition of  FIDC, implementation of the hi4tery
studies under technical assistance from the Project was
assumed by the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and
good. The Ministry instituted changes that entailed
compliance with certain official requirements which was not
yet completed as closing date of the Project neared.
Revisions included the expansion of the study, Review of
Marine Resource and Technology Evaluation, cancellation of
the Study on Fishery Regulations, and reallocation of funds
for the latter study to the former. As of May 1986 govern-
ment counterpart funds have not yet been released nor has
the consultancy contract been signed between MAP and
International Center for Living Aquatic Resources
Management (ICLARM).

program. Under the project a total of 1,690 head has been
dispersed, representing 802 of target as of 31 December
1985. The rest were either ready for distribution or under
negotations for delivery.
2.14   Tbe program for breed stock upgrading involved importation
of purebred cattle stock to improve BAI's existing herd at
the Bureau's dairy farm in Sorsogon. From June 1984 to
December 1985, the Project enabled importation of 130 nead
of Sahiwal Friesian pregnant heifers and production of 112
yearlings, 58 heifers, 54 bulls and 60 calves.
2.15   The objective of BAI's research program on small livestock
nutrition was to bring down cost of livestock and poultry
production by utilizing the more abundant and non-
conventional feedstuffs available in the country. The
following sub-projects were undertaken by BAI under the
Project:
a. Duck nutrition and research using energy and protein
source for meat and egg production in the Philippines;
b. leaf protein concentrate as a source of protein for
poultry feeding;
c. Nutritive evaluation of cassava leaf meal (CLN) for
poultry feeding;
d. Utilization of Azolla for swine and poultry feeding;
e. Utilization of biogas sludge for swine and poultry; and
f. Goat feeding and feeding anagement.
2.16   The objective of the pasture and legume seed production and
dispersal program was to increase beef production through
development of existing pasture resources.  Assistance from
the Project enabled BAI to establish and equip a
.- g,    100-hectare pasture seed production farm, of which 501 has
been seeded as of 31 December 1985. A total of 2,630
.*' ' e^ X .s -^. ' ; ,.r440grams of -goot quality pasture seeds has been produced

2.17   The livestock 'auction" market development project was
aimed at improving the servicing of farmers and buyers by
providing centralixed marketing facilities which include
weighing scales, sheds, pens/corrals, etc. Through the
Project, EAI has provided 40 livestock markets in operation
with weighing scales; dccredited 93 livestock auction
markets; and identified 62 livestock pooling places for
-      establishment and development.
B. *    AN AVAIUIENTS           -
2.18   Effective 4 April 1984 an Amendatory Agreement was enforced
reducing the amount of the subsidiary loan from US $42.220
million to US $42.193 million. The equivalent of US
$27,000 was utilized for a comprehensive study of the
livestock milling industry undertaken by the Asian
Institute of Management (AIM) for the ninistry of
Agriculture and Food. As a result the amount of the
unallocated loan proceeds was reduced from US $0.920 M to
US $0.893 M.
2.19   A second Amendatory Agreement executed on 25 October 1985
finally established the amount of the subsidiary loan at US
$21.76 M.
This amount comprised actual availments, brokendown as
follows:
a.' US S19.559 M for the on-lending program;
b.  US $2.193 M for consultancy services; and
c. US $0.005 M for the unallocated portion.
2.20   Of the total allocation of US $40.000 M for on-lending the
unavailed balance amounted to US $20.441 M, which was
approved by World Bank for cancellation. Actual availments
totalled US $19.559 14, additionally involving US $0.005 M
foreign exchange rate differentials re-classified
;       "Unallocated".
-.2.21 Actual availments for.consultancy services exceeded the
original allocation of US $1.150 M by US $1.043 M, which
excess was charged against original allocation for equip-
-.            wment, vehicles and materials (US $0.150 M) and the unallo-
cated portion (US $0.893 )0.
C.  SUPERVISION OF SUB-PROJECTS
2.22   As a standard operating procedure, supervision of sub-
projects is undertaken by DBP in two stages: the first,
during the sub-loan releasing period; and the second, after
full release of the sub-loan.



- 13 -
Be:  Pbil. 3rd LDP/FCP (loan No. 1894-PH)
Supervision during the sub-loan releasing period involves
assessment by DBP of the progress of sub-project implemen-
tation by the sub-borrower to determine when the subsequent
disbursement will be made. The first-stage supervision
*     also ensures that a sub-loan relesse is utilized for the
- t  't ^ approved purposes as possible deviations are imediately
prevented/corrected.  Post-disbursement supervision is
usually conducted 30 days after the final sub-loan release
provided necessary manpower is available.  The second-stage
supervision looks into the completion of the sub-project,
t'  *4 i<'-   * ' uccess potential of the sub-project in future operations,
and other conditions.
D.   REVISIONS
2.23   During Project implementation there was a continuing
increase in the price of imported feedgrains, so use of
locally grown corn was promoted. Priority for financial
assistance was given to piggery and poultry sub-projects
located in the corn-producing areas. Project sites had
previously been concentrated within 100-km radius from
major consumption centers.
2.24   High feed costs discouraged small commercial producers from
participating in the Project, although the aim was to
reach this segment. As a result, financing was re-
channelled to the expansion of medium and large scale
piggery and poultry enterprises.
During Project preparation, one of the objectives was the
redirection of assistance to backyard/small commercial pro-
ducers, which would be achieved by addressing this group
differently from large-scale commercial producers. Wbile
the former was to be given credit and market access, the
latter was to be assisted through a more comprehensive
approach involving supplementary services. Recognizing the
imbalance that had persisted between the development of
livestock produc$ion and the feed sub-sector, the Project
would provide some. seed money for studies and related acci-
:*    vities.  Safeguards against risks brought about by high
feed costs were to be instituted by DBP in terms of lending
v~ >     policies.           -
'' '^ : Efforts of DSP to attract 'ackyerd/small cormercialprodu-
cers in the iaitial stage of Project implementation were
reflected in a'liberalized lending program, features of
which included the following:
a. Minimal equity participation;
b. Nonrestrictive collateral appraisal; and
c. Low interest rates.

Ba: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (loan No. 1894-PH)
2.25   In 1981-32, effective demand for pork and poultry meat was
net thereby slowing down loan availments for piggery and
broiler production. abis made it possible to finance a
greater number of village cattle fattening sub-projects
than expected. However, most of these sub-projects have
shifted to cattle breeding because of shortage of feeder
stock.
2.26   Financing of broiler sub-projects had been de-emphasized in
the Project because of the monopolies on production inputs
by integrators. Nevertheless, 343 broiler producers sought
financinal assistance under the Project and among them was
a uizeable number of cont'ract growers.
2.27   The polyculture of milkfish with prawns and the alternating
production of milkfish and solar salt were encouraged under
the Project to improve viability of fishpond operations.
2.28 During the implementation of the Project, DBP made repre-
sentation with the Ministry of Finance to reouest World
Bank for certain revisions in the Loan Agreement. Among
the significant requests approved by the World Bank are:
a.  Submission of audited financial statement covering the
final year of disbursement only;
b.  Financing the computerization of the DBP Management
Information System as well as the development of a Loan
Management System and Data Base Management System; and
c.  Beallocation of US$ 1.043 Million from 'ategory 2
(Equipment, Vehicles and Materials) and Category 5
(Unallocated) to-Category 4 (Consultant's Services).
S.   DMPLEMENTING SCHEDUIE
2.29   The bulk of the sub-projects financed was approved during
the initial year of Project implementation. Accounting
reports indicate that all the 767 fisheries sub-projects
and 771 of the 2,877 livestock sub-projects financed were
approved during this period (1980/81). More than 222 of
the total number of livestock sub-projects was approved in
1981/82 and less than 12 in 1982/83. (Table 5e)
The number of sub-projects financed in 1980/81 exceeded
the annual target set in the TBRD Indicative Program for
the Project by 751. The overage is attributed chiefly to
the accelerated assistance for cattle sub-projects. At the
end of the financing period, realization rates were 71S for
the project; 1222 for the livestock sub-sector; and 282 for
the fisheries sub-sector. (Table Sb)

Re- Phil. 3rd LDP/PCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
2.30   A preliminary analysis of implementing schedule in terms of
investments indicates annual lags between target and actual
draxwdown. However, this trend should be 'tributed to an
understatement in actual investment. The figure for a
given year is a composite of partial sub-loan releases
for different sub-projects approved within the year or sub-
sequent sub-loan releases for sub-projects approved during
previous years. On the other hand, yearly target invest-
-uents constitute total project costs for a given year.
These constraints should be observed in using the data pre-
sented in Table Nos. 5, Sc and 5d.
F.   REPORTING
2.30   Separate accounts and records for the Project were
established and maintained by DBP in accordance with
generally accepted and sound accounting procedures.
Reporting was strengtlhened with the installation of an MSA
General Ledger System as part of the development of a bank-
wide MIS under the Project.
G *  PROCUREMENT
2.31   The items procured for the Project were few in number and
diverse in nature and could not be bulked to attract inter-
national bidding. Procurement for farm development was,
therefore, made by farmers through local suppliers.
Commercial outlets were adequate for the main inputs such
as construction materials, feeds, medicines, vaccines, and
fishing gears.
2.32   Computer hardware purchased directly with IBRD funds was
procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB).
On the other hand, computer facilities initially procured
with DBP funds but re-imbursed by World Bank were acquired
locally through negotiated purchase.
B.   COSTS
2.33   Total Project Cost vas US $140.656 sillion, of which 32% or
US S45 H would be re-imbursable from IBRD. Fifty-seven per-
cent (57Z) or US $80.531 H would be financed by DSP and 112
or US $15.125 M, by sub-boirowers' counterpart funds.
As a result of the suspension of the Credit Component in
May 1983 and the subsequent cancellation of thte unavailed
balance of the IBRD loan, Total Project Cost decreased to
US $68.548 M. The IBRD loan was reduced to US $ 21.526 M;
DBP funds, US $33.312 M; and sub-borrowers' equity, US
$13.710 M. Percentage-wise, the average contribution of
assisted sub-projects ranged from 5S to 351 as A result of
DBP policy effective since 1981. On the other hand, the
shares of IBRD and DBP decreased to 31S and 40%,
respectively. (Table 4)

I.  FARM INVES1IENTS
2.34   The number of sub-projects financed totalled 3,644, of
which 791 or 2,877 were for livestock development; and 212
or 767, fisheries development. As a result of mid-course
revision, assisted livestock development sub-projects were
predominantly beef cattle. This sub-project type accounted
for 46t or 1,325 of the total number of livestock sub-
loans. Of the total number of fisheries sub-projects
assisted 911 or 698 were fishpoands. (Table 5)
2.35   The total amount of loans approved was about Y531.5 M, of
which 69X or P366.1 M financed livestock developent sub-
projects; and 31Z or 7165.4 M, fisheries development sub-
projects. Because of higher investment cost, piggery
sub-projects shared 542 of total amount of livestock/
poultry loans approved despite accounting for only 32%
of total number of sub-projects assisted. On the other
hand, beef cattle sub-projects utilized only 192 of total
amount of livestock/poultry loans approved. Fishpond sub-
projects contributed 891 of total amount of fisheries loans
approved as lending for fishing vessels was, otherwise,
delimited by increased construction costs. (Table 6)

Re: Phil 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PX)
III. PROJECT IMPACT
A.   INSTITUTIONAL
BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY (BAI)
3.01  In addition to expanding the national breeding stock base for
dairy cattle production, the cattle dispersal program supported
livelihood projects such as the Bakahang Barangay by augmenting
farmers' income from milk and calves sold.
3.02  The BAI stock farm in Sorsogon (Bicol Region) has been a source
of upgraded cattle breeders for the milkshed areas. It has
further developed into a demonstration and training cetter for
students and farmers in the Region and other parts of the
country.
3.03  Of six sub-projects comprising the research program of BAI for
small animal nutrition (Para. 2.15) four were completed and one
was still on-going as of January 1986. Two out of three studies
included in another sub-project could not be undertaken because of
the delay in processing of required documents for the purchase of
equipment for the production of leaf protein concentrates. The
substitute mechanical method of producing leafmeal concentrate
was tried but recovery was low and processing slow, hence the
studies were discontinued.
Three studies constituting the goat nutrition and feeding manage-
ment research are expected to be completed on 30 June 1986.
Delays were caused by biological/budgetary constraints and drawn
out processing of papers for the procurement of supplies,
materials and equipment.
3.04  Nevertheless, from the researches/studies undertaken by BAI,
conclusions are that cost of production of livestock and poultry
can be reduced with the use of non-conventional feedstuffs which
are locally abundant, without adversely affecting growthi,
meat/egg production, and mortality. The Project-funded studies
have provided 8AI with new technological packages for further
adoption by the livestock and poultry sub-sectors.
3.05  The targets for Project assistance to the pasture legume seed
production of BAI were not fully attained because of delays in
the release of counterpart funds and in the purchase/delivery of
equipment. Nevertheless, the Bureau was able to minimize depen-
dence an imported seeds for distribution to farmers. Moreover,
the experience developed the expertise of technical staff involved
in the Project and strengthened BAI's capability   to meet the
seed requirements of its cooperators. Newly gained expertise
enabled modification of pasture legume seed production/dispersal
technology then existing to suit local conditions. Finally,
farmer cooperators' awareness of the value of pasture develcp-
ment in improving animal productivity was increased.

3.06 Significant advances made by BAI in tee past in developing live-
stock auction markets were heightened by the Bureau's accomplish-
ment under the Project.
DKEVWPPMENT &*1K OF TIE PRILIPPINES (DBP)
3.07 The Project supplemented DBP resources for on-lending to the
livestock/poultry and fisheries sub-sectors in the equivalent
-amount of US $33.32 million with US $ 19.565 million. In addi-
tion the equivalent amount of US $15 from the proceeds of the Yen
Bond Series No. 1 Issue was made available to DBP by GOP. The
additional funds would have fixed the share of total foreign
financing at 50Z of total project cost (excluding sub-borrowers'
equity) had the proceeds been allocated for on-lending. The
scheme had been intended as an alternative to the arrangement
requested by GOP during negotiations for World Bank to increase
the loan from US$45 M to US$60 N for the same purpose but which
the latter could not grant due to resources constraints.
Inasmuch as funds from the Yen Bond Flotation were utilized for
other purposes by DBP, the amount of foreign exchange financing
for the Project remained at 36Z of total project cost (excluding
sub-borrower's equity), which was IBRD's counterpart.
3.08 A self-assessment made by the DBP Data Center, Inc. (DCI) on
the implementation of the integrated computer-based Management
Information System (MIS) and the acquisition of better hardware
and software attributed the following impacts to this Project
sub-component:
a.  The computerization efforts of DBP made substantial gains.
b. User satisfaction was improved due to the decrease in turn-
around time and error occurrence levels.
c. On-line systems catering to financial requiiements of DBP on a
nationwide scale gave management immediate access to current
infonmation necessary for decision-making.
Out of the implementation of the NSA General Ledger System, the
Kfollowing becefits have been realixed:
A.  A reduction in the manpower requirement from 10 to 4;
b. Reduction in the time to complete financial reports from 2-3
months to one week after end-of-month; and
c. Up-to-date posting of daily transactions.

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP,FCP (Loan No. 1894-PR)
3.09 Feedback information from 14 DBP user departments showed the
following results:
a. Immediate access to current information has generally been
confirmed.
b.  Seven user departments reported improved quality, accessibi-
lity and timeliness of data as a result of the computeri-
cation.
c. Satisfaction has been indicated by users of the General
Ledger System, a packaged system.
d. Twelve user departments reported that errors still occur in
their computerized systems. These are primarily due to
program bugs, input errors, specification errors and changes
in specification, particularly DBP lending policies. These
errors are presently being addressed by DDCI.
e. Ten user departments complained of increased costs due to the
computerization effort. This could be explained by the fact
that most systems developed by DDCI are either:
(1) Still in the conversion stage wherein expenses accumulate
while no benefits are yet realized;
(2) Or, within the payback period wherein the
benefits/savings being experienced are still paying off
the original investment.
f. Indications show that systems developed in-house are not yet
efficient. Most systems are still in the stabilization
period wherein remaining system bugs are attended to and
errors in masterfile data which were erroneously converted
are corrected. Users and DC operations are also monitored by
DC during this period to ensure conformance to predefined
system operating and control procedures.
It is expected that these systems will be fully efficient
after this period when operations have stabilized with
respect to the computerized environment.
g. There vere a few occasions when systems were discontinued
before full implemaentation. An example is the ASD Reporting
System which was discontinued due to the followiug reasons:
(1) Significant reduction in the number of World Bank reports
required from 200 to 56.  The system was, therefore, too
costly to operate for the benefit of the remaining
reports.



- 20-
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
(2) Too much time covered to convert from manual to com-
puterized files (6 months per quarter) since data from
branches are usually delayed or invalid.
(3) Time/cost savings were not realized, instead expenses
accumulated due to the errors during conversion period.
(4) Errors were noted on worksheets, listings and statistical
reports. These errors were attended to by DC upon notice
from ASD. However, too much time was spent correcting
these errors such that final reports outdated their use-
fulness to the end-users.
3.10    Rationalization of departmental responsibilities in the imple-
mentation of the credit component facilitated upgrading of tne
quality of loan appraisal standards and streamlining of loan
processing for faster results.
3.11    The Monitoring and Evaluation System (MES) required by World
Bank to be established under LOP 11 by the defunct Agricultural
Plans and Programs Staff (APPS) was finally realized under
LDP/FCP III with tbe transfer to ASD of certain functions of
the Agriplan Unit. In May 19S3 ASD was reorganized with the
transfer of the following functions from the Agriplan Unit to
the former:
a. Monitoring and evaluation of ADB/WB-assisted agricultural
programs, including the undertaking of project completion
reports;
b. Preparation and periodic review and evaluation of the
Annual lending Program (ALP) of Read Office and Branches
for the agricultural sector; and
c. Preparation of program proposals to World Bank for the
financing of the agricultural sector.
Since its operation in 1984, the MES has provided the basis for
courses of action to alleviate distressed conditions of sample
sub-projects.  The MES has generated current data on business
activities of various types of livestock, poultry and fisheries
sub-projects on which the models used in this PCR had been
built on.  These models will eventually be the bases for
updating technical and financial parameters in future lending.
Also, the MES staff assisted in the collection drive of DBP.
Finally, the exercise has provided ASD with the capability in
project monitoring and evaluation and the basis for
establishing a similar system for the ADB/OPEC-Assisted Laguna
de Bay Fishpen Development Project.

Re: PhiD. 3rd LDP/PCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
3.12    Hiring of consultants' services (Para. 2.08) further enhanced
the institutional capability of DBP in handling development
investments, particularly in the field of agriculture. For
one, a tra.ning program on basic livestock, crop and fisheries
production and marketing was designed and implemented to
improve technical competence of Branch personnel who did not
hive formal education in agriculture but were nevertheless
involved in the evaluation and supervision of various agri-
cultural projects. Also, a group of agricultural staff of DSP
underwent special training/workshops to improve their knowledge
and skills to be effective trainors. They were given adequate
inputs to broaden their perspective in their respective areas
of specialization within the framework of development
financing.
3.13    Seminars/workshops conducted under the training program from
19$1 to 1984 were participated in by technical staff of DBP
Head Office and Branches and seven private development banks.
Tne largest participation was drawn by training courses in pro-
j,'ct evaluation and supervision. About 32% of the 1,100 par-
ticipants who attended the training program during the
four-year period was trained in this field. Ranking second was
training in financial analysis which accounted for 28%; ttiird,
livestock-crop-fisheries systems, 152 and the rest or 252, com-
puterization for MIS,. basic accounting, and economic analysis.
3.14    The research study, "Viability of the Fishpond Industry in
Samar and Leyte", provided the basis for formulating Guidelines
for Evaluating Fishpond Projects. Tne guidelines have been
adopted by DBP since 1983 in the rehabilitation/restructuring
of distressed accounts.
3.15    Tne study on the promotion of regional feedmills provided DBP
with clearer insights into and better undertaking of the
problems besetting the hog and poultry industries. It pointed
out direct relationship of the livestock sector with the feed-
mill industry where the success of one depended much on the
other. Moreover, the study recognized that in the selection of
. feedmill sites, the financial viability of the bog and poultry
farms has to take precedence. Ekxistence of a wall-established
seaport in a region and a surplus production of yellow corn
were likewise cited as two important considerations in the
selection of feedmill sites.
That the financial viability of a 16-ton capacity feedmill
requires that it be tied up to at least a 500-sow hog farm was
in itself a recognition of the difficulty in catering mainly to
the independent small producers no matter how numerous the hogs
may be. By implications, the study would seem to emphasize the
importance of having some forms of cooperative association
among small producers so that they may be able to integrate
feedmilling in their livestock operations.

3.16    Through the credit component, DBP financed the acquisition of
2.1 million animal/poultry stock and the development/improve-
ment of 5,000 hectares of fishpond. It also assisted the
establishment of saltbeds and construction of fishing vessels,
"lambaklad", and support facilities such as slaughterhouses,
ice plants end slipways. (Table 5e)
3.17    Indications are that project output for 1980 to 1985 contri-

and annually fed a number of consumers:

3.18    Assuming that the six-year average national product.on for
these commodities is sustained in 1986 and onwards, share of
Project output is likely to increase since by then all the
assisted sub-project would be fully productive, as shown by the
figures above (Para. 3.17). Wor Project commodities whose pro-
duction started levelling off in 1983, i.e., marine, solar salt
and ice, shares to national production would likely be main-
tained in 1986 and thereafter.
3.19    It is estimated that at full development, the assisted
livestock and poultry sub-projects would supply the country
annually with about 28,359 metric tons of meat; 60.5 million
*  . .pieces of chicken and duck eggs and almost 293,500 liters of
.*cow and goat milk. (Table 14)
On the otber-hand, primary output from the assisted fisheries
sub-projects includes 34,600 metric tons of marine/commercial
fish and 7,500 metric tons of milkfish annually. Production
of secondary fishpond products is estimated at 141 MT of
prawns, tilapia and siganids and 3,630 MT of solar salt yearly.
Ice would be produced at the rate of 12,640 MT every year.
(Table 14)

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-Pi)
3.20    Actual volume of production would be below appraisal target
because the number of participants is less than expected as
DBP suspended the acceptance of loan applications in August
1982 or about one and one-half years before closing date.
Nevertheless, value of production is expected to be high
-   because of increases in the price of output.
3.21    Deviations in the nature of output as a result of shiftings to
related operations have proven to be beneficial to sub-
borrowers. The production of solar salt, prawns, tilapia or
siganids as secondary fishpond crops has provided additional
income to operators. This also applies to the conversion of
cattle fattening to cattle breeding operations; and commercial
broiler raising to the contract growing scheme of broiler
production.
3.22    Based on actual financed level of operations, the credit
program provided employment for approximately 4,100 workers.
This represents 53S of the appraisal estimate of 7,727 man-
years, at 300 working days per year at appraisal. (Table 15)

Re: Phil. 3rd IDP/PCP (Loan No. 1894-PR)
IV. RATES OW RETURNS
4.01    Data for updating costs/prices and technical parameters of
selected appraisal models were generated through the Monitoring
and Evaluation System (HES) of ASD. More importantly, the MES
baS provided current data for establishing new models for'
fisheries sub-projects that evolved during Project implemen-
tation. Sources of data were farm records accomplished monthly
by 52 sample sub-borrowers in a pilot area comprising the
jurisdictions of six Branches and the Agricultural Loans
Department (AID). Timeframe covered a 12-month period spanning
Calendar Years 1984 and 1985. From these base data, rates of
returns were calculated. (Table 16)
A.   LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY
4.02    Of four (4) appraisal models so updated, indications are that
only the piggery sub-project (increasing sow level from 5 to 20
head) has slightly increased in IRR. This is attributed to
sustained satisfactory technical performance resulting from
improved management practices adopted in operations.
4.03    On the other hand, high expectations from cattle sub-projects
have not materialized particularly for village cattle produc-
tion under the "paiwi" scheme. In practice, a sub-borrower or
owner of the breeder stock does not realize sales revenues from
milk produced as these accrue to the caretakers-cooperators.
Among others, such deviation from the prescribed sharing
arrangement of 50-50 on calves and milk produced has con-
siderably reduced IRR to the owner from 52% to 14.3%. Rates of
return for the sub-project type are shown in Table 16c.
4.04    With an IRR of 592 and ERR of 61.9%, broiler production through
contract growing has proven to be more technically feasible and
financially viable than commercial broiler production by inde-
pendent growers. Financing of contract growers was an innova-
tion adopted during Project implementation in which only
investments for fixed assets were provided by DBP. Working
capital was obtained by sub-borrowers from integrators.
4.05    The attraction of poultry broiler contract growing lies in the
provision of inputs and production incentives by integrators to
growers.  Tn this scheme, the former supplies the latter with
day-old chicks, feeds, and other inputs to raise broilers
averaging 1.3 kilograms liveweight. Finished broilers are
bought back by integrators at a guaranteed payment of 71.50 per
bird weighing an average of 1.3 kilograms.



- 25 -
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. l894-P?)
Buying price is computed at 19.50 per kilogram for every unit
liveweight in excess of the initial 1.3 kilograms. Inputs
required for additional weight gain are provided by the
growers.
Finisied broilers produced'by assisted contract growers average
1.6 kilograms liveweight.
4.06    Indications are that performances of the different types of
livestock sub-projects have been adversely affected by
increased capital investments and operating capital, especially
costs of feeds and feed ingredients. Compounding this problem
is the control of livestock product prices by integrators
and/or major producers. Slow increases in sales revenues have
been exhibited by layer, hillbeef and broiler (commercial) sub-
projects.
Nevertheless, efforts were exerted by some sub-borrowers to
reduce costs by substituting imported feeds and feed ingre-
dients with locally grown raw materials.
4.07    In general, the livestock/poultry sub-projects under LDP/FCP
III are very sensitive to a l0S decrease in selling price more
than to an equal percentage increase in cost of inputs.
However' except for backyard piggery, these are within accep-
table ratios. Backyard piggery sub-projects are very sensitive
to price and cost changes because of high dependency on grains
and by-products, which are expensive.
B.   FISHERIES
4.08    The flexibility in financing allowed by IBRD under LDP/FCP III
enhanced the development of six other fishpond models in addi-
tion to the four appraisal models.  Fishpond sub-projects tra-
ditionally assisted through the past credit lines were
represented by 15-hectare models either for new construction,
major reconstruction, partial reconstruction. or minor
rehabilitation. -
4.09    The models recently developed included the (a) monoculture of
milkfish on an expanded area of 25 hectares; (b) polyculture of
: ilkfish with prawns; and (c) combination of fishpond and
saltbed operations. These sub-projects were assisted either
for new construction or expansion.
4.10    Of the traditional fishpond sub-projects financed, indications
are that existing fishponds assisted for minor rehabilitation
have the highest IRR And ERR. Except for new construction
fishpond sub-projects, the three others have higher TRR/ERR at
current costs and prices.



-26-
Re: Phil. 3rd IDPIFCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
4.11    Of the new models, existing fishponds had higher IRR/ERR than
those of the newly established ones. Among the six models,
existing polyculture fishponds had the highest IRR (44Z) and
fishponds that produced milkfish and solar salt, the highest
ERR (732). (Table 16)
4.12    As mentioned in para. 2.27, adoption of the milkfish-prawn or
ailkfish-salt combination was a measure to improve viability of
fishpond operations. These cultural practices had been found
to be more technically feasible and financially viable than
m- mocultore, especially7for newly established sub-projects.
4.13    The Project envisioned to finance purse seiners in line with
improvement in fishing vessel technology. IRRa were appraised
at 281 for purse seiners with gross tonnages (GT) of 30; and
242 for 50 CT. ERRs were estimated to decrease conversely with
increase in fishing vessel capacity.
During Project implementation, however, sub-projects financed
were trawlers of 35-GT and 45-GT capacities. At these volumes,
7RRa were 331 and 341, respectively; while the respective ERRs
were 412 and 392. The shift to sub-loan demand for trawlers
was attributed to lover investment cost as against that of
purse seiners. (Table 5c and 16h)
4.14    Two units of ice plants were financed under the Project.
Indication is that the 45-ton capacity ice plant operated more
viably ti.an the 5-ton. The former had IhR and ERR of 321 as
against the latter's IRR of 232 and ERR of 282.   (Table 16h)

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
V.     INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
A.   DSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND GROWTH
5.01    Supervision of the implementation of the Credit Component and
coordination with participating agencies for tbe implementation
of the Non-Credit Component were assumed by the Agricultural
Supervision Department (ASD). Togetber with the Agricultural
Loans Department (ALD)', ASD was organized in August 1980 from
the abolisbed Agricultural Projects Department I and II (APO I
and II). The reorganization was necessary to accelerate the
pace of DBP assistance to the national food production program.
(See PCR for Treefarming II dated February 1986).
B.   SUPPORTING SERVICES
5.02    Supporting services for the implementation of the credit
program continued to be provided by the Bureau of Animal
Industry (BAI) and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic
Resources (BFAR), which started with LDP II and EC? II. Under
memoranda of agreement formalizing the detail of BAI/BPAR
extension agents with DBP, terms of reference of the seconded
fieldmen were as follows:
a. Conduct regular sub-project visitations;
b. Assist proponents in drawing up simple recording
systems;
c. Assist in the formulation of balanced feed rations using
locally available feed ingredients: (BAI)
d. Set up animal and health sr..'Jtation programs: (BAI)
e. Assist in marketing of farm produce and procurement of
farm supplies;
f. Coordinate with other offices on related activities for
the promotion of an effective sub-project supervision
program; and
t}    g.  Render periodic reports to DBP on sub-projects being
supervised.
Collection of loans was additionally assigned to the
detailed BAI/BFAR technicians.

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PR)
5.03   Since 1981 a total of 45 fisheries specialists has been detailed
with 27 DBP Branches. These BFAR technicians served the Project
in varying lengths of time, ranging from one month to 38 montns
or an equivalent of 537 man-months. Within this period the
total number of Project beneficiaries assisted was 486.
In the extension of technical-;assistance under the Project, BFAR
fieldmen observed that adoption of techniques for increasing
. production was slow for first-time operators and that know-how
and skills of some sub-borrowers were inadequate.  These
situations necessitated the concentration of supervision efforts
in the following:
a.   Fishpond construction;
b.   Farm management;
c.   Repair and maintenance of dikes, water supply, gates and
drainage;
d.   Pond preparation, fertilization, supplementary feeding,
disease prevention, harvesting and maintaining fresihne,s of
fishpond products before and during marketine, and/or p.o-
cessing;
e.   Polyculture of bangus with other species like prawn, tila-
pia, crab and also salt-making; and
f.   Preparation of pond engineering designs and water supply
and drainage facilities.
5.04   In addition to dispensing technical assistance, the SFAR spe-
cialists also assisted in determining Project implementation
problems. Based on their findings, drawbacks in project opera-
tions included the following:
a.   Inadequate sub-loans for operating/vorking capital;
b.   Lack of funds to rehabilitate projects destroyed by
typhoons and floods (calamities);
-c.   Tncreased project costs due to inflation and peso deva-
luation; and
d.   Deteriorating peace and order conditions.
Cases of speculators/get-rich-quick operators or sub-borrowers
who did not have intentions of actually going into fisnfarming
have also been reported. However, it is believed that these
were not Project beneficiaries since DBP lending policies and
procedures would eliminate such speculators/operators.



- 29 -
Re:  Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-Pi)
5.05   A total of 22 livestock specialists from the Bureau of Animal
Industry has assisted 19 Branches.
5.06   Services of most of the extension agents were terminated because
of reduced Branch operations arising from suspension of
lending, cost reduction measures necessitated by DBP's financial
difficulties, and availability of DBP technical men whose ser-
vices were harnessed for supervision/collection since workload
for lending activities had been reduced. As of March 1986 there
ov * ---were oanly 11 detailed technicians left assisting 10 Branches.
5.07   Periodic evaluation conducted by ASD indicates that the
SAI/PAR technicians' support services have been satisfactory
to DBP and its clients.
C.   STAFF TRAINING
5.08   In preparation for their involvement in the implementation
of tDP/FCP III, as well as in prior projects, DBP technical.
staff attended trainings which started to intensify in
mid-1981. By then the Project-funded training program drawn
up by foreign consultants became operational.
D.   FARM CREDIT
5.09   Implementation of the Credit Component was covered by
separate special financing programs for livestock and
fisheries development. Priority in extending credit was for
additional loans for sub-projects previously financed by
DBP. Nevertheless, new sub-loans were also extended provided
that applicants showed proper aptitude and ability to carry
out the sub-project to completion.
Credit was provided for any or a combination of the
following general purposes:
a. Construction/renovation and development of fixed assets;
b. Installation/acquisition of machinery/equipment;
c. Procurement of foundation stock;
d. Operating capital and miscellaneous expenses;
e. Other purposes directly related to the sub-project.
5.10   Loan proceeds were released on a staggered basis following
the funding requirements at different stages of sub-project
development, as contained in the farm plan.
5.11   Collaterals included first mortgage on real estate property,
assignment of leasehold rights and or chattel on machinery/
equipment or durable assets.



- 30 -
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
5.12   Sub-loans vere payable from 5 years (for fishing projects
other than fishpond and fishing vessel) to 15 years (for
cattle projects). Payments were required in semi-annual
amortizations, except those for cattle sub-loans which were
due annually.
5.13   Grace period  varied from one year (for broiler projects)
to five years (for cattle project) during which only
interest on sub-loan was required to be paid.
E.   ACCOUNTING/REPORTING
5.14   The accounting system adopted for LDPIFCP III was the
Modified Cash Basis. In this system DBP recognises income
on loans and advances and all other incomes upon collection
while interest expenses and other financial charges on
borrowings from the National Government are treated on
accrual basis. All other expenses are recorded on cash
basis. At the end of each quarter or whenever necessary,
DBP prepares summaries and/or consolidated financial statements.
F.   FINANCIAL PERPORMANCE AND RETURNS
5.15   Bulk of the earnings of the Credit Component was derived from
regular interest/financial charges on sub-loans. Earnings from
this source averaged 65% of the total for 1960 to 1984.
However, in the first year of implementation the main source of
earnings was service and application fees which accounted for
78Z of total earnings for 1980. Reflecting the pace of imple-
mentation, the share of service and application fees drastically
fell to 25% in 1981 and to 3% in 1982.  (Table 7)
5.16   On the average, salaries and other personnel benefits comprised
44X of total earnings for 1980 to 1984. Expenses for this pur-
pose exceeded total earnings by 3% in 1980 but eventually
narrowed down to 14% of total earnings for 1984. Interesc on
bills payable shared an average of 36% of total earnings. This
expense item had been more or less maintained at same level from
1982 to 1984. (Table 7)
5.17   The first sub-projects assisted under the Credit Component were
- still within the grace period of sub-loan'repayment in 1980 and
1981, causing low earnings for the period. For the same period,
ezpenses were high because of accrued interest/financial charges
on amounts already vithdrawn from the World Bank; consultants'
fees charged against operations; and salaries/personnel bene-
fits. Net losses were incurred in 1980 and 1981 as a result but
these were overcome in 1982 to 1984.  (Table 7)



-31-
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
5.18   As deferred charges, coamitment iees charged on the unavailed
balance of the loan, when included in total expenses as cost of
funds. increased net losses in 1980 and 1981. Moreover, this
inclusion reduced net income from 1982 to 1984. Total ear-
nings, however, still outpaced growth rate in total expenses
even with the addition of deferred commitment fees. (Table 8)
5.19   The percentage share of total earnings in average investment
showed an uptrend from 112 in 1981 to 261 in 1984 attributed to
improvement in income generated from sources other than interesc
on sub-loans. On the other hand, administrative expenses
declined as a component of average investment from 12Z in 1981
to 62 in 1982 and levelled off at 51 in 1983 and 1984. Cost of
funds constituted 141 of average investment in 1981 and settled
down to 1OX from 1982 to 1984. These patterns resulted in a net
loss of 151 for average investment in 1981 and increasing net
income towards 1984. (Table 9)
5.20   For 1985 to 2000 it is projected that earnings (interest on sub-
loans) and expenses (bills payable) will undergo downtrend
directly proportionate to yearly reduction of IBRD funds with
DBP. Despite the declining trend, however, the Credit Component
will still te able to generate net income through the 15-year
period. Starting with 701 of total earnings in 1905, net income
will close with 322 in 2000. (Table 10)
G.   COST RECOVERY
5.21   As of 30 June 1985 outstanding loan balance amounted to F364,633
million, of which 34.81 was fisheries sub-loans and 65.21,
livestock sub-loans. (Table 11)
It is anticipated that reduction in total outstanding balance
will tend to increase from the initial 231 posted for 1965, as
indicated by the difference from total releases. The trend is
reflected in DBP's repayment scheme in which only a fraction of
the sub-loan principal is paid in the early stages of the term.
The larger porFion of the amortization is applied to
regular/additional interests on sub-loans and other charges.
After full settlement of these 6bligations, liquidation of the
outstanding principal balance is accelerated during the
remainder of the term.
5.22   Total arrears amounted to 1150,059 million, of which 371 was for
fisheries accounts and 63Z, livestock accounts. Arrears ratios
were about 261 for both fisheries and livestock accounts.
(Tables 12 & 13)
Of the total amount of arrears, about 42.61 was over two years
past due.



- 32 -
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
5.23   Of the total number of accounts, 2,955 or 75.42 had started
paying amortization, of which 192 represented fisheries sub-
projects; and 812, livestock sub-projects. More than ninety-
five per cent (952) of the accounts under amortization or 722 of
total number of accounts was in arrears, majority or 812 of
which was on livestock sub-loans and only 192 on fisheries sub-
loans. (Tables 12a 6 13a)
5.24   The highesit incidence of arrearages among DBP Branches with
substantial exposures in fisheries lending for the Project were
Puerto Princesa, Catarman, Mati, and Zamboanga, with arrears
ratios ranging from 40.120Z to 43.5782. In livestock lending
the highest arrears ratio was 33.392Z attributed to the
Agricultural Loans Department (ALD) at Pead Office. Ranking
next to ALD was Lucena Branch with 30.9952 both of which had
substantial investments under the Project. (Tables 12 & 13)
5.25   For DBP to surmount the arrears problem, efforts have been
concentrated on loan collection activities, especially in the
Branches. For DBP's collection drive the following major
policies have been adopted:
a.   Implementation of rehabilitation/assistance programs for
typhoon/calamity victims
Area-specific and time-bound rehabilitation/assistance
programs for typhoon/calamity victims implemented in
1983 and 1984 were consolidated into a general program in
1985. Principally, these programs were aimed at alle-
viating mortgagors' repayment difficulties by extending
loan terms. These programs contributed to cash collections
since mortgagors were required to pay 5 to 102 of total
arrears for them to qualify for rehabilitation and/or
assistance.
b.   Provision of incentive for prompt payment
This policy entitles mortgagors who pay their accounts
promptly to a rebate equivalent to 12 of the interest due.
c.   Provision of incentive for full payment
This policy provides for the condonation of additional
interest on interest and penalty charges and reversion of
interest rate to that prevailing before 16 August 1984 for
borrowers who would pay in full their obligation with the
DBP.



- 33 -
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1094-PP)
d.   Provision of incentive for updating ot accounts
Under this policy, interest rates of past due accounts
which have been subjected to floating interest rates
shall be reduced to 182 (for loans of up to 7170,000) and
21X (for loans P120,000) provided all past due amount,
including advances shall be fully paid before 31 December
1986.
5.26   For its part, ASD fields assistance missions to branches with
high incidence of arrearages to undertake on-the-spot corrective
actions on problematic accounts. These branch assistance
missions conduct personalized loan collection on seriously
delinquent big agricultural loans. On a broader framework, the
local agricultural situation is also assessed to obtaiji bases
for policy recommendations.
R.   INSTITtTION BUILDING    -
5.27   During Project implementation DBP suffered financial dif-
ficulties which were aggravated by poor collection performance.
In order to conserve resources, DBP introduced the following
changes in the lending guidelines:
a.   Acceptance of loan applications only for priority projects
that can be co-financed by other banks in the private
sector, except loans of not more thaa 7170,000 and assets
of P253,000 or less after financing;
b.   Acceptance of loan applications only for projects covered
by special financing packages, as an exception to Item a;
and
c.   Acceptance of loan applications only for projects which
can be fully funded out of available special sources such
as the World Bank as an exception to the suspension of the
acceptance of new loan applications until after all those
in the pipeline have been processed.
Along the same line, DBP made representations with GOP to
request World Bank to increase level of reimbursement for
the loan from 372 to SOZ. Other requests were for the
expansion of the scope of the Project to include other
viable agricultural projects; eztension of the closing date
of the Project from 30 June 1984 to 30 June 1986; and
lifting of the suspension of the Project. Approval of
these requests by World Bank, however, was held in abeyance
until DBP presents a rehabilitation program.

Re: Phil. 3rt LDPIFCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
DBP opted for the cancellation of the uncommitted balance of
the Loan which became effective on 17 October l198.  Neverthe-
less, a rehabilitation program was proposed and approved by the
President of the Philippines in December 1985.
5.28   A rehabilitation scheme for DBP supplanting but basically
U } the same as the one approved by the former President, was sub-
mitted to the new President in April 1986. It calls for, among
other things, a "reorganization of DBP with emphasis in le"ding
to agriculture and small and medium industries and the
reconstrucL;.on of the DSP Board of Governors, into a Board of
Directors coaposed of a Chairman/President, Vice-Chairman and
seven other members from the government or private sector".

VI.    SPECIAL ISSUES
A   OPERATIONAL STATU  OP SUB-PROJECTS
.O3 1tVield dati  va lablefrom branch supervision sission4reports of
the agricutural Supervision Department would indicate that busi-
ness failures in small and medium-sized pig and poultry sub-
loans have been proportionally greater than among large-scale
units, a situation almost similar to what bad been the
experience under the Second Livestock Development Project.
Soaring costs of animal feeds and irregular supply of day-old-
chicks were cited as the principal causes of such failures.
Many raisers had to reduce production capacities because of ina-
bility to meet the substantial recurring costs typical of an
intensive system of producing pork, eggs and poultry. Not a few
small producers returned to the old method of raising pigs and
poultry which relied more on the use of indigenous feedatuff
available in the village. Oftentimes permanent and costly
buildings and other farm facilities designed for a typical com-
mercial operation were either under-utilized or left totally
idle, if not being used for other purposes.
6.02   A general tendency to expand operations and attain some econo-
mics of scale has been observed among large-scale producers.
Sub-borrowers under this category usually were also engaged in
other business ventures and had the advantage of having a wide
capital base and adequate cash flows. Much of their farm pro-
duce normally goes to the urban markets, particularly Metro
Manila. The small and medium-sized producers, on the other
hand, catered mainly to the municipal and provincial markets.
The disparity in prices of farm produets necessitated large-
scale producers, whose costs of production are much higher, to
look for lucrative markets as in Metro Manila and other urban
centers.  Om the otber hand, the small raisers, confronted with
limited markets locally and higher cost of inputs, had to adopt
- --a conservative approach of production so as to bring down costs
and remain competitive with the-numerous subsistence raisers in
"   the rural areas whose produce is being sold at a iucl lower
*-price.*
; 6.03 A3 he Project' has demonstrated thit small pig"ery and-.poultry
producers did not have the capability to compete with large
producers under the comercial and intensive production system.
Nevertheless, small producers can be given access to credit
provided that they adopt the traditional production system to
ensure enterprise viability.

Re:  Phil. 3rd WP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
6.04   In cattle, feedlot and cow-calf operations in small units and
conducted iA the outskirts of towns lhave become a promiaent
trend in beef production. Tais may be attributed to
deteriorating peace and order situation which prevented
entrepreneurs to raise breeding cattle in traditional grazing
areas.
In some instances, sub-borrowers who were given loans either
for a small-scale piggery or poultry unit have shifted to or
combined their operation with either goat raising or cattle
fattening projects.
6.05   The strategy under the Third Livestock Development Project is
the adoption of a commercial and intensive production system
anchored primarily on non-ruminants to attain growt.} in the
livestock sector. While this situation worked positively for
large-scale production units, such was not thie case witht respect
to the small and medium-sized ones. On the contrary, many of
the latter group, unable to compete with and match the efli-
ciency and organization of the large units, were gradually
squeezed out of business, allowing the other 6roup to Zai,i more
and more control and influence over the livestock business.
6.06   Even long before the Project was conceived, the demand for
feedgrains by the livestock sector, particularly pigery and
poultry, had been outstripping the country's capacity to produce
same leading to substantial growth in the impor tation of
feedgrains and protein concentrates. This, however, did not
seem to influence tne basic direction and general components of
the Project when it was appraised as the same bias for commer-
cial swine and poultry production was embodied in the program.
Consequently, there had been concentration of pig and poultry
sub-loans under the Project except in traditional cattle raising
provinces. Of the total sub-loans granted 77X went to tae non-
ruminant sector (pig and poultry) with the balance (232) going
to the ruminant sector, mainly for beef production. Goat
farming received only less than one percent of the total.
(Table 6)
6.07   The increasing dominance of the large and integrated pig and
-   poultry farms had likewise been a fast-emerging trend during the
seventies. Attempts to include in the program the participation
of small and medium-sized operators following an intensive
farming system because of some social consideration, appeared to
have been an over-estimation of their real capacity to compete
with their large counterparts.
B.   SUB-PRWJECT SUPERVISION
6.08   Lack of qualified personnel in many DBP branches to provide
technical assistance and to monitor the performance of
numerous sub-projects contributed to a certain extent to nign
rates of loan default and incidence of business failure. Widely
dispersed location of sub-projects financed also adversely
affected genuine efforts of DBP to effectively supervise them.

Wnile a Memorandum of Agreement betieetn DBP and the Bureau ot
Animal Industry (tile latter to provide technical assistance to
DBP clients) did exist during the implementation of the Project,
the impact of such arrangement leaves much to be desired, not
only because of the limited number of livestock technicians
involved in relation to the number of sub-projects to be duper-
vised but also for their lack of full commitment to the cause of
DBP. Todate, only 8 out of 38 BAI technicians remain on-detail
with some DBP branches.

Re: Phil. 3rd LWP/FCP (Loan No. 1Q94-PU)
VII.  CFANGES IN REPEATER PROJECT
7.01    Gontinued expansion of the livestock sector Is needed in
order to meet the growing demand for food of the burgeoning
human population. However, because of new constraints that
have evolved vithin which animal production systems must
operate, a broad livestock development project to be pursued
in the future would have to be premised on the following:
a. amphasis toward animal systems which are primarily
grass-eaters and do not demand so much foreign
exchange in their operations;
b. Development of breeds of animals which will have
potential for multiple usage, particularly, for meat
and milk;
c. Broad participation of smallhold farmers in order to
widen the sector's economic base;
d. Maximized utilization of localy available resources,
both conventional and indigenous;
e. Deeper appreciation of the constraints and realities
existing in the rural economy.
All these virtually mean that such a livestock development
project in the future will have to be based primarily on
ruminants which include cattle, carabao, goat and sheep.
These types of animals, having a compound stomach, are
capable of coverting low-grade roughage, agricultural by-
products and crop residues not directly useable by man, into
highly nutritious human food. Such inexpensive inputs are
abundant in the countryside. Unlike in the commercial pro-
duction of pigs and chicken, expansion of the ruminant sec-
tor would not likely result in the growth of the country's
importation of feedgrains and.protein concentrates, and thus
help in conserving the country's scarce foreign exchange
earnings..
7.02    Efforts to increase the country's cattle population must
continue but should also address the more fundamental issues
such as the very low national average on calf-crop (less
than 50Z), inefficient use and inequitious distribution of
government-owned grazing lands, as well as the problem of
animal diseases and infestations. The problem of high
investment cost of the ranch-type operations and the
deteriorating peace and order in many traditional grazing



- 39 -
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-Pl)
areas, however, would require tne reorientation of the stra-
tegy towards emphasis on smalihold cattle farming. Aside
from its social implications, such approach will make better
use of the vast but oftentimes wasted resources available in
numerous farmlands. Technology on silage making vill nave
to be popularized among small farmers to ensure adequate and
steady supply of roughage even during off-seasons.
7.03    The country's extreme dependence on imported milk and milK
products would likewise necessitate the development of the
local dairy industry, no matter how long and slow the pro-
cess would be. Towards this direction, initial efforts to
upgrade the local stock in order to improve their genetic
potential for commercial milk production will have to take
place at a much faster rate, and at wider scale to include
animals in backyard farms. In addition, establishment of
nucleus dairy units in strategic places would be very
essential not only for modelling purposes but also in pro-
viding related support services to small satellite farms.
But more importantly, there is need for the formulation and,
later on, a well coordinated implementation, of a national
breeding program which is to be founded on the local >reeds
where environmental adaptation is basic to a succesetul pro-
duction, and aimed at producing dual type of animal be it
large or small ruminants for simultaneous production of
meat and milk.
7.04    The commercial swine and poultry sectors apparently have
already attained that stage where pouring of development
funds may no longer be necessary. Therefore, development
efforts should be directed mainly for the benefit of the
subsistence raisers in backyard farms. Because almost every
household has a few head of pigs and/or chicken to raise,
improvement in taeir production levels and efficiencies will
certainly have a much greater social and economic impact
than when commercial farms are allowed to expand even
further. But more than anything, marketing support to
assure the backyard raisers reasonable returns for their
produce would be an important consideration.
7.05    Part-of the overall livestock development project is the
need to institutionalize the delivery of veterinary
services. Economic losses arising from death of animals,
heavy infestation and high morbidity could run into several
millions of pesos in a tropical country like the
Philippines. Such amount of losses should easily justify
the establishment of provincial veterinary centers with
adequately equipped saboratories which will solely be
responsible for the surveillance, control and eradication of
livestock diseases. Eliminating some important diseases
could possib'y open foreign markets for Philippine animal
products.

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
7.06    There is likewise a need to continue the thrust towards
further development and expansion of the fishery sector with
emphasis on th,e aquaculture sub-sector to meet tr,e growing
fish requirement of the population in tthe com.ng years.
However, for such thrust to have a socio-economic impact in
the light of the launching of the country's econmomic reco-
very program, it would have to be anchored on the following:
a. There must be emphasis towards generation of wealth from
the fisheries resources through projects utilizing tech-
nology that does not demand much foreign exchange in its
operationi but rather contribute to the accumulation of
forein exchange.
It has been recognized that the industry is beset with a
progressively declining catch efficiency of commercial
deep- sea fishing vessels, which are import -dependent
on engine and equipment spare parts, fuel and nets,
because of increase in fishing fleet operation and the
probability of resource depletion in traditionally known
fishing grounds. On the other hand, aquaculture
projects are known to have improved production per unit
area even as the area in operationx is increasing. Tae
only known import component in the extensive production
of bangus, sugpo and tilapia is inorganic fertilizer
whicn usually comprises less than one-third of the
operating cost. Thus, it would be practical to limit
the number of fishing vessels to existing levels atld
increase their efficiency by repowering and improving
fishing technology. qence, the aquaculture sub-sector
will bear the burden of filling the supply-demand gap.
b.  There must be a broad participation of small fish
farmers to upgrade their livelihood and widen their
economic base. This can be done by allowing experienced
fishpond caretakers to operate individually or collec-
tively idle or new fishponds within one fishpond system.
This scheme will be beneficial to the government's
effort of improving the lot of the rural population
since this will lead to the equitable distribution of
wealth, improve production, and allow fish farmers to
enjoy the full fruits of their labor.
c. Available government demopstration farms must be
harnessed to develop viable technology on aquaculture
projects utilizing organic fertilizers from indigenous
materials and fish fry which are locally available
and/or can be introduced and reproduced in the area at
the least cost.
d. The number of trained and experienced extension officers
must be increased and their roles strengthened to ensure
the transfer of viable fisheries technology and the
supervision of projects as well as to inculcating in the
minds of borrowers-operators credit consciousness.

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1694-PH)
VIII. CONCLUSION
8.01    The objectives of the Project were attained, particularly in
providing support for institutional development tnrougn the
non-credit component. Inspite of shortfalls in tar6ets, tile
credit component provided DBP with financial assistance in
the amount of US $53 million (including GOP counterpart
funds) to some 3,644 livestock/poultry producers and
fishermen.
8.02    For DBP, institutional development was enhanced by the tech-
nical assistance sub-component, the objective of which was
to strengthen planning and implementation of the Project.
Technical assistance to DBP enabled the formulation and
implementation of an expanded training program in lendin4
operations; conduct of studies; and establishment of
monitoring/evaluation and management information systems.
The training program upgraded staff capability for sub-loan
evaluation and economic/financial analysis, to which is
attributed the development of new sub-project mixes based on
technical feasibility and financial viability. The study on
viability of fishpond projects in Samar and Leyte Provinces
was the basis for framing a more responsive guideline in
sub-loan evaluation. Tne pilot monitoring and evaluation
system has shown potentials for becoming an effective
planning instrument; and the management information system
has started centralizing the widely dispersed Branch
reporting network.
8.03    Support services discharged by the Bureau of Animal Industry
(SBAI) for the livestock industry which at the same time
facilitated Project implementation were enhanced by the non-
credit component. More importantly, out of the Project-
funded studies undertaken by SAI, new technological packages
on small animal nutrition have been developed.
8.04    On the other other hand, the abolition of Fishery Industry
Development Council (FIDC) and eventual transfer of its
functions to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and the
revision of the program delayed the implementation of the
studies for the fishery industry beyond the extended closing
date for the non-credit component of the Project (30 June
1986). Indications are that this sub-component will not be
further implemented. Considering that the revised program
concentrated on a review of marine resources and technology
evaluation, its result could have provided the basis of
setting DBP lending priorities for deepsea fishing.
8.05    Based on actual availments from the US $40 million loan from
IBRD only US $19.559 million or 482 was utilized for the
credit component. In terms of target number of sub-
projects, only 70.82 was assisted. The shortfalls in target
investments and number of sub-projects were aggravated by



- 42 -
Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
the series of suspensions in 1983 which culminated in the
cancellation of the unavailed balance of the credit in
October 1984. These courses of action arose from
financial difficulties undergone by DBP but, moreover,
sub-loan comnitment for marine fishing had stopped after
the initial year of Project implementation.
Target number of sub-projects for marine vessels/traditional
bancas was 2,326 or 451 of aggregate while target invest-
ments amounted to S14.3 M or 18.31 of total. Total number
financed was only 63 involving $2.143 M or an accomplishment
of 2.n and 15.OZ, respectively.
8.06    In the project design, emphasis on credit was placed on
increase in fish production through expanding fish farming
and offshore commercial fishing. The sub-sector accounted
for 54Z of target number of sub-projects and 532 of credit
allocation. The change in thrust to fisheries from
livestock/poultry production was based on lower cost of
production of fish than that of livestock/poultry.
Assistance for. fish production from offshore commercial
fishing was geared towards exploitation of new geographic
areas and a wide spectrum of vessel sizes, with priority on
smaller fishing boats. The objective to reach sustenance
and municipal fishermen was bolstered by the prohibition of
commercial fishing within seven kilometers from shore, as a
national policy. However, assistance from the project for
this purpose was restrained by the availability of loans
from the Government-behest program, "Biyayang Dagat" where
as a conduit bank DBP approved 330 sub-loans in the amount
of 72.9 million as of 31 July 1982.
Regarding financing of larger size fishing vessels, demand
for loans was subdued because of increased costs of
construction materials and fuel and restrictive lending
policies resulting from financial difficulties. Adopted in
1981 and 1982, the policies were as follows:
a.  Increase in the basic interest rates, application fees,
.1' ...   and other charges;
b. Change in debt-equity ratio and collateral requirements
- '.     9              for loans to be secured by government land covered by
,;       PLA/FLA;
c.  Requirement of co-financing with other banks for appli-
cants with loans of more than 7170,000 and whose
assets exceed 7250,000 after financing; and
d. Use of income tax returns as the basis for determining
capacity to generate the equity requirement/repay the
loan.

Re:  Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PI)
Implementation of Project design with respect to marine
fishing was restricted by increased material and fuel costs;
availability of substitute source of funds under the
nBiyayang Dagat Program" of government; and stringent DBP
financing policies.
8.07    Based on the classifirtation of the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics (BAECON) that backyard or small-scale producers
-     of pigs and other small livestock are those with 20 head or
less, it may be said that the sub-projects assisted under
the Project were medium- and large-scale. Tne average
capacity of piggery projects was 18 sov-level or about 180
head at any given time which, per BAECON's definition, is
commercial. The Bureau's standard 20-head or two to three
sow-level project was not financed despite efforts of DBP to
re-direct lending towards this scale of operation.
8.08    Under the commercial and intensive production system adopted
in the credit program, small-scale livestock/poultry sub-
projects so defined had very low chances of survival vis-a-
vis medium- and large-scale. This approach required use of
commercial feeds, medicines, vaccines, feed supplements, and
infrastructure, the prices of which rose during Project
implementation thereby increasing cost of production. Even
among some medium-scale operators, inputs were not regularly
used, resulting in outbreaks of pests and diseases and poor
quality of produce. Further aggravating low quality of out-
put was the use of substitute feeds to reduce cost of pro-
duction. The overall impact of these constraints was that
farm gate prices for the produce were low.
The Project concept that commercial producers can use credit
effectively and quickly respond to business opportunities
precluded backyard livestock/poultry raisers, given tne pre-
vailing financial difficulties.
8.09    The more successful medium- and large-scale commercial
livestock producers had che capability to infuse additional
capital, when necessary, which gives them the following
built-in advantages.
- }   a.  Efficient Production.  Available capital enabled medium-
and large-scale operators to engage in bulk buying of
;-   -     imported feed ingredients at cheaper prices and assured
continuous feed supply.
b. Good Quality Feed Rations. With the services of hired
nutritionists high quality and balanced feed rations
could be formulated.
c. Technical Back-Up. Services of consultants in prac-
tically every aspect of farm operation could be available.



- 44 -
Re: Pbil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-Pul)
4. High Prices. Because of good quality of produce and
access to urban markets, medium- and large-scale opera-
tions enjoyed higher output prices.
e*. Resiliency. Nedium- and large-scale producers had the
capability to restore their projects back to normal
operations after a setback.
8.10    With the financing of large-scale pi8gery and poultry sub-
projects, two issues were anticipated by DBP, namely:
a. Deviation from the objective of the IBRD credit line to
assist small- and medium-sized producers; and
b. Distortion of the supply-demand balance already attained
for pork and poultry (chicken) products if entry of big
producers in the market forces out the smaller ones.
In response to the clarification requested by DBP on self-
sufficiency, the National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA) stated that there was the general indication that
such was existing. Nevertheless, continuous provision of
credit was deemed necessary by NEDA to maintain the self
sufficiency momentum, provided the industry situation is
closely monitored and approval of large loans treated on a
case-to-case basis. In addition, NEDA recommended that the
share of credit for cattle production in the total loanable
funds for the livestock sector be increased.
8.11    Considering that assistance to backyard livestock producers
was available from Government livelihood programs, the role
of DBP as a major source of medium- and large-size loans was
firmed up during Project implementation. The desegregation
accounts for the inability of the Project to reach the
target clientele. Moreover, shortfalls in target credit for
piggery and poultry may also be attributed to DBP's regu-
lated financing because of self-sufficiency in these
*        sub-sectors.
8.12    During appraisal, Project justification was pre-conditioned
on DBP's capability to provide the followini support
services:                                 -
a.  Upgrading the quality of sub-loan application standard;
. and streamline sub-loan processing;
b.  Strengthening of staff capability for economic analysis;
and
c. Updating leading policies to counter risks.

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/?CP (Loan No. 1894-PH)
8.13    The DBP, through the Agricultural Supervision Department,
consolidated its quality control services into a program to
cover not only WP/FCP III but also its various agricultural
credit lines. ahe program consisted of assessment of Branch
agricultural lending activities; extension of technical
assistance to the Branches; and conduct of agricultural sub-
sector situation reviews. Specific activities included the
following:
a. Sub-project operations analysis aimed at reducing
arrearages and incidence of business failures and empha-
sizing the need for farm-level monitoring and
supervision;
b. Appraisal of loan proposals;
c. Loan purpose verification for special sub-projects; and
d. Technical and financial analysis of exceptional cases
involving problem accounts.
Other measures included updating of lending policies (Paras.
2.04; 2.23 to 2.26; and 3.13); rationalization of departmen-
tal responsibilities (Paras. 3.09 and 5.01); implementation
of a comprehensive agriculture staff training program
(Paras. 3.12 and 5.05); and expansion/upgrading of computer
facilities for the HIS (Paras. 2.09 and 3.08).
8.14    The efforts of DBP in resolving the foregoing appraisal
issues (Para 8.12) was well appreciated by World Bank, as
indicated in a communication from Mr. K. G. V.. Krishna to
DBP Chairman Cesar Zalamea (8 April 1984), excerpts of wthichi
follows:
"Concerning livestock and fisheries operations,
I am pleased to tell you that the mission was
impressed with the caliber of the staff working on
these projects and the character of most of the
'investments reviewed. xxx"
'Concerning computerization of DBP management
information system, the Mission reported that the
*           component was proceeding well: staff at DBP Data
Center have satisfactorily taken into account the
fluidity of current DBP organisation in system
development. xxx"



- 46 -
Re:  Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1894-PR)
The same view was reiterated by Mr. Ralph Wadsworth in his
letter to DBP Chairman Jesus P. Estanislao (9 June 1985)
saying he was
"zxxx glad to learn (from the Quality Control Services
Report of ASD) that efforts of ASD in conducting the
quality control of the branch's agriculture portfolio
have brought about additional cash collection, par-
ticularly from other wise inactive accounts. xxx"
8.15    The obstacles that affected Project implementation were
vell-known to World Bank missions that visited the country
from 1981 to 1984. For problems that could be controlled by
the implementing agencies, specific alternatives were
suggested by the World Bank. Information from available
records show the following actions/suggestions of the World
Bank:
a. On the observed lag in commitments for marine vessels,
WS suggested the financing of tuna fishing and
infrastructure investment.
b. On the trend towards financing of large enterprises out-
side Metro Manila but which rely on the urban market for
outlet, the Bank asked DBP to assess adequacy of
transportation facilities and costs; and impact on'
small- and medium-scale enterprises.
c. On the agriculture staff training program initially con-
fined to livestock and fisneries, IBRD recommended the
expansion of scope to include DdP staff's needs in 'all
major sub-sectors in agriculture.
d. On the trend towards cattle financing, consent was given
for the opening of new Project areas.
e. On the arrears problem, the World Bank recommended the
dissemination to the Branches of the results of the
comprehensive supervision missions on agricultural
lending and collection introduced by ASD.
However, for problems which stemmed from the depressed eco-
nomy, the Bank was circumspect, advising no more than
flexibility in the implementation of the Project.
8.16    By and large, while the World Bsank did not anticipate the
developments that were to affect project implementation, it
gained insights into circumstances through feedback from
supervision missions and open communications with DBP.

Re: Phil. 3rd LDP/FCP (Loan No. 1Z94-P?)
IX.    RECO1EYDATIOtZS
9.01    DBP has developed technical and financial capabilities in
implewenting financing programs for livestock and fishery
development, having been involved in this activity since
1958. On this basis, it is recommended that the institu-
tion's expertise be harnessed for the economic recovery
program of the Philippines.
9.02    Considering the financial and economic crisis that the
country is presently undergoing, DBP's immediate concern
should be the rehabilitation of distressed sub-projects,
particularly of smallholders. Towards this end, the
the primary objective of DBP's financing programs snould
be the improvement of per unit productivity to ootain
target aggregate production levels.
For the livestock and inland fishery sub-sectors, financing
assistance should be confined to the provision of working
capital for existing sub-projects and should veer away from
establishment oi new sub-projects.
On the other hand, assistance to the marine fishery sub-
sector should include provisions for working capital,
modernization of fishing gear and equipment, hull and engine
repairs, and re-powering of (but excluding construction of
new) fishing vessels.
9.03    In extending revitalization loans, DBP should give priority
to its prime clients.
9.04    Funds for financing programs should be domestically sourced
to minimize demand for foreign exchange and cost of
har.dling. If funds are provided by foreign sources,
assistance should be in the form of grants-in-aid and simi-
lar programs.
9.05    Flexibility in financing, which was allowed by the World
Bank and adopted by DBP in this Project, should be pursued
in future projects, but discriminately.
