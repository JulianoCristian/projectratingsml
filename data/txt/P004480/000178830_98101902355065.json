objectives are to increase\n            production of animal protein and to strengthen the\n            institutional capability for implementing this and future\n            projects. Its subcomponents will be broadly determined by an\n            annual lending program prepared by DBP in consultation with\n            concerned agencies are envisaged to include financing of\n            small livestock and cattle, fishponds and marine vessels and\n            other items to support the two subsectors, including\n            slaughter-houses, iceplants, etc. Although production is its\n            principal objective, the project aims to support small- and\n            medium-scale entrepreneurs in order to redress some of the\n            regional development imbalances. Noncredit components\n            include consultant services and support to sectoral\n            agencies. The main risks include the possibility of\n            inadequate interagency coordination, possible lack of\n            regional focus and narrowing profit margins if output prices\n            continue to be held down by Government. The loan agreement\n            contains a number of provisions concerned with interagency\n            coordination and the strengthening of the regional focus."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
