Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework 
 
Proposed Istanbul Municipal Infrastructure Project 
 
Background
 
The Istanbul Municipal Infrastructure Project will have four components: 
 
(i) Environmental 
management: 
a. 
Closure of existing landfills and illegal dump sites; and 
b.  Financing shipping waste collection and emergency response vessels.  
 
(ii) 
Municipal services and infrastructure: 
a. 
Preparing a detailed risk assessment for all major municipal systems; 
b. 
Preparing a Municipal Infrastructure Risk Mitigation Plan; 
c. 
Retrofitting selected key buildings, fire stations and municipal 
infrastructure; and 
d.  Providing needed equipment. 
 
(iii) 
 Pilot urban transformation program:   
a. 
Pilot urban transformation feasibility studies; and 
b.  Selected priority investments associated with urban transformation. 
 
(iv) 
Engineering services and audits: 
a. 
Design studies, tender documents, review of strengthening and other 
design, surveys and other studies; and 
b.  External audits of project accounts 
 
Possible Land Acquisition or Resettlement Requirements
 
The project is not expected to require the acquisition or expropriation of private land, as 
all anticipated investments will take place on public land.  Similarly, as the work should 
be carried out on existing sites, there should be no need to access public land that is 
informally occupied.  During implementation, however, the IMM may request the project 
to fund unforeseen investments for which the municipality may need to acquire private 
land or regain possession of public land that is either leased to a private party or 
informally occupied and used by a private party.  To maintain flexibility and enable the 
Bank to respond positively to such requests, the IMM has prepared this Policy 
Framework to ensure compliance with the Bank’s Operational Policy 4.12, Involuntary 
Resettlement.

Land Acquisition Process 
 
The process of constructing a public facility goes through three main steps.   
 
The first step in the process is to obtain the approval of the district municipality council 
and be integrated into the municipal land use plan.  Consideration by the council and 
entry into the plan are both preceded by public announcements in newspapers and posting 
in the municipality office, a public planning meeting, and a 60-day period during which 
the public is invited to comment.  If substantive negative feedback is obtained, the 
decision is reviewed by the municipality council and either approved again or denied. 
 
The second step occurs on the Metropolitan Municipality level, where the council must 
grant approval and the land use plan must be changed to integrate the facility.  Both 
actions are also preceded by similar notifications, public meetings and feedback period.  
If the response is negative, the proposal is submitted to the council for re-consideration. 
 
After the site proposal completes the first two steps, documentation is prepared to request 
a
location permit.  In addition to the decisions and confirmation that the site is entered 
into the respective plans, the documentation consists of feasibility studies; preliminary 
design; environmental assessment; ownership status; estimated land cost replacement 
value of above ground assets, based on a professional valuation; estimated construction 
and supervision cost; and confirmation that adequate funds are available..  Once the 
location permit is issued, the land can be acquired.   
 
Land Ownership and Use Status 
 
Land ownership status can include one or more of four scenarios:   
a) 
owned by the municipalit
y
and either vacant or used by the municipality, a 
municipal company or a private entity under a lease or informal arrangement;  
b) 
owned by the Treasury
or other state agency and either vacant or used by the 
owner;  
c) 
owned by the state or state agency or enterprise and used by another party
through 
a
lease or informal arrangement; 
d) private 
land
either used by the owner or another private individual or enterprise or 
used informally by a third party through a lease or informal arrangement. 
 
Each scenario has different implications for entitlements and action which are noted 
briefly below and in the “Entitlement Matrix,” attached as Annex A. 
 
Municipal Ownership
.
The land is owned and used by the municipality, the land is 
transferred to the solid waste management office.  If the land is used by a third party 
under a lease, the Metropolitan Municipality adheres the conditions of the lease, which 
may or may not include the obligation to transfer the activity to another site.  If the land 
is used informally, the Metropolitan Municipality compensates the user for assets that are 
lost and assists the user to relocate the activity.

Ownership and Use by the Treasury or Other State Entity
.
If the land is owned and used 
by the State or one of its agencies, the solid waste management office negotiates with the 
owner/user to transfer the land to the Metropolitan Municipality.  Depending on 
circumstances, the land will be transferred to the Metropolitan Municipality without cost 
or leased or sold to the Metropolitan Municipality after compensating the user for lost 
assets.   
 
Ownership by the Treasury or Other State Entity and Used by a Third Party
.
If the land 
is leased to a third party, the owner will vacate the land and transfer or lease it to the 
Metropolitan Municipality, adhering to the conditions of the lease, which may or may not 
require compensation for lost assets or disruptions in use.  If the land is used informally, 
the owner will vacate the land, compensating the user for lost assets, and assist the user to 
find another suitable location. 
 
Private Ownership
.
If the land is privately owned, the Metropolitan Municipality will 
commission a property assessment and contact the owner giving notification that the land 
is needed for the facility.  The Metropolitan Municipality will then invite the owner to 
negotiate for purchase, based on the assessment.  The objective of negotiation is to reach 
an agreement on the value of the land, assets, loss of income (if relevant) due to 
relocation, and the cost of relocation and re-establishment.  The owner must be 
compensated in full before work can begin. 
 
Expropriation
 
If negotiation fails, the Metropolitan Municipality can request the court to issue an 
expropriation order, documenting the failure to reach a settlement through negotiation.  
The court will commission an independent assessment prior to issuing the order and 
setting the price.  When the order is issued, the Metropolitan Municipality compensates 
the owner at the level set by the court and obtains title.  Work cannot commence before 
the payment is made in full. 
 
If the owner is not satisfied by the court decision, he or she can appeal the financial 
settlement, but cannot reverse the expropriation order.   
 
Although the Metropolitan Municipality has the authority to request and obtain an 
expropriation order, expropriation inevitably generates strong public criticism and thus it 
is rarely used. 
 
Responsibility 
 
The Metropolitan Municipality is ultimately responsible for land acquisition and 
expropriation.  The process is managed by the office that will use the land, however, in 
collaboration with the municipal cadastre office.   
Page  4
Compliance with OD 4.12 
 
The government recently changed the expropriation law to authorize compensation to 
informal and illegal land users for the assets they lose when the government reasserts 
control over public land.  The new legislation essentially closed the only significant gap 
between Turkish laws and World Bank policies relating to land acquisition and 
expropriation.  Nonetheless, to assure compliance with OP 4.12, the Metropolitan 
Municipality will notify the Bank of any plans to acquire private land, or to clear 
informally occupied public land, for facilities funded through the project and will prepare 
a
brief land acquisition plan for each investment.  The plan should be submitted to the 
Bank for review and no objection at the time the municipality requests a location permit.  
The report should provide details about the amount, ownership status and use status of 
public and private land to be acquired for project investments, documenting the action 
taken to that point as well as any public comments received along the way.   
 
In addition to following regular Turkish land acquisition procedures, the municipality 
will conduct an open public hearing prior to submitting the request for a location permit.  
The hearing should be announced in newspapers and other media at least two weeks 
before the event, and announcements should be posted in prominent places in the vicinity 
of the proposed site.  The municipality will record minutes of the meeting that describes 
when and where the meeting was announced, who was invited, who attended (with an 
address or telephone number for further contact) and includes all comments received 
during and prior to the hearing.  The documentation presented to the Bank will include 
the minutes of the hearing with a statement from the municipality indicating the actions 
that will be taken in response to the comments received.   
 
Disclosure 
 
This Policy Framework was disclosed in country by the Metropolitan Municipality on 
March 9, 2007.
