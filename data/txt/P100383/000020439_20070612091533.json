and (ii) improving its capacity to\n            mitigate earthquakes by retrofitting key facilities and\n            infrastructure and upgrading the institutions and their\n            procedures to help them respond to emergencies. The IMIP\n            would consist of four components with the first being\n            improvements in environmental management: this includes\n            closure of existing unauthorized disposal sites for\n            municipal solid waste (landfills) and rehabilitation of\n            creeks; preparation of annual business plans that include\n            operating performance, investment program and financial\n            targets and results; and financing waste collection\n            equipment. The second component is strengthening of\n            municipal services and infrastructure which includes:\n            preparing a detailed risk assessment for all major municipal\n            systems; preparing a Municipal Infrastructure Risk\n            Mitigation Plan; retrofitting of municipal infrastructure\n            (under-passes, pipelines, viaducts etc.); and providing\n            emergency fire department equipment. The third component is\n            the pilot urban transformation program which includes: pilot\n            urban transformation feasibility studies; and retrofitting\n            and construction of buildings, fire stations and emergency\n            housing associated with urban transformation in the most\n            seismic vulnerable areas. The final component is the project\n            management and audits, this consists of: design studies,\n            surveys and technical training for project implementation;\n            and external audits of project accounts."}, "docdt": "2007-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
