                         The revised PDO is to contribute to (i) the rehabilitation and clean up of unauthorized waste disposal sites and creeks and (ii) the strengthening of the capacity
                         of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) to mitigate the impact of earthquakes by retrofitting infrastructure and providing training to respond to
                         emergencies more effectively.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         IMM has made progress in the creek rehabilitation component since the previous missions in May 2010 and July 2010, especially with respect to construction in the 9 creeks where
                         rehabilitation works were started. Subsequently, in October 2010, disbursements commenced on the project. The preparation work on additional creek sections remains behind

                         about to start for microzonation and fire vehicles with documents under final review. No significant progress has been made in the project's other components. Given the continuing

                         slow rate of disbursements and the lack of progress on several key components and activities that have not yet started, the project's progress towards meeting its development
                         objectives and the targets of the project indicators remains limited. As a result, the project rating remains unsatisfactory.
