           were highly unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            high, Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the proactive and consultative approach taken by\n            the Borrower, the Guarantor, and the Bank in closing the\n            project allowed all parties to manage risk and minimize the\n            cost of an unsuccessful project. The need for land\n            acquisition and resettlement is often necessary to ensure\n            safe development and provide social benefits. In case of a\n            major reallocation of resources or significant changes in\n            the priority of components through restructuring, a greater\n            use of the Bank's internal quality control mechanisms,\n            such as a full decision-meeting, and peer reviews will\n            likely improve the outcome of the restructuring. While a\n            project implementation unit (PIU) management structure may\n            have simplified the process of Bank supervision, its\n            effectiveness in achieving program development objectives\n            (PDO's) and ensuring smooth implementation will still\n            have required adequate processes and authority for the PIU\n            to interface and coordinate with various implementing\n            departments and entities. Projects that support a large\n            number of different investments, not all of which may be\n            fully identified before appraisal require careful project design."}, "docdt": "2013-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
