satisfactory\n            outcomes, highly likely sustainability, and substantial\n            institutional development impacts. Among the lessons\n            learned, it is reinforced that strong government commitments\n            enhances the chances for success, as demonstrated by the\n            pro-active implementation of public finance management\n            reforms; that a focused, and well defined program delivers\n            positive results, shown particularly in the Treasury\n            component, carefully, and functionally designed prior to an\n            established computerization, thus ensuring an effective\n            implementation; and, that flexibility in the design of\n            components (accomplished in close collaboration between the\n            Bank and counterparts) also succeeded in enabling\n            discussions on different public finance management systems,\n            and on understanding the full range of requirements. It is\n            also worth noting that the continuity of project staff,\n            eased communications with participating institutions, and an\n            efficient project administration."}, "docdt": "2002-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
