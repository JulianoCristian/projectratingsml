INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
SOCIETE TUNISIENNE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$7.5 million to
Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz (S.T.E.G.).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        S.T.E.G. is a state-owned electricity and gas company created
in 1962 to take over and operate the assets of seven foreign utility com-
panies which were nationalized in that year. Mr. Woods served as concilia-
tor in the ensuing compensation dispute which was settled in 1967. Pay-
ments of the agreed amounts were initially delayed, but are now being made
on schedule.
3.        The proposed loan would be the first Bank loan to S.T.E.G., the
Bank having declined to consider a loan in the mid-sixties because of the
compensation dispute. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development would
make a loan to S.T.E.G. for the same project, equivalent to $2.5 million.
It has made two previous loans to S.T.E.G., the first in 1963 for $11.2
million and the second in 1967, for $12.9 million. Both loans, which have
been fully disbursed, were for the purchase and installation of electricity
generating equipment and transmission lines. The Kuwait Fund was satisfied
with S.T.E.G.'s performance under both loans. The Fund has participated
in the appraisal of the project now proposed and negotiated its loan simul-
taneously with the Bank. This would be the first operation undertaken to-
gether by the Bank and the Kuwait Fund.
4.        Negotiations took place in Washington from December 10 to 16,
1970. Mr. Sadok Bahroun, President and Managing Director of S.T.E.G.,
represented the Borrower together with Messrs. Kemal Rekik and Salem Tekaia.
Mr. Zini Mestiri of the Planning Ministry and Mr. Ahmed Badra of the Tunisian
Embassy represented the Guarantor. Messrs. Abdlatif Al-Hamad, Director-
General, and Mr. Abdul Rahim Mirghani, Chief Economist, negotiated the
Kuwait Fund's loan.
5.        Following is a summary statement of loans and credits to Tunisia
as of December 31, 1970:

6.        Implementation of subprojects under the first loan made to Societe
Nationale d'Investissement (Loan 449) has proceeded satisfactorily, with the
exception of a few subprojects for which imports have been delayed. How-
ever, disbursements under the loan are now expected to be completed shortly.
Commitments and disbursements under loans No. 512 and 648 to SNI are pro-
ceeding satisfactorily.
7.        Savings of about $1.5 million have been made on the Second Educa-
tion Project (Credit No. 94), and the Government has requested a reallocation
of these amounts and a postponement by two years of the Closing Date of Decem-
ber 31, 1970. It has been postponed by four months as an interim measure to
allow the Association time to examine the request. I will in due course pre-
sent to the Executive Directors recommendations concerning the utilization of
these funds.



8.        The Executive Directors approved amendments to Loan No. 484
and Credit No. 99 (Cooperative Farm Project) on November 17, 1970. Dis-
bursements are expected to resume as soon as these amendments become ef-
fective.
9.        Initial delays in the preparation of bidding documents accounted
for slow disbursements under Loan No. 573 (Ports II). A number of con-
tracts have now been awarded and an acceleration in disbursements can be
expected.
10.       After some delays in bidding for the First Water Supply Project
(Loan No. 581), most of the contracts have now been awarded. Construction
started last September and disbursements are increasing to a satisfactory
level. Credit No. 209 for a Second Water Supply Project became effective
on November 12, 1970.
11.       Disbursements under the Railroad Project (Loan No. 606 and Credit
No. 150) remain slow. Works were delayed by flood damage in the fall of
1969 and the need to give priority to flood damage repairs.
12.       In 1962, IFC invested $2.0 million in NPK-Engrais, a phosphate
fertilizer company. In 1966, IFC made an investment of D 300,000 (about
$571,500) in the share capital of Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI),
which in 1970, was increased by $630,000 allowing IFC to maintain its 20
percent participation when SNI doubled its share capital. In 1969 IFC made
an investment of $9.9 million ($8 million as a loan and $1.9 million in
share capital) in COFITOUR, a tourism development and holding company.
13.       The Bank and IDA are at present considering projects in family
planning, highway construction, agricultural credit, tourism infrastructure,
fisheries as well as a fourth loan to Societe Nationale d'Investissement.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
14.  BORROWER:            Societe Tunisienne de 1'Electricite et du Gaz
(S.T.E.G.)
GUARANTOR:           Republic of Tunisia
AMOUNT:              US$7.5 million in various currencies
PURPOSE:             To finance construction of the El Borma-Gabes
gas pipeline
AMORTIZATION:        In 16 years, including a 3-year period of
grace, through 26 semi-annual installments
beginning May 15, 1974 and ending November 15,
1986.
lNTEREST RATE:       7-1/4% per annum
COMMrTMENT CHARGE:   3/4 of 1% per annum
RATE OF RETURN:      The economic rate of return is estimated at
over 25% (see para. 21 below).
15.       The Kuwait Fund will extend a loan of 900,000 Kuwaiti dinars
($2,520,000) on the same terms except that the rate of interest will be
3-1/2% per annum plus a service charge of 1/2 of 1% per annum, and that
there will be no commitment charge.
PART III - THE PROJECT
16.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Societe Tunisienne de
l'Electricite et du Gaz - El Borma Gas Pipeline Project - Tunisia"
(No. PTR-66a) is attached.
17.       Tunisia's installed electric generating capacity is now about
258,000 KW, 83 percent of which is operated by S.T.E.G. Fuel oil, some
of which is imported, is the principal energy source for the existing
plant. Tunisia's domestic oil production ran at 4 million tons in 1969,
of which 3.6 million tons were produced at El Borma. This oil field in
the Tunisian part of the Sahara is being exploited by Societe Italo -
Tunisienne d'Exploitation Petroliere (S.I.T.E.P.), a joint venture be-
tween the Tunisian State and the Italian state owned ENI Group.    There is
at present no sizable commercial utilization of natural gas in runisia.
Gas produced at the El Borma oil field in association with crude oil has
up to now been flared.



18.       S.T.E.G. was established by the Tunisian Government in 1962 to
take over and operate the assets and liabilities of seven private utility
companies which had been nationalized. While it is now an efficiently
managed institution, it is still beset by long-standing problems relating
to staffing and to accounting procedures. Excessive recruiting in the early
years of its existence led to overstaffing. Inadequate records and account-
ing hamper the management of the company's affairs. S.T.E.G.'s present man-
agement is determined to resolve these problems. A recently developed pro-
gram of retraining, early retirement and a change in recruitment policies
is already showing results, although it will not be until about 1975 that a
satisfactory staffing position will have been reached. S.T.E.G. retained
qualified auditors in 1969 and has made arrangements for the secondment
of a senior accountant from Electricite de France. The draft Loan Docu-
ments stipulate further improvements in manpower utilization and collection
of management control data.
19.       The project consists of constructing a 294 km. gas pipeline from
the El Borma oil field to a power plant being built by S.T.E.G. near Gabes
with French finance. It would comprise procurement and installation of:
(a) compressors and a gas treatment station as well as ancillary facili-
ties at the El Borma oil field; and (b) a transmission pipeline from El
Borma to the Gabes power plant. The plant will consist of two 30 MW
thermal generators, and is required to meet the increase in power demand ex-
pected by the 1972-73 winter season.
20.       The proposed Bank loan of $7.5 million would be made in con-
junction with a loan of $2.5 million equivalent from the Kuwait Fund for
Arab Economic Development under a joint financing arrangement with the Bank.
The two loans of together $10 million would cover the foreign exchange cost
of the project, whose total cost is estimated at $13.6 million. They would
include retroactive financing of engineering studies with a foreign exchange
cost of $380,000.
21.       The economic return of the plant and pipeline taken together is
estimated to be well in excess of 25 percent. The proposed project would
permit almost entire reliance on natural gas as fuel until 1979, but the
declining supply of natural gas and the growing electricity demand will
necessitate a substantial use of fuel oil from 1981 onward. It is estimated
that by 1986 the El Borma field will have reached its economic limit of
production. This, in turn, defines the life of the project although it is
possible that gas operation could continue beyond that date. Despite the
expected limited period of use, the gas pipeline would provide the least
costly method of supplying fuel to S.T.E.G.'s generating plant at Gabes.
To ensure STEG's financial viability and an adequate contribution from its
own resources toward future expansion, it has been agreed that STEG would
maintain a ratio of operating surplus to net fixed assets of at least 10
percent (Section 5.06 (a) of Draft Loan Agreement) and a debt equity ratio
not to exceed 45:55 (Section 5.07 (a) of Draft Loan Agreement). According
to projections debt service would always be covered adequately by the oper-
ating surplus, the coverage never falling below 1.7 during the life of the
loan.



22.       International competitive bidding is in progress.    Bidding pro-
cedures wer;; started last summer to have the pipeline in operation in time
for the sta,! -uD of the power plant (mid-1972).   Bids for most items have
be2n receive7.' :ad are presently being evaluated. No local bidders par-
ticipated.
23.       The Barlk would disburse 75 percent on all foreign exchange ex-
penditures, and the Kuwait Fund 25 p*rcent.    They would share responsibil-
ity for project supervision, and -C.J .(rk together in loan administra-
tion.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
24.       'The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and S.T.E.G., the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, the re-
port of the Committee, provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of tne
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of a Resolution approving
the propo-ed Loan are being distributed to the Executive 9irectors sep-
arately.
25.       Particular attention is drawn to (i) paragraph (b) of Sectiont
8.02 of the Loan Agreement which provides that in case the Kuwait Fund
Loan becomes due and payable in advance of its agreed maturity the Bank
can accelerate the maturity of its Loan; (ii) Section 8.03 of the Loan
Agreement which specifies, as an event of suspension of the Pank Loan,
that the right of the Borrower to withdraw the proceeds of the Kuwait
Fund Loan shall have been suspended in whole or in part; (iii) para-
graph (b) of Section 9.01 of the Loan Agreement which makes the ef-
fectiveness of the Bank L-oan Agreement conditional upon fulfillment of
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Kuwait Fund Loan Agree--
ment; and (iv) Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement requiring the
Guarantor to exercise its rights to purchase gas, under its agreement
of December 7, 1970 with Societe Italo-Tunisienne d'Exploitation
Petroliere which has the El Borma oil and gas concession, and not to
terminate or amend any of the Guarantor's rights under the agreement
without th.o prior appro-.'al of the Bank.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
26.       The most recent economic report on Tunisia dated May 4, 1970
(EMA-22a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 5, 1970., A
basic data sheet is attached.
27.       Tunisia's economic development during 1970 has, on the whole,
been less favorable than had been forecast. GDP at constant prices, which
at the 'beginning of thie year was expected to rise by 7.2 percent, grew by



not more than 4.5 percent. Agricultural production actually declined as a
good grain harvest was more than offset by poor olive and vegetable crops,
and a fall in livestock production. Output in most other sectorq also fell
short of expectations partly because of disruptions caused by the disastrous
floods in September/October 1969. Domestic demand, on the other hand, con-
tinued to rise strongly with public expenditures leading the way. Invest-
ment outlays increased by 12 percent while consumption expanded by 6 per-
cent. The combination of low production and buoyant demand put pressure
on prices and led to an 8 percent increase in imports. As exports grew
only slowly, the current account deficit in the balance of payments rose
by $24 million to an estimated $128 million. But the deficit was more than
covered by increased foreign aid, and reserves continued to rise moderately.
28.       Tunisia's economic development over the last few years had been
affected by unfavorable weather conditions, severe marketing constraints
especially for exports, and a number of organizational difficulties which
resulted in slow production growth, deteriorating public savings, increasing
inflationary pressures, and a high external debt burden. These factors have
contributed to the recent political changes and led to a serious search for
a more successful set of economic policies. The efforts culminated in a new
economic strategy, presented by the Prime Minister last November, which
aims at accelerating the growth of production and exports by reducing direct
government interference in economic decisions; encouraging private initia-
tive and entrepreneurship; and relying more extensively on market forces
as guide for investment and production. More specifically, the Government
has stated its intention to give priority to increasing agricultural output,
and to the promotion of labor intensive small and medium scale industrial
enterprises. Productivity and export orientatiou will be the principal
criteria for investment allocation. Workers' emigration will be encouraged
as an outlet for surplus labor, while efforts to control the increase in
population will be intensified.
29.       The new budget for 1971 which has just been presented to Parliament,
reflects already to some extent the changes in overall policy. It offers
incentives for private investors and reduces the amount of public capital
expenditure. Government investments will focus on the completion of ongoing
projects and on complementary works to raise the productivitv of existing
facilities. The expansion of current spending will be more limited and
selective than in previous years. Moreover, a major overhaul of the tax
structure has been started with the objective of removing existing produc-
tion and export disincentives.
30.       Stimulated by the new budget, private investment is expected to
rise substantially during 1971, particularly in the agricultural sector.
Agricultural production is likely to recover somewhat, especially since
favorable weather conditions are likely to produce a good olive crop. In-
dustrial output is expected to continue its moderate rise, concentrated
mainly in food processing and textiles. Crude oil production is unlikely
to grow, but considerable gains may be expected from tourism. Overall pro-
duction could be 6-8 percent higher than in 1970. This together with rising
imports and the fiscal restraint should reduce the inflationary pressure.



31.       However, much remains to be done to carry out the structural
reforms envisaged by the Government. Institutional changes will have to
be made and the responsibilities of government agencies, banks, and enter-
prises need to be newly defined in order to establish an efficient market
economy. Adequate export incentives will have to be given and a more
liberal exchange system is required. In addition, there is urgent need
for a reappraisal of sectoral policies. The Fourth Plan (1973-76) which
will soon be prepared, could play a leading role in the implementation
of the necessary economic reforms.
32.       Tunisia's external debt burden is high.    In 1970, about 25 per-
cent of gross foreign exchange earnings had to be spent on servicing
external debt obligations, most of it for public and publicly-guaranteed
debt. The structure of external debt, however, has been considerably im-
proved in recent years by reducing the amount of new short and medium-term
borrowing and,while payments on present debts will still remain large in
coming years, there is scope for some additional borrowing on conventional
terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
34.       I recommend that the Executive Directors of the Bank approve
the proposed loan.
