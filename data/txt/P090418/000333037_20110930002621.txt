1.     The Closing Date for the Serbia Consolidation of Collection and Pension
Administration Reform Project for Serbia (PARIP), Credit No. 40710, P090418, will be
extended from September 30, 2011 until September 30, 2012. This will be the second
extension of the project, for a cumulative period of 24 months

2.      The credit in the amount of SDR 16.6 million was approved by the Board of
Directors in May, 2005. It aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the
pension system through: the modernization and streamlining of the institutional capacity
in the pension system; improved pension system administration; developed capacity for
policy identification, analysis and monitoring; and increased public understanding of the
system. There were three components: consolidation of collection and reporting;
consolidation and institutional strengthening of the PAYGO funds; and pension policy
analysis and development.

3.      The first two years of project implementation suffered from delays due to political
instability and frequent changes in government. Subsequently, following a renewed
commitment from the Project’s key stakeholders, improved inter-agency cooperation, and
intensified efforts from the implementing agency, several legislative amendments and
enactments necessary to create the environment and framework for advancing the project
agenda were completed - i.e. the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance and the Law
on Voluntary Pension Funds and Pension Schemes have been amended, and the Law on
Central Registry of Compulsory Social Insurance has been enacted. In addition, several
key project results were achieved, including: the administrative and financial
consolidation of the three PAYGO pension funds has been completed; pension modeling
capacities have been built within the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP)
enabling better pension system monitoring; and job skills in beneficiary institutions have
been enhanced through training and educational courses. Also, significant progress has
been made towards the modernization of the entire pension system administration - the
new business processes in the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (PDIF) and the
Central Registry have been defined and the revision of the business processes related to
collection of social contributions in the Tax Department is in its final phase.

4.      In spite of the substantial implementation progress, it became apparent during
2010 that the slow start to the Project had impacted on the procurement schedule and the
Project’s IT activities (hardware procurement, software development and IT consultant
services) that are needed to modernize business processes and facilitate implementation
of the reform agenda would require additional time to complete. While it was assessed
that the finalization of all activities that were envisaged under the Project would require

                                            3
additional 24 months, the Client requested a shorter extension to ensure tight focus of key
policy-makers and all institutions on the Project-supported work. Accordingly, the
Country Director approved a 12-month extension of the Project Closing Date from
September 30, 2010 to September 30, 2011.

5.      The implementation progress during the first extension continued. Currently,
most project activities have either been completed or are in final stages of
implementation, including the largest procurement process, the development of the
Central Registry Information System (CRIS), which has been finalized and the
implementation has started. However, the CRIS development, as well as a few additional
project activities critical for the achievement of Project Development Objectives will not
be completed by the Project Closing Date. This is primarily due to the logical sequencing
of these activities – the revision of existing business processes and the identification of
new ones had to be completed to enable the procurement of their development and
implementation.

6.      The extension would enable finalization of three key areas: (i) the development
of the Central Registry Information System (CRIS); (ii) software customization packages
in the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (PDIF); and (iii) implementation of the new
business processes for the contribution collection system in the Tax Department. Taking
each in turn:

               i. The procurement process for the engagement of the CRIS developer
                  has proven to be complex and accounted for a very protracted process.
                  This was the largest IT procurement package in Serbia, so it attracted
                  lots of interest by potential bidders, resulting in a high number of
                  questions and requests for clarifications. Also, the size and complexity
                  of bids and relative lack of experience of the evaluation committee in
                  handling such big procurements resulted in a somewhat longer
                  evaluation process.       The US$6.6 million contract with the
                  hardware/software supplier for the Central Registry was finally signed
                  on August 17, 2011. The Government has set up a solid project
                  management structure consisting of a number of teams of inter-agency
                  experts to work closely with teams of the contractor. Besides, two
                  international experts for management of similar tasks are about to be
                  recruited (the procurement process has been completed, but the
                  contracts will be signed if the extension is granted) to facilitate the
                  development. A detailed Critical Path Analysis has been developed.
                  It indicates that the development, installation and testing of the entire
                  CRIS will require 12 months, so the Project extension will allow its
                  completion.

               ii. The identification of the new business processes for the PDIF has been
                   completed, and the extension would allow for software customization
                   that was planned to support new business processes. The procurement
                   process for the document management, archive and storage systems
                   has been initiated, while the procurement process for the management
                   information system, HR and FM management systems is expected to

                                            4
                  be initiated if the extension is approved. Both activities would be fully
                  completed, with new business processes in place and fully tested by
                  the new closing date of the Project. Also, the extension would allow
                  for the data migration in the PDIF.

              iii. Finally, the extension will also allow for the modernization of the
                   contribution collection system in the Tax Department. The new
                   business processes are currently been identified, and it is expected that
                   the procurement process for their development, implementation and
                   testing would be initiated in October, and all the work completely
                   finalized by September 2012. The reform in Tax Department has been
                   supported by the International Monetary Fund’s resident advisor, and
                   the management of this task will be coordinated by an experienced
                   international expert financed under the project.

7.     The Action Plan for the remaining activities, as well as a detailed implementation
plan for the CRIS development have been submitted to the Word Bank team, and the
teams agreed that the revised Procurement Plan would get approved immediately
following the extension of the Project. Both the Action Plan and the CRIS development
plan show that all the remaining activities can be completed within the proposed revised
Closing Date. Also, to facilitate coordination among institutions and ensure smooth
implementation, the Government has selected two international experts – one for the Tax
Department, and another one for the PDIF and the Central Registry. Both have
substantial experience in managing similar projects, and the latter has been working with
both institutions in the past.

8.     Both the PDO and Implementation Progress (IP) ratings continue to be
Moderately Satisfactory. As of August 31, 2011, 91% of the Credit has been contracted
(US$22.7 million), and to date 60% (US$15.8 million) has been disbursed. The recently
signed US$6.6 million hardware/software contract for the Central Registry accounts for
about 26% of the Credit, and will be disbursed within the extension period.

9.    There are no outstanding audit reports for this project and the financial
management rating is Satisfactory.

10.     The Borrower has submitted a written request for the extension of the current
Project Closing Date (see Attachment 1), an Action Plan for the completion of the Project
during extension period (see Attachment 2) and a revised Procurement Plan (available
upon request). The Action Plan has been reviewed by the World Bank team and is found
acceptable. The World Bank team supports the requested extension.
