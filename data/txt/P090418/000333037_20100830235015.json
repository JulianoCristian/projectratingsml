From the\n            time of its effectiveness in June 2005, the project has\n            suffered implementation delays as a result of political\n            instability and frequent changes in government. Both the\n            project development objective rating and its Implementation\n            progress rating are moderately satisfactory. It is the\n            Bank's assessment that an 18 month extension will be\n            prudent to ensure the completion of the development of the\n            majority of the software solutions for the business\n            processes, services and procurement of hardware for the\n            central registry. The Government is, however, optimistic\n            that the work can be finalized within 12 months and has\n            objected to a longer extension at this time. Thus, this\n            request is for a 12 month extension only. The Government has\n            prepared a detailed action plan for the completion of the\n            remaining project activities reflecting the one year\n            extension. The action plan is found acceptable to the Bank.\n            Should the completion of this project activity exceed the\n            requested one year extension of the closing date, the\n            Government has committed to financing remaining activities\n            from its own resources. Alternatively, in such case, the\n            Government could request another short extension and the\n            World Bank team will be amenable to considering such a\n            request. There are no outstanding audit reports for this\n            project and the financial management rating is satisfactory.\n            This will be the first extension of the project closing date."}, "docdt": "2010-08-19T00:00:00Z"}
