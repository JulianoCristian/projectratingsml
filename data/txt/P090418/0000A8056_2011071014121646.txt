                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In spite of evident progress in project-supported reforms in all beneficiary institutions, the previous concerns about the finalization of all project activities by the closing date of the
                         project remain. Moreover, it is now clear that, despite the one-year project extension, some project activities will not be completed by the Project Closing Date. This primarily refers

                         implementation against the milestones established in the action plan, discussed delays in the implementation of remaining project activities, and agreed upon actions that would
                         facilitate further implementation and improve the likelihood of finalization of most project activities within the current Project Closing Date. The Government team confirmed its
                         commitment to the project and the plan to ensure the continuation of an intensified implementation schedule, and its intention to request an extension of the closing date of the
                         project. While there is no certainty that the second extension of the closing date of the project would be granted, it is certain that any possible consideration of extension would
                         definitely be based on progress in implementation over the remaining Project implementation period. Such progress will be measured based on the milestones set in the Action Plan.
