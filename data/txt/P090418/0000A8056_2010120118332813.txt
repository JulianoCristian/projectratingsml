                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite the very slow start of the Project, implementation has accelerated since the Mid-Term Review, in October 2009. The concept of the new consolidated system has been
                         agreed and translated into the Law on Central Registry, adopted by the Parliament in May 2010. Data registries at the Tax Department and the Pension and Disability Insurance

                         closing date has now been extended until September 30, 2011 to allow for finalization of remaining activities under the Project, and an action plan was created to facilitate Project
                         implementation. Following the extension of the closing date, the progress with implementation has continued. There is, however, still a considerable number of activities that will
                         need to be completed. The teams revised the progress on all the remaining activities and concluded that their timely finalization will only be possible if there are no delays in their
                         implementation.
