1. The Closing Date for the Consolidation of Collection and Pension Administration Reform
   Project for Serbia (PARIP), Credit 40710, will be extended from September 30, 2010 until
   September 30, 2011.

2. From the time of its effectiveness in June 2005, the Project has suffered implementation
   delays as a result of political instability and frequent changes in government. Both the Project
   Development Objective rating and its Implementation progress rating are Moderately
   Satisfactory. However, with a one year extension the project would be on track to meet its
   development objective allowing the implementation performance to be upgraded to
   Satisfactory. Furthermore since early 2010, there has been a significant improvement in
   implementation progress due to a concerted government effort that includes increased inter-
   agency cooperation and agreement on an implementation plan), improved management of
   procurement processes, and greater project monitoring. Disbursement has reached 36
   percent of the total credit amount of SDR16.6 million (US$25 million equivalent), and there
   are a number of important procurement packages underway which should result in another
   US$3.5 million (14% of the total credit amount) committed by the end of September, 2010.

3. It is the Bank's assessment that an 18 month extension would be prudent to ensure the
   completion of the development of the majority of the software solutions for the business
   processes, services and procurement of hardware for the Central Registry. The Government
   is, however, optimistic that the work can be finalized within 12 months and has objected to a
   longer extension at this time. Thus, this request is for a 12 month extension only. The
   Government has prepared a detailed Action Plan for the completion of the remaining project
   activities reflecting the proposed one year extension. The Action Plan is found acceptable to
   the Bank. Should the completion of this project activity exceed the requested one year
   extension of the Closing Date, the Government has committed to financing remaining
   activities from its own resources. Alternatively, in such case, the Government could request
   another short extension and the World Bank team would be amenable to considering such a
   request.

4. There are no outstanding audit reports for this project and the financial management rating is
   Satisfactory. This will be the first extension of the project Closing Date.
