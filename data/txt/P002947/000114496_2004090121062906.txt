Re: Structural Adjustment Credit
Credit Number 2314-UG (Amendment)
Dear Minister Mayanja -Nkangi,
            I refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the
      Structural Adjustment Credit dated December 12, 1991,
      between the Republic of Uganda (the Borrower) and the
      International Development Association (the Association), and
      to your request for an amendment of the Development credit
      Agreement to permit use of the special Account for petroleum
      products.
            In order to implement your request, which we find
      acceptable, we propose to amend the Development Credit
      Agreement, as follows:
            Paragraph 1 (a) of Schedule 4 to the Development Credit
            Agreement is amended to read as follows:
            "(a)   the term "Eligible Expenditures" means
      expenditures in respect of the reasonable cost of goods
      required during the execution of the Program and to be
      financed out of the proceeds of the Credit allocated from time
      to time to Categories (1) and (2) set forth in the table in
      paragraph (1) of Schedule 1 to this Agreement."
           Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing proposed
      amendment by signing, dating and returning the enclosed copy
      of this letter to us, at which time the amendment shall
      constitute a binding agreement between the Borrower and the
      Association.
Very truly yours,
International Development Association
