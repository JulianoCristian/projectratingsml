                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The partial success of the reforms on business environment has invigorated government's efforts to do more hence further support to the Doing Business Steering committee will
                         further enhance the sustainability of outcomes achieved this far. However, there would be no need to extend the closing date.
