1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.              The Islamic Republic of Mauritania was, and still is vast and sparsely
populated. At the time of project preparation, 800,000 of its 3.1 million people lived in the
capital city of Nouakchott. Mauritania’s economy was, and still is, constrained by low
levels of industrialization and a heavily concentrated export base. The two main
commodities – fish and iron ore – account for about three-quarters of exports, and they
remain vulnerable to sharp swings in international prices and external demand.

2.             The Business Environment Enhancement Project was prepared from 2006
to 2008 – a period of significant political and economic change in Mauritania. Following a
bloodless coup d’état in August 2005, a democratization process started and the country
held a presidential election in March 2007.

3.            At the time of project preparation, Mauritania was pursuing sustained
macroeconomic and sector adjustment reforms that laid the ground for private-sector-led
growth. In 2006, Mauritania started to produce oil. Despite some fluctuation, gross
domestic product (GDP) growth was robust, recording growth of 11.7 percent that year.
Fiscal performance was high, reflecting the government’s efforts to collect revenue.
Sustained spending discipline and strict adherence to fiscal and monetary policies helped
reduce the 12-month inflation rate to an average of 6.2 percent in 2006. Despite this
progress, however, there was little change in the country’s poverty levels.

4.             In 2007, the government made economic diversification its priority as it was
articulated in Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2007-2011. The CAS identified three
focus areas to achieve this goal for FY08–FY11: economic governance and public sector
capacity; diversified growth through an improved investment climate and, potentially, key
enabling infrastructure; and fighting poverty and inequality. The strategy also
acknowledged that the formal private sector was small and its development hampered by
regulatory challenges.

5.              The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), the Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA), and Doing Business reports identified a range of constraints on the
growth of the private and financial sectors in Mauritania, including limited access to and
the high cost of finance; weak legal, regulatory, and judicial frameworks; a poor regulatory
environment for businesses; and inadequate infrastructure. This supported the World
Bank’s decision to develop a private sector development project in Mauritania after more
than five years of absence (the last World Bank private sector development project ended
in 2000).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.             The original project development objective (PDO) was “to enhance the
business climate through improvements in the financial, legal, and judiciary sectors, and
regulatory environment for enterprises”. This would facilitate private-sector-led
growth/investment in the economy, and improve the public services that directly affect
private development. The PDO was worded consistently in the project appraisal document
(PAD) and Development Finance Agreement (DFA).

7.                Four key PDO indicators were chosen during the project’s appraisal:
          •    Reduction of non-performing loans.
          •    Reduction of the number of procedures required to establish a business.
          •    Increase in the percentage of commercial court decisions published on the
               government website or any other sites agreed with the International
               Development Association.
          •    Signed performance contracts with the government by public enterprises that
               have been operationally and financially audited under this project.

8.            The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework in Annexure 3 omitted
the fourth PDO indicator, creating an inconsistency in the document. However, the list of
PDO indicators in the DFA is consistent with the main text of the PAD. In addition, the
PAD identified nine intermediate indicators, which are presented in Table 1.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

9.            With the level 1 project restructuring, approved on May 22, 2013, the PDO
was revised. The project was restructured to improve the slow progress in implementation
and disbursement and to align project objectives with new government priorities –
reforming the investment climate to foster private and financial sector growth and
development was considered the top priority. 1 The project’s new PDO was “to enhance the
business climate for financial institutions and other targeted private sector enterprises in
Mauritania.” Notably, the revised objective removed reference to the legal and judiciary
sector.

10.             The PDO indicators were reduced from four to two. An indicator associated
with the legal and judiciary sector and an indicator related to state-owned enterprise reform
were dropped. The two retained indicators were as follows:

    •   Number of procedures required to establish a business is reduced (taken from
        original indicators).
    •   Percentage of credits reported to the credit registry increases (new indicator).

11.            The restructured project adopted seven intermediate indicators, of which
three were retained from the original list of indicators and four were new. These changes
are summarized in Table 1.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.             The PAD did not have a section dedicated to describing the project
beneficiaries, but the targeted groups can be inferred from the text. The ultimate project
beneficiary is the private sector, including companies – both large and small – microfinance
institutions, and banks. The PAD also identified various public sector beneficiaries,
including the Délégation Générale à la Promotion de l’Investissement Privé (DGPIP), the
government’s investment promotion unit under the Prime Minister’s office; Société
Mauritanienne d'Electricité (SOMELEC), the state electricity company; Mauripost, the
state postal service company; the Port of Nouakchott; and the Central Bank of Mauritania.
The project’s capacity building was also expected to benefit the Ministry of Justice and the
judiciary.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13.             The project was designed with three components: improve the business
climate to foster private sector development, build public-private partnerships and enhance
productivity, and support project implementation. The first component focused on
strengthening the financial sector and improving access to finance, improving the legal and
judicial framework for business and financial activities, and streamlining the regulatory
environment for businesses. The second component was dedicated to improving corporate
governance in public enterprises, namely by introducing performance contracts,
implementing utility reform to foster private sector participation, and enhancing the long-
term electricity-sector planning functions.

14.            The DGPIP, under the Prime Minister’s office, was responsible for the
project’s overall coordination. While staff members were to be provided by the DGPIP, the
third component would cover the cost of capacity building in the following areas: financial
management according to international accounting standards, procurement of goods and
consultant services, annual reporting to the International Development Association, M&E,
audits, and public information.

1.6 Revised Components

15.             By the time the mid-term review (MTR) was conducted in September 2012,
the project team had already raised a number of issues through successive ISRs. The MTR
confirmed these issues, and the World Bank and the Government of Mauritania agreed to
the restructuring. The project team made the following key observations about the project’s
progress during the mid-term review:

   •   There was a lack of traction to undertake public enterprise reforms.
   •   There was no champion for the judiciary subcomponent.
   •   The government was emphasizing the importance of undertaking investment
       climate reforms and developing the Nouadhibou special economic zone (SEZ).

16.              Based on these changes in circumstances, the government submitted an
official request for a level 1 restructuring. The restructuring aimed to build on the project’s
early wins by enhancing the supervision capacity of the Central Bank of Mauritania and
opening the country’s financial sector. The restructured project would boost the effort to
improve the investment climate in order to further enhance private sector development.
Three priority areas for the investment climate, as defined by Doing Business, were
selected: starting a business, paying taxes, and getting credit. The project placed a renewed
emphasis on supporting the Nouadhibou SEZ, while the planned activities for public
enterprise reform and judiciary capacity building were dropped.

17.            The project end date was also extended by one year to account for the one-
year delay in implementation as a result of the World Bank’s suspended operations in
Mauritania after the coup d’état.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Project based on sound analysis

20.            The project was designed from 2006 to 2008 – the year it was approved.
There was little institutional memory of the previous private sector development project,
which closed in 2000, to inform the new project, but its design did benefit from several
high-quality analytical documents, including the Financial Sector Assessment Program, the
Investment Climate Assessment, the Enterprise Survey, Doing Business reports, and the
Doing Business reform memo. The project was also guided by several strategic documents,
including the Country Assistance Strategy (FY08–FY11) and the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (2006–2011). The project was prepared in close partnership with the Central
Bank of Mauritania, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Economic and
Development Affairs. 3

Sufficient donor coordination

21.             Donor coordination was sufficient. The project team mapped out the
relevant activities in Mauritania during the project preparation phase. In particular, the
World Bank was in close communication with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
about public enterprise reforms.

Project preparation facility contributed to early wins

22.             A project preparation facility was put in place in November 2006 to draft a
banking law, conduct a feasibility study on a refinancing mechanism for microfinance
institutions, and review performance contracts for public enterprises. The facility played
an important role in achieving the project’s early wins, such as the country’s adoption of
banking and microfinance laws.

Complex project design for a client with limited capacity affected the initial phase

23.            The project appeared to be streamlined, with two operational components
and one administrative component focused on developing the financial sector and
improving the business-enabling environment. However, on further examination, each
component had a number of individual activities, which posed a challenge for execution.
This was exacerbated by the project’s many stakeholders and the wide-ranging expertise
needed to oversee the project’s implementation. Although many small activities are
necessary in a project aiming to build an ecosystem to support private sector development,
this project became too complex by attempting to address too many challenges. This,
combined with the client’s weak implementation capacity, made the project overly
ambitious. The restructuring gave the project the opportunity to address the shortcomings
and significantly reduce the complexity.

2.2 Implementation

Project restructuring

24.              The activities in the project were significantly streamlined during the
restructuring – those that had no traction were dropped, and the project refocused on the
government’s main priorities at that time. The restructuring also allowed the project to
align the results framework to demonstrate a clearer link between activities and targets.
The streamlining and refocusing of activities significantly improved the project’s
performance. Disbursement rate was already improving by the time the restructuring took
place, but it picked up significantly after the restructuring (60 percent in five years and four
months, including the one-year dormant period, and 40 percent in the two years following
the restructuring).




                                               8
Supervision requirements met

25.             With the exception of the suspension period, there were at least two
supervision missions a year throughout the project duration, often exceeding the required
two missions a year. The task team leader provided stability. There was a change of TTLs
from project preparation to implementation (handover when the project was approved), but
thereafter the task team leader remained in charge until December 2013, a year before the
project closed.

Political instability

26.             While the project was in operation, Mauritania experienced one coup d’état,
five cabinet reshuffles, and two presidential elections. This had a significant impact on the
project. Although the project was approved on May 22, 2008, it took more than a year to
be declared effective due to the coup d’état in the same year and the subsequent suspension
of World Bank operations in the country from August 2008 to September 2009. The project
was declared effective on December 28, 2009 after the World Bank lifted OP7.30. 4 The
many cabinet reshuffles affected the continuity in the project’s implementation.

Lack of a functioning project implementation unit

27.             The project was originally managed by the DGPIP in the Prime Minister’s
office. The Mauritanian government insisted that the project should use the existing
structure and staff, which is why it did not set up an independent project implementation
unit (PIU). Following the DGPIP’s dissolution, the project’s management was moved to
the Commissariat pour la Promotion de l’Investissement (CPI) in the President’s office.
However, the CPI was also dissolved, and all employees including the project staff were
let go on January 25, 2011. To avoid penalties for eliminating the PIU, which was a
violation of the financing agreement, the government had the project temporarily managed
by a different, existing PIU. Later, a new PIU was created under the Ministry of
Development and Economic Affairs. This PIU was staffed with consultants competitively
selected according to the World Bank’s guidelines and remunerated by the project. A team
was recruited in November 2011, but the coordinator was deemed unsatisfactory during
the probation period. As a result, yet another selection process took place. Although the
probation period ended in May 2012, a new coordinator was not hired until July 2012. In
early 2013, there was yet another change in project coordinator. These disruptions resulted
in a dysfunctional PIU, which ultimately delayed the project’s implementation.

2.3 M&E Design, and Implementation and Utilization

Design

29.              During the decision meeting and the quality enhancement review, it was
agreed that the Business Environment Enhancement Project’s indicators should be closely
linked to tangible results of an improved financial and judicial system and investment
climate. However, when the M&E framework was examined against the proposed
activities, the theory of change to support the framework was unclear. The original PDO,
“to enhance the business climate through improvements in the financial, legal, and
judiciary sectors, and regulatory environment for enterprises,” was measured using four
indicators: non-performing loans, number of procedures to establish a business, the level
of published commercial court decisions, and the number of signed performance contracts
by public enterprises. The selected indicators were not inadequate, but were insufficient to

                                                       10
measure such a vast subject as “improved investment climate.” The intermediate indicators
were able to monitor limited aspects of the PDO, such as investment climate as defined by
the business registration regulatory framework or tax administration. However, they
missed out on others, such as progress towards lowering non-performing loans.

30.             During the restructuring it was acknowledged that the original design had
an unrealistic expectation of the time needed to improve non-performing loans. 5 The
restructuring paper concluded that the project’s proposed activities were not adequately
linked to this objective. To establish a better results chain, the use of non-performing loan
as an indicator was replaced with the percentage of credits reported to the credit registry.
This new indicator was linked to a causal effect that could be established within a
reasonable timeframe. However, the new set of approved indicators were still somewhat
limited in their ability to measure the broad reform areas of the financial, legal, and
judiciary sectors, and the regulatory environment for enterprises.

31.             The project had an appropriate baseline and targets, as approved by the
PAD. All the indicators were measurable. M&E technical assistance was provided to the
project unit members (civil servants) at the start of the project. The reliance on Doing
Business meant that the indicators were externally validated and readily available annually.
However, the project team may have placed too much emphasis on the Doing Business
data to understand the investment climate, and by doing so, it may have missed out on the
opportunity to identify indicators that could have been more relevant to measure the project
results.

Implementation and utilization

32.            Since most of the indicators were from the Doing Business Report, which
comes out once a year, the M&E data gathering was an uncomplicated process. Successive
ISRs were able to complete the M&E despite the fact that the project operated without an
M&E specialist with the exception of the last six months. During the restructuring the team
assessed the historical M&E data to inform the project’s next steps. The lack of progress
on the M&E indicators played an important role in the decision to implement a level 1
restructuring. However, as noted above, the heavy reliance on the Doing Business
indicators may have limited the discussions on Mauritania’s real priorities in terms of the
financial and private sector development agenda.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial management

33.           The project’s financial management performance was satisfactory.
Financial monitoring reports and audit reports were acceptable and submitted in a timely
manner. Audit opinions were unqualified during most of the project’s duration.

Procurement

34.             Successive aide-memoires highlighted concerns about the delay of
procurement. The main reason for the delay was the procurement procedures imposed by
the government, in addition to the World Bank’s guidelines. The government instituted a
committee to review all procurement, including those handled by World Bank projects. All
contracts above a certain threshold required the Minister’s signature, which caused
significant delays. There were also several complaints brought to the committee by
unsuccessful bidders – in some cases the PIU was asked to re-open the procurement process
after a lengthy review. Following investigation these complaints were deemed unfounded.

Safeguards

35.            Overall compliance with safeguard policies was satisfactory. The PAD did
not identify any safeguard issues and the project was classified as a category C project,
involving technical assistance, analytics, and capacity building, with no works. There were
no safeguard issues during implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36.            The project financed several activities that helped the government make
progress in developing the Nouadhibou SEZ, including a feasibility study of the zone, the
legal and regulatory framework to manage it, and technical assistance to establish a one-
stop-shop for business registration in the Nouadhibou SEZ. As a result of this support, the
government has asked the World Bank to develop the zone further (P151058). If designed
and implemented well, this new project could address several key constraints to private
sector development in Mauritania.

37.           Another tangible contribution that the project made to Mauritania was the
financing of the private sector development strategy. The strategy, according to the
managing director of the DGPSP (a unit mandated to support private sector development
under the Ministry of Development and Economic Affairs), has led to support from the
African Development Bank and the United Nations Development Program. 6 The United
Nations Development Program currently has a $10 million engagement in the country. The
program was already working in Mauritania, but the strategy helped re-orient the resources.
The African Development Bank launched a $24 million project for inclusive growth in the
country in 2014, which was developed based on the private sector development strategy.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: High (original) and Substantial (revised)

38.            The Business Environment Enhancement Project objectives were highly
relevant to the Country Assistance Strategy FY08–FY11, which had the following three
pillars: economic governance and public sector capacity; diversified growth through
improved investment climate and, potentially, key enabling infrastructure; and fighting
poverty and inequality.

39.             The project was designed to contribute to the first two pillars. The reform
of public enterprises as measured by one of the four PDO indicators – the number of signed
performance contracts by public enterprises – directly contributed to the first pillar. An
improvement in the judiciary sector, as measured by the number of decisions published,
also contributed to the economic governance theme in the first pillar by improving
transparency. The PDO, “to enhance the business climate,” was well aligned with the
second pillar. The activities implemented were based on recommendations from high-
quality analytical pieces.

40.             The project maintained its relevance after the restructuring, contributing to
the two pillars of the Country Partnership Strategy 2014–2017: growth and diversification,
and economic governance and service delivery – but perhaps somewhat less directly. 7 The
revised PDO, “to enhance the business climate for financial institutions and other targeted
private sector enterprises in Mauritania,” contributed to the first pillar, based on the premise
that improving the investment climate is a prerequisite for private-sector-led growth. This
argument may be even stronger in the 2015 economic context, where the commodity price
has fallen sharply. With the reduction of revenue from the export of iron ore, there is a
more pressing need to diversify the Mauritanian economy. A lower rating (“Substantial”)
than the pre-restructuring phase (“High”) was assigned because the activities that could
have made the project more relevant to the country’s development strategy – public
enterprise reforms and judiciary sector reforms – were dropped.

Relevance of Design: Negligible (original) and Modest (revised)

41.            As discussed in the previous section, the project’s design had a number of
issues, including a long list of complex activities, many stakeholders, and a lack of a
coherent results chain linked to activities. The original PDO’s four indicators were not
inadequate, but failed to capture the impact of the project comprehensively due to the vast
and ambitious objective. The choice of intermediate indicators was adequate to monitor
progress towards achieving limited aspects of the PDO, but it did not capture the progress
towards the PDO in a comprehensive manner.

42.              The main achievements during the first half of the project did not fit with
the original PDO and its key indicators. The achievements – the opening of the financial
sector and the improvement of the Central Bank’s supervision capacity – are discussed
further in the next section (para 47). As important as these achievements might be, in the
absence of any explicit mention in the M&E framework, or accompanying TAs (to gauge
the level of policy dialogue on the financial sector development issues), these achievements
almost appear as a fortunate accident.

43.             The restructuring addressed some of the challenges discussed above,
particularly the project’s complex design. The team narrowed the range of reforms by
removing activities that were less relevant to the PDO, such as labor flexibility. However,
the project’s fundamental challenge still remained: How can something as vast as “the
improvement of the investment climate” be measured in a meaningful manner? In the
absence of an answer, the project continued to rely on a limited number of Doing Business
indicators – starting a business and paying tax. In addition, the restructuring paper lacked
robust analyses that would have helped the project team prioritize and sequence activities.
This was particularly felt in the financial sector development component.

Relevance of Implementation: Negligible (original) and Modest (revised)

44.             Before the project was restructured it attained two important achievements.
First, the government adopted several laws and implementation regulations related to the
financial sector – banking law, microfinance law, and loan recovery law. Second, the
project enhanced the Central Bank’s supervision capacity, which helped improve the
soundness of Mauritania’s financial sector. The project also financed two studies (a power
generation master plan and a sector tariff study) that benefited the power sector. Both
studies significantly contributed to the Banda Gas to Power Project (300 megawatts)
preparation and the addition of renewable energy capacity in Mauritania, which will help
reduce the cost of power supply.

45.             Although these achievements are important in creating the foundation for
private sector development, they were not relevant to the project’s results framework. As
a result, despite these achievements, the midterm review concluded that none of the four
PDO indicators were met and only one of the five intermediate indicators achieved its
objective. Other activities, which could have had a more direct impact on the PDO, such
as improving the dissemination of legal information (for increasing the publication of court
decisions), public enterprise audits, and the design of performance contracts (for signing
performance contracts for public enterprises) were not implemented due to lack of
stakeholder interest.

46.            After the restructuring, the project’s activities were more aligned with the
PDO and associated indicators. The team made a concerted effort to operationalize Guichet
Unique for business registration, which involved regulatory reforms, institutional
development, capacity building, and providing equipment. As a result, strong results on
business registration were achieved, as measured by the PDO and intermediate indicators.

                                            14
However, no meaningful progress was made towards improving tax administration. In fact,
Mauritania scored a negative reform on the Doing Business paying tax indicator in 2014.
The project’s focus on business registration reforms alone was narrow when compared with
the ambitious PDO to improve the investment climate. Other activities that would have had
a significant impact on the broader investment climate if implemented properly, such as
judiciary reforms, were dropped during the restructuring for valid reasons, as discussed
earlier.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (efficacy)

Rating: Modest (original) and Substantial (revised)

47.            During the first half of the project, from inception to restructuring, none of
the four PDO indicators were achieved and one of the five intermediate indicators was
achieved – the only notable positive result was the reduction of the cost of starting a
business, as measured by Doing Business. Successive ISRs highlighted the lack of progress
and the mid-term review confirmed this, as measured by the key indicators. 8 The results
are summarized in Table 4.

48.             However, some important achievements are worth noting. As discussed
previously, Mauritania has adopted banking and microfinance laws and regulations, which
have strengthened the financial sector. Although the target was not met, non-performing
loans have more than halved. Based on the Financial Sector Assessment Program’s
recommendation, and the passing of the banking law financed by the project, several new
banks received a license from the Central Bank of Mauritania, including two foreign banks,
which has increased competition. Interest rates have dropped from an average of 14 percent
in 2006 to 9 percent in 2010, while maintaining a low credit-to-GDP ratio. 9 While it is
difficult to establish the causality between the activities financed by the project and the
lowering of the interest rate, it could be argued that the new banking law has improved the
business climate in Mauritania by lowering the cost of financing, which is a critical element
of private sector development. Domestic private credit as a percentage of GDP has dropped
from 31.1 percent in 2009 to 29.2 percent in 2010 and 27.1 percent in 2011. 10 Since then,
however, it has started to rise again, recording 30.5% in 2012, and it is clear that more work
is needed to improve the financial sector in Mauritania.

49.            During the project restructuring, four PDO indicators became two. Two key
indicators were removed, one remained unchanged (number of procedures to start a
business), and another indicator was added (percentage of credits reported). According to
the Doing Business report published in October 2014 (one month before the project ended),
seven procedures are required to start a business in Mauritania, which falls short of the
target of five. The Mauritanian government claims that further reforms have been
undertaken since May 2014 (the cut-off date for the Doing Business 2015 data). The results
validation mission believes the claim of five procedures to start a business is warranted,
however, the verdict of the Doing business report will be delivered only in October 2015.
The government also claims that the number of days required to start a business is less than
seven days. This requires further probing.

50.             The project’s support to improve the procedure to register businesses
contributed to 5,643 new businesses registering during 2014 11 (according to Guichet
Unique, which became operational in late 2013). According to Doing Business, at the level
of minimum capital requirement for Mauritania as of 2014 (331 percent of gross national
income per capita, which is $1,060), 12 each business would have to spend at least $3,508.60
in start-up costs. This translates to $20 million invested by new businesses in 2014 alone.
It should be noted, however, that the reform to reduce the minimum capital requirement
will reduce start-up costs per business over time.

51.             Reducing the procedures and costs to register a business since the reforms
were implemented a year before the project closed has led to cost savings of $900,000 for
the private sector, and will save a further $2.5 million over the next three years.

52.             The Business Environment Enhancement Project also helped modernize the
financial information system of the Directorate General for Banking Supervision at the
Central Bank. The new system, along with the revised regulation on credit reporting, has
improved access to credit information. With support from the project, the bank regulation
was revised to reduce the threshold for reporting commercial loans. Under this regulation,
all loans of 3,000 Mauritanian ouguiyas ($10) and above should be reported in the system.
As a result of this reform, 100 percent of credits are reported to the credit registry. A credit
bureau is under construction.

53.            Of the seven intermediate indicators, four were fully met and one was
partially met. One notable regression was the number of tax payments. 13 Table 5
summarizes the results.

54.            The project also helped improve the Central Bank’s capacity for
supervision, including monitoring and analyzing financial and monetary statistics. A total
of 83 staff members from the Central Bank benefited from training on banking supervision,
accounting, and information system management. Thanks to the project, the number of
supervisors doubled from 15 to 30. The project also upgraded the information system from
a rudimentary MS Excel spreadsheet to a new system based on JAVA and MYSQL, with
a secure connection. This progress is acknowledged by the IMF’s 2014 Article IV
Consultation Staff Report. The Central Bank has “adopted regulation on risk classification,
provisioning and bank governance, and is developing risk-based supervision procedures
and on-site inspection methodology. Supervisory capacity has also been strengthened with
new personnel for inspections and IT systems to support real-time data transmission.” 14

   The paying taxes indicator measures the taxes and mandatory contributions that the case study company
must pay in its second year of operation. The 2015 Doing Business Report assessed taxation as it applied to
the case study company in calendar year 2013. Starting from January 1, 2013, the health insurance
contribution was introduced in Mauritania, as envisaged by Law No. 2012-007 adopted on February 7, 2012.
The new health insurance contribution is levied on gross salaries at the following rates: employee contribution
is 4 percent and the employer contribution is 5 percent of the gross salaries. The new health insurance
contribution is paid monthly and separately from the social security contribution, which was already captured
by the Doing Business study. Therefore, in accordance with the methodology of the paying taxes indicator,
12 payments were added to the number of payments that the case study company would need to make, and
the total tax payments increased from 37 to 49.

55.             The project provided valuable support in developing a master plan for the
electricity sector, which, according to the Ministry of Petroleum, Energy, and Mining, is
considered the most important blueprint for solving the energy crisis in Mauritania. The
project also conducted a tariff study for the national power utility SOMELEC. The master
plan has helped restore the ministry’s credibility with major donors, who have decided to
support the plan’s implementation, including the Band Gas to Power Project (300
megawatts). The plan has allowed the government to be less dependent on fuel by
increasing production capacity from local resources (mainly gas and hydroelectricity) and
enhancing renewable energy’s role in the country’s energy mix. Total electricity
production is expected to increase from 94 megawatts at the time of the project preparation
to at least 400 megawatts. 15

56.            The Business Environment Enhancement Project also opened dialogues
between the government and the private sector by facilitating many meetings between the
two parties and creating opportunities for exchange. During the results validation mission,
the private sector confirmed that the government has become more open to discussing
policy with the private sector.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Modest (original) and Substantial (revised)

57.             There was no economic and financial rate of returns analysis prepared at the
project’s inception, therefore the assessment here is more qualitative. A total of
$4.5 million was disbursed during the project, of which 60 percent was disbursed before
the restructuring and 40 percent after.

58.            There were limited achievements before the restructuring. Notable
accomplishments did not appear anywhere in the results chain (see Section 3.2 for a
detailed discussion of the project’s achievements).

59.            During the post-restructuring period, the government fully implemented the
business registration reform, resulting in $20 million in investments by new businesses in
2014 (see Section 3.2) – a positive result when measured against the total Business
Environment Enhancement Project cost of $5 million. A cross-country comparison would
be useful to put this figure in perspective, but data is scarce. One indicative comparison is
offered by a recent impact evaluation of two investment climate advisory services projects
in Africa, where a consultant estimated that Rwanda’s business regulation reforms
generated investments of between $33 million and $88 million (Rwanda’s economy is
nearly twice as big as Mauritania), while Liberia’s reforms resulted in investments of
between $1 million and $12 million (with an economy half the size of Mauritania). 16 Both
advisory projects had budgets comparable to the Mauritania project.

60.            An estimated $900,000 has been saved as a result of the business
registration reforms implemented in Mauritania (see Annexure 3 for methodology).
Although a direct comparison is difficult, similar projects involving business registration
reforms resulted in private sector cost savings of $5.7 million in Rwanda, $1.6 million in
Sierra Leone (with an economy about the same size as Mauritania), and $1 million in
Burkina Faso (almost three times bigger than Mauritania). 17

61.             The project spent about $350,000 on reforming business registration,
including regulatory reforms, advisory services, capacity building, and the provision of
hardware and software. As a result, 5,643 new firms have been registered – a $63
investment per firm. A direct comparison is found in Nicaragua, where the same activities
have been financed for three different business registration functions (national and sub-
national): $47, $101, and $198 in investment to create one firm. 18

Enhancement Project on or above par with the comparators in terms of project efficiency.
Stakeholders also said that the project was responsible for catalyzing energy investment to
increase Mauritania’s energy production capacity by 300 megawatts.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory (original) and Moderately Satisfactory (revised)

63.             The outcomes assessment was performed on the basis of a split evaluation
because the PDO and key project outcome indicators were formally changed during the
restructuring. The project outcomes were assessed based on the original and revised PDO,
weighted by disbursements.

64.            Under the original objective, the project is rated Unsatisfactory based on the
following ratings: relevance of objectives was High; relevance of design was Negligible;
relevance of implementation was Negligible; efficiency was Modest; and achievement of
the objective was Modest.

65.            Under the revised objective, the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory
based on the following ratings: relevance of objective was Substantial; relevance of design
was Modest; relevance of implementation was Modest; efficiency was Substantial and
achievement of the objective was Substantial.

66.            When these two ratings are weighted by disbursements, the project’s score
is 3 – moderately unsatisfactory. Given the higher disbursements before the restructuring,
driven by the delay in proceeding with the restructuring, the score is weighted towards the
negative.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

67.             The project did not have any specific activities targeting women, or offer
direct support to micro, small, and medium businesses, with the exception of the adoption


                                                 20
of the microfinance law. As a result, it is difficult to claim that the project has reduced
poverty, improved the gender balance, or contributed to social development.

68.            However, one positive point to note is that the proportion of the project’s
female beneficiaries, as recorded by the PIU (one of the intermediate indicators), far
exceeded the target (37 percent against a target of 5 percent).

Institutional change/strengthening

69.             During the results validation mission, five agencies clearly acknowledged
the Business Environment Enhancement Project’s contribution. The project created the
DGPSP and Guichet Unique, which the DGPSP hosts. It also strengthened the Central
Bank of Mauritania; the Ministry of Petroleum, Energy, and Mining; the Ministry of
Justice; and the Chamber of Commerce. The DGPSP has established itself as an agency
that champions private sector development in Mauritania. Its management team
particularly appreciated the fact that the last project coordinator and team leader facilitated
the government granting the agency observer status within the project’s steering
committee. This, according to the DGPSP, helped it gain higher profile and recognition as
a supporter of the private sector. The DGPSP also acted as a PIU in the second half of the
project, contributing to the project’s efficiency and its successful turnaround in the last two
years. Guichet Unique also improved its profile by consolidating business registration
procedures, as recognized by the Doing Business report. The agency particularly benefited
from the recruitment of an expert who worked extensively with Guichet Unique
management to re-engineer processes while building capacity.

70.              Despite the momentum of the DGPSP and Guichet Unique, their long-term
success is still in question. With the delay in start-up and implementation, these agencies
were being established and fully operationalized when the project closed. They are still
young and have not yet clarified their financial sustainability.

71.              The Central Bank of Mauritania appreciated the project’s capacity building
– a total of 83 staff members were trained and 17 were recruited and trained. Some trainees
admitted they knew very little about their functions before the training, and the capacity
building program equipped them to perform their tasks. The number of supervisors has
doubled, significantly strengthening monitoring capacity. The project also financed the
Central Bank’s IT upgrade and improved the information system for banking supervision.
The stronger capacity of the Central Bank was externally validated by the IMF in Article
IV in 2014.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
Rating: Moderate

74.            There is a moderate risk that the project’s development outcome will not be
maintained. According to the IMF, the Central Bank’s capacity building seems to have had
a lasting impact, although there are other areas that need work: the subsequent Article IV
in 2015 warned that it remains fragile to shocks. The DGPSP and Guichet Unique are new
organizations that still need to become fully independent and sustainable. Further capacity
building will be required before these entities are on a sustainable path.

75.            The government expressed a renewed commitment and urgency to improve
the investment climate after the restructuring. Based on the number of reforms achieved in
the last 18 months, this momentum is producing results. However, the maintenance of the
investment climate reform program requires solid technical expertise to guide analysis and
policy formulation.

76.            The Minister of Development and Economic Affairs, who has championed
the country’s investment climate reforms, will depart from office shortly. Whether the
country can maintain the same level of effort under new leadership remains to be seen.

77.             The results validation mission received encouraging comments from private
sector stakeholders that the government has become more consultative in its policy-making
process. This change has come without any specific institutional capacity building (for
example, setting up a presidential investors’ council or a secretariat for public-private
dialogue), as seen elsewhere, but through the project’s efforts to bring the private sector
and the government together. Given that this shift was driven more by cultural change than
institutional change, the project team was hopeful that the government would continue this
consultative approach to policy making after the project closure.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

78.             While the Business Environment Enhancement Project was highly relevant
in the context in which it was developed, the design did not pay sufficient attention to the
results chain and the complexity of implementation. The project had a long list of activities,
many stakeholders, and required wide-ranging expertise to oversee implementation.
Furthermore, overall risk was underestimated. These factors made execution a challenge.




                                             22
Quality of supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.             Issues arising during project implementation were addressed in a timely
manner. Although the restructuring streamlined the project and made it possible to achieve
the PDO and most intermediate indicators, it would have had an even greater impact if it
had taken place earlier. Although the need for restructuring was flagged in successive ISRs,
the team failed to reach an agreement with the government on the restructuring until the
midterm review. As a result, the project was left with little time to implement activities
after the restructuring. With the exception of the last 12 months, the disbursement rate was
consistently slow – 35 percent of the total project investment was disbursed in the last 12
months.

80.            The validation mission also noted that the stakeholders in Mauritania would
have appreciated more support to accelerate the project’s progress. Although the minimum
number of supervision missions was met, there may have been room for additional support
given the limited experience and capacity to implement private sector reforms. More
proactive and innovative measures to leverage the World Bank Group’s resources could
have been explored earlier to address the slow pace of progress in the area of Doing
Business until 2014.

Justification of rating for overall Bank performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

81.           Based on the three key ratings: Outcome (Moderately Unsatisfactory),
Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry (Moderately Unsatisfactory) and Bank
performance in ensuring quality of supervision (Moderately Satisfactory), the overall Bank
performance rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Government performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82.             Implementation during the period before the restructuring experienced
several disruptions, notably the coup d’état and subsequent suspension of the project. This
was further exacerbated by the lack of decisive action (for example, the delayed decision
to restructure) and the government’s uneven commitment to reforms. Despite the strong
emphasis on public enterprise governance mentioned throughout the project preparation,
the implementation of activities under this component was slow, and the activities were
discarded during the restructuring. Similarly, the project team found little traction on the
legal and judicial component, and it too was dropped. There was much stronger momentum



                                            23
to reform the investment climate towards the end of the project, but little happened during
the first four years.

83.             The government struggled to support the adequate functioning of the PIU
throughout the project. The dissolution of the DGPIP, then the CPI, put the project at risk
of violating the finance agreement. In addition, the government’s decision to add a second
layer to the procurement process hindered efficiency. The maintenance of a functioning
PIU persisted throughout the project, until the last coordinator took the position in March
2014.

Implementing agency performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

84.            As mentioned above, the stability of the PIU, both its structure and staffing,
was a challenge throughout the project. The project had four coordinators in the life of the
project. With the exception of the last 12 months, the disbursement rate was consistently
below expectation.

Justification of rating for overall borrower performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

6. Lessons Learned

Choose key indicators based on a clear results chain

85.            The project’s original design included a number of activities that
contributed very little to achieving the PDO. The restructuring paper recognized the
disconnect between one of the original PDO indicators (non-performing loans) and the
proposed set of activities. Due to this disconnect, despite some important achievements,
the project had not made much progress when measured against the selected indicators.
The PDO indicator on non-performing loans was dropped during the restructuring.

Line up all the necessary expertise in a timely manner for supervision

86.            To ensure high-quality oversight, the project team enlisted experts within
the World Bank Group to supervise its activities. The project team worked closely with the
World Bank Group Doing Business reform advisory team, which provided the necessary
oversight and helped maintain a healthy relationship with the client. The government had
implemented several reforms, such as passing the new investment law and SEZ law, but
was surprised to find that these reforms did not improve the Doing Business indicators.
These misunderstandings and resulting frustration were well managed by the Doing
Business experts, who could clearly explain the methodology and clarify which reforms
apply to the Doing Business study.


                                             24
87.             Beyond the management of expectation, it was important to have experts
with the right skills involved in designing the reform program to achieve the objectives set
out by the government. Experts from different Global Practices (GPs) were identified to
help the project, including a credit bureau expert from Financial Market GP and a business
registration expert from Trade and Competitiveness GP. Four experts, covering different
subject areas, reviewed the government’s draft Commercial Code. Equipped with the right
expertise and knowledge, the task team was able to help the government achieve several
reforms.

Find the balance between Bank-executed and client-executed technical assistance

88.              The Business Environment Enhancement Project was largely a technical
assistance initiative, combined with some light investment in equipment. For the private
sector development component, the reform agenda was framed around the Doing Business
indicators. Since IFC provides advisory services for Doing Business indicators related to
reforms, the question is whether a better result could have been achieved if this portion of
the Business Environment Enhancement Project were implemented differently. This is
particularly a pertinent question for Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice, which was
born as a result of a merger of the World Bank private sector development unit and IFC
advisory services for investment climate. The merger became effective in July 2014, six
months before the project closing date. 19 Given that the project struggled with the
government’s procurement system, the IFC-executed advisory model could possibly have
expedited the delivery of advisory services to get results faster. However, the IFC-executed
advisory model is only possible when a trust fund is lined up. At the time of the project’s
implementation, IFC did not have a trust fund dedicated to Mauritania, and it may not have
been possible to move quickly to launch advisory services. Furthermore, IFC’s advisory
services do not finance any equipment. In the case of Mauritania, financing the
computerization of the one-stop-shop was an important building block of the project’s
business registration reform and it would not have been possible if IFC was operating
alone. Given these insights, a takeaway for the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice
is that it is important to recognize the strength of both modalities and considers combining
different tools from the design stage.

Prioritize activities and be selective from the beginning

89.             The original project design, with a budget of $5 million, aimed to implement
business registration reforms, taxation reforms, trade logistics reforms (customs), labor
reforms, and public enterprise reforms (performance contracts). It also aimed to build the
Central Bank’s capacity and establish a credit bureau and credit registry. Each of these
activities could easily cost more than $1 million – tackling all of these objectives with the
$5 million budget was deemed impossible from the beginning of the project.




19
 The merger also included InfoDev and Trade Department of the Poverty Reduction and Economic
Management Vice Presidency of the World Bank Group.

                                             25
90.              The project was eventually streamlined, but reaching agreement to
restructure the project took a long time. Given the generally strong resistance from
stakeholders to eliminate activities once the project is approved, it is important that
activities are selectively chosen at the beginning of the process.

The selection of the project coordination/implementing unit is critical

91.             The Mauritanian government insisted that the project should use the
existing structure and staff. However, the first two agencies that managed the project, the
DGPIP and the CPI, were dissolved. The second dissolution put the project at risk of
violating the financing agreement. These changes contributed to the delay in project
implementation by disrupting day-to-day coordination. It is important to ensure that the
government commits to support a well-functioning PIU.

92.            A new PIU was created under the Ministry of Development and Economic
Affairs. A team of consultants was competitively recruited in November 2011, but the
coordinator was deemed unsatisfactory during the probation period. As a result, another
selection process took place. Although the probation period ended in May 2012, a new
coordinator was not hired until July 2012. In early 2014, there was another change in
project coordinator. These disruptions resulted in a dysfunctional PIU, which ultimately
delayed the project’s implementation.

Assess political economy thoroughly

93.             The project dropped its public sector and judiciary sector reform agenda
during the restructuring – these two components are widely acknowledged as difficult areas
of reform. Even with heightened enthusiasm at the time of project preparation, it is
necessary to thoroughly assess the level of political commitment to undertake difficult
reforms.

More creative thinking on M&E indicators required

94.            The project had difficulty establishing a robust M&E framework to
adequately measure “improved investment climate,” with a well-articulated results chain.
The team chose to use Doing Business indicators as proxies. These indicators are externally
validated, with a consistent, annual data collection methodology. However, by heavily
relying on the Doing Business indicators, the project’s results framework was somewhat
incoherent and it missed out on the opportunity to identify a measurement that could have
captured its impact more comprehensively. Furthermore, the project would have benefited
from an internal benchmarking tool to assess efficiency in a more robust manner. This tool
could also help create a department-level database of important information, such as the
cost of implementing certain activities (business registration reforms, for example) and
compliance cost savings achieved.




                                            26
Build relationships

95.             The project’s disbursement rate dramatically improved in 2014, increasing
from 65 percent in March to 92 percent in December. In March 2014, the project welcomed
the fourth and last project coordinator. The new coordinator and the then task team leader
quickly established a trusting relationship. This trust resulted in an open dialogue upfront
that empowered the project coordinator. As a result, the back and forth on non-objections
significantly reduced, contributing to a strong disbursement record.

Country Management Unit’s support

96.             In the last two years of the project, quite a number of reforms, especially
related to Doing Business, were achieved. The task team leader attributes this success to
the country management unit’s active involvement. The input from the Country Director
and the Country Manager helped the project team reach high-level decision makers to
discuss critical issues and get on with the project’s reforms.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic and financial analysis was not conducted during the project’s preparation
because it was a technical assistance project. Alternative considerations are used to
substantiate the different aspects of project efficiency (see the Efficiency section of the
main report).

For the project cost of $5 million, the business registration reforms alone could attribute
$20 million in investments by new businesses (see the Achievement of Project
Development Objectives section). This investment figure will grow if the government
continues to implement investment climate reforms and if private sector operators feel
sufficiently comfortable to formalize their businesses. It is hard to have a robust cross-
country comparison as the data are scarce: one indicative comparison is offered by a recent
impact evaluation of investment climate advisory services in Africa, where a consultant
estimated that the range of $33 million and $88 million investment generated as a result of
business regulation reforms in Rwanda (whose economy is nearly twice as big as
Mauritania), and $1 to $12 million range in Liberia (whose economy is half of
Mauritania’s). 20

On the cost saving side, the reduction of procedures and cost to register a business as a
result of reforms implemented through the project, led to the compliance cost saving of
$900,000 for the private sector since the reforms were implemented (a year ago), and will
save further $2.5 million over the next three years. Although a direct comparison is difficult,
based on existing assessments, some comparators of private sector cost saving obtained
from business registration reforms can be offered as follows: $5.7 million in Rwanda, $1.6
million for Sierra Leone (about the same size as Mauritania) and $1.0 million for Burkina
Faso (almost three times bigger than Mauritania). 21

The project spent approximately $350,000 on the business registration reform, which
included regulatory reforms, advisory, capacity building, and the provision of hardware
and software. With this investment, 5,643 new firms have been registered: $63 investment
for every firm. The only direct comparison that can be offered is from Nicaragua, where
three different business registration functions (national and sub-national) recorded $47,
$101, and $198 investment for creating one firm. 22

The project also helped upgrade the Central Bank’s capacity for supervision, including
monitoring and analyzing financial and monetary statistics, as acknowledged by the IMF’s
2014 Article IV staff consultation report. Although unquantified, the benefits of the
improved supervision capacity of the Central Bank contribute to a more sound financial
system, which, in turn, supports economic growth more efficiency. The project also

partially contributed to lowering interest rates, from an average of 14 percent in 2006 to
9 percent in 2010, by introducing more competition to the banking sector in Mauritania.

According to the Ministry of Petroleum, Energy, and Mining, the project’s support in
developing a master plan for the electricity sector and conducting a tariff study for the
national power utility SOMELEC was considered the most important blueprint for solving
the energy crisis in Mauritania. This master plan has helped restore the ministry’s
credibility with major donors, who have decided to support the plan’s implementation. As
a result, total electricity production is expected to increase from 94 megawatts at the time
of the project preparation to at least 400 megawatts, which will make a significant
contribution to economic growth.

     Introduction


1.This document is the closing report on the achievement of the project development goal
indicators and results. It implies: (i) first, to identify the indicators; and (ii) analyse their
current value in comparison with their targets, in order to assess if these have been achieved
or not.

2.This report includes two sections: the first section will present the project; and the second
section will provide an evaluation on the achievement of the indicators for project goals and
results.

     I.       PROJECT PRESENTATION

     A. Project background:

3. In an effort to improve Mauritania's image overseas and locally, the Islamic Republic of
Mauritania Government (GRIM) decided to undertake investment climate reforms in order
to improve the business climate for private sector development. On the 1st of July 2008, the
Government signed a Loan Agreement in Nouakchott, tying it to the International
Development Association (IDA), in order to fund the Economic Activity Climate
Improvement Project (PACAE). The project was implemented on the 29th of December 2009,
and was set to last 5 years. Project cost is USD 5 million, 90% of the funds being provided
by the International Development Association (IDA), and 10% by the Mauritanian state.

     B. Project Development Objective

4. The development objective (PDO) at the inception was as follows: "Improve the business
climate through incentive reforms in the finance, legal and judicial sectors as well as the
business regulatory environment, and support restructuring measures for selected public
companies (PSE)"

5. Following project restructuring in 2008, new priorities established to focus on investment
climate reforms in order to foster private and finance sector development, led to the new PDG
entitled as follows: "Improve the business climate for financial institutions and other
targeted companies of the private sector in Mauritania".

6.The project's Initial PDO achievement level will be measured using the following key
indicators 23:

          •   percentage of nonperforming loans;



     23The indicators of the initial PDO are associated with results indicators associated to the project components.

                                                           39
         •   number of days needed to start a company;
         •   time needed to secure a course ruling; and
         •   Implementation of performance contracts.

7.The project's new PDO execution level will be measured using the following key
indicators:
      • The number of procedures needed to start a company is reduced
      • Percentage of credits listed in the credit register

      C. Content of the project

8.    The project will include the following components:

         •   Component A:

9. Aimed at improving economic activity, and to promote the private sector's development.
This component aims at reinforcing the financial sector, through the reinforcement of the
Central Bank of Mauritania, of the banking sector and of microfinance. It also supports
economic and financial activities' legal and judicial environment update, as well as
streamlining of the business regulatory environment, using reforms and incentives for private
investment.

         •   Component B:

10. Aims at establishing public-private partnerships, and improving productivity. Five
companies were targeted initially (MAURIPOST, SOMELEC, SOMAGAZ, SNDE and the
Port of Nouakchott) to be supported in their restructuring. The project will aim at supporting
the electricity sector, to improve extension planning through 2 studies.

         •   Component C: Project coordination and administrative and fiduciary
             management

11.National institutions directly benefitting from the project are DGPSP, BCM,
MAURIPOST, SOMELEC, DGPE, CIMAM, Nouakchott and Nouadhibou's commercial
courts, and Nouadhibou's free-trade zone. This requires robust coordination.

12.The project team includes one coordinator, one RAF, one RPM, one RSE, one internal
auditor and one assistant accountant, in charge of the coordination.

         1.1.Component A

13.Activities planned under this component aim at improving the banking monitoring process
in the framework of a changing financial context and, at facing the challenge of the
implementation of the new banking regulatory framework in Mauritania. This will reinforce
BCM's position in its monitoring and control role. Such an improvement will be made through
remote transmission of interim financial statements as well as automation of financial

                                                40
intermediate supervisory tasks. These actions aim at contributing to the financial system's
surveillance streamlining, improvement, and reinforcement.

EVALUATION OF RESULTS


      5.1. Relevance of goals, design and implementation

Relevance of goals.

27.  The goals of the project were highly relevant in terms of the vision and the strategy of the
Mauritanian government, as specified in the CSLP and the private sector's development
strategy. It assisted with an economic activity improvement system to promote the
development of the private sector through the reinforcement of the sector and of micro-finance.
ii) It also supports the updating of the legal and judicial environment of economic and financial
activities, as well as the rationalization of companies regulatory environment through reforms
and incentives for investment.

Relevance of design.

28. Project design was highly relevant. The design tried to institutionalize and develop tools
and instruments for private sector promotion. It provided major financial resources to conduct
relevant studies. These studies had a positive impact on project design. Project risks were also
very well identified and mitigation measures implemented.

Implementation relevance.

29. The project implementation relevance is considered appropriate. Project activities
implementation was considered successful despite coordination issues encountered in the first
few years. Design and implementation also led to beneficiary institutions reinforcement, and
to the thorough consideration of the private sector development program.

      5.2. Implementation of project development goals

30. The execution of the new project's PDG, aimed at improving the business climate for
financial institutions and other targeted private sector companies in Mauritania is considered
appropriate. The project supported short and medium term priorities to improve the business
climate, and contributed to capacity building of stakeholders’ reinforcement in the short term,
directly benefitting over 100 people.
                                                 47
31. Successful implementation of activities associated with institutional capacity building of
the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) allowed: i) secured channel operationalization; ii)
training of 3 IT managers to xx language; and iii) banking monitoring technical support. The
final goal is to implement an operational monitoring system, through tools design, capacity
building for people in charge of monitoring and knowledge transfer and the conduct of the
study on the Central Credit Register.

32. The successful implementation of activities associated with reforms preparation to improve
the business climate allowed: i) the conduct of a study on private sector development strategy,
and to provide technical assistance to DGPS; ii) the organization of an exchange visit for the
benefit of the one-stop-shop manager; iii) the organization of the investment forum; iv) the
support of special economic zones (implementing decrees, draft on the regulator in charge of
regulating the zone, management methodology, and the training on best practice in terms of
mediation and arbitration for the Nouadhibou Free-Trade Zone managers; v) the meeting of
the managers of the Free-Trade Zone with MEDEF in Paris; and vi) implementation of an
information system for the benefit of the Nouakchott one-stop-shop.

33. The successful implementation of activities associated with the establishment of public-
private partnerships, and improvement of productivity, allowed the conduct of restructuring
studies and public companies audits (MAURIPOST, SOMELEC, SNDE, SOMAGAZ, and
Port de l'Amitié); ii) long term improvement of the electricity sector extension planning
function, through the electricity master plan and the conduct of a SOMELEC pricing study.

34. At the end of the project, the number of procedures needed to start a company was reduced
from 9, to 8. This contributed to a large extent to an increase in the percentage of newly created
companies, namely 4264, including 352 women-owned companies. The percentage of credits
listed in the credit register indicator (30%) also increased by 100%. The initial value of 30%
and the 50% target were all exceeded. A key point of the project was to give the beneficiaries
(as a result of the training), the capacity to actively take part in the preparation of reforms to
improve the business climate. At the end of the project, several institutions benefited from
training activities, to the benefit of their employees. Data related to beneficiaries’ satisfaction
in terms of project results couldn't be collected in an in-depth manner. However, the last project
committee meeting held on Thursday, the 11th of September, took note of the significant
progress made in terms of project activities and regarding the results obtained, and the
coordinator and his team were congratulated on their efforts. The following tables give a
summary of the key performance points (AOP)

•     PDO indicator 1: The number of procedures needed to start a company is reduced

35. This indicator has almost been achieved. Initially, the number of procedures required to
start a company was set at 9, as indicated in Table 3 below. Several major interventions
contributed to the achievement of this indicator, namely the establishment of the one-stop-
shop and the continuation of a reform program (reinforcement and computerization of

•     PDO indicator 2: Percentage of credits listed in the credit register

36. This indicator was achieved and exceeded the target. At the end of the project, 100% of
credits were registered. The main intervention contributing to the achievement of this indicator
is the training of several controllers. The Central Bank also initiated the modernization of the
Central Credit Register through the establishment of a secured communication channel with
the banks, allowing real-time data transmission on payment irregularities. Risk statements are
now extended to all credits, whatever the amount.

37. This indicator was achieved and exceeded the target. At the end of the project this was
4264 (including 352 women). The main interventions that contributed to the achievement of
this indicator were the training of GU staff and the mobilization of communications assistants.

•     Result Indicator 2: A one-stop-shop (OSS) for company creation is established and
      operational

38. This indicator was achieved. The Extraordinary Meeting of the Council of Ministers held
on Wednesday 31st of May 2014 reviewed and adopted a draft decree establishing a single

                                                   49
business creation form. The aim of this law is to "institute a one-stop-shop" to facilitate
procedures, and to attract national and overseas investors willing to have a relevant legal
framework to start their company", explains the government.

39. The established and operational one-stop-shop offers entrepreneurs a fast, efficient and low
cost service with an information system adapted to the needs of investors and partners. The
one-stop-shop reduced the number of procedures, as well as the time and the cost associated
with business creation, reflecting the impact study conducted in 2014 by DGPSP.

40.  This study provided recommendations which, once taken into account, would further foster
company creation in RIM. The aim is to: i) accelerate the single form process at the level of
the one-stop-shop; ii) accelerate the one-stop-shop integration process with the one-stop-shop
for all relevant services in terms of business creation (CNSS, BCM, labor inspectorate, etc.);
iii) capitalize and communicate adequately on the opportunities provided until now on the
internal application at the BCM level, to increase to credit access margin; and at the same time,
iv) accelerate the reform process related to the Central Risk Register, etc.

•     Result indicator 3: The cost to start a business is reduced (% of GNI per inhabitant)

creation process, through the continuation of the reform program (reinforcement and
computerization of DGUSIP).

      II.    Conclusions


49. Data collected on the current values of indicators associated with achievement of PDG of
the project and interim results, show that most indicators’ targets have be achieved and
exceeded (see Annexure). Indeed, results achieved are far from being satisfactory for some
indicators associated with the result of interim results no1. The business climate has improved,
especially the indicator tax payment reduction per year, with a target of 20 and a current value
of 49 according to the last 2015 DB report.

The report correctly summarizes and analyzes what happened from the conception through the
implementation of the Project. The report also adequately captures the achievements. However,
given the achievements against the PDO and key indicators, the Project deserves a rating
higher than Moderately Satisfactory.

Chamber of Commerce: While the Business Environment Enhancement Project’s
contribution was appreciated, especially where the chamber directly benefited from the
support (modernization of the national commercial registry, the development of the private
sector strategy, and feasibility study of a mediation and arbitration center), it lamented the
project’s lack of direct work with private sector operators. The project was considered too
focused on the public sector.
