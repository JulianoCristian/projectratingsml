                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on the findings of the missions conducted in January and April 2014. The recent implementation progress of the project is less than the desired level. A thorough
                         review of the project progress will be undertaken during the proposed August 2014 mission. That said, the following progress made are worth high-lightening:

                         The project disbursement rate has increased to Sixty five percent (65%), with an additional five and one-half percent (5.5%) committed. In addition, it is estimated that an additional

                         eighteen percent (18%) of project funds are in the process of being committed (final procurement processing/contract signature pending). Given the above, the rate of disbursement
                         is forecast to reach at least 80% in the next 3 months, but at which time the project will be approaching its closing date (November 2014). Recent discussion with the Government
                         revealed that the counterpart is interested to request for the extension of closing date.

                         The feasibility study for a One-stop-shop for enterprise creation and investment in Nouakchott has been completed and an expert is engaged to assist in establishing and ensuring
                         that the enterprise registration agency is operational . The Government has subsequently completed draft laws that will abolish the following requirements: (i) publishing the name of
                         the newly registered enterprise in the official Gazette (estimated to take 2 weeks); (ii) minimum capital payment requirements; and (iii) depositing the capital in a bank. These new
                         draft laws are awaiting Parliamentary approval. In addition, a single registration form has been designed and adopted for new registrations and all relevant public agencies which
                         approve new registrations have now been mandated to operate from the premises of the One-stop shop.

                         Another important developments relate to: (i) the development of the national private sector development strategy, which has been finalized with a corresponding action plan; (ii) The
                         revision of the Code of Contracts; (iii) Review of priority provisions of the Commercial Code and its implementing decrees and global update of the Commercial code; (iv) Technical
                         assistance on Banking supervision and inspection for the Central Bank of Mauritania; (v) IT Equipment for a secured communication line between BCM and key primary banks; and
                         (vi) Feasibility study for the Special Economic Zone, and the drafting of relevant laws.
