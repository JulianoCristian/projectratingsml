         Business Environment Enhancement Project for Mauritania is\n            to enhance the business climate through improvements in the\n            financial, legal and judiciary sectors, and regulatory\n            environment for business, and the support of measures to\n            restructure selected public enterprises (PEs). The project\n            needs restructuring for two main reasons: to improve the\n            very slow progress in implementation and disbursement; and\n            to align project objectives with new Government priorities\n            in investment climate reforms for private and financial\n            sector growth and development. The restructuring will amend\n            the project\u0092s legal documents by: 1) revising the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO); 2) modifying, eliminating\n            originally planned project activities and adding others that\n            are more consistent with the PDO; 3) reallocating funds\n            accordingly across old and new disbursement categories; 4)\n            revising the results framework to be coherent with the\n            restructured components and activities; and 5) extending the\n            closing date by a year from November 30, 2013 to November\n            30, 2014. This first extension of the closing date is\n            necessary to make the revised PDO, which maintains the core\n            focus of the project, achievable. Without an extension,\n            on-going activities will be negatively affected."}, "docdt": "2013-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
