                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall project development objective (PDO) is to enhance the business climate through improvements in the financial, legal and judiciary sectors, and regulatory
                         environment for business. This would facilitate private-sector led growth/investment in the economy and improve the services of the public enterprises that directly
                         impact private sector growth and development.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project PDO and IP ratings were downgraded to MU due to very slow implementation progress, low disbursement, and disfunctional Project Implementation Unit (PIU). A
                         midterm review (MTR) of the Project took place from September 3 to 18, 2012. The option of canceling the Project was offered to the authorities who rejected it in favor of
                         restructuring. Thus, the restructuring of the Project is being undertaken at the request of the authorities during the mid-term review held in September 2012. After about 30 months of
                         implementation, the project needs restructuring for two main reasons: (i) to improve the very slow progress in implementation and disbursement; and (ii) to align project objectives

                         with new Government priorities in investment climate reforms for private and financial sector growth and development. Government has renewed its commitment for the Project by
                         reorganizing the Agency in charge of Private Sector Development. This Agency will be a key beneficiary and close partner in the Project for undertaking the investment climate
                         reforms that the Project will be focusing on.

                         The restructuring would amend the Project’s legal documents by: (i) revising the Project Development Objective (PDO); (ii) modifying, eliminating originally planned project activities
                         and adding others that are more consistent with the PDO; (iii) reallocating funds accordingly across old and new disbursement categories; (iv) revising the Results Framework to be
                         coherent with the restructured components and activities; and (v) extending the closing date from November 30, 2013 to November 30, 2015. This first extension of the closing date is
                         necessary to allow completion of planned project activities and make the revised PDO achievable. There are no new Safeguards triggered and safeguard level C remains the same.
                         There are no audit issues. Based on the proposed changes, this will be a Level I restructuring.
