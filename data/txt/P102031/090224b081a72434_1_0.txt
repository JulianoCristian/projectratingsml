                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall project development objective (PDO) is to enhance the business climate through improvements in the financial, legal and judiciary sectors, and regulatory
                         environment for business. This would facilitate private-sector led growth/investment in the economy and improve the services of the public enterprises that directly
                         impact private sector growth and development.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As agreed prior to the restructuring, the project PDO and IP ratings have been upgraded to MS after a supervision mission in January 2013 during which noticeable Progress both in
                         implementation and disbursement was witnessed. In addition to disbursement which has increased by 28% to reach close to 50% of the Credit, several activities have been
                         completed or shown very good progress such as:
                         (i)          Audit of 10 commercial banks which were completed and an action plan was drafted by the Central Bank of Mauritania to implement the recommendations.

                         (ii)      Credit bureau: Preliminary work was completed to ensure a secure line of communication exists between the Central Bank and Commercial banks for transfer of data on
                         borrowers.
                         (iii)     One-stop-shop for enterprise creation: a feasibility study was undertaken to help Direction Générale de la promotion du Secteur Privé (DGPSP) set up a one-stop-shop. This
                         is to be followed by an implementation of the recommendations of the study.

                         (iv)      Electricity Sector: the studies on the Electricity sector master plan as well as implementation of new tariffs by SOMELEC (the state-owned electricity company) have been
                         completed and will prove very valuable for the efficiency of the energy sector as well as for the « Gas-to-Power » Project in preparation.
                         (v)       MAURIPOST : The audit report for MAURIPOST has been finalized and delivered to the authorities for implementation of the recommendations.
                         (vi) Financial Sector Strategy: Financed by FIRST trust fund, the strategy has finally been adopted by the Government. A dissemination workshop is to be scheduled to solicit the
                         financial support of the donor community for implementation.


                         The Level I restructuring of the Project amended the legal documents by: (i) revising the Project Development Objective (PDO); (ii) modifying, eliminating originally planned project
                         activities and adding others that are more consistent with the PDO; (iii) reallocating funds accordingly across old and new disbursement categories; (iv) revising the Results
                         Framework to be coherent with the restructured components and activities; and (v) extending the closing date by a year from November 30, 2013 to November 30, 2014. This first
                         extension of the closing date is necessary to allow completion of planned project activities and make the revised PDO achievable. As part of the restructuring, the disbursement
                         estimates were revised. No new Safeguards were triggered and safeguard level C remained the same.

                         The restructured Project is closely aligned with Government commitment towards undertaking key investment climate reforms for Private and financial sector development. It has
                         provided a new momentum to the Project which activities have been reformulated to support the following key investment climate reforms: i) starting a business; ii) getting credit; and
                         iii) paying taxes.

                         The revised PDO is to enhance the business climate for financial institutions and other targeted private sector enterprises in Mauritania. The revised PDO Outcome indicators are:
                         (1) Number of procedures required to establish a business is reduced (2) Percentage of credits reported to the credit registry increases. As discussed above, there is already
                         progress being made towards meeting the revising PDO and outcomes sought. There are no new risks identified for the Project and the risk rating remains the same.
