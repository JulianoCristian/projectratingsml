outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\u2019s\n            original design included a number of activities that\n            contributed very little to achieving the project development\n            objective (PDO). The restructuring paper recognized the\n            disconnection between one of the original PDO indicators\n            (non-performing loans) and the proposed set of activities.\n            Due to this disconnect, despite some important achievements,\n            the project had not made much progress when measured against\n            the selected indicators. The PDO indicator on non-performing\n            loans was dropped during the restructuring. Beyond the\n            management of expectation, it was important to have experts\n            with the right skills involved in designing the reform\n            program to achieve the objectives set out by the government.\n            Experts from different Global Practices (GPs) were\n            identified to help the project, including a credit bureau\n            expert from Financial Market GP and a business registration\n            expert from Trade and Competitiveness GP. Four experts,\n            covering different subject areas, reviewed the government\u2019s\n            draft Commercial Code. Equipped with the right expertise and\n            knowledge, the task team was able to help the government\n            achieve several reforms. The project was eventually\n            streamlined, but reaching agreement to restructure the\n            project took a long time. Given the generally strong\n            resistance from stakeholders to eliminate activities once\n            the project is approved, it is important that activities are\n            selectively chosen at the beginning of the process."}, "docdt": "2015-05-29T00:39:04Z"}
