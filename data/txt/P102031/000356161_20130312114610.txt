﻿MAURITANIA BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT PROJECT
RESTRUCTURING PAPER
A. SUMMARY
1.    This Level I restructuring of the Mauritania Business Environment Enhancement Project
(BEEP) is being undertaken at the request of the Borrower, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania
during the mid-term review held in September 2012. After about 30 months of implementation,
the Project needs restructuring for two main reasons: (i) to improve the very slow progress in
implementation and disbursement; and (ii) to align project objectives with new Government
priorities in investment climate reforms for private and financial sector growth and development.
To show its commitment and eagerness to see the Project achieve results, the Government has
taken some key steps by reorganizing the Agency for the promotion of private sector
development and in charge of the business environment reforms, passed a new investment code
to attract local as well as international investors, and created a Special Economic Zone in
Nouadhibou for the investors to operate. With a new impetus created with the midterm review,
and a Government new financial sector strategy, a restructured BEEP will, therefore, be
implemented in an atmosphere where momentum and favorable political economy exist to
undertake reforms that will see the investment climate improve to allow the Private sector to
strive and create jobs.
2.    The restructuring would amend the Project's legal documents by: (i) revising the Project
Development Objective (PDO); (ii) modifying, eliminating originally planned project activities
and adding others that are more consistent with the PDO; (iii) reallocating funds accordingly
across old and new disbursement categories; (iv) revising the Results Framework to be coherent
with the restructured components and activities; and (v) extending the closing date by a year
from November 30, 2013 to November 30, 2014. This first extension of the closing date is
necessary to make the revised PDO, which maintains the core focus of the Project, achievable.
The activities being dropped, including support to public enterprises are not of highest relevance
to the Project objectives. Without an extension, on-going activities will be negatively affected.
No new safeguards policies are being triggered and thus safeguards remain at the same level C.
There are no audit issues.
B.    PROJECT STATUS
3.    The project was subject to a late start due to political instability in the country. It took
more than a year after the Project was approved on May 22, 2008, to be declared effective on
December 28, 2009. This was due to the situation prevailing in the country which suffered a
military coup in 2008 that overthrew the President. That event triggered OP 7.30 and a
suspension of all Bank activities in Mauritania. Project activities only started after OP 7.30 was
lifted in 2009 and the Bank resumed its operations in Mauritania.
6


﻿4.    The Project is rated moderately unsatisfactory as implementation has been slow overall
and disbursement low, standing at 39% at end September 2012. This represented a 28% increase
in a year. A number of activities, primarily related to the strengthening of the financial sector
were implemented in the early days of the project. Then the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
which was part of CPI (Commissariat pour la Promotion de l'Investissement) under the purview
of the Prime Minister was eliminated and Project staff members who were employees of CPI
were dismissed. To avoid penalties for the elimination of the Project PIU which was a violation
of the Financing Agreement, the legal remedy applied by the Borrower was to have the Project
temporarily managed by an existing PIU. It took more than a year to reconstitute the Project
staff who are now paid with project proceeds in a PIU which is under the purview of the Ministry
of Development and Economic Affairs (MAED). However, the new coordinator has been in
place since only July 2012.
C.    PROPOSED CHANGES
5.    The investment climate in Mauritania continues to be difficult for enterprises operating in
the country. The latest Doing Business 2013 report ranks Mauritania 167th out of 185 countries
on the ease of doing business. This continuous low ranking, year after year, has gotten the
authorities concerned. To improve Mauritania's image abroad and locally, the Government of the
Islamic Republic of Mauritania (GIRM) is more than ever determined to undertake investment
climate reforms aimed at enhancing the business environment for the development of the private
sector. Hence, during the mid-term review of September 2012, GIRM asked the Bank to support
its efforts in investment climate/Doing Business reforms in the following priority areas: (i)
starting a business; (ii) paying taxes; and (iii) getting credit. The project will thus be refocused
accordingly. This means abandoning planned activities directed at public enterprises, in order to
put more emphasis on investment climate reform activities that have a direct impact on the
private and financial sectors.
Project Development Objectives
6.    The original project development objective (PDO) was to: "enhance the business climate
through improvement in the financial, legal and judiciary sectors and regulatory environment for
business and the support of measures to restructure selected Public enterprises (PEs)."
7.    The original PDO outcome indicators were: (i) Non performing loans at commercial
banks improve; (ii) Number of procedures required to establish a business is reduced; and (iii)
Percent of commercial and financial court decisions that are published on the GIRM website
increases.
8.    In line with the proposed changes and Government new priorities to focus on investment
climate reforms to enhance private and financial sector development, the new proposed PDO
reads as follows: "enhance the business climate for financial institutions and other targeted
private sector enterprises in Mauritania."
7


﻿Results/indicators
9.     By the mid-term review, key original project indicators were generally not met. Two of
the three PDO indicators were not realized and the third was only partially met. Half of the six
intermediate result indicators were achieved, but only partially. Some indicators, including the
outcome indicator pertaining to the level of non-performing loans were difficult to measure as
they were not directed related to project activities. Key performance indicators are, thus, being
revised in Annex 1 in light of agreed upon activities, for better measurability and attribution of
project outcomes to activities being funded.
10.   The proposed revised PDO outcome indicators are: (i) Number of procedures required to
establish a business is reduced; and (ii) Percentage of credits reported to the credit registry
increases.
11.   The revised PDO indicators reflect the refocus of the Project. The revised PDO is more
likely to be achieved as it is more in line and consistent with Government actions and
commitments with respect to investment climate reforms.
Components
12.   Originally, the project was to be implemented through two technical components and one
administrative component. The proposed changes will affect all three project components.
Originally planned activities will be either modified or dropped and replaced with new ones as
explained below and summarized in Table 1.
Component 1: Improving the Business Climate to Foster Private Sector Development
13.   This component supports the Government of Mauritania's efforts to: (i) strengthen the
financial sector and thus improve access to finance; (ii) improve the legal and judicial framework
for business and financial activities; and (iii) streamline the regulatory environment and reduce
the administrative barriers for commercial activities.
Component 1.1: Strengthening the Financial Sector
14.   This subcomponent was to finance activities to: (i) strengthen the institutional capacity of
the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM); and (ii) strengthen the banking and microfinance sectors.
15.   Completed activities. Several achievements have been made including: (i) adoption of
new Central Bank statutes, (ii) a new Banking law and a new microfinance law were adopted and
several Central Bank directives accompanied these new laws; (iii) an accounting framework for
banks was developed; (iv) independent external audits were conducted for all banks in operation.
As per the recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), several new
banks received a license from BCM thus increasing the number of banks operating in Mauritania
and the level of competition. With the entry of internationally-renowned banks which had all the
required systems in place, there has been a significant decline in interest rates due to increased
competition. With financial and technical assistance from First Initiative, a financial sector
8


﻿development strategy was drafted and validated at a workshop before its approval by Council of
Ministers. The Restructured Project will be consistent with the recommendations of the Strategy.
16.   On-going activities: Several other activities are underway and progressing well
including: (i) a new secured line of communication between BCM and financial institutions for
data reporting; and (ii) provision of long term technical assistance on supervision to BCM, in
collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
17.   New activities: The proposed new activities under this subcomponent include: (i)
improvement of the Central Bank Credit registry to improve access to finance; and (ii)
supervision manual and accounting plan for insurance companies which may in the future come
under the supervision of BCM. Support for the modernization of the payment system that was
requested by the Central Bank has not been included among new activities due to a lack of
funding.
Component 1.2: Improving the Legal and Judicial Framework for Business and
Financial Activities
18.   Originally, this subcomponent was supposed to finance the following activities:
(a)   Developing laws and regulations for the creation, perfection and enforcement of
mortgages and the improvement of laws and regulations for movable property,
accompanied by the development of a modem commercial and credit registry;
(b)   Simplifying debt collection and contract enforcement mechanisms;
(c)   Strengthening judicial capacities with respect to commercial law, financial law
and commercial dispute resolution;
(d)   Strengthening ethics in the judiciary;
(e)   Developing judicial statistics and indicators to monitor progress of the judiciary;
and
(f)   Improving the dissemination of legal information.
19.   Completed activities: Of all the originally planned activities, only those related to:
simplification of debt collection contract enforcement mechanisms which yielded a new law, and
training of commercial court judges have been undertaken. Technical assistance to set up a new
mediation and arbitration center in the chamber of commerce was also carried out. In the
restructured project, most of the remaining activities will be dropped as they do not contribute to
achieving the new Government priorities and project development objective.
20.   New activities: The proposed new activities include: (i) support for the revision of the
commercial code and key implementing decrees; (ii) support to the Direction du Patrimoine
(Directory of Patrimony) for organizing and securing land titles as a modification of the
originally planned activity (a); and (iii) support for the modernization and computerization of the
commercial registry located at the Chamber of commerce and commercial courts in Nouakchott
and Nouadhibou.
9


﻿Component 1.3: Streamline the regulatory Environment for Business
21.    Support under this subcomponent was to be provided for the following activities:
(a)    Preparing reforms to improve the business climate such as facilitating business
start-up, simplifying corporate taxation, improving cross-border trade; and
(b)    Developing  an  incentive system  for private investment and    developing
appropriate institutional arrangements for investment promotion.
22.    Completed activities: Support for the development of a private investment promotion
system was partially carried out with technical assistance for the new investment code, and a
study on special economic zones (SEZ). The investment code was adopted by the Council of
Ministers on June 28, 2012 and by Parliament in July 2012. A special economic zone was set up
in Nouadhibou and will operate under the new investment code and appropriate implementation
decrees that need to be passed.
23.    On-going activities: None of the reforms (starting a business, simplify corporate
taxation, and trading across borders) have seen much progress as the government entity in charge
of carrying the reforms was very unstable and not well organized to deliver any results. Only
starting a business reform will continue under the restructured project.
24.    New activities: In response to Government's request, the proposed new and modified
activities focus on support to the newly created private sector investment promotion agency
(DGPSPI - Direction Generale de la Promotion du Secteur Prive) to undertake the following:
(a)    Investment climate/Doing Business reforms in the areas of (a) enterprise creation,
(b) paying taxes and (c) access to credit. That would entail establishment and
operationalization of a "One-Stop Shop" for enterprise creation.
(b)    Promote public-private dialogue and dissemination of Public-Private Partnership
(PPP) methodologies including the preparation of a new Private Sector
Development (PSD) strategy.
(c)    Operationalization  of the Nouadhibou   Special Economic Zone including
formulation of appropriate decrees for the new investment code.
Component 2: Building Public-Private Partnerships and Productivity Enhancement
25.    This component was to support activities to improve corporate governance in a select
group of PEs as well as several reforms measures in the Mauritanian electricity sector to attract
increased private sector investments and participation in the local power market.
26.    Completed activities: On-going activities such as the audit of MAURIPOST, the
electricity tariff study of SOMELEC, and an investment plan for the electricity sector have made
substantial progress and will be completed. These activities also happen to be very important to
inform the new Mauritania Gas-to-Power Project in preparation. All activities not yet started
under this component will be dropped to accommodate Government new priorities and provide
more support to the new private sector development agency (DGPSP).
I DGPSP which was created on May 20, 2012 replaces CPI which housed the PIU before it was officially abolished
and all staff fired on January 9, 2011 by decree No. 004-2011.

﻿Institutional arrangements
27.    As per the original institutional arrangements, a steering committee will continue to
oversee the PIU and provide strategic guidance. A Prime Minister's decree3 organizing the
MAED made the Ministry the official anchor of the Project which was originally under Direction
Gndrale a la Promotion de l'Investissement Privd (DGPIP)4, and then CPI which was
eliminated on December 16, 2010 because its linkage to the Prime Minister's office was not
working well either. The original minimum required Project staff included a coordinator, a
financial management specialist, a procurement specialist, and an internal auditor. As per the
midterm review recommendations, a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) specialist, and an
accountant will have to be added to the new PIU under MAED which has been functional since
September 2011 and was assessed satisfactory during the midterm review. However, the
Government arritd formally establishing the PIU as well as the recruitment of remaining PIU
staff will need to be completed no later than February 15, 2013 with organization and attribution
satisfactory to IDA. All PIU staff members will be consultants recruited in accordance with
World Bank Consultant Guidelines (i.e. none of them will be civil servant).

The revised category of expenditures includes a new credit category (4) that includes operating
costs that was not part of the original project agreement. This is to allow the Project to finance
the cost of operating the PIU as requested by the Borrower. Category (4) will thus replace
Category (1) which is included in the Table for memory with the amount already spent as revised
allocation. All future expenses under the Project will be financed out of Category (4).

﻿Financial management
31.   Financial management (FM) arrangements remain the same to those described in the
PAD except that any reference to DGPIP will be replaced with PIU or MAED as appropriate.
During the midterm review, the FM arrangements were assessed satisfactorily. The same team of
FM specialist and Coordinator will be responsible of implementation of the recommendations of
the midterm review action plan related to internal control, external audit and accounting
software. Implementation of this action plan will allow further strengthening of the financial
management team.
Procurement
32.   Procurement arrangements remain the same to those described in the PAD except that
any reference to DGPIP will be replaced with PIU or MAED as appropriate. An updated
Procurement Plan has been prepared and submitted to IDA for approval.
Closing date
33.   It is proposed to extend the closing date by a year until November 30, 2014. This
extension is necessary to accommodate and implement the Government's new approach and
priorities, the institutional changes that provide new opportunities, and the streamlined design
and indicators. Also, as mentioned earlier, implementation of the project was delayed for a total
of two years because of: (i) a late effectiveness of the project caused by political unrest; and (ii)
the difficulties encountered with the project implementation unit. This will be the first extension
of the project closing date.
34.   The extension will, thus, permit to complete planned project activities to allow the
achievement of the PDO. New activities such as one-stop-shop for enterprise creation and
overhaul of the credit registry that were added as a result of refocusing the Project to align it
better with Government priorities will need long term contracts for technical assistance and
goods that go beyond the current closing date of November 30, 2013.
35.   The Project remains the main instrument that the Government is relying on to accompany
them to undertake priority reforms to improve the investment climate in the country. BEEP will
help the authorities achieve results of preliminary key actions such as a new investment code,
creation of a Special Economic Zone and reorganization and revitalization of the Agency for
Private Sector Promotion and Development, and a new Financial Sector Strategy.
Implementation schedule
36.   Project activities are scheduled to be implemented through November 2014, i.e., until
FY15. See Annex 2 for proposed implementation schedule.
