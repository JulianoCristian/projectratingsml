The\n            overall outcome of the project as rated satisfactory; the\n            performance of the Bank and the borrower was rated\n            satisfactory. The project aimed at implementing the first\n            5-year phase of a 20-year national land titling program and\n            rationalizing cadastral mapping and documentation for the\n            compilation of a national cadastre. The important lessons\n            learned are :(a) For systematic title adjudication, national\n            land use and classification policies must be addressed in an\n            integrated manner before project implementation. (b) The\n            provincial and branch land offices need to be integrated\n            within the management structure of Department of Lands (DOL)\n            with clear lines of authority and reporting. (c) Reliable\n            land parcel statistics are needed to provide a sound basis\n            for planning. (d) Sustainability of technical change\n            requires parallel institutional change. (e) Human resource\n            management is a key aspect of institutional development.\n            Incentives for career advancement and improvement must be\n            provided to staff to enhance their skills and to retain them\n            in the positions for which they are trained."}, "docdt": "1993-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
