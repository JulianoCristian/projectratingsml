In a multi-state project,\n            clearly defined functions and responsibilities of the\n            Central Hub and the individual states are necessary for\n            successful implementation. Mapping and assessing the\n            expertise and capacities of partner organizations for\n            implementing/supporting different project objectives is\n            critical. Providing women the capacity and opportunity to\n            overcome social barriers at household and community level,\n            and share their concerns and aspirations, is a powerful\n            entry point for social mobilization. Financial management\n            capacity and financial discipline through Internal lending\n            in self-help groups without dependence on subsidized credit,\n            is critical for Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to link with banks,\n            access credit and maintain good repayment rates. The is need\n            to support awareness raising and skills training among women\n            with support in marketing and business development. Robust\n            monitoring and evaluation systems that provide critical\n            information on the process and outputs and outcomes are the\n            basics for any project to learn as it is implemented."}, "docdt": "2006-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
