The\n            specific objectives are to: a) establish women's\n            self-help groups (SHGs); b) sensitize and strengthen the\n            institutional capacity of support agencies to proactively\n            address women's needs; c) increase the incomes of poor\n            women; d) develop linkages between SHGs and lending\n            institutions to ensure women's access to credit\n            financing; and e) improve access to better health care,\n            education and drudgery reduction facilities.  The project\n            will pursue its objectives through the following components:\n            a) institutional capacity building for women's\n            development; b) establish support mechanisms for women\n            managed income generating activities; c) establish\n            mechanisms to access social programs and leverage funds for\n            community assets creation; and d) provide effective project\n            management systems."}, "docdt": "1997-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
