    THE FEDERALDEMOCRATICREPUBLIC OFETHIOPIA
      FIRSTPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT OPERATION


                  GRANT AND PROGRAMSUMMARY

Borrower:         Federal Democratic Republic o f Ethiopia
Amount:           SDR 83.4 million (US$120 millionequivalent)
Terms:            IDA grant for vulnerable countries
Description:      The project will support the implementation o f the S D P W by:
                  strengthening the focus on planning and budgeting processes;
                  stabilizing the public sector during a period o f rapid state
                  transformation in order to maintain pro-poor expenditures; and
                  improving the investment climate (including for the rural sector).
Benefits:         The project i s supporting a PRSP prepared with strong country
                  ownership which is comprehensive, relevant, sound and supported by
                  a verifiable program o f implementation.            The project is also
                  supporting the Government in improving planning and budgeting
                  processes in an increasingly inclusive and efficient manner. Further,
                  the project supports the decentralization process by adding to the pool
                  o f funds available for timely and predictable fiscal support to local
                  governments.      Finally, project preparation has reduced transaction
                  costs by accelerating donor harmonization around the PRSP process.
Risks:            Successful implementation requires strict adherence to the financial
                  calendar so that regions and districts (or woredas) receive their
                  budgetary allocations ina timely manner. Further, the funds provided
                  for service delivery may be absorbed into financing the growing
                  bureaucratic structures resulting from decentralization. The program
                  mitigates these risks by instituting a financial calendar and having a
                  financing strategy for the one o f f costs o f decentralization. Moreover,
                  the main fiduciary risks relate to delays in preparing, consolidating
                  and auditing financial information.          While a capacity building
                  program i s being designed, it will need to be implemented ina timely
                  and effective manner or it could impact the levels o f multi-sectoral
                  program and donors' budget support. Further, the Government has so
                  far taken only limited actions in private sector development and
                  financial sector development while recognizing that implementation
                  o f this program i s central to achieving higher growth rates in
                  Ethiopia. Given previous experience in Ethiopia and elsewhere, it i s
                  critical that the Government implements the credible program o f prior
                  actions that have been identified for PRSC-11. Finally, there i s a
                  potential risk for re-emergence o f conflict with Eritrea.
Estimated         SDR 83.4 million (US$l20 million equivalent) will be disbursed on

                                  A PROPOSED GRANT TO
       THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OFETHIOPIA
   FORA FIRSTPOVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT OPERATION


                   I.ETHIOPIA'SPOVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

A.     Background

1.     Despite a decade of rapid economic growth, Ethiopia remains one of the poorest
countries in the world with a per capita income of only US$lOO for its populationof 67
million people. Its poverty results from a number of structural factors including geographical
isolation, extreme vulnerability to weather shocks, health hazards (HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB),
lack o f infrastructure, rapid population growth, and extreme environmental degradation. These
factors have combined to lock substantial parts of the population in a poverty trap. In August
2002, the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia published Ethiopia's
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction
                                           -
Program (SDPRP). The SDPRP identified a feasible combination of policies, institutions and
investments needed for poverty reduction.             It focused on improving rural productivity,
accompanied by the fostering o f agriculture, industryand services with a sufficiently highenough
value added to offset the disadvantage o f high transport and logistics costs. Investments are,
hence, necessary for a broad spectrum o f infrastructure (transport, energy, water) and social
services (health and education). Given the low per capita income, domestic spending on such
investments i s constrained despite a good tax effort. Development assistance, while increasing in
the recent past, i s still at per capita levels far lower than other Afncan countries and would need
to increase insupport of the SDPRP.

2.     The SDPRP i s serving as the main instrument for coordinating international support around
a locally owned agenda, and for harmonizing support in ways to reduce transaction costs. The
document has strong ownership within the Government and its preparation was utilized as a
forum for policy discussions with civil society and the donors. Within this harmonized approach,
the policy dialogue covers a broad set o f areas at different stages o f policy formulation and
implementation (including governance and capacity building; rural development, vulnerability
and food security; private sector development; and human development). Duringthe first year of
its implementation, much of the SDPRP vision has been developed into policies and programs
which are under implementation.

3.     As indicatedinthe World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presentedto the Board
inApril 2003, a series of annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits were included for assisting
the Government o f Ethiopia in implementing its SDPRP. It i s inthis context that this Program
Documentpresentsafirst single-tranche PovertyReductionSupport Operation(PRSC-I) to
the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in the amount of SDR 83.4 million @JS$l20
millionequivalent) to support the implementation ofEthiopia's poverty reductionstrategy.

B.     Policies, Growth andPovertyReductioninEthiopia

4.     The SDPRP's goals, objectives and strategies were set in the context of a decade of
progress in economic performanceand poverty reduction.Followingthe collapse o fthe Derg
regime, structural reforms began in the early 1990s. Foreign exchange markets were liberalized
and the birr was devalued, bringinga 50% depreciation inthe real exchange rate. Initial emphasis
was placed on the agriculture sector, where reforms reversed the heavy burden o f implicit taxes
on the rural economy. Restrictions on grain traders were relaxed and then lifted, food delivery
quotas on farmers were lifted, whilst restrictions on agricultural input markets were lowered and
seed and fertilizer availability increased dramatically. Farmgate prices for tradeables improved,
productivity increased, and production expanded. Progress was also made in improving the

homegrown civil service reform program - comprising expenditure and human resource
efficiency of tax policy and in lowering customs tariffs. Privatization reforms began, and a

managements reforms as well as initiatives in performance improvement and ethics - was
launched to increase the efficiency and effectiveness o fEthiopia's nascent federal system.

5.     Growth in the reform period since 199213 averaged 5.8% per annum, implying
historicallyhighper capita GDP growth of about 2.8% per year. Growth inthe early days of
the reform period came from an increase inprivate consumption, was spread quite evenly across
the agricultural, industrial and service sectors and was spurred on by substantial improvements in
food production. In the latter half of the 1990s, government expenditures (especially military
expenditures during 1998 and 1999) and government investment (education, health,
infrastructure) became a more important source of growth. This compares with an average fall in
per capita GDP o f about 1% per annum from 1974-91 under the Derg regime, and an annual
average increase of just around 1.5% for the period from 1951-1973. While average growth in
the reform period since 1992 was historically strong, annual growth rates have been erratic,
especially since 1996/7'. Real GDP growth averaged 7.0% per annum in the first five years of
the reform period to 1996/7, but has averagedonly 1.O% per year since.

6.     Stable macro policies have been maintained throughout the last decade. Annual
inflation since 1992/3 has averaged under 2% (largely driven by wide swings in cereal prices).
Non-food inflation i s also low, running at around 3% annually since the reform period began.
The fiscal deficit was carefully managed; the deficit after grants averaged 5.1% of GDP from
1992-97, although it had risen to an average of 8% since then. Monetary policy has also been
muchmore stable than the average for Sub-SaharanAfi-ica -with broad money growth averaging
about 12% annually since 1992, about halfthe African average. The exchange rate i s managedto
keep the real exchangerate constant, althoughit has depreciated slightly over the past 3 years. At
3.7% o f GDP between 1992-2001,the external current account including grants has been close to
the averagefor Sub-SaharanAfrica althoughseverely affected by the coffee price decline and the
reduction ingrants duringthe war.

7.     Despitea reducingshare inGDP, agriculture remainsimportant. Over the last decade,
agricultural contribution as a percentage o f GDP has decreasedfrom 57% to 43%; the agricultural
sector has grown at only 2.5% o f GDP per annum whereas the non-agricultural GDP has grown
strongly at about 8% per annum. However, agriculture plays an important role as it provides the
livelihood for 85 percent of the population, and accounts for 80-90% of merchandise exports.
Highvolatility causedbypoorrains, sharply deteriorating terms oftrade since 1996, andconflict,
has dampened growth. Following a bumper cereal crop in2000, agricultural output fell for two

'Annual  real GDP growth has fluctuated widely between a peak o f 12.0% in 199213 to a fall of -3.8 last
year.

successive years, falling most starkly by 12% during last year's drought which threatened 15
million people with starvation. Falling coffee prices since 1997198have seen the value of coffee
exports fall from $420 millionto just $142.4 million last year. Dependence on agriculture leaves
the population of Ethiopia highly vulnerable to weather and terms of trade shocks (e.g. a massive
decline incoffee prices). The weather shocks also result ina slower decline inpoverty due to the
continuing impact that malnutrition and resultant stunting have on the future productivity of
survivors.

8.     Improved economic performance has translated into some poverty reduction,
especially during the first half of the 1990s, but less so during the latter part. While no
nationally representative information on poverty i s available for the first halfof the 1990s, several
studies conclude that per capita private consumption rose significantly from 1992193 to 1996197.
Since public spending became the dominant source o f growth (initially military spending and
then substantial investments in education, health and roads), the poverty-elasticity o f growth can
be expected to have slowed down between 1997-2002. This seems to be reflected inthe poverty
data, with the poverty headcount reducing only by 2 percentage points from 46% to 44% between
1995-2000. While this may be a slight underestimation, these results are broadly consistent with
the evolution of private consumption per capita.' Since 2000, consumption poverty is likely to
have risen.

9.     Despite limited reduction in income poverty in the second half of the 1990s, the
magnitude and the direction of other measures of welfare show significant improvements.
On the social sector side, social and human development policies have been given much greater
emphasis since the end o f the conflict with Eritrea, and poverty-targeted expenditures have risen
dramatically. Stunting, a measure of long-run malnutrition for children less than 5 years, stood at
57% which i s still extremely highby international standards although extreme stunting 3declined
from 44% in 1995 to 31% in2000. School enrollment rates have increased dramatically and the
gross enrollment rate has improved from 30% inthe late 1980s to 62% in 2003. The proportion
o f the population with access to primary health care, sanitation and clean water has also
improved. The distances covered by halfthe populationto reach a health center and water source
have all declined between 1995 and 2000 as a result of large public investments in schools,
clinics, roads, water, and energy. Other health outcomes have been somewhat less promising,
especially as a result of the HIVIAIDS crisis and low levels of immunization coverage, and
maternal and infant mortality remainhighrelative to other low income countries.

10.    The reforms reduced poverty, but a new impetus was needed. Poverty remains
extremely high in Ethiopia at a 44% national poverty rate or about 28 million Ethiopians below
the poverty line in 2000. Further, the situation i s also worse than the national averages in
particular regions. The challenge of poverty reduction i s that, if the population growth rate
remains at 2.9% per annum, Ethiopia will need to grow annually by 4-5% just to prevent
increasesinthe absolute number of poor people.

C.     The SDPRP Strategy

11.     The Government's long-term development vision i s to build a free market economic
system that will enable the economy to develop rapidly, extricate itself from its dependence on
food aid, and allow poor people to be the mainbeneficiaries of growth. Insupport of this vision,


 A methodological review ofthe data is underway as part ofthe Poverty Assessment.
 Extreme stunting is definedas stunting where the height to age ratio is three standard deviations from the
mean.


                                                   3

the development objective of SDPRP is to reduce poverty by enhancing rapid economic
growth while at the same time maintaining macro-economic stability and equitable growth
and a positivesocial impact. Specifically, real GDP is targeted to grow by at least 7 percent on
average duringthe programperiod with all the sectors contributing to achieve this result; and the
poverty head count is projectedto decline by about 10 % (about 4 percentage points) by 2004/05
from its 1999/00 level o f 44 percent. The main measures for achieving the SDPRP objectives
relate to structural and state transformation,i.e. rapid growth inthe agriculture sector; private
sector development; rapid non-traditional export growth; major investments in education and
capacity building; deepened and strengthened decentralization;               improved governance,
empowerment of the poor and enablingenvironment for PSD; and a focus on food security.

12.    Buildingon earlier efforts inthe 199Os, Ethiopia's state transformation agenda is designed
to (i) federal, regional, and local institutions to deliver services efficiently and effectively,
      enable
(ii)empower citizens through public participation, and (iii)      promote accountability and good
governance in an environment favorable to value creation. This strategy o f institutional overhaul
and capacity building i s to be achieved through a revamped civil service reform program; a
second phase of democratic decentralization to districts (or woredas) in rural areas and
municipalities in urban centers; as well as the roll-out of tax and justice systems reform.
Complementary efforts to support ICT-based solutions across public sector institutions are also
underway.

13.    Structural transformation aims to accelerate growth through greater emphasis on market
development. Inrural areas, the strategy focuses on the "marketization" of agriculture including
improvements in land tenure security, demand based agricultural extension services; competitive
inputsand output markets; and the development of cooperatives. On the urban side, the focus is
on improving the investment climate (competition policy, improvements in availability and price
of urban land leases, financial sector reform, and availability o f infrastructure especially power
                                                                                  -
and telecommunications) inconsultationwith the private sector.

14.    The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the World Bank and the IMF endorsed the
SDPRP as a sound basis for continued assistance to Ethiopia and noted several positive
features. However, the JSA also identified as areas for improvement: formulation of
alternative macroeconomic scenarios; further articulation of strategies for promoting rural
and private sector development; evaluation of the early experiencewith decentralization; a
refinementinthe costingof the PRSP programs; and the needfor a strategyto manage and
reducevulnerability. Specifically, the areas o f improvementrelatedto:

0   The formulation o f the SDPRP included a special focus on private sector development
    including the business environment, the financial sector, infrastructure, market institutions
    and rural markets. Further, during the formulation process, the Govemment also focused on
    rural development issues. Broad policy directions were indicated in these various areas;
    however, the underlying action plans for private sector development, finance and rural
    development were not finalized at that time.


0   The growth forecasts contained inthe SDPRP were higher by 1% per annum than the growth
    projections whichhad been agreed to inthe context of the PRGF discussions. Inthe absence
    of credible action plans, it was difficult to establish how the incremental growth would occur.
    There was also uncertainty regarding external financing since a major variable (i.e. the IDA
    allocation) was not available because the CAS was still under formulation. This was further
    complicatedby concerns about Ethiopia's extemal debt sustainability.



                                                   4

    The JSA highlightedthe need to develop more specific measures to strengthen the justice
    system, enhance transparency, and fight corruption. It also stressedthe importance of a well
    developed strategy for addressing the implementation challenges associated with woreda
    decentralization inter alia by setting service delivery benchmarks, developing more effective
    mechanisms for transferring resources, building capacity in a sustainable manner, and
    instituting robust M&E systems to track decentralized service delivery.               Further,
    decentralization was also expected to have implications for the costs of service delivery,
    including one-time costs and changes inrecurrent and investment costs.

    Finally, the SDPRP was based on the policy content and costs of major elements of existing
    sector programs (ineducation, health andtransport). However, reviews of all three programs
    were underway.

15.   Progress during the first year of SDPRP implementation has been mixed. The
Government i s finalizing its first Annual Program Review(APR) to be presented at the upcoming
Consultative Group meeting(December 1 and 2,2003). The APR reviews the performance of the
past year as well as the actions implemented, in addition to refining the SDPRP in terms o f
monitorable targets and implementable policies and programs, especially inthe areas where the
IMF/WorldBank Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) outlined the need for refinements. These included
the need for more specific agendas on rural growth andprivate sector development and mitigation
measures to ensure that the ongoing decentralization drive yields favorable results. In addition,
the APR will add depth to the vulnerability pillar. Working closely with civil society and the
donor community, the Government has developed a time-bound plan to reduce the impact of
rainfall variability and the vulnerability to famines. The emphasis i s onnew programs such as the
development o f a productive safety net, migration to newly developed lands, and the exploration
of a price support mechanism to stabilize agricultural prices. Inaddition, there has been an effort
to make the SDPRP more hunger sensitive, especially in terms of increasing the emphasis on
growth infood insecure regions.

16.   Economic growth during the first year of SDPRP implementation was adversely
affected by a severe drought the worst to hit Ethiopia since 1984/85. There are around 5
                                  -
million people who suffer from chronic food insecurity and for whom, in the context o f the
SDPRP,     the Government had begun to develop programs at a community level to foster
economic diversification, labor mobility, and provide more effective social protection. However,
the drought increased the number of people threatened by starvation from 5 to 15 million
requiring a more substantial emergency response. Real GDP in 2002/03 is estimated to have
declined by -3.8%, largely because o f a fall in the cereals harvest. Agricultural production in
2002/03 i s estimated to have fallen by 12% compared to the previous year's production, which
was itself already slightly down from the bumper harvest of 2000/01.            In addition, water
shortages interrupted hydro-power generation, and caused power cuts in urban centers. Food
shortages caused a sharp increase in cereal prices and the Consumer Price Index rose by an
estimated 14.6% during 2002/03, following two years of negative price inflation when food
prices were falling. Inresponseto the drought, vulnerability has hence emerged as a highpriority
issue and the Government i s workmg to add to its SDPRP, inthe first APR review, a programto
eliminate the chronic food insecurity affectingabout 12 millionpersons withinthe next 5 years.

11.        SDPRP FINANCING: ROLE OFMULTI-SECTORAL PROGRAMASSISTANCE


17.     As was noted in the last CAS, Ethiopia is currently unlikely to achieve several of the
MillenniumDevelopment Goal (MDG) targets by 2015 primarily due to substantial (and unmet)
financing needs. Achieving the SDPRP targets by 2004/05 will help to make modest progress
towards the MDG targets; even this will require domestic financing (from high levels of growth
and increasing volume of tax revenues) and higher levels of official development assistance
(ODA) to support increases in primary service delivery. Given the decentralized nature o f the
state in Ethiopia, the planning (including those related to inter-sectoral choices), budgeting and
implementation of primary service delivery occurs at the regional level or, below that, at the
district (or woreda) level. Financing i s transferred from federal level to regional level and from
regional level to woreda level through a system o f inter-governmental fiscal transfers or
subsidies. Consequently, it has become increasingly attractive to provide multi-sectoral program
or direct budget support to the Government and to allow these funds to indirectly increase
government funds available for federal-regional or regional-woreda transfers.

18.        Donors, hence, place a greater emphasis on assessing the expenditure outcomes of
previous fiscal years and budgetary allocations for future fiscal years and the associated output
and outcome targets at a sectoral level. These activities - annual public expenditure reviews and
sectoral reviews for health, education and roads - have been institutionalized in Ethiopia for
several years now but the importance of these activities became central duringthe preparationof
the first PRSC series. The remainder of this section reviews the expenditure results based on the
currently available data; it i s expected that as this revised process becomes institutionalized in
future PRSCs, the nature o f the dialogue will evolve further and with a much greater emphasis on
primary service delivery.

19.     Inadditionto the assessment ofpublic expenditure whichthe rest ofthis sectionis devoted
to, it i s important to note that multi-sectoral program support donors and budget support donors
have also assessed and have planned assistanceto support inthe positive evolution of three main
aspects o f the public expenditure management systems. First, the rules embodied in the inter-
governmental fiscal transfer system will evolve to provide appropriate incentives to local
governments to increaseprimary service delivery. Second, financial management systems will be
strengthened to provide timely and reliable data on overall expenditure utilization.         Third,
monitoring and evaluation systems will also be strengthened to provide timely and reliable data
on the outputs and outcomes resulting from the public expenditure. It should be noted that the
assessment of public expenditure management systems and the Government's existing and
planned program of policy changes to address these constraints are at the center o f the PRSC-I
through I11 reform agenda and are supplemented by a multi-donor supported Government
capacity building program. These measures are described in detail in section I11D on public
sector reform(paragraphs 71 to 101).

A.      FinancingNeedsfor the SDPRP andMDGtargets

20. Growth rates will have to rise for Ethiopia to meet the PRSP and MDGs targets.
Ethiopia will not be able to reach its SDPRP targets (or the MDGs) under current growth

     performance trends. Growth projections4 show that: with population continuing to grow at 2.8%
     per annum; an unchanged fiscal framework stance; growth trends remaining unchanged; and the
      historical relationshipbetween growth and MDGoutcomesholding infuture, Ethiopia i s unlikely
     to reach either the SDPRP or MDG targets for poverty reduction and could at best reach the
      education targets. Real growth of between 6.5 and 7.2% betweennow and 2015 would be needed
     to halve income poverty, under alternative assumptionsfor the poverty elasticity of growth. Total
      investment would need to rise to 28-32% o f GDP, depending on the efficiency o f investment.
     The key variables are indicated in Table 1 below which compares recent trends in economic
      growth, poverty reduction, and recent performance against the MDGs; SDPRP targets, based on
     the existingfiscal positionand implementationofthe SDPRP; andthe MDGtarget andthe annual

Note : The projected annual average cost is estimated by linearly adjusting the SDPRP target outcome by the desired
rate. For example, growth in gross primary enrolment rate (GPER) inthe SDPRP is about 3.3%, while the desired rate
to achieve the MDGtarget is 3.8 % (see Table 1). Therefore, the cost to meet the MDGtarget for GPER is computed as
the cost as per SDPRP multiplied by 3.W 3.3. MDGs considered for projecting sector cost are: for agriculture
food poverty line, for water - the                                                                              - the
                                  water and sanitation targets, for education - the GPER, and for health- the under 5
mortality rate.

22.    Major public investments would be required to place Ethiopia on a sustainable
growth path. Inturn, and given the low levels of domestic savings, such an effort would require
major support from the international community. Indeed, if absorption capacity was adequate,
ODA i s likely to be extremely productive in a country such as Ethiopia. Applying the
Collier/Dollar (2001) estimates of the determinants of the retum to ODA to the case of Ethiopia,
ODA in Ethiopia has potentially highest return inthe world interms o f poverty reduction: every
$1 million o f ODA reduces poverty by 1500 persons. The reasons behind this result are that
Ethiopiai s poor, has reasonably good policies, and received low levels o f international support.

23.     Given its low income, a doubling of aid would translate into levels of ODA to GDP inthe
range o f 25 to 30% of GDP which i s a level that few countries have managedto sustain over time.
Several factors suggest that Ethiopia could manage its short term macroeconomic implications
and positively benefit from large inflows in the medium term (e.g. prudent macro economic
policy, labor surplus limiting real exchange rate appreciation, low, food being largely a non-
traded item and very low levels of asset accumulation providing potential for positive
externalities).     There are, however, risks associated with the substantial scaling up of
development assistance. First, Dutch disease effects associatedwith increased aid revenues could

adversely affect the tradable goods sector and eventually overall economic growth. Second, and
more importantly, effective use of aid resources will require measures that can increase public
sector absorption capacity through the focus on decentralization and on capacity building and an
increasing role for the private sector inservice delivery.

B.     Review of BudgetOutcomes

RecentPerformance

24.    A key aspect of the provision of support through the PRSC is to depend upon the efficacy
o f the Government's own expenditure management systems. Consequently, the results from the
perspective o f budgetary outcomes generally and funding for priority sectors and primary service
delivery specifically were assessed. Such a review has been ongoing inEthiopia for several years
in the context of Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs); however, this was the first year that the
work on budgetary outcomes was being undertaken in the context of the proposed PRSC and
donor budget support operations. This section focuses its assessment on four important areas:
overall macro economic developments; overall fiscal outcomes; sectoral allocations; and
allocations for primary service delivery. Separately, the robustness of the Government's
expenditure management systems is assessed in section I11(under the public sector institutional
performance sub-section).

25.    Variability between Budgets and Actual Spending in Ethiopia is Low. Assessment of
Ethiopia's recent performance in budget execution i s complicated by delays in budget
consolidation and reporting, which have been extended with decentralization. The provisional
consolidated budget for 2002/03 became available only inearly June 2003 i.e. inthe 1lthmonth
of the fiscal year. Actual data are typically made available one year after the end o f the fiscal
year. The consolidated budget for 2003/04 is under finalization. These recent delays aside, the
recurrent budget in Ethiopia i s traditionally implemented within 5% o f planned spending.     By
comparison, average variability inthe capital budget over the past 7 years has been around 20%,
with the biggest variation by far coming in donor disbursements. This may mark an absorption
problem, but much of the explanation for the large difference between budgetedaid and reported
budget outtum is under-reporting and, to some extent, overly optimistic budgeting for grant-
funded donor-run projects. By reducing variability in donor disbursements, the shift to multi-
sectoral program and budget support by donors should reduce the variability inEthiopia's capital
budget.

27.    FY02/03 Macro Performance. Recent macro-economic developments were heavily
influenced by the adverse impact o f the severe drought. First, real GDP i s estimated to have
declined by -3.8% though nominal GDP rose by 8.6% due to higher price inflation. Second, food
shortages and increases in cereal prices resulted in the Consumer Price Index rising by 14.6%
following two years o f negative price inflation when food prices were falling; underlying non-
food inflation remained relatively stable averaging around 3% over the past few years. Third,
external sector performance was also affectedas exports rose by an estimated 8.6% while imports
increasedby an estimated 16.5%. Imports volumes rose by 12.6% compared to the previous year
as the drought spurred a sharp increase in food aid imports and oil prices were slightly higher.
Since most of the increase inimports was aid-financed, the current account deficit on the balance
of payments is estimated to be around the same in2002/03 as the previous year, at about 6.1% of
GDP. Finally, foreign exchange reserves are estimated at 4.1 months, below the PRGF program
target o f4.3, but up from 3.3 months o f imports in2001/02.

28.   FiscalTrends. Ethiopia's fiscal policy has become more expansionary inthe recent past,
driven initially by military spending, but more recently by public investment as defense spending
has fallen. Total budget expenditure has increased substantially inthe past 5 years, by 88 percent
in nominal terms since 1997/98.        This amounts to an increase from 24 percent o f GDP in
1997/98 to around 37.5 percent in 2002/03 (Table 4). The overall fiscal deficit including grants

     and emergency assistance i s estimated to have declined from 9.3% of GDP in2001/02 to 8.5% in
     2002/03; excluding grants, the deficit i s estimated to have widened from 14% of GDP to 17.4%
     as it includes emergency assistance of around 5.4% o f GDP.

     29.     FY02/03 outturns. Total revenue reached 30.5% of GDP in 2002/03, compared with
     24.8% and 23.6% respectively in the preceding two years. Even adjusting for emergency
     assistance in 2002/03, total revenue and grants were 24.8% of GDP, compared with an average
     for SSA o f about 23.6% in2002. Fiscal expansion has been financed almost evenly by increased
     domestic revenues, increased external grants, and increased external financing (see Table 4).
     Domestic revenues rose from 18.8% in2000/01 to 21.7% in2002/03, with tax revenue continuing
     a steady rise, reaching 16% of GDP in 2002/03 compared to 15.3% in 2001/02 and 13.7% in
     2000/01. External grants rose from 3.2% of GDP in 1999/00, before the end o f the war with
     Eritrea, to 4.7% in 2001/02, then peaked at 8.8% of GDP in 2002/03 in response to the food
     crisis. External financing of the budget doubled from 3.8% o f GDP in 2000/01 to 7.6% in
     2002/03. Domestic financing has dropped dramatically since the end o f the conflict with Eritrea.

     30.     FY03/04 budget. The final column of table 4 sets out the fiscal framework in the PRGF
     program. The overall deficit i s programmedto fall by one percentage point of GDP, to -7.5% o f
     GDP, despite a small fall in total revenue and grants, and a continued rise in tax revenue, to

 16.5% of GDP. External financing i s programmed to fall by 2.1% of GDP, largely because IDA
disbursements are set to drop as IDA i s restraining new lending commitments and disbursingonly
grants aheado f HIPC Completion Point.

31. Multi-sectoral program and Donor Budget Support Flows. The most notable shift on
the revenue side is towards program credits and grants, which are projected to rise from
1.3% to 4.0% of GDP; the PRSC accounts for around half of the 4.0% program grants
figure. In FY03, Government received $194.7 million either through multi-sectoral program
lending or donor budget support (an IDA credit of $120 million, an EUgrant of the equivalent of
$39.1 million, a credit from the African Development Bank o f $20 million and a DFID grant of
the equivalent of $15.6 million). In FY04, Government's budget projects receipts of US$38.5
million from EU and $27 million from African Development Bank). Based on the proposed
budget support from various donors participating inthe mission, up to US$250 million would be
available     (SEK 80 million from Sweden, GB Pounds 10 million from DFID, up to Euro 30
million from EU, US$4 million from Germany and US$50 million from African Development
Bank and C$lO million from Canada).

32.     Sectoral Allocations. The build-up in spending since 1996/7 was initially driven by
increased military spending during the war years (1998-2000). However defense spending has
since declined from a peak of 12.9% o f GDP in 2000, to 5.5% this year, and since 2002/03, a
nominal ceiling o f Birr 3 billion has been set for future years. The budget has become more pro-
poor as spending in other areas - mainly poverty focused sectors - has increased by an amount
just more than equal to the fall in military spending. Overall, the share of poverty spending
doubled fromjust below 28% in 1999100, to 56% inthe 2003104 budget. The most notable shifts
in post-war expenditure are towards the social sectors (see table 5). As a proportion of GDP,
poverty spending for 2003104 is budgeted at 20% o f GDP. However as the final column o f table
5 shows, in current $US per capita terms, this remains a meager amount. Health spending per
capita for instance i s well below the cost o f abasic public healthpackage.

33.    FY03l04 Budget. The Federal budget for FY200314 was approved by Parliament in July
2003. Expenditures on poverty-targeted sectors continue to improve, with military spending
falling marginally. The main growth can be attributed to a major expansion of the food security
and a continued prioritization in favor of the national capacity building programs. The latter
includes financing for the roll-out of the woreda and school net projects, which provides an ICT
infrastructure to schools and Government offices across the country, and which was initiated in
FY02103, i s also funded and i s expected to be completed.           In conclusion, the budget is
increasingly becoming pro-poor. The shares of spending for social services are relatively high
compared with other Sub-Saharan African counties. Yet inper capita spending, the amounts are
inadequate to deliver basic services to Ethiopia's poor people.

C.     PRSPImplementation Processes

34.    The Government has focused on mainstreaming PRSP implementation processes in
order to achieve three goals. First, the Government desired to reduce transaction costs by
rationalizing and harmonizing planning and implementation processes related to the SDPRP
including those related to ongoing sector development programs, a major cross-sectoral public
sector capacity buildingprogram, as well as its woreda and municipal decentralization program.
Second, the Government wanted to ensure increasing donor provision of timely and predictable
multi-sectoral program or budget support to its rapidly evolving federal system. Since its own
Treasury resources have historically been utilized more rapidly then projectized donor financing
across tiers of government, the Government was interested in increasing the levels of external
assistance moving through direct funding channels, and then disbursed across budgetary
institutions as Treasury funds. Finally, the Government aimed to promote planning and
budget processes at the local government level by ensuring resource predictability through
the intergovernmentalsystem, which utilizes federal-regional as well as regional-local transfers
to meet the respective delivery responsibilities of successive tiers of government. Giventhat the
decentralization program extends down three levels (Federal, regional and district/woreda), the
planning process requires several iterations, and therefore ample time for preparation and
approval. Delays inthe start o f the medium-termexpenditure planning cycle had led to budget
allocations by local governments being made well after the start o f the relevant fiscal year. The
Government had failed to observe its own published financial calendar inrecent years and wanted
to improve performance in this area and sought assistance from its partners, particularly by
donors providing early indications of commitments to allow for certainty which can in turn be
passedon to local governments. Since SDPRP finalization, the Government focused on: refining
the PRSPpolicy matrix; and aligning the PRSP, planning andbudgetingcycles and designing one
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for use by the PRSP and for both PRSC multi-sectoral
program support and donors' budget support operations.

35.    The Government has engaged in a substantial effort to refine the SDPRP policy
matrix and to identify a sub-set of indicatorsthat couldbe utilized for PRSCmulti-sectoral
programsupport and donors' budgetsupportoperations. The revisedmatrix has clarified the
relationship between outcome, output, and input indicators. Outcome indicators specified in the
SDPRP document would be used for measuring achievement of development goals. In order to
reduce the actions in the policy matrix to a smaller and more manageable level, Government
established four inter-ministerial worlung groups to develop matices for each o f the four main
themes contained in the PRSP: growth (private sector development, rural d,evelopment,
vulnerability and roads); human development outcomes (education, health and water); public
sector institutional outcomes and democratic decentralizatiodgovernance.          However, since
outcome indicators are subject to external risks or assumptions about the behaviors of non-


                                                 13

Governmental stakeholders, output indicators would be utilized to measure Government policy
and implementation performance annually as the basis for release of multi-sectoral program or
donors' budget support funding. Finally, input indicators would consist o f policy actions and
constitute "prior actions," "triggers," or "benchmarks" to be completed before the approval of
each PRSC. Schedule 2 contains the World Bank PRSC matrix as a subset of the overall
multi-sectoralprogram and budgetsupportmatrix.

36.   Since the implementation of the PRSP will occur through Ethiopia's own public
sector management systems, the Government has begunto alignthe PRSP implementation
processwith its Macro-Economic and FiscalFramework (MEFF) planningprocess and the
annual budget preparation process. This integration will also include alignment of dialogue
with donors, particularly those providing multi-sectoral program or budget support. Specific
planned changes are shown in Figure 1 and include five key features.                 First, PRSP
implementation would be aligned with the financial year o f the Government (July 8-July 7)
thereby aligning measurement o f outcome and output targets with the measurement of fiscal
outturns. Second, the sequence and timing of existing sector review processes would be aligned
with the annual PRS review process. Third, the PRS Annual Progress Review (APR) would be
held around three to four months after the end of the fiscal year (October-November).        This
would allow fiscal results from the previous FY to inform the annual PRS review. Fourth, the
Annual Progress Review would precede the MEFFprocess. This would allow donors to review
past progress and make indicative commitments in time for the Government to utilize these
commitments in its MEFF process. This would, of course, mean that the APR has sufficient
information to allow donors to reach judgments on commitments for future years. Fifth, the
existing Public Expenditure Review (PER) process will be integrated into the cycle by being split
into two parts - the review of the previous fiscal year outturns will be undertaken intime for the
Annual PRS Progress Review and the evaluation of the next fiscal year's budget will occur
separately inApril-May.

37.   The sequencing of the PRSC operations over the transitional period is shown in
Figure 2. For PRSC I,the timing o f the approval and effectiveness would be after the first
annual PRSprogress review and it would provide funds which would be utilized inFY03/04 (i.e.
the current fiscal year). Moving immediately to a cycle whereby funds under PRSC I1would be
available before the start of FY04/05 would result ina period o f less than six months inwhich to
demonstrate results. Hence, the proposal is that the eventual alignment with Government budget
cycle would occur over two credits: PRSC I1would disburse its funds around October-November
2004; andPRSC I11around June-July 2005.

D.      FiduciaryStandards

 38.    FiduciaryAssessments. Duringthe first year of PRSP implementation, extensive review
 o f the country's public financial management accountability arrangements, which cover its public
 expenditure, procurement and financial management systems, was undertaken in the context of
the Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR). These assessments were carried out against a backdrop of the
Government's existing reform program and the woreda decentralization policy which is currently
posing short-term challenges for financial management and accountability arrangements by
exacerbating the limitation inskills and capacity at the woreda level.

39.     CFAA.. The recent Ethiopia CFAA sought to enhance howledge of financial
accountability arrangements in the public and private sectors in Ethiopia and was a joint
undertaking o f the government, Bank, and other donors. In addition to the federal level, the
CFAA reviewed financial accountability arrangements in four regions, Amhara, Tigray, Somali
and SNNP Region, as part of the CFAA. Inparticular, the work focused on the effects o f this
devolution program and identified measures, in particular training and capacity building
programs, that could help to strengthenthe accountability environment.

40.     CFAA Findings. The overall conclusionwas that considerable progress has been made in
the rationalization and strengthening of budgeting processes at the Federal level. Ethiopia's
financial integrity was rated as `above average', ranking Ethiopia above the modal point innearly
all areas compared with other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.             Against a tradition of a
disciplined culture of Ethiopian society, there i s little evidence o f systemic and widespread
corruption inthe public sector. The CFAA noted that the woreda decentralization strategy, while
ambitious and rapid, is being managed pragmatically, primarily through common sense
approaches undertaken by Regions but this remains a key area of concern as the findings were of
a tentative nature given that the process was in its early stages at the time that the CFAA field
work was undertaken. While the activities carried out in certain regions, such as the SNNP
Region under the Budget Reform Program, have made some progress, the CFAA noted that the
rollout to other regions was still underway and support for this initiative was essential. In
addition to the impact of decentralization, other areas of concern raised by the assessment
included: (i)   the totality of Govemment funds or public money is not comprehensively covered
within the existing financial reporting structures; (ii) although there have been improvements in
rolling out the new chart of accounts, current accounting and reporting systems are still weak in
terms o f delay and their incomplete nature; (iii) i s urgent need to ensure that internal audit
                                                   there
and other functions o f intemal control start to operate effectively at boththe Regional and Federal
level; (iv) backlog in the presentation o f audited accounts; (vi) staff skill shortages at woreda
level.

41.     Given the important role envisaged for the private sector, NGOs and civil society in
enforcing financial accountability, the CFAA also reviewed the private sector and Non-
Govemmental Organizations (NGOs). There i s a shortage of resources for enforcing the law and
monitoring compliance for NGOs. The development of the private sector financial accountability
i s relatively low but the regulatory framework i s largely sufficient to provide for good corporate
governance. On the issue of the audit`accountancy profession, there is no national accountancy
body or `standard setting' body and the academic and practical training capacity in the Private
Sector needs to be enhanced.

42.     CFAA Recommendations and Development Action Plan. In order to maintain the


                                                  17

`above average' rating under a more decentralized system, a number o f prioritized
recommendations were highlighted in the draft CFAA Development Action Plan.                   The
implementationo f the CFAA Development Action Plan is occurring within the broader context of
the Government's Civil Service Reform Program and its Public Service Delivery Capacity
BuildingProgram.

43.    The CFAA recommendationsare, hence, an integral part of the Government'sPublic
Sector Reformprogram (as per the detailsprovidedinparagraphs89 through 93 ). Several
recommended actions which focus on improving the planning and budgeting cycle and
improvingfinancial management processesand information systems are central elements of
the public institutionalperformancesection of the policymatrix in Schedule 2. Finally, key
activities are prior actions for PRSC-I(issuance of and compliancewith a financial calendar
and introduction of new chart of accounts in four regions) and PRSC-I1 (reduction in the
auditsbacklogfor the federal accountsto one year) as notedinparagraphs 183 and 184.

44.    CPAR. Also completed in early FY03, the CPAR reviewed the Ethiopian procurement
system against the generally accepted international principles o f sound procurement fiduciary
management, i.e. transparency, economy and efficiency necessary for an optimal use of scarce
public funds. The Report provided: (i)    an analysis of the country's public sector procurement,
including the legislative framework, organizational responsibilities and capabilities, present
procedures and practices, and how well these work in practice; (ii)   a general assessment of the
institutional and organizational risks associatedwith the procurement process, and (iii) a detailed
action plan for improvements. The CPAR recommendations were coordinatedwith donors such
as the EU, UK and Sweden, which are also engaged in procurement reform initiatives with the
Government.

45.    Context of the CPAR The approximate value o fpublic procurement of goods, works and
consulting services financed by external assistance and external loans in 2001/02 i s estimated at
Birr 1,755.44 million (about US$208 millionequivalent). The approximate percentage of goods,
works and consulting services financed by external agencies is 24%.         Currently the bulk of
spending is still carried out by the federal Government, with the Ministryo f Defense in2001/02
comprising a major part o f the recurrent budgetnet of debt servicing and other special deductions.
On the capitalbudget side the Ethiopia Roads Authority (ERA) accounts for just under halfof the
provisions, followed bythe Civil Aviation Authority. Though it i s expected to increase rapidly as
decentralization reforms take root, currently little spending takes place at the woreda level, and
much of the latter's budgets are administered by zonal administrations, which are deconcentrated
branches o f regional government. The capacity of local governments to prepare and execute
budgets and carry out procurement varies. While major cities like Addis Ababa and DireDawa
have beenprocuring for years on their own account, woredas have effectively no capacity.

46.    Findings of the CPAR. The CPAR found that standard criteria (i.e. comprehensive and
transparent legal framework, modernized procurement procedures, proficient staff, independent
control mechanism, anti-corruption measures) are partially satisfied in Ethiopia, and that
improvements are necessary in a number o f areas, either by starting reform initiatives suggested
inthereportor bycompletingthe ones already underway.

47.    Strengths and Weaknesses of the Current Procurement System. As mentioned above,
corruption does not appear to be systemic or widespread in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, areas
identified by the report as requiring improvement included the legal and regulatory framework,
institutional framework, procurement practices and procedures, private sector, and building sub-
national capacity to cope with the demands of the decentralized system.                 Substantial


                                                 18

improvements can be achieved through the completion of the reform initiatives already underway
under the procurement component of the Government's Civil Service Reform Program. Other
new reform initiatives, such as the procurement Code, the establishment o f an adequate
Procurement Body and the training of staff are to be completed under the forthcoming Bank-
financedPSCAP project.

48.    Recommendations. The CPAR recommended implementation of a set o f priority actions,
including enhancing the capacity of the Task Force for procurement reform; preparing
comprehensive procurement legislation based on the existing legal fiamework one already
present, to meet internationally acceptable standards; preparing standard, fully comprehensive
biddingdocuments andProceduresManuals; strengtheningthe MOFEDProcurement Department
to assume the functions of a Procurement Policy and Monitoring Directorate; promoting
dissemination and use o f Ethics code in the context of the CRSP; launching a sustained
procurement capacity building program; and involving the private sector and civil society as a
whole in the procurement reform. The risks resulting from resistance to change that could
hamper a successful implementation o f the proposed reforms were considered to be low because
these reforms are fully compatible with the general aim of the Government to modernize
procurement regulations and practices and with the Government's decentralization policy. The
Government has made substantialprogress in implementingthe findings of the CPAR and,
in order to further the dialogueon procurement reformis planning to publicly disclosethe
findingsof the CPAR.

49.    The CPAR recommendationsare an integral part of the Government's Public Sector
Reform program (as per the details provided in paragraph 94). Several recommended
actions which focus on decentralizing procurement implementation arrangements and
strengtheningproceduresand practicesare includedinthe public institutionalperformance
section of the policy matrix in Schedule 2. Finally, key activities are prior actions for
PRSC-I (adoption of a circular devolving procurement responsibilities from MOFED to
federal budgetary institutions) and PRSC-II (enactment of a procurementproclamation) as
notedinparagraphs 183 and 184.

E.     Donor HarmonizationArrangements

50.    Dialogue betweendonors and Government commenced inthe early 1990s and, since 1997,
there has been increasing co-ordination between the Government and donors in the context of
three sector programs: health, education and transport, and also in joint forums (e.g. Public
Finance Management committee). The formulation of the InterimPRSP and the PRSP provided
increased opportunities for Government-donor interactions and together with a donor
harmonization initiative and multi-sectoral program and budget support harmonization have
resultedinchanges indonor coordination arrangements. The donors, under the aegis o f the local
Development Assistance Group (DAG) - which i s co-chaired by the World Bank and the UNDP      -
met regularly with Government as the SDPRP was being prepared, with the result that a DAG
Joint Partner Review o f the SDPRP was prepared inconjunctionwith the JSA.

51.    Harmonization. The overall partnership architecture has been definedthrough Ethiopia's
participation, over the last year, as one of the three pilot countries in the Initiative for
Harmonization of Donor Policies, Procedures and Practices. Inthis context, the Government re-
affirmed its commitment to the harmonization process in the context of the High Level Forum
held in Rome in February 2003. Subsequently, the DAG and the government agreed on a new
partnership architecture inApril 2003. The architecture includes a harmonization task force and
a secretariat in the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Development to support the coordination


                                                19

and harmonization process. It also defines the roles, functions and rules of engagement o f the
various joint govemment donor groups within the architecture.

52.    Ethiopia i s also one of the countries being supported by the Strategic Partnership with
Africa (SPA) working group on budget support. The approach agreed in the context o f the SPA
and Harmonizationinitiatives was two-fold. First, where donors provide support through sector
programs and projects, donors will harmonize procurement, financial management, disbursement
and environmental appraisal and implementation procedures and assessments. Second, where
donors provide multi-sectoral program or budget support, donors would agree on a core set o f
common indicators inthe multi-sectoral program or budget support matrix in order to reduce the
transaction cost to the Government. This would not mean that each donor would necessarily
utilize the same indicators but that the total list o f indicators to be monitored would be kept to a
manageablenumber.

53.    Within the context of the overallharmonizationagenda, a substantialeffort at multi-
sectoral program and budget support co-ordination has been initiated. First, a budget
support group - which previously existed informally -           i s now integrated within the overall
partnership architecture and liaises closely with sector working groups whenever the budget
discussion relates to policy content for those particular sectors. Second, multi-sectoral program
and budget support operations are prepared by all interested donors through a common process
undertaken in the context of the Bank PRSC preparation process. Donor representation in this
process includes the Afncan Development Bank, Canada, DFID, European Union, Finland,
Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and Sweden. The potential multi-sectoral program and budget
support for the coming Ethiopian fiscal year would be in the range o f $250-275 million (i.e. the
coordinated process will result inaddition to the PRSC ingrants or concessional loans for another
$100-125 million).

54.    Coordinationwith the IMF. Since 2001 the Government has been implementing a three-
year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) Arrangement with the IMF. Emphasis in
terms of structural reforms under the PRGF has been placed on financial sector reform (in
particular restructuring the Commercial Bank o f Ethiopia (CBE)), and improvements in fiscal
consolidation and reporting. Overall performance has remained on-track, although the fourth

plan for CBE - which was a performance criterion under the program.
review underthe thirdannual arrangement was delayed pendingthe preparationof a restructuring
                                                                                   This performance
criterion, and structural benchmarks for improvedpublic expenditure management have now been
met. The fifthreview of the PRGF is expected to be presentedto the Board for completion at the
end of February 2004. The Fund Relations Note, which provides further details, is included as
Annex 7.

                   111.     THE PROPOSEDPRSCIREFORMPROGRAM

A.      Overview and Objectivesof the PRSC Series

55.     The World Bank has aligned its response to the SDPRP as contained in the CAS
which is based on a mix of lending and non-lending instruments. The performance-based
IDA allocation is US$1.5 billionover FY03-05 for the base case .I        O  Lendinginstrumentsconsist
of: PRSCs for FY04 and FY05 which are expectedto support policy reforms and the financing of
essential investments and services (20%); capacity buildingprojects for public and private sectors
and civil society (22%) andthe balance ininvestment projects -primarily ininfrastructure (56%).
Non-lending instruments include a strong program of Economic and Sector Work (ESW) which
focus on issues of overall development policy, sector dialogue and public expenditure
management.

56.    The PRSCs constitute a series of one tranche operations over three-years to align the
policy agenda supported by the World Bank with national policy priorities in SDPRPFRSP. The
financing needs and levels will be based on the medium-termfinancing plan contained in the
Government's Macro-Economic andFiscal Framework (MEFF).

57.     Sectors and themes of "emphasis" and in "maintenance mode".                l1 While recognizing
the importance o f each o f the main themes inthe SDPRF'PRSP, the PRSC series will commence
with some areas of major emphasis inthe policy dialogue and, as those areas transfer to a more
stable policy dialogue, will intensify dialogue in other areas. Within this general framework,
there were four key considerations inEthiopia.

     0   given that this is the first cycle of PRSC multi-sectoral program support and donors'
         budget support, a considerable focus on the PRSP implementation processes was
         required;

     0   the decentralization to the woreda level provided opportunities for improving service
         delivery and governance but also presentedrisks as noted inthe JSA. These risks related
         primarily to stabilizing resource flows to districts and commencing restructuring to
         ensure that staffing structures do not disproportionately consume the incremental fiscal
         resources reaching districts. Further,the focus on the cross-cutting systems of planning
         and managing public service delivery will have an important benefit for sector service
         delivery (particularly inhealth, education, rural roads and water supply);




lo  The full CAS allocation will be committed and disbursed to Ethiopia in its entirety only if this is
permissible in the context o f Ethiopia's debt sustainability situation. Since the HIPC Decision Point in
December 2001, Ethiopia's debt situation has deteriorated markedly due to exogenous shocks. Hence, the
CAS proposed that until Ethiopia reaches HIPC Completion Point and Ethiopia's debt sustainability i s
reassessed, IDA would only extend grants to Ethiopia, which as a debt-vulnerable low income country is
eligible to receive up to a maximum o f 40 percent of its IDA allocation as grants.           Consequently,
satisfactory progress towards the achievement o f the HIPC floating completion point triggers i s an
important consideration in order for Ethiopia to be able to potentially benefit from the entirety of its IDA
allocation.

     0   the need to underpin Ethiopia's growth agenda with credible plans for private sector
         development, financial sector and rural sector were noted by the JSA as key issues to be
         focused on inthe first year's implementation;

     0   the Bank will continue, during the period of PRSC-I, to support existing sector
         development programs inhealth and education through existingBank projects.12 Hence,
         the policy dialogue on health and education sectors would only shift to the PRSC
         instrument as the existingprojects close - duringthe period of the preparation of PRSC-
         11.

58.    Three areas of intensive engagement underpin PRSC-I. First, the cross-cutting issues
o f public sector reform and decentralization (including measures to improve financial
management in line with the recommendations of the CFAA and measures to improve
procurement in line with the recommendations of the CPAR) are a primary area o f focus.
Second, the strengthening of PRSP implementationprocesses - inparticular the timeliness of the
planning and budgeting processes providing greater predictability of resource flows to local
governments which deliver primary services - will be supported by the operation. Third, the
investment climate in urban and rural areas (i.e. private sector development, financial sector and
rural development) i s an area o f focus that will commence in PRSC-I and continuing more
intensively duringPRSC-11.

59.    PRSC-11 would intensify the engagement on the investment climate in urban and
rural areas (i.e. private sector development, financial sector and rural development) with an
increasingemphasis on improving the rural investment climate. It would also continue the focus
on cross cutting issues of public sector reform and decentralization (with an increased emphasis
on inter-governmental fiscal reform).      Finally, it would maintain the emphasis on PRSP
implementation with a much stronger dialogue on the budget, and support the Government in
implementing the SDPRP monitoring and evaluation action plan. The additional focus would be
on primary service deliveryinhealth and education.

60.   The areasof intensiveengagementfor PRSC-I11are indicativeat this stage and would
need to be reconfirmed and specified more concretely during the appraisal of PRSC-11. The
current expectation i s that PRSC-I11would add a focus on rural/decentralized infrastructure, local
economic development and local government planning.

B.    Analytical Underpinningsfor the First PRSC Series

61.   As reflected in Figure 2, an extensive set of analytical and advisory activities will
informand shape the first PRSC series. For PRSC-I1and PRSC-111, analytical underpinnings
are expected to include, among others, work currently in progress on a Country Economic
Memorandum on sources of growth; a water strategy focusing on how to use this vital natural
resource better, especially for irrigation and energy, and how to help reverse environmental
degradation; a Poverty Assessment to clarify the evolution o f poverty, and the occurrence o f
poverty traps; a Rural Development Strategy; an Institutional Governance Review (IGR) to
identify institutional weaknesses that are contributing to government performance problems,
contribute to the improved design of projects, and to provide a rigorous basis for prioritizing
reforms; and Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) on the impact of the introduction o f the
VAT on the poor, the impact of the decline incoffee prices onpoverty, andthe impact ofreform

infertilizer marketing. For PRSC-I, the following key activities have been or will be completed
prior to Boardpresentation.


During FYOl and FY02 - just after the conflict with Eritrea ended - IDA provided two single
62.    Implementation Completion Reports for Recent Adjustment Lending in Ethiopia.

tranche adjustment credits (the Ethiopia Emergency Recovery Credit and the Ethiopia Structural
Adjustment Credit) totaling $270 million.          These credits helped to stabilize the post-war
economy, reallocate public spending to poverty targeted sectors, and kick-start public sector
management and private sector development reform agendas. Draft Implementation Completion
Reports (ICRs) have been prepared and will be finalized prior to PRSC IBoard presentation and
some key lessons have been identified.           First, technical assistance should accompany the
adjustment program in Ethiopia to ensure institutions have the capacity to implement new
policies and legal frameworks. Second, an appropriate balance needs to be struck especially in
the move towards a PRSC between rewardingthe implementationo f good policies and meeting
                              -                                                      -

urgent budgetary financing needs. Third, private sector development will take time inEthiopia
and should be viewed as a process of a more open dialogue between Govemment and the private
sector around a medium-termreformagenda. The Bank should support this with analytical work,
continued in-depthdialogue and strong monitoring and supervision of reforms. Finally, more
attention i s needed to developing the public expenditure management agenda to allow a
transparent dialogue around improved and more timelybudgeting.

63.    Investment Climate Assessment. The Bank in partnership with a local research
institution (the Ethiopian Development Research Institute) undertook a firm survey o f some 450
firms across Ethiopia.       Based on this work, an Investment Climate Assessment i s almost
completed (projected for publication in early 2004). The draft study has confirmed some o f the
bindingconstraints based on private sector perceptions and the firm data. These include: tax
policy and administration; access to infrastructure (particularly telecommunications and power);
access to leased land; access to finance; bureaucratic red tape; and competition policy (which i s
expressed as lack of demand giventhe market size).

64.    Diagnostic Trade Integration Study. This assessment focuses on the institutional
impediments to trade. These range from the trade and incentive regime (particularly effective
rates o fprotection and real effective exchange rates), generic market access issues (tariffand non-
tariff barriers, special rules o f access and accessionto the WTO), foreign direct investment, legal
and regulatory framework for trade and investment, trade facilitation, institutions and institutional
support for trade.     Some key sectors are further specifically analyzed including agriculture
(cereals, coffee, horticulture and sugar), livestock and meat, manufacturing and tourism.

65.    Risk and VulnerabilityAssessment. This study examines the risks faced by individuals,
households, communities and the public inEthiopia and how they are managed. Startingwith the
hypothesis that risks are important determinants of poverty, it develops an understanding o f risk
management strategies that can be used to assess the prospects and strategies for poverty
reduction and sustainable development inthe future. The review finds that the developments in
the 1990s have provided a promising platform to reduce poverty and vulnerability in Ethiopia.
These positive developments on welfare notwithstanding, many Ethiopians remain poor, and
highlyvulnerable.

66.    Country Status Report for Education. This report, nearly completed, is expected to
articulate a broadly-shared vision for educational development inthe coming years and strengthen
the analytical underpinnings of multi-sectoral program and budget support. Using commonly
available administrative data supplemented with currently-accessible survey data, the report i s


                                                   23

reviewing: (a) the macroeconomic context for educational development; (b) growth in
enrollments and student flow patterns, including primary school completion rates; (c) education
finance; (d) service delivery arrangements and performance across sub-sectors; and (e) social
disparities ineducation. The work has included active participationby members of a Ministryof
Education counterpart team.

67.   Country Status Report for Health.            This report will consolidate existing sector
knowledge in order to lay the groundwork for policy and strategic discussions. It seeks to
identify key HNP issues for the poor inEthiopia, assessing how healthinterventions and services
in the past have reached the poor; and proposingkey policy and strategy issues to be resolved.
The report will address the following topics: (a) trends and equity in outcomes; (b) household
caring practices; (c) health seelung behavior; (d) out of pocket expenditures; (e) health sector
performance: efficiency and equity; (e) macroeconomic and socio-economic context; (e) public

achievements o f poverty related health outcomes; and (0 policy implications for sector
financing o f health including costing and budgeting o f health strategies to accelerate

development. Preliminary results, especially regarding low effective health coverage provided
from facility-based services, has playeda key role inthe recent policy dialogue. The full report i s
expected to be completed inFebruarylMarchof 2004.

68.   Public Expenditure Review. The 2002/03 Ethiopia Public Expenditure Review (PER)
focused on the long-run spending requirements of the social sectors. The PER concludes that
without reductions in the unit costs of basic service delivery, and a dramatic increase in donor
assistance, Ethiopia will have difficulty meeting a number of the MDGs. Given the basically
sound policy priorities and performance o f the government, the report advocates a substantial
increase in extemal aid to support expanded social sector spending. The PER notes that the
implications are not just for aggregate levels of donor support, but for the type of support
provided, as the expansion of social services requires primarily recurrent finance on a large scale,
and over a prolonged period. While the PER advocates a continuedrole for sectoral interventions
under definedconditions, multi-sectoralprogramandbudget support will be important inthe shift
towards recurrent financing, with increased predictability and enhanced efficiency through the
harmonization o f donors' procedures.

69.   Technical Assistance. Technical assistance missions have been fielded in several areas
(telecommunications, privatization, urban land reform, food security and safety nets).         The
technical assistance missions have been used for two purposes. First, these missions have
provided the primary vehicle for re-engaging with the Government on areas where the overall
policy dialogue had reached a standstill (e.g. in the financial sector or telecommunications
reform). These missions have allowed the areas of re-engagement to be identified without any
expectations regarding follow-on activities. Second, these missions have been utilized where the
Government i s in the process of preparing a program or action plan and the assistanceneeded is
immediate and the objective i s to provide quick input and feedback to refine the Government's
documents rather than prepare a separate Bank ESW (e.g. for food security, privatization, urban
landreformand safety nets).

. C. Objectives ofPRSCI

 70.    The objective of PRSC Iwill be to support the implementation of the SDPRP by:
  strengthening the focus on planning and budgetingprocessesincluding through the provision of a
 framework within which interested multi-sectoral program and budget support donors can
 participate; stabilizing the public sector during a period o f rapid state transformation in order to
 maintain pro-poor expenditures; and improving the investment climate (including for the rural
 sector).   The sections below discuss the recent performance, key constraints, Government
 program and Bank support for the main areas of PRSC I(public sector management and
 governance; rural development and vulnerability; private and financial sector development; and
 humandevelopment).

 D. Public Sector Reformand Governance

 D.1 RecentPerformance

 71.    There are three inter-related aspects of public sector reform which have affected recent
 performance in Ethiopia: the assignment o f public service delivery responsibilities, staffing and
 financing; recent developments in expenditure management systems and structures (i.e. planning
 andbudgeting, financial management and fiscal reporting systems); and the Government' s unique
 approach to capacity building.


 established a federal system of ethnically based regional states (with zones, woredas - or districts
 72.    Service delivery responsibilities, staffing and funding.          Starting in 1995, Ethiopia

 - and kebeles as lower local governments) with responsibility for a broad range of the country's
 political, economic, and social objectives. There was a significant redeployment which resulted
 in an establishment of 300,000 civil servants at regional level and below accountable to newly
 formed regional executives as compared to 40,000 left in federal institutions. Further, the
 Government developed an intergovernmentalfiscal system that met both its service delivery
 and local empowerment objectives and pursued a policy of "balanced regional progress"
 through the use of formula-driven block (or sectorally un-earmarked) transfers. This regional
 "subsidy" largely operates as an entitlement and has enabled regions to meet their recurrent
 expenditures effectively. The formula has gone through various revisions over the years but has
 typically included a heavily weightedper capita variable, as well as variables for "development
 gap" and revenue performance.

 73.    In 2001, following a series of political reforms, the Government launched an ambitious
 second phase of political, fiscal, and administrative decentralization in four of its most populous
 regions (Amhara, Oromia, SNNP, and Tigray).          This phase sought to bring decision-making
 closer to the people at the woredas or "grass roots level" and improve the responsiveness of
 assigned delivery responsibilities (for example, health and education).         Several key actions
 occurred. First, the four regions undertook far-reaching constitutional and legalreforms designed
 to clarify the separation of powers (between executive, legislative, and judicial branches o f
 government), to transfer authority to the woreda sphere, and to empower municipalities.
 Enabling legislation was passed to define the delivery responsibilities of different levels of
 government as well as the fiscal sources (for example, transfers or own revenues) available to
 meet recurrent and investment needs. Second, since September 2001, the Government has moved
 quickly to implement the Civil Service Reform Program across regions and levels of
 government. Noteworthy initial steps include the establishment o f focal points responsible for
 implementation of reforms in federal, regional, and local institutions, and a series o f workshops


                                                 25

undertaken to sensitize the political leadership and civil servants across the country about the
objectives, design, and expected results of the CSRP. Third, regions commenced the process o f
streamliningzones   - intermediate  administrative layers betweenthe region andthe woredas - and
regional and zonal staff have been redeployed into administrative pools accountable to local
executives. Municipalities also commenced more clearly delineation of their state and own-
source functions, developed appropriate management structures and, in some cases, downsized
staff levels. Fourth, given that wage levels of regional officials generally followed those of
federal civil servants, some regions (such as Tigray) institutedspecial allowances to encourage
staff redeployment to remote woredas. Efforts were also initiatedto release municipal staff from
civil service pay and employmentrules, and encourage a more market-oriented, competitive wage
system to evolve. Fifth, regions established regional-to-woreda"block" grants. These have a
formula-driven equity focus similar to that of the federal-to-regional subsidy, result in fifty to
eighty percent o f the regional subsidy being transferred to woredas and provide funding for
recurrent costs given limitedrevenue raising authority o f woredas. All four regions managed the
service delivery risks o f transferring significant shares o f regional budgets to woredas in a "risk
aware" manner through a variety of measures including:providing budget guidelines to influence
functional and economic split of expenditures; usinga contingency fund to "smooth" allocations
to woredas that were unable to meet existing commitments and usingother existingtransfers (e.g.
rural hardship allowances, sector capital grants and food security transfers) as complementary
instruments. Sixth, the four regions also commenced a program o f legal, restructuring, and
capacity buildingefforts for municipalities. Finally, the federal-regional intergovernmentalfiscal
transfer system has been expanded to introduce two federal specific purpose programs for food
security and capacity building  - which                                                   -
                                        are performance-based instruments.

74.    Expenditure Management Systems SupportingService Delivery. For the larger part of
the decade, institutional mandates for expenditure management systems were split; planning and
capital budgeting processes were managed by the Ministry o f Development and External
Cooperation and the regional planning bureaus and recurrent budgeting processes and financial
management processes were managed by the Ministry o f Finance and the regional finance
bureaus. Despite this, the consolidated budget in Ethiopia was managed carefully within macro
ceilings. Inlate 2001, the two ministries were merged into the Ministry o f Finance and Economic
Development (MOFED) and simultaneously regional planning and finance bureaus were
integrated as an important first step towards an integrated budget framework. Third, in2001, the
MinistryofFinance issuedfinancial regulations requiringsystematic planning and budgetingof
expenditures according to an integrated, medium-term framework                and spelling out the
responsibilities of different bodies as well as the annual timing o f each stage o f the exercise.
Fourth, as part of this calendar, the Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework (MEFF) sets out: the
main sources and uses o f funds at the federal level; Indicative Planning Figures (IPFs) - or
ceilings - for the capital expenditures of federal bodies consolidated into a three-year rolling
Public Investment Program (PIP); and - as a single line item the federal transfer to regions and
                                                                 -
the aggregate forecast for regions' own revenues. This MEFF and its associated budgetary
ceilings are approved by the Council o f Ministers.

75.    Government's Unique Approach to Capacity Building. In response to mynad public
management constraints noted above, the Government unveiled the National Capacity Building
Program in 2001. The program seeks to strengthen workmg systems, improve organizational
effectiveness and rapid develop human resources in the public, private, civil society, and higher
education sectors. A super-ministry, the Ministry of Capacity Building, was established to
provide policy direction, coordination, implementation support, as well as monitoring and
oversight o f capacity building subprograms. Counterpart Capacity BuildingBureaus were also
created inregions in order to support holistic capacity building efforts at the sub-national levels.


                                                  26

The program consists of six subprograms (Civil Service Reform, District-Level Decentralization,
Tax Systems Reform, Justice Systems Reform, and the ICT). The Civil Service Refom Program
includes the Expenditure Management Control Program (EMCP) which in turn includes several
important areas such as planning and budgeting, accounting reform, internal and external
auditing, treasury management, procurement, information systems).            The Government has
approached the implementation o f the NCBP by putting together a Public Service Delivery
Capacity Building Program (PSCAP); this program has two important innovations. First, it
mainstreams capacity building as a Government program rather than as a series o f discrete
projects.    Second, it introduces the concept of a capacity building grant within the inter-
governmental fiscal transfer system and linksthe planning for regional capacity buildingwith the
resources available for this purpose.

76.   Institutional Performance. While the allocative and operational efficiency in priority
sectors are important indicators of public sector performance, three sets of intermediate indicators
reflect the overall effectiveness of public management systems. These are the adequacy and
predictability o f fiscal flows; the expenditure and tax autonomy o f sub-national jurisdictions; and
the incentive environmentfor publicservants.

77.   Adequacy of fiscal flows. Overall, there has been an increase in recurrent and capital
financing to local government in absolute terms. Assessing the adequacy of fiscal sources (ie.,
transfers and own revenues) for regions and local governments wouldrequire an estimation of the
fiscal gap between costed functional assignments and optimized revenues. While such an
assessment i s not available

    0    The average annual growth of budgeted transfers through the regional subsidy was 22%
         p.a. between EFY92 and EFY95.

    0    In addition to the regional subsidy, actual value of cash and asset transfers to regions
         have also increased through federal programs such as capacity buildingand food security.
    0   recurrent spending by regional governments has increased (at an average o f about 9%
        p.a.) since the start o f fiscal federalism. InFY2002/03, recurrent spending was projected
         to increaseby 40%.

There are continuing risks to the adequacy of fiscal sources for service delivery at the local level
including the establishment of unaffordable structures for local governments, inadequate division
of revenue assignedto regions, and sub-optional assignment o f revenue authority to regional and
local governments.

78.   Predictability of resource flows has been measured in terms of budget variance and
execution rates in-year, and medium-termprojections across years.

    0   In-year predictability. Actual resourcestransferred to regions has typically fallen short o f
        budget amounts by approximately 20% over the pastthree years.


    0   Execution at the regional level suggests that certain sources o f financing and certain
        approaches to program design can promote predictability. For instance, transfers funded
        through domestic sources (or treasury funds) disburse at approximately 91% within the
        planned time period. Grant-financed capital expenditures suffered fkom low execution
        rates but have improved slightly in recent years. Disbursement rates for loans are fared
        well.



                                                   27

     0   Resource predictability across fiscal years depends largely on Ethiopia's ability to
         develop a medium-termexpenditure framework including multi-year appropriations of
         the federal-to-regional transfers. Such efforts are still works-in-progress,

79.    Fiscalautonomy was measured as the sum of own revenuesand unconditionaltransfers as
a percentage of total expendituresfor aparticular tier o f sub-national government.


     0   The majority of regional expenditures (about 75%) are financed largely through
         unconditional transfer payments from the federal government, with the balance being
         funded through own-revenue.


     0   Nearly a third o f public expenditure i s the responsibility o f the Regions, including the
         majority of social sector spending (75% of health and education for delivery of all
         services upto secondary level); and a large share of agriculture, roads, andwater supply.


     0   Significant improvements in fiscal autonomy at the local level were effected inthe four
         reforming regions through the introductionof a revenue share from regions to woredas in
         FY2001-2002. In the current EFY, the woreda block grant constituted 45% of total
         regional expenditures in Tigray, 51% in Amhara, 47% in Oromia, and 81% in SNNP
         regions.

80.    Incentives were measured in terms o f internal wage relativities (for example,
decompression ratios) as well as the fair comparison of wages with private sector counterparts.
Comprehensive data on wage levels i s still being developed, however, preliminary survey
evidence suggests that private sector wages are on average about 125% higher than comparators
inthe civil service. The differentials are higher for technical staff. At the same time, findings
suggest that the pay of civil servants at the lowest grades is not sufficient to meet even a quarter
of the requirements for household subsistence.          The wage bill is also a measure of the
affordability of maintaining the staff complement at given wage levels. Overall, the wage bill as
a percentage of total regional and federal expenditures has remained steady, at approximately
65% and 35% respectively.         These may increase if new woreda structures are established
although preliminary evidence suggests that wage expenditures have remained constant since the
new woreda structures have largely been filled through staffredeployment.

D.2 Key constraints

81.    Ethiopia stands out among African countries both in terms o f its track record on public
sector reform as well as its continued commitment to a major overhaul o f state institutions.
Notwithstanding the progress made over the past decade, the institutional, organizational, and
slulls-related constraints that hinder Ethiopia's intergovernmental system from achieving its
service delivery and empowerment objectives are extensive, although not insurmountable. The
five critical sets o f public management constraints that currently impede SDPRP implementation
relate to: expenditure, financial and personnel management systems, legal framework for woredas
and municipalities, intergovernmental fiscal framework, administrative and organizational
structures at the federal, regional, andlocal levels, and accountability.

82.    Modernizationof expenditureandfinancialmanagement systems at all levelsremains
a priority.     The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) exercises were carried out during the period



                                                 28

 2002/2003. Given that the areas covered by the two reports and the resultingrecommendations
 deal with the Government's Expenditure Management Control Program (EMCP), the analysis of
 key constraints and the Government's program draw substantially upon both documents. Some
 key areas for improvement are noted below. First, coordination o f effort between various
 departments within MOFED remains an important concern. Similarly, coordination between
 MoFED and the MCB on various planning initiatives currently underway needs to be enhanced.
 Second, the planning and budgetingprocessrequires improvements as there has been insufficient
 compliance with the financial calendar; limited political ownership of the MEFF and its
 indicative planning figures as a basis for integrated, medium term planning; and efforts to
 transform the PIP into a Public Expenditure Program (PEP). Third, the quality and timeliness of
 fiscal reporting has slowed markedly with decentralization and federal accounts and audit
 backlogs have remained.

 83.    Personnel management systems also need to be reformed in line with the current
 needs of the civil service. Civil servants at all levels     - despite an across-the-board salary
 increase in 2001 - continue to receive low salaries and problems o f poor incentives remain as an
 affordable, medium-term public sector pay policy has not yet been developed. Personnel rules for
 woredas includingprocedures for hiring, firing, transfer, and promotion remain unclear and need
 to be codified as is also necessary for municipalities, which sit outside the core civil service
 system. Anecdotal evidence indicates increasing incidence o f workers with specialized slulls
 migrating to the private and NGO sectors, or abroad and may undermine the sustainability of
 capacity buildinginvestments inurbanmanagementand ICT.

 84.     Legal framework for woredas and municipalities still requires clarification. Given
 that the functional andrevenue assignmentswere delineated and codified ina very short period of
 time to meet the overriding political objective of woreda block grant implementation, there i s
 significant scope for refiningand detailing woreda legislation inreforming regions to ensure clear
 definitions of roles and responsibilities for specific delivery responsibilities o f state functions
 such as primary education and healthcare. It i s not yet clear whether sub-regional transfers such
 as the woreda block grant would also be made available to urban centers (or their woredas) to
 finance their state functions (for example, primary healthcare or education). Nor i s it evident that
regions have adequately provided-through        the appropriate assignment of own fiscal sources-
 for the growth of municipal functions inworedas, particularly those inrural hinterlands of urban
areas.

 85.    Inter-governmental fiscal framework. Inthe federal-regional subsidy, the application of
the subsidy formula has been carriedout ina transparent manner andthe main issue relates to the
vertical division o f revenue which i s undertaken year-to-year on an ad hoc basis. Inthe region-
woreda subsidy, despite progress made with the introduction o f the woreda block grant, there are
several critical risk factors. First, preliminary evidence from reforming regions suggests that
costs o f woreda decentralization - includingpermanent increasesinrecurrent requirements of new
woreda structures    - were significantly underestimated, and have contributed to unprecedented,
fiscal shocks in certain regions such as Oromia. Second, the block grant may have become
overloaded with a range o f sectoral and regional objectives, even though it offers little scope for
the conditional pursuit o f regional priorities. Third, the grant formula has a heavy (although
justifiable) bias towards equity that may result in rewarding under-performance over the longer
run. Fourth, the existing capital hnding mechanisms available for basic services and
infrastructure, particularly the sector specific mechanisms funded by a variety o f donors, require

immediate review in light of the basic thrust of Ethiopia's fiscal decentralization objectives.

"grow" their municipal functions over time. Revenues raisedby woredas (for example, land use


                                                  29

and fertilizer fees, community contributions) are off-set in the existing grant system. Initial
survey data also suggests that revenueswithin woredas are sub-optimal becausethey are collected
in an uncoordinated and arbitrary manner.         Sixth, municipalities are not eligible to receive
regional transfers such as the woreda block grant. There i s growing acknowledgement across
regions that municipalities require a more predictable, transparent, and equitable system-
consistent with fiscal arrangements for woredas-to         finance state and municipal functions.
Further, municipal level autonomy in setting tariff and tax rates i s limited and information and
institutional constraints such as incomplete cadastral surveys and weak administrative capacities
limit the ability municipalitiesto fully exploit existingtax autonomy.

86.     Administrative and Organizational Structures. As an integral part o f the current wave
o f decentralization in FY2002-2003, Ethiopia's reforming regions began establishing basic
administrative or institutional structures for woreda and municipal governments based on general
prescriptions by the Ministries of Capacity Building, and Federal Affairs. At the same time,
functional reassignments by reforming regions implied a set of requirements in terms of
administrativerestructuringo fregional bureaus, and the transfer o f core competencies to the local
level. There are already indicationsthat functional reassignments inpriority sectors (for example,
health and education) and prescribed structures for woredas and municipalities are inall cases not
consistent or sustainable. Furthermore, decentralization efforts involvedthe establishment of new
woreda structures. The first year's experience suggests that institutional structures in woredas
were unrealistic both interms o f their financial costs as well the availability o f qualified staff to
fillvacancies. A comprehensive review of woreda structures will benecessarywithin the next
year to ensure that the functional as well fiscal concerns are addressed. Equally important i s the
need to support restructuring of regional sector bureaus in line with the newly assigned delivery
responsibilities of the woreda sphere.      Reforming regions embarked on an initial phase of
restructuring for regional bureaus and woredas with similar efforts inthe municipal governments
o f urban centers. The experience of other developed and developingcountries suggests that these
types o f critical restructuring and strategic staffing efforts tend to lag intergovernmental fiscal
reforms (for example, the introduction of block or other types of grants).            Moreover, the
introduction o fperformance or results-orientation with restructured sub-national institutions i s not
automatic and therefore will requiremore deliberate efforts.

87.     Vertical and horizontal accountability. From the perspective of the SDPRP's service
delivery objectives, woreda block grants (like federal-regional subsidies) provide for only weak-
to-moderate inputcriteria (for example, indicative guidelines for recurrent and capital allocations)
and no explicit output criteria (for example, sectoral output indicators). A challenge for sector
management within regions (for example, bureaus, zones, woredas, and municipalities) i s to
preserve and improve vertical monitoring and also development mechanisms for minimum
service delivery standards in priority sectors. An overriding priority of the SDPRP i s to ensure
that local communities     -particularly the poor   - take full advantage o f the opportunities that
decentralization provides inter alia by participating in, negotiating with, influencing, controlling,
and holding to account the institutions of woreda and municipal government. Inmeetingthese
challenges, several recent studies suggest that the residents o f woredas and municipalities have to
contend with a variety of formal and informal constraints such as basic nutritional deficiencies,
exclusionary customs and practices, unequal gender relations, and lack of education. Historical
patterns o f governance within kebeles can also affect the ability of citizens to build coalitions,
federate community organizations, and ultimately, give expressions to new preferences and
priorities, particularly of the poor. The democratic character of decentralization will likely
depend on sub-woreda, sub-municipal, and kebele level efforts to undertake collective actions
that demonstrably enhancethe asset base and capabilities o f Ethiopia's ruraland urbanpoor.

D.3 Government'sprogram

88.    The Government's public sector reform program under the SDPRP continues with many of
the reforms described earlier which commenced under the pre-SDPRP period. The paragraphs
below describe progress from August 2002 to the end of December 2003 and the Govemment's
plans for the remainder o fthe SDPRP period.

89.    Planning and budgeting reform activities have two main goals: providing resource
predictability for service delivery by moving from an incremental budgeting to a system of
medium-term rolling plans based on three-year forward estimates, and improving planning
efficiency by transitioning from a traditional dual budget to one that integrates planning of capital
andrecurrent spending.

90.    Starting at the federal level, the Government program will reinforce the central role of the
financial calendar in a medium-term expenditure management framework. Beginningwith April
2004, the Government will utilize the already established series of bi-annual meetings between
the MinistryofFinance andEconomic Development (MoFED), the Ministry ofRevenue, and the
regional finance bureau officials to allow Regional administrations to participate in discussions
defining the vertical division of revenues between federal and regional levels and therefore the
resource pool available for transfers such as regional subsidy and specific purpose grants. The
Government also plans to implement a reformulated Public Expenditure Review process which
would include Government-Donor review of previous fiscal year's performance and Government-
Donor dialogue on the draft budget which would discuss sector allocations and allocations for
primary service delivery. Further, these discussions would consider all funds and accounts.          13

Finally, it has aligned the timing of the sector development reviews with the financial calendar.
Adherence to the financial calendar will remain a central element of the Govemment's program
so that increased predictability o f resource flows to the Government will translate into increased
predictability at the point of service delivery at the region level and below.

91.    Transition towards an integrated capital and recurrent budgeting process will require
coordination among the various planning initiatives currently underway at federal and regional
levels by MOFEDand MCB respectively. The Government plans to develop a Government-wide
position on integrating the newly developed strategic planning manual as a key component o f its
overall expenditure management cycle.              Specifically, it would develop an expenditure
management cycle that requires civil service institutions to develop medium-term strategic plans
within the resource envelopes generated through the MEFF, and annualize these medium-term
plans into budgets with yearly performance agreements. Additional technical assistancewould be
required to map out such an integrated process which thereafter be provided legal force as a
directive from MoFED.

92.   FinancialManagementSystemStrengthening.Currently, only one region's accounts are
current, while the federal government has a one backlog on the closing o f accounts. Inline with
the agreements reached in the CFAA action plan, the Government i s undertalung several related
measures which are expected by the end o f the program to result in the clearance o f the federal
accountsbacklog and in a substantial reduction inthe regional backlog. First, the Government i s
focusing on improving the quality of fiscal data by adopting a new chart of accounts across the


l3These include, in addition to the consolidated fund, Road Fund, Pension and Social Security Fund, Fuel
Price Stabilization Fund, Privatization Fund, Industrial Development Fund, Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Fund, and Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund. The total amount inthese
hndsexceeds 10%of total spending.


                                                   31

federal and regional levels, and replacingits single entry cash management system with a double
entry book-keeping modified cash accounting system. This new chart of accounts has already
been adopted by four regions and will be adopted by all regions by the end of the program. A
considerable program of technical assistance i s ongoing and additional assistancewill be required
to implementthe program. The Government also plans to amend its proclamation on financial
administration to set a time limit for the submission of draft government accounts to the Auditor
General. Second, the new accountingsystem, which was adopted for the FY03 budget, will be
accompanied by an upgrade o f the Budget, Disbursements and Accounts (BDA) system by all
federal level institutions and a majority of the regions. Third, the Government will strengthen its
internalaudit function by institutingsystems audit procedures and its external audit function
through capacity buildingand the development of various techniques related to risk management
and value for money audits. Fourth, given that municipalities have personnel and financial
regulations different from more traditional civil service institutions, significant progress has been
made in the development of prototypepersonnel management regulation for municipalities. Two
regions (Tigray and SNNP) have already adapted and adopted these regulations as a basis for
modernizing personnel management in their rapidly reforming municipalities.              Progress on
municipal financial managementregulations will be equally important.

93.    Information Systems Strengthening. Building on the recent establishment of an ICT
Development Authority, the Government will develop a Government Information Systems
Strategy (GISS) in order to ensure coordinationbetween the ICT sub-program and key business
users such as the CSRP Coordinating Office (for financial and human resource management), the
Federal Civil Service Commission, MOFED's budget, accounts, and IT departments, as well as
the Ministry of Federal Affairs support to municipalities. An important element of the GISS
would be a clear Applications Roadmap to clarify the business case for applications roll-out, as
well as financial, technical, procurement, and humanresource requirements. The Government is
commencingthe development and implementationof interimsystems (e.g. roll-out of the existing
BDA3 and Budget Information System packages at the federal and regional levels) and medium
term solutions (e.g. Integrated Financial Management Information System) in the financial
management arena.       Similarly, work i s being undertaken for personnel systems and land
management systems.


March 2003. Two committees have been established - a high level Steering Committee and a
94.    Progress inprocurementreforms has been in line with the CPAR Action Plan agreed in

Technical Committee.       The Steering Committee i s chaired by the Minister of Finance and
includes the three MOFED State Ministers; State Minister for Capacity Building; and
departmental heads from MOFEDand MoCB. The Technical Committee consists of the 7 heads
of department in the MOFED and could benefit from membership from ministries with high
volumes o f procurement (e.g. Infrastructure, Education and Health). Decisions have been taken
to decentralize procurement and to transform the Procurement Department in the MOFED into a
regulatory directorate within MoFED with responsibility for oversight o f the procurement
function in the Federal Government. A directive has been issued informing federal budgetary
institutions regarding the decentralization o f the procurement function in the near future. A
Procurement Proclamation will be enacted to allow for decentralization of the procurement
function to the regional level. The Government's objective in vesting regulatory powers to a
Directorate within MoFED was to minimize additional costs. However, international experience
indicates that regulatory bodies are most effective when operating as independent and
autonomous and reporting to the highest authority possible. The impact o f the Government's
proposed approach on the effectiveness o f the regulator will, hence, need to continue to be
monitoredclosely throughout the programperiod.



                                                  32

95.    To modernize personnel management, the Government has introduced a Results-Oriented
Performance Evaluation (ROPE) system that links individualperformance with outputs laidout in
institutional strategic plans at the federal level. Once refined, the ROPE would be rolled out
across tiers of government in step with the strategic planning exercises currently underway. The
Government's aim i s in part to provide a more coherent linkage between individual and
institutional performance. A key ingredient to achieving this goal i s to also address the widely
acknowledged problems o f inadequate remuneration. Building on both job classification and
salary surveys, federal and regional remuneration policies will be adopted and implementation
thereofwill commence.

96.    Legal framework for municipalities and woredas.                The Government has enacted
appropriate legislation that clearly assigns the expenditure responsibilities o f municipalities for
municipalities in four regions and Addis Ababa. Such legislation for municipalities would be
completed for most regions by the end o f the program. Further, by the end of the program, the
Government would also pass legislation inmost regions assigning expenditure responsibilitiesto
regions and woredas as well as assigning fiscal revenue sources (for examples, own revenues and
transfers) necessaryto carry out those responsibilities).

97.    Intergovernmental fiscal relations and transition. The Government has focused on the
development o f a robust intergovernmental fiscal framework consisting o f appropriate fiscal
instruments that can meet the recurrent, capacity building or performance, as well as the
investment needs o f the local government sphere. It has introduced the PSCAP as a federal
specific-purpose, performance-based program as a complement to the regional subsidy. It plans
to provide a similar line item in the federal. budget to finance the one-off transitional costs of
woreda decentralization. Further, Government plans to seek legislative approval for an update of
the federal-regional subsidy formula which would follow a "fiscal gap" methodology that seeks
to meet the difference between expenditure needs and revenue raising capacity. Finally, the
Government will issue a fiscal decentralization strategy that provides a consistent approach across
various types o f local governments (for example, by addressing issues such as the absence of
federal financing for state functions such as education or health when these are provided by
municipalities).

98.    Restructuring and performance improvement for municipalities, agencies, bureaus,
woredas, and municipalities. This is occurring through the Performance and Service Delivery
Improvement Program (PSP) within the CSRP. Indeveloping PSIP, ministries, authorities, and
regional bureaus (MABs) develop civil service action plans and realization of "quick wins,"
which are rigorously monitored by the CSRP Coordinating Office. Progress in preparing these
plans and realizing quick wins enables an MAB to move further along the performance
improvement chain through the development o f multi-year strategic plans, identification of output
targets, as well as the preparationand implementation o f a service improvement and restructuring
plans (for example, consideration of outsourcing, contracting out, joint management, provision of
autonomy and other options).         The restructuring and performance improvement have been
initiated for 16 of the 65 "reform towns" and Addis Ababa City Administration; and in 11
ministries, agencies and regional bureaus (including the Customs Authority in the Ministry of
Inland Revenues, the Ethiopian Investment Authority under the Ministry o f Trade and Industry,
and the Treasury Department in the Ministry o f Finance). The program will continue to expand
to a majority o f institutions at federal, regional and woreda levels.

99.    PSCAP Planning Process and Linkage to PRSC Commitments. As has been noted
earlier, rather than takmg a project-based approach to public sector improvements, the
Government has undertaken a nation-wide medium term planning exercise involving regions,


                                                    33

 local authorities, and federal institutions. Eachregions has prepared 5-year PSCAP Action Plans
that prioritize capacity building and transformation activities for the region (and its local
jurisdictions) across all the reform initiatives of Government such as CSRP, justice systems,

PSCAP resources against these planned activities - are expected to result in a region led process
decentralization, and ICT. This bottom-up action planning process - and the expected flow of

with strong quality assurance and oversight from the federal level.         A series of bi-weekly
meetings o f regional and federal authorities have allowed for intensive peer review of plans both
interms of formandcontent. The translation oftheActionPlansinto one-year CapacityBuilding
Agreements that require regions to commit to semi-annual capacity buildingoutputs as a basis for
receiving support for the Government's PSCAP Grant.            The aggregation o f these regional
capacity buildingoutputs representnational level commitments to transformation.

D.4 WorldBankSupport

 100. ExistingInvestment Projects, Pipeline Projects, and AAA. The Bank is supporting the
Government's PSCAP programthrough an FY02 lendingoperation i.e. the Capacity Buildingfor
Decentralized Service Delivery Project (CBDSD, US$28.2 million) which aims to enhance
decentralized service delivery performance by building public sector capacity building at the
federal, regional, and local levels by: (i) implementingcivil service reforms, (ii)
                                                                                  restructuring and
empowering local governments, and (iii)        strengthening of the Ministry o f Capacity Building
(MoCB). The CBDSD will be followed by a larger, longer term multi-donor capacity building
program, supported on a SWAP basis. This larger program, the Public Service Delivery Capacity
Building Project (PSCAP, US$lOO million expected, FY04), will seek to build capacity for
improved public service delivery by supporting the deepening of civil service reforms, deepening
district-level decentralization, improving urban management, and reinvigorating justice sector
institutions. In addition, the Bank i s also preparing for delivery in FY04 an Information and
Communications Technology Assisted Development to support the coordination andregulation of
ICT applications to improve education, foster civil society empowerment, and better govemment
at all levels. Fiduciary assessments - the CFAA and CPAR         -have been prepared as described
earlier. Finally, the Bank has also commenced the Institutional Govemance Review - a multi-
year multi-product ESW.

101.   The role of the PRSC series in supporting the public sector transformationprocess
will focus on four broad areas i.e. strengthening o f public financial and human resource
management systems across tiers of govemment, clarification o f the legal framework within
regions for woredas and municipalities, development o f a robust intergovernmental fiscal system
and restructuringand performance improvement. Under PRSC-I,the prior actions would consist
of: (a) MoFED issuance o f directive on financial calendar; and implementation o f two actions
(Cabinet approval o f Macro-Economic and Fiscal Framework for 2004/05-2006/07and MOFED
issuance o f indicative planning figures for Federal regional subsidy and Federal specific purpose
grants); (b) adoption o f new chart o f accounts by Regional Cabinets o f four regions; (c) issuance
of circular on devolution o f procurement responsibilities from MoFED to federal budgetary
institutions; and (d) enabling legislation to assign expenditure and revenue responsibilities to
municipalities enacted in 4 regions and Addis Ababa. Under PRSC-11, the prior actions would
consist of: (a) revising the financial calendar and issuing a directive on strategic planning
management, consistent with MEFF, PIP/PEP, and annual budgeting cycle; (b) reduction of the
audits backlog for the federal accounts to one year; (c) Procurement Proclamation passed by
Parliament; (d) Cabinet approval o f fiscal decentralization strategy for municipalities and
woredas.

E.1 RecentPerformance

102. Agriculture is the dominant driver of the rural economy and is important for the
performanceof the overalleconomy. The share of agriculture inoverall GDP has declined over
time (as would be expected), but it remains the
primary source of employment for about 80% of              Figure3: AgriculturalGDP (in millions

103. Agricultural GDP has expanded over the past decade, but has done so only weakly
and is subject to large periodic weather related shocks, resulting in large fluctuations in
agricultural output as shown inFigure 3. Between 1992/93-2002/03, the sector grew on average
by 1.5 per cent, ranging from 2 to 15 percent inyears o fpositive growth and declining as much as
12 per cent in a drought year such as 2002/03." The slow aggregate growth, however, masks the
regional variation in performance, with the highpotential and more food secure regions showing
a relatively better trend.

yielded positive but overall limited results. The
increase in overall production between 1992-93          e
and 2002-03 i s largely accounted for by area                0

l5The growth estimate for the period 1992-93to 2001-02, excludingthe 2002-03 drought, is 2.3% which is
still below the current annual populationgrowthrate of 2.4%.

per annum between 1992-93 and 2002-03, and was driven almost entirely by the increase in
maize yields (yieldsfor other major cereals were flat).

105. A number of factors have inhibited agricultural growth, including the impact of
environmentaldegradation.For example, recent analysis suggests the crop production foregone
as a result o f usinganimal manure and crop residues as fuel instead o f as organic fertilizer may be
as high as 271,000 tons of grain equivalent to about 3% of total grain production inEthiopia.
                                      -
Nevertheless, even the realized increases in productivity have not necessarily translated into
higher farm incomes as higherproductionhas at times resulted inprice collapses, particularly for
cereals, in the face o f poorly integrated markets and the lack of effective demand. Overcoming
these problems entails putting in place better infrastructure (e.g., roads, markets, irrigation,
communication) and development o f rural towns to serve as growth centers. For example,
empirical evidence from Ethiopia suggests a highrate of return to investment in rural roads by
reducing transport costs and providing better access to markets. A more vibrant agriculture and
better linkages with town centers and industry would also spur non-farm activities, which are
currently very limitedbut can be an important source ofm a l income growth and diversification.

106. To cope with the vulnerability which affects a very large proportion of the poorest
households, Ethiopia's current safety net, primarily financed through international
humanitarian assistance, is very large. The spending on transfers to the poor in the form of
food aid over the last five years has averaged about $265 million per annum.16 This represents
about 13 per cent of total public spending, amounting to $4 per capita or $40 per beneficiary for
the approximately 6 million chronically food insecure persons.             The year 2002/03 was a
particularly badyear with a severe drought due to insufficient rainfall inconcurrent rainy seasons.
The number of people receiving food aid increased to 12 million. Early warning and food
distribution systems were stretched to the limit, and humanitarian assistance for the drought
reached $800 million. Despite recent macroeconomic gains in the years before the drought,
almost 50% o f the rural populationremainedbelow the poverty line, and an additional 14%have
a highprobability o f falling into poverty with a single large shock (e.g. drought, death o f an adult,
etc.). As the effects o f the current drought will continue to be felt well into 2004, its full impact
on growth, numbers o fpeople inpoverty, and humandevelopment outcomes is not yet known.

107. It is widely acknowledgedthat the humanitarian effort each year has been successful
insavinglarge numbersoflivesand avoidingmajor humanitariandisasters. Nevertheless, it
i s a challenge to manage such a large safety net program. The current safety net can be and has
the potential to be made more productive than it i s at present. Evaluations indicate that the
program did not protect livelihoods, generate community assets, or protect human capital to the
extent that couldbe expected fiom the large amount o f resources allocated to the overall effort. In
brief, the safety net has not been development-driven and constitutes an important missed
opportunity.

E.2 Key Constraints

108. Ethiopia has a low-input, low value and subsistence oriented agriculture that is
frequently buffeted by droughts. The development and commercialization o f the rural
economy i s at the core o f the government's SDPRP (Ethiopia's PRSP). The reforms o f the early
1990s yielded benefits with agriculture performing markedly better than in the past. Yet
agricultural, and hence rural, growth remains low and volatile. The government's support for


16 The total transfers fluctuate from about $120 in "good" years to about $500 million in "bad" drought
years.


                                                   36

  agricultural growth inthe past decade was predicated on the assumption that the critical constraint
  lay on the supply side, and that a highly centralized roll out of improved technological packages
  (combining fertilizer, seed, and technical advice on how to use them) would break through this
  supply constraint and leadto sustainedgrowth.I7 This strategy allowed food productionto grow,
 but the failure to pay adequate attention to the demand side factors has constrained the overall
 performance.

   109. The uniform promotion of a single technologicalpackage across the country ignored
. agro-ecologicalfactors and socio-economic factors affectingfarmers' input decisions. Other
  factors affecting farmer incentives also received insufficient attention, such as tenure security
 which i s a key determinant in farmers' decision undertake productivity enhancing and
 conservation investments; access to appropriate technical advice (as extension agents were
 preoccupied with input supply and credit administration instead o f delivering advisory services);
 lack o f effective and efficient markets for inputs and outputs which have driven up marketing
 costs to a point where the farmer gets only a fifth of the retail price for agricultural products -
 reflecting high search and transaction costs, poor incentives for inter-temporal and inter-spatial
 arbitrage, and inefficient marketinginfrastructure; lack o f effective riskmanagement mechanisms
 resulting in risk averse behavior which exacerbates farm level and market intermediaries'
 investment decisions; insufficiently developed irrigation infrastructure;18and the lack of access to
 financial services.

  110. An important but often overlooked factor affecting agricultural growth
 perpetuating poverty is environmental degradation. Expansion o f production to marginal
                           -                                                                       -  and

 and environmentally fragile areas by a rapidly growing population; lack o f investment in
 measures to protect the degradation of the natural resource base - in part driven by the lack of
 incentives to undertake necessaryconservation measures because o f insecure tenure rights; over-
 exploitation and resultingloss of forest resources which i s exacerbated by droughts; and the lack
 of access to altemative energy sources resultingina diversion o f animal manure from fertilization
 to fuel use are contributing to a slowing of agricultural productivity and growth, and having
 significant ecological impact in several parts of the country. There are several areas of weakness
 in the policy and institutional framework for better stewardship of natural resources and the
 environment: there is a need for a better integration of environmental considerations inmacro and
 sector policies and strategies; need for better incentives and accountability o f public and private
 sectors for environmental performance and outcomes; implementation o f established policies and
 strategies down to the woreda level and availability and quality o f information and analysis for
 better decision making andpublic awarenessof critical environmentalissues.

 111. Addressing all of these factors alone, however, may not be the complete solution to
 Ethiopia's poverty problem. The above mentioned factors aimed at promoting growth are
 necessarybut may not sufficient to reduce chronic food insecurity. Recent studies conclude that
 even if Ethiopia's growth on average exceeds 5% per year in the future, poverty and household
 vulnerability will remain a serious c~ncem.'~      Further,riskstemming fiom the highprobability of

    For example, the water storage capacity inEthiopia at 40 cubic meters is very low compared to the 6000
 cubic meters inSouthAfrica).
 I 9Vulnerability inpresent-day Ethiopia i s high with almost 50% o f the population considered chronically
 poor, an additional 27% moves in and out of poverty, and almost 14% who are not poor now have a high
 probability of falling into poverty in the future with a single large shock (Risk and Vulnerability
 Assessment, World Bank 2003, draft).

drought i s also an important factor affecting household decisions.                 Measures of variability
(calculated over the 33 years between 1967-2000) across time and space show that, in any given
year actual rainfall can deviate from the long-term average for an area by up to 50% (Figure 5).
This suggests that even when the overall average rainfall may appear "normal", many areas may
experience significantly higher or lower than expected rainfall.

112. In drought years, households sometimes undertake actions that endanger their own
survival in the long run by: selling oxen, delaying treatment of a health problem, withdrawing
children from school, and so on. The problem created by drought i s therefore notjust limitedto
hunger and malnutrition but it has lasting adverse impacts on household assets and overall
development. To be effective, public response to such a pervasive threat o f famine should be on
a continuous basis rather than on a perpetual "emergency" footing and should deal with the root
cause o f famines rather thanjust deal with their effects.

E.3 GovernmentProgram

113. The Government's strategy is to create an environment conducive to the
transformation from the current subsistence orientation of agriculture to a more dynamic,
diversified and commercially oriented agriculture and a more vibrant rural non-farm
economy. In implementing this strategy, the outcomes the Government wishes to achieve are


*'The   hghly variable and unequal distribution o f rainfall implies that Ethiopia experiences pervasive
drought risk. Between 1978 and 1994 alone, there were 15 droughts (and famines), with large numbers of
households facing food and non-food consumption shortfalls each year.


                                                       38

 increased rural incomes and agricultural production, while increasing the resilience of rural
people to shocks andreducing the impact of the shocks. These outcomes are to be measuredby:
the growth in agricultural and crop GDP at constant factor cost; growth rate of off-farm rural
income; and reduction inpercentage of stunting and wasting inchildren under the age of 5.

 114. Over the long term the Government's strategy aims to commercialize agnculture through
improved linkages with fast growing small towns which will serve as marketing centers, regional
specialization, and diversification of income sources and product mix at the householdlevel. The
main elements of the strategy are to:

     Enhance the security o f land tenure for rural households to provide them with the appropriate
     incentives to undertake productivity enhancing investments and allow greater flexibility in
     user rights to land to help factor mobility.

     Increase rural productivity through modernization and expansion o f the research and
     extension system and by making it more demand-driven, while providing complementary
     investmentsinthe humancapital throughthe TVETprogram.

     Improve the functioning and efficiency of agricultural input and output markets through
     increased competition; enhanced spatial and inter-temporal integration through improved
     infrastructure and better market information systems; improved grades and standards;
     reforming and strengthening farmer cooperatives; and reviewing, with donors, the modalities
     of food aid with a view to minimizingits impact onmarket development.

     Provide an opportunity for people in high density food insecure areas to move to a more
     hospitable and productive environment through a new access-to-land program that i s strictly
     on a voluntary basis and with appropriate riskmitigationmeasures inplace.

     Improve the rural financial system by introducing alternative mechanisms to increase access
     to savings and credit services, and develop mechanisms for better riskmanagement including
     market (price) risks and periodic climatic risks using innovative instruments such as weather-
     basedinsurance.

     Improve natural resource management through increased investments in viable irrigation and
     water management systems, and improved environmental sustainability o f interventions.

     Undertake measures to improve the economy of pastoral areas through implementation of the
     Pastoral DevelopmentPolicy, Strategy and Action Plan.

It should be noted that the rural development strategy also benefits from and is coordinated with
other strategies to improve the investment climate (in particular private sector development
activities and infrastructure).

115. Enhancingland tenure security. There i s an increasing appreciation by the government
of the centrality o f perceptions o f tenure security in providing incentives to invest in upgrading
the productivity o f rural land and for promoting factor mobility. Improved land tenure security
and greater flexibility and transferability of user rightswill be measured by the number o f regions
with legal frameworks for land use inplace. Some progress has been achieved inthis area with
the passage of land policy legislation in four regions. The process of issuing certificates of user
rights to individual holders is also being implemented. The federal government i s inthe process



                                                  39

o f identifying the lessons and best practices emerging from the experience o f the different regions
to identify specific actions and indicators to further strengthen tenure security and to make user
rightsmore flexible and transferable. The enactment o f land legislation inthe remaining regions
will be completed duringthe programperiod and harmonized, as appropriate, based on emerging
best practices.

 116. An important component of the strategy, that transcends several of the elements
outlined above (productivity enhancement, marketing and rural financial system), is the
restructuring of fertilizer markets. Fertilizers are an essential part of the improved
technological package to raise agricultural productivity, but the current retail delivery system
creates several distortions: extension agents, preoccupied with fertilizer distribution and input
credit administration, are unable to concentrate on delivering technical advice; administered and
guaranteed credit does not ensure efficient use o f fertilizers and prevents alternative market based
credit mechanisms to develop;       both prevent the development o f a robust retail market for
fertilizers. At the same time, the import and distribution segments o f the fertilizer market can be
made more efficient. Fertilizer i s a strategic commodity with potentially great impact on farm
incomes and poverty. Inthe short run, the envisagedrestructuringat the retail level may lead to a
fall in fertilizer consumption as new systems develop. To minimize the negative impact on
fertilizer use, the changes will be phased in over the next three years and in the interim,
cooperatives and micro-finance institutions are expected to step in to ease the transition. The
Government plans to conduct a study to explore the options for reforming the market structure for
the import and distribution (including wholesale and retail) segments o f the fertilizer market and
adopt policy to reform fertilizer marketing system including import and distribution segments
based on recommendations o f study.

117. Reform of research and extension services. The Government has developed and has
started implementing a plan to enhance the effectiveness o f agricultural research and extension.
The reform o f the research system i s under way and capacity building for extension agents has
started with the launching o f an agricultural Technical and Vocational Education and Training
(TVET) program. To increase the effectiveness o f the knowledge delivery system, it is critical
that extension agents are able to focus on providing technical advisory services.                The
restructuring o f the lower levels o f the fertilizer marketing chain would greatly help relieve the
extension agents from the responsibility o f delivering fertilizer and credit and allow them to
focus primarily on providing advisory services. The progressive disengagement o f extension
staff from non-advisory services which i s to be completed by the end o f the third year i s thus an
important part o f the Government's program. The improved responsiveness o f research and
extension institutions will be measured by increased number o f technologies tested for adaptation
and popularization.     In the longer-run, the effectiveness o f the system will be measured by
evaluating its impact on farm level productivity.

118. Improving the agricultural marketing system. The focus on "marketization" o f
agricultural production remains a key element o f the government's medium-term strategy for
rural growth from two perspectives. First, there i s a focus on increased production for domestic
markets (as part o f the broader food security strategy) and o f higher-valued products for export
markets, which require complementary investments to improve marketing and associated
services. To develop the lower end o f the fertilizer marketing chain, the government plans to
provide technical assistance for strengthening and capacity building for cooperatives, micro-
finance institutions and private sector dealers to replace the current input and credit delivery
system. These actions are to be complemented by regional governments withdrawing from the
provision o f guarantees for input credit in a phased manner by the third year o f the program. At
the higher end o f the marketing chain, to improve the functioning o f the import and distribution


                                                   40

of fertilizers, the government plans to conduct a study to explore the options for reforming the
market structure for the import and distribution (including wholesale and retail) segments o f the
fertilizer market, including the fertilizer tender committee process and the possibility of
permitting foreign participation inthe importation and marketing of fertilizers. The Government
will develop and implement a transition strategy and adopt a policy to reformfertilizer marketing
system including import and distribution segments based on recommendations o f study.
Improved agricultural marketing systems will be measured by increased number of active
participants(including cooperatives and traders) infertilizer, grain, and livestockmarkets at retail
and wholesale level.

119. Second, with regard to domestic consumption, there is a greater focus on strengtheningthe
domestic distribution system and especially the capacity for smoothing prices across harvest
periods and between food surplus and deficit regions, which require investments in information
systems, storage facilities, access to credit, transport and mechanisms to manage market price
volatility. These are medium to long term activities to be supported through an investment
program by the government. In this regard, the establishment o f a warehouse receipts system
would promote greater trading of agricultural commodities.          The system would allow for
specialized intermediaries (warehousemen) to provide certification to the physical existence of
the product and allow trade to occur without the simultaneous physical transfer of the
commodities. The system can also help smooth inter-temporal price volatility through increased
storage by serving as collateral for short term financing needs. This would be particularly
beneficial for farmers operating in segmentedmarkets and for infusingmuch needed liquidity in
the marketing chain. Legislationfor the warehouse receipt system has recently been approved by
the Parliament. The systemwould next be piloted and tested, a regulatory agency for warehouse
receipts system created - initially through establishment of its Board      -and voluntary grading
standardsprepared.

120. Reducing vulnerability. It is clear from recent experience that existing household and
public strategies for managing risk are weak. Given already very low incomes and highexposure
to downside shocks, household strategies are generally highlyrisk-averse interms o f willingness
to adopt high-yieldingfarming technology or make essential productivity enhancing investments.
In September 2003, the Government and donor partners completed the draft New Coalition for
Food Security (NCFS) document and action plan which elaborates Ethiopia's vision o f a long-
term solution for chronic food insecurity and vulnerability inthe country. Some key institutional
andpolicy reforms presented inthis context have beenincorporatedinto the policy dialogue. The
NCFS defines programs to build productive assets at the household and community levels and
formulation and initial implementation o f small-scale water harvesting infrastructure.        The
success of the strategy will be based on measuring differentiated public response to predictable
vs. unpredictable food insecurity (as measured by the percentage of predictable food insecure
populatiodworedas implementing multi-annual asset protection and promotion schemes
including public works and conditional transfers); and improved public response to shocks (as
measuredbypercentage of Food Security Programfrom Government's own resources). The goal
now i s to scale up these food security programs and to achieve donor harmonizationinsupporting
the government's shift from apurely humanitarianto a more productive approach.

121. One central element of the food security program i s the public safety net program. The
Government i s expanding its      objectives for the use o f the large amounts o f humanitarian
assistance from immediate relief which focuses on the important objective o f providing a safety
net for immediately saving lives to incorporate the additional objective o f simultaneously
encouraging productive asset building and protection. The transition to a system with these
expanded objectives would be achieved through a sequence o f related actions and reforms. First,


                                                 41

 the Government would, starting with the DPPC's emergency appeal for 2004, reduce the number
 of people to be included inthe emergency appeal (1.5 millionby end of 2004 and a cumulative 3
 million people by end o f 2005).       Second, the Government would design and establish an
 altemative safety net system to meet the temporary consumption needs o f the chronically food
 insecure households excluded from the emergency appeal; this system would include,               for
 example, labor-intensive public works as well as conditionaltransfers to households to encourage
 continued investment by food insecure households in the health and education o f their children.
The Government plans to design the safety nets programs so as not to create a dependency
 syndrome among the group assisted. Third, the Government would establish a basic (floor) level
o f financing for "normal" years for this system but would scale up rapidly during years when
there is a rainfall shock or major drought.

 122. A second central element o f the program i s to reduce vulnerability i s to provide households
in chronically food insecure areas an opportunity to move to an alternative, more secure and
productive area. The access to new land program could encompass up to 6 million or so people
living in chronically vulnerable areas. The Government is dealing with six types o f risks under
the program: migrants not being voluntary; migrants not sufficiently understanding program
benefits andrisks; lands for resettlement havingprior claims; environmentalissues; definition and
provision o f public services (including roads, water, health and education infrastructure); and
provision o f sufficient food rations. Inorder to ensure that there are no unintended social and
humanitarian consequences, the Government needs, in the case of each of these risks, to identify
specific measures, institutional responsibilities for implementing the measures defined and a
systemfor monitoring o f the risks putinplace. The Government has consequently prepared draft
guidelines; these still require considerable work and technical assistance inorder to be o f suitable
quality and it is expected that the guidelines would be finalized by the end o f March 2004. Inthe
meantime, the Government has decided that the use of guidelines, once these are finalized, would
form the basis for future regional government access to the federal specific purpose grant for food
security. Consequently, the Government has issued a circular to the regions confirming that
access to federal specific purpose grant for food security will require compliance with guidelines
for mitigating social and environmental risk under the Access to New Land Program when these
guidelines are finalized by the end o f March 2004.        Once the guidelines are in place, the
Government also plans to issue a public statement regarding the benefits available under the
program for potential migrants.

123. Environment. Recent progress has been made in the development o f an environmental
regulatory and institutional framework inEthiopia through the passage of a package o f three new
proclamations by the Ethiopian Parliament in October, 2002. The first proclamation focuses on
the Establishment of Environmental Protection Organs and aims to integrate environmental
considerations into the policy and decision making o f sectoral agencies, including the
establishment of environmental units at the federal and regional levels (at the federal level, such
units already exist in ERA, and EEPCO). This is an important step towards the development of
the institutional framework and is a prior action for PRSC I.The second proclamation focuses on
the adoption of EnvironmentalImpact Assessment which i s an internationally accepted and
adopted tool to assess the environmental implications o f projects and programs, consider
alternatives, and identify mitigation measures. EIA can be effective in improving project design
and preventing unnecessary economic and social costs due to failure to consider serious
environmental impacts or to involve affected populations in project design. EL4 has been in
practice in Ethiopia for quite some time, however, its implementation has not previously been
systematic. The third proclamation focuses on EnvironmentalPollutionControl and addresses
the management o f hazardous waste, the establishment of environmental standards for various




                                                42

environmental media (air, water, soil), and the monitoring of pollution. The Government plans to
disseminate the findings of the CEA

124. Rural Finance. This is an important area whichwill be evolving over the next year as the
regional governments disengage from the provision of guarantees and alternative institutions and
instruments develop to manage the risks ofrural lending. The withdrawal o fregional government
guaranteed credit is important for fostering alternative market based channels for rural financial
services, particularly for key inputs such as fertilizers, and i s hence included as a prior action.
Further, as the CBE restructuring plan is developed, this will have important implications for
rural financial services. Finally, the availability of financial savings products in the rural is an
important element of reducing vulnerability given that livestock which constitute the major form
of savings are at risk during years of weather shock. Given the substantial interlinkages within
these issues, the Government i s planning to review its micro- and rural strategy and develop
actionplan to improve access to micro- and rural finance.

E.4 World BankSupport

125. Existing Investment Projects, Pipeline Projects, and AAA.                The current lending
program in support o f the government strategy consists o f projects supporting community-driven
development activities, including building household and community assets, through the
Emergency Drought Recovery project (US$60 million grant), Food Security project (US$S5
million), and Pastoral Community Development project (US$30 million grant), as well as the
development of the national agricultural research system through the Agricultural Research and
Training project (US$60 million). These operations are to be complemented through a lending
pipeline over the next three years which encompasses upgrading and more responsive technical
advisory services, market development, risk management mechanisms and rural land
management through proposed Rural Capacity Building, Rural Market Development and Risk
Management and Access to Land projects.          The Bank is also considering including a new
operation for the development of a growth enhancing safety net, as part o f a broader "rural
development and vulnerability SWAP" to be financed within a multi-donor design framework.
Further,the Bankhas supportedthroughnon-lending assistance, an ongoing policy dialogue with
the Government on key policy and institutional issues, including through a workshop in
November 2002 and regular interactions with government teams on a broad set of rural
development topics. A Risk and Vulnerability assessment i s projected for completion inthe first
quarter o f FY04 as well as an assessment of key safety net programs as part o f the PER. Finally,
the World Bank and DFID are conducting a Country Environmental Assessment to assist the
Government in the implementation o f the environmental proclamations by developing a phased
implementationplan for addressing institutional and capacity issues.

126. The PRSC agenda over the next three years will focus on policy and institutional
reforms aimed at improving agricultural productivity and reforming the safety net. For PRSC I,
the prior actions will consist of issuance of Rural Land Proclamations to enhance land tenure
security and a directive to establish appropriate land administration institutions in four major
regions; increasing the percentage of extension staff with no responsibility for delivery o f inputs
and credit and reducing regional government guarantees for input credits; completion o f the risk
mitigation plan for access to new land and adoption of guidelines; and passage of the
environmental legislation. For PRSC 11, the prior action will be the definition o f institutional
arrangements, implementation modalities and monitoring mechanisms for a system of multi-
annual productive safety nets and the commencement of implementation.

F.     Private and Financial Sector Development

F.1 RecentPerformance

 127. The private sector in Ethiopia has been in existence for only about a decade; under the
previous regime, all property was nationalized. Private sector activity was restored in 1991and it
was only as part of the first round of liberalizationin 1994 that the private sector began operation
in earnest. Private enterprises are generally small and in their early stages of development.
Industryrepresents about 10% GDP and despite the slowly declining share of agriculture - and a
rising share of services    - the industrial and manufacturing shares of output have essentially
remained stable since the early 1990s. The flow of private investment and its participationinthe
economy have so far been quite low and private investment i s estimated at about 10 percent of
GDP (up from about 7 percent in 1994).

128. A draft Investment Climate Assessment reveals that the Ethiopian manufacturing
sector, as reflected by the random sample of firms analyzed in that study, has three major
and inter-related characteristics    - small size of firms, low labor productivity and low level of
exports. First, firms tend to be small in size with the median firm hiring only 14 employees.
Second, the cost of labor inthis sector i s very low, compared to some leading countries exporting
labor-intensive manufactures; for example, the median manufacturing wage rate in Ethiopia i s
almost one-third of that inChina and about 40 percent lower than that inBangladesh. However,
despite the low labor cost advantage, almost all Ethiopian firms are producing for the domestic
market and very few firms participate in export activities. Controlling for size and type o f
industry of employment, a typical worker in Ethiopia is 80 percent less productive than the
average worker inBangladesh and more than two times less productive than the average Chinese
worker. Third, non-exporting firms mentioned as among the top three reasons for not exporting;
inability to produce to clients' standards and specifications (69% of firms); foreign price
competition (35%); and highcosts of establishing foreign distributionnetworks (20%).

129. The ratio of exports to GDP increased from 8 to 15 percent over the period but its
composition has not changed much, and agricultural exports, though volatile, still dominate
exports. A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (completed in November 2003) focuses on the
other institutional impediments to trade. These range from the trade and incentive regime
(particularly effective rates of protection andreal effective exchangerates), generic market access
issues (tariff and non-tariff barriers, special rules of access and accession to the WTO), foreign
direct investment, legal and regulatory framework for trade and investment, trade facilitation,
institutions and institutional support for trade. Some key sectors are further specifically analyzed
including agriculture (cereals, coffee, horticulture and sugar), livestock and meat, manufacturing
and tourism. Finally, transport costs have an impact given the long distance from access to sea
transport (e.g. from Addis Ababa, the capital to Djibouti i s 573 miles). While highat about 10%
of trade value, transport costs appear, on the basis of a recent study, to be competitive on a per
milebasis withEastAfrican nations.

130. Further, the inflow o f Foreign Direct Investment into Ethiopia remains extremely
limited (an average o f about $60 million in net FDIper year over the past 5 years with a large
proportion attributable to a single investor) despite a large "diaspora" which in the case of other
countries often invest in their home country. The Investment Code in Ethiopia (which governs
both foreign and domestic investment) has beenamended several times inthe recent past and it is,
hence, up to date and quite liberal, particularly with regard to tax advantages accorded to export-
oriented FDI. The key constraint relates to foreign ownership in many key sectors: financial


                                                  44

sector, infrastructure and in domestic wholesale and retail activities. These restrictions seem to
be de facto relaxed inrecent years as the Government is seelung to engage the private sector in
power generation and as strategic equity partner intelecommunications as yet no deal has been
                                                                          -
finalized. Finally, the lack of FDI may also result from the problems with the privatization
program not being able to sell Public Enterprises         - which  i s a topic discussed at length
subsequently.

 131. Financial sector. The problems of the private sector are caused in part by insufficient
access to finance, causedbothby limitedamounts and by limiteddiversity o f instruments. Since
 1991, the Government started liberalizing the banking system and allowed entry of the private
sector. There are six domestic banks competing with the state owned Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia; however, there are no foreign banks as the sector i s not open to foreign firms as per the
Investment Code.       The financial sector continues to be characterized by a weak level of
contestability and a lack of dynamism and CBE continues to dominate the financial sector both in
terms of lending and deposit talung (about 80 percent). Deposit and lending rates in Ethiopia
have remained low by international standards over the past decade. Despite these low rates,
deposits have grown faster than lending and deposit mobilization in Ethiopia (as measured by
M2/GDP) is highby African standards, at approximately 40%. There i s excess liquidity inthe
banlung system between 20 to 40 percent of deposits - which results inpart from the under-
                 -
development o f lending techniques based on balance sheets and the presence o f collateral based
lending. CBE itself has been in a crisis for some time due to the economic downturn, poor
lending decisions, lack of risk based pricing of loans, the war with Eritrea, and fluctuations in
agricultural prices; a recent audit indicates that non-performing loans are substantial at least half
                                                                                       -
of the portfolio consists of overdue loans. The Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) and the
Construction and Business Bank (CBB) are also state owned institutions in the banking sector
which are having solvency and liquidityproblems. There are also nine insurance companies and
nineteen micro-finance institutions (MFIs) in the financial sector.         Although microfinance
institutions have the potential for vastly improving access to financial services for low-income
households and MFIs are growing fast, the volume of operations o f these institutions remains
quite low as a proportion of CBE rural lending. Leasing and other types o f non-credit financing,
as well as bond debt and equity markets, remain essentially absent.

132. CBE as Instrument of Monetary Policy. It i s important to note that, given the highly
underdeveloped nature o f the financial sector and the few monetary policy instruments available
to the central bank (National Bank of Ethiopia), CBE's pricingand lendingpolicies are often used
by the Government as direct instruments of monetary policy and fiscal stimulus/stabilizationwith
resulting consequences on its balance sheet. For example, in an effort to stimulate the economy
in 2002, the Government caused CBE to reduce its lending and deposit rates by 3 percentage
points each.

F.2 Key Constraints

133. The private sector which operates only in the context of the domestic market currently
suffers from lack of business confidence. This arises partly by problems o f the recent past (the
war, recession and imprisonment o f several businessmen in the context o f anti-conuption
measures in 2001). It also arises due to the fact that, in the context of a small domestic market,
the average firm has to compete with imports, the public sector and foundation enterprises. First,
inmost sectorsthe trade regime is fairly liberal and weightedaverage import tariffs are at 17.5%.
Firmswhose outputs compete with imports inthe domestic market admitted inthe context ofthe
Investment Climate Assessment that imported goods are more attractive to consumers due to
greater durability (mentioned by 20% of firms),         better material quality (36%) and better


                                                   45

model/design (28%).      Second, there i s a large public enterprise sector (e.g. in industry, public
enterprises account for about 60% of value added). Third, there i s competition from "foundation"
companies (which are well-capitalized private businesses associated with political parties within
the current ruling coalition which were established as foundations at the end of the civil war)
which are active in most major sectors (fertilizer, cement, transport and micro-finance).          The
private sector asserts that these firms have preferential access to contracts, information and
finance. Data on the size of the turnover o f these firms relative to the size of the rest o f the
private sector, their competitiveness and profitability are not available.    21 Competition policy
andprivatizationare, hence,importantissuesfor the domesticprivatesector inEthiopia.

134. Given the problems with competing in existing markets and sectors in Ethiopia, it would
have been expected that Ethiopian entrepreneurs would seek to diversify into other sectors and
markets, particularly export markets. Clearly, diversification o f production into non traditional
activities, including in agriculture, will be key to moving onto a higher growth path and, in
Ethiopia, diversification will largely be associated with exporting.         There are two potential
reasons why investment innew activities i s not accelerating: innovation externalities which result
in risks for the innovator but returns more broadly and coordination failures especially for the
emergence of supporting services. Increasingopportunitiesfor trade and export is another
important issuefor the private sector inEthiopia.

135. While competitiveness i s influenced by low labor productivity, as noted earlier, it is also
influenced by shortcomings in the investment climate which are extemal to the firm. Based on
the interviews with 427 firms in six regions, these shortcomings, as perceivedby the respondents,
are shown inTable 6.

136. Financial sector development. The financial sector has grown in the past decade but it
remains mired by important structural weaknesses. CBE's dominance o f the banking system as a
whole, its noncommercial decisions relating to interest rate pricing, as well as its unfair
advantages with respect to retaining virtually all of the public enterprise business, and control of
the payment system outside of Addis Ababa, seriously undermine competition and poses a major
obstacle to private banks' ability to achieve profitability. The short-term challenge inthe banking
system is to reduce non-performing loans - through collections, rescheduling and work-outs -
adversely affecting the long-term viability of the private sector. The long-term challenge is that
to better utilize available domestic savings as even the low savings (about 5% GDP) are un-
invested and remain as excess liquidity within the banlung system. The underlyingcauses o f the
excess liquidityhave not been thoroughly analyzed; contributory factors could include collateral
'` As a follow-up to the survey underlying the ICA, an additional survey is currently being conducted of
foundation companies.

 based lending (and therefore a lack o f collateral), associated lack o f balance sheet based lending
 or simply lack o f profitable opportunities. This i s an issue that needs to be investigated further.

 F.3 Governmentprogram

 137. The Government has defined a comprehensive private sector development strategy in the
 SDPRP/PRSP and has detailed this further in the draft Industrial Development Strategy which
 was recently discussed with various stakeholders in Ethiopia. The Government's objectives are
 to increase the contribution o f private sector to GDP growth as measured by private investment in
 GDP and to increase factor productivity. While this strategy is not underpinned by a detailed
 action plan as yet, it captures the main elements o f the Government's approach which consist of:
 (a) improving external market access and incoming FDI; (b) implementing domestic competition
policy and reducing role o f the state in commercial activities through privatization; (c) reducing
regulatory burden and streamlining tax policy and administration; (d) improving access to
infrastructure, leased land and finance; and (e) public-private consultation mechanisms.              As
implementation o f the strategy has only recently commenced, it i s expected that the measures in
the Government's program will gather momentum with many key actions being completed by
PRSC-I1and PRSC-111.

 138. External Market Access and Encouraging FDI. The Government has taken several
important steps to signal its intention to integrate Ethiopia more completely into the international
economy. In February 2003, the Government formally submitted a request to the World Trade
Organization for accession to that body and i s currently in the process o f preparing the
Memorandum on Foreign Trade Regime for submission to the WTO. The Government has made
offers - with MIGA acting as a mediator          **- to the 50 largest international claimants whose
properties had been expropriated under the previous regime. Finally, the Government took steps
to pay a claim that had arisen as a result o f interruption o f work in an IDA funded roads project
which had occurred duringthe Ethio-Eritrean border conflict. The Government plans to measure
improvements in trade policy based on the progress made in its World Trade Organization
membership.

 139. Domestic Competition Policy. The Trade Practices Proclamation came into force on
April 17, 2003 and establishedrules on: anti-competitive practices such as price collusion; abuse
o f market dominance; anti-dumping and consumer protection.                The Ministry o f Trade and
Industry has prepared a list o f members for the Competition Commission which has been
submitted for approval by the Prime Minister. Further, the Ministry plans to utilize the Domestic
Trade Department as the secretariat for the Competition Commission.                   To advance the
implementation agenda, it will be necessary to develop separate regulations and implementation
guidelines particularly since the current legislation has some key definitions which are not
completely specified and has other flaws which will need to be rectified. Prior to working on
detailed regulations, it would benefit the dialogue if the Government issued a policy statement
setting out the objectives and implementation plan for Ethiopia's competition policy. Such a
statement could clarify, for example, that the law i s meant to support a modem competition
policy with its key objective being to create a level playing field              where each market is
contestable, resulting in greater economic competitiveness to the ultimate benefit o f consumers.
It could further clarify that the policy is not expected to result in onerous govemment regulation
o f markets but to specify a limited number o f private anti-competitive conducts which would not
be permitted. The Government would involve private sector stakeholders inthe development o f


22The Government invoked Article 23 o f the MIGA Convention which mandates the Agency to encourage
the amicable settlement o f investment disputes (MIGA Board Brief o f M a y 8,2003).


                                                   47

regulations as well as consider involving the Competition Commission in the process of
undertakinga public education and advocacy campaign.

140. Inthe short- to medium-term, the main changes in overall industrial structure and market
dominance in Ethiopia are likely to occur if the privatization program picks up momentum.
Consequently, in parallel with the actions discussed in the previous paragraph, the Government
would undertake other competition policy related activities. First,the Government would review
the overall size and sectoral composition of the major industrial groups in Ethiopia in order to
establish what impact on market concentration the possible participation o f such groups in
various privatization transactions would have.          Second, the Government would review
competition (both from other domestic enterprises and from imports) inthe sectors where a large
number of Public Enterprises are candidates for privatization. The privatization programwould
be designedand implementedin such a manner as to favor new market entrants and limit market
dominance in markets and sectors by enterprises (irrespective o f whether the enterprises are
foreign or domestic, public or private, or for profit or not).     Technical assistance would be
requiredbothinthe development o f regulations and inthe other studies suggested; several donors
have indicated an interest in supporting these activities. Finally, towards the end of the program
period, the Govemment would amend the law in order to harmonize it with international best
practice and separate the consumer protection and anti-dumping aspects from the competition
policy aspects o f the proclamation.

141. Privatization Program. After an initial phase of success, the privatization program in
Ethiopia has had limitedprogress inthe recent past as some 39 enterprises being offered for sale
have not been sold. In2001/02, only 3 enterprises were sold for Birr 9.8 million and in2002/03,
only 4 enterprises were sold for Birr 11.3 million. Inorder to accelerate progress in this area, a
substantially revised approach to privatization would be required. The Government would need
to change the emphasis on maximizing the sale price of the enterprise to focus onbroader revenue
maximization and associated goals. This would require changes in valuation methodologies,
consideration to the impact of excess labor and potential redundancies, assisting public enterprise
staff who choose to enter the private sector, and the need for increased use of transaction
advisors. Further, specific privatization methods will needto be determined for individual public
enterprises and institutional arrangements (which currently include the Ethiopian Privatization
Agency, the Public Enterprise Supervisory Authority and the Board o f Trustees) may need to be
reviewed. Finally, consideration will need to be given to post-privatization support and impact
evaluation. The Govemment i s currently preparinga privatization action plan andwill implement
this during the program period. The Govemment will measure progress in this area by reduced
Public Enterprise tumover to gross value of domestic production.

142. Reducingthe Regulatory Burden. As part o f the PSIP described earlier, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry has taken steps to streamline business registration processes within the
Ministry, the Ethiopian InvestmentAuthority and related institutions. As a result, as a prior
action for PRSC-I, the cost of registration has reduced from $425 (which was the highest inthe
world on a per capita GDP basis) to $65 and the time of registration from 44 days to 8 days. The
next key area targeted from improvement i s the customs administration based on the principles of
risk-based selective verification, service orientation and simplified procedures supported by full
automation. The Government has taken steps to upgrade the customs information system, moved
the main customs office to outside Addis Ababa and entered into a pre-shipment contract with
SGS. Considerable work for the Customs Authority remains to streamline its work to make
customprocedure faster and more user- friendly. The Ministryo f Revenue i s reviewing a report
by an IMF Technical Assistance mission which has made recommendations covering a two to
three year horizon and should result in a customs administration that: utilizes simple procedures


                                                 48

based on self-assessment; implements selective physical inspections based on systems developed
by SGS; and makes full use o f the information systems being installed (ASYCUDA ++). The
Government has recently begun to pilot test measures to reduce the steps required for customs
clearance o f goods down from seventy two to nineteen. The next phase will focus on customs
reform where there i s an ongoing review by the Government with IMF technical assistance and
the Ministry o f Revenue plans to reduce the processing steps down from 72 to 7 or 8. The
measures to improve customs will be implementedduring the programperiod and are expected to
reduce the total number o f days for customs clearance.

143. Tax Reform and Improvements in Tax Administration. The Government initiated a
significant tax reform program in 2002 to broaden the tax base and to improve the efficiency of
tax administration. The key element included the introduction o f a value-added tax (VAT) and
lowering o f income tax and profit tax rates. The program was implemented through legislative
changes (new legislation for VAT and income tax), institutional changes (including the
introduction o f a Taxpayer Identification Number); organizational changes (the establishment of
the Ministry o f Revenue and organizational changes at the federal level including the
establishment o f a large taxpayer office) and strengthening o f personnel (new hires and
substantial training). It i s noteworthy that the process o f introducing VAT included considerable
participationby and consultation with the private sector.

144. Improving access to leased land and reducing lease costs. The Government will
measure progress inthis area by improved access to urban land as measuredby cost o f urban land
in Addis. The Government program attempts to address two related factors: first, increasing
supply o f new leases especially inAddis Ababa; and second, improving the process o fproviding
lease titles for existing land. The passage o f an Urban Land Lease law in June 2002 was an
important first step which was supported by the Bank's ESAC. Inorder to use urban land more
efficiently, the Government is trying to encourage private sector participation in the housing
sector (by passage o f a condominium law) and i s developing low-cost housingprograms inAddis
and other main cities) as well as industrial parks (one has commenced in Addis and others are
under consideration in other regions).     Since land i s a regional responsibility, various regions
have also commenced the process o f translating the federal legislation to region-level legislation
and implementation regulations with Addis Ababa has been the furthest along in this process.
The Government has defined and commenced implementation o f the first phase o f its Urban Land
Management and Development Program. Two important activities are expected to commence
shortly: (a) a study to evaluate whether changes are required to the existing legislation inorder to
address existing shortcomings (e.g. specifying principles for collaterization, incorporating
principles o f land valuation particularly in cases o f acquisition by Government for eminent
domain, etc.); and (b) developing regional prototype land lease legislation based on the Addis
Ababa experience for use by all regions. Given the expectation that revisions to federal land
legislation may be required, the activities can only be completed during the program period.
From the standpoint o f monitoring indicators to measure progress in this area, there are
difficulties with existing data systems and the information that i s most easily available is the price
o f land at various auctions in Addis Ababa. While this would be an imperfect measure o f
movement o f overall land prices throughout the country, it i s potentially the only indicator
available untilthe cadastral information systems improve over the medium-term.

145. Improving access to telecommunications. The Government's overall goal is to utilize
telecommunications (voice and data) as part o f its development strategy, particularly in rural
areas. Its implementation approach had previously been to maintain a monopoly state operator
(the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation) and attempt to cross-subsidize expansion to
rural areas from profits made in urban fixed line and mobile networks and international calls.


                                                  49

This strategy had not yielded the requiredresults due to both lack o f competitive pressures and
the absence o f management capacity inETC. The Government's hence sought a credible partner
which would make a minority equity injection and bring in management slulls; the process was
unsuccessful as the Government didnot find a partner that it considered credible. Inthe absence
o f the success o f this approach and pending a re-tender o f ETC inthe future, the Government has
taken many measures - including change o f the top management o f the ETC and a considerable
                                                                                -
expansion o f the fixed, mobile and internet services i s expected to occur in the coming several
months. Measures to increase competition in the sector have been more limited; licenses have
been issued for the on-site provision o f phone, fax and data communication services and in
equipment supply and maintenance but liberalization has not yet extended to the introduction o f
competing Internet Service Providers. Two licenses for satellite based mobile telephone services
have been issued but, given the potentially higher cost o fprovision o f such services, this may not
translate into substantially increased competition for ETC. Regulatory capacity continues to
remain weak although an advisor has prepared a capacity buildingprogram for ETA. Finally, the
Government i s also constructing an 1,100 site satellite-based special-purpose system for its own
use - a woreda net (to connect district headquarters to the regional and federal levels) and a
school net (to connect secondary schools). ETC i s the implementing agency for this initiative as
well.

 146. The Government i s currently evaluating its options for a further partial liberalization o f the
sector while allowing the ETC to maintain a monopoly over the backbone network. Given that
the existing communication policy o f April 2002 i s unclear as to the next steps planned in the
liberalization process, the Government plans to issue a clear policy statement which would, inter
alia, contain: quantifiable goals and objectives and a clear liberalization timetable; and describe
the strategy and timetable to implement a phased opening o f all market segments to private sector
competition while maintaining ETC's monopoly over the backbone infrastructure. Further, with
regard to the woreda and school net initiatives, the Government plans to review the potential to
use the networks put inplace as the basis for further private sector participationand management.

147. Improving Transport. The Government has a substantial roads sector development
program which i s geared towards six major objectives. First, it improves the quality and quantity
o f the road network and rural travel and transport. Second, it focuses on the institutional reform
and commercializationo fthe operations o f the EthiopianRoads Authority. Third, it enhances the
potential for public-private partnership in delivery and financing by strengthening the domestic
construction    industry, supporting labor-based        maintenance     methods    and    supporting
rationalization in the provision o f maintenance equipment. Fourth, it ensures the adequacy o f
road maintenance and financing arrangements. Fifth, it develops a network based approach to
road planning and management and addresses development issues in a comprehensive manner
(e.g. by taking a road corridor development approach).        Sixth, it strengthens deliver o f urban
transport infrastructure and services. The Government i s also considering options for introducing
private participation into the Ethio-Djibouti rail line (the Chemin de fer Djibouti-Ethiopian
railway). Finally, the Government has recently liberalizedthe air cargo market.

148. Improving Energymower. Given the high dependence on biomass in Ethiopia, the
overall strategy is to improve the supply of electricity and biomass energy inan efficient and cost
effective manner and to promote rational inter-fuel substitution. In the electricity sub-sector,
which i s currently dominated by the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO), the
Government's approach is to develop the country's substantial hydropower resources through
both private and public sector investment for domestic and export markets (Sudan and Djibouti),
while taking adequate measures in addressing the risk o f reduced supply resulting from drought;
increase rural electrification by liberalizing power generation, transmission, distribution and


                                                 50

supply in isolated areas to complement EEPCo's efforts; commercialize and decentralize
EEPCO's operations; and strengthenregulationby the EthiopianElectric Agency. Inthe biomass
sub-sector, the strategy i s to involve the rural population in forest development and expand the
use of efficient fuel wood stoves, while promoting the use o f modern fuels such as liquefied
petroleum gas and Gelfuel.

149. Public-PrivateConsultationMechanisms. Since early 2002, the Govemment has started
a regular and systematic process o f public-private consultations at the national level and for key
export sectors (leather, textiles and garments and horticulture). These consultation mechanisms,
especially those at the sectoral level are usedto resolve problems as they arise.

150. Short-term measures. Even as the Govemment i s implementing measures to address
long-term impediments to PSD, it recognizes that this will only result in improvements in the
medium-term. Consequently, to stimulate short-term growth, the Govemment has started the
process o f attracting investors to sectors where Ethiopia has an apparent comparative advantage
(e.g. horticulture, garments and tourism) and some local and foreign entrepreneurs have
demonstrated     the potential profitability o f export-oriented firms (e.g. in cut flowers and
garments). The Govemment has introduced a package o f measures to improve access to inputs
for exporters as well as to reduce costs o f access. This package includes access to land; tax
holidays, access to long term finance and would be implemented by a stronger Investment
Authority with a one-window approach to providing licenses, land, and tax holidays to FDI.

151. Financial Sector. The policy agenda in the PRSP includes: strengthening the credit
environment and broadening access to financial services; reducing the existing debt overhang o f
the banking system while preserving viable firms; increasing the efficiency o f the banking sector
through measures to improve contestability; introducing new financial products (e.g. rural credit,
credit to SMEs, and leasing) and finding ways to get the long term finance and equity finance
markets started. The results o f the Government's financial sector strategy are expected to result
in: commercial banking being modemized and competition increased as measured by growth in
market size o f private banks and reduced non-performing loans; increased access to financial
services for small holders, entrepreneurs and traders; and development o f financial markets.

152. The Government i s inthe process of restructuringthe CommercialBank of Ethiopia,
the Development Bank of Ethiopiaand privatizingthe Construction and BusinessBank the
focus at this stage i s predominantly on improving CBE's performance.         CBE acquired extemal
consultancy support to improve its management and work commenced inmid-2003. The audit o f
CBE was completed in May 2003 and revealed that over half of all loans were non-performing
loans (NPLs).   The Ministry o f Finance has recently approved a restructuring plan for CBE and
the plan's implementation has begun. There are elements inthe plan that represent progress inthe
restructuringo f the bank. However, there are still areas that need to be addressed and Bank staff
will be working with the authorities to do so over the following months. Given the negative
impact that a large-scale and immediate liquidation o f the collateral underlying the NPLs would
have on the domestic asset markets as well as on the nascent private sector, the Government has
identified measures which would de-link the removal o f NPLs from CBE's balance sheet from
the liquidation o f the underlying collateral. The restructuring plan i s expected to reduce NPLs to
less than 20% o f total loans over the next four years. The implementation o f this plan i s the first
step in the sequence o f financial development and an important macro risk that needs to be
resolved.

153. The DBE restructuring plan would be expected to provide an estimate o f the re-
capitalization needs and possible financial restructuring based on an in-depth and independent


                                                  51

 analysis o f the loan portfolio; the real value o f the respective collateral, and the current
provisioning against non-performing loans. The plan would also include a strategic analysis o f
DBE's role, strategies, development plans, and organizational and financial structure; this
 analysis would examine additional areas in which DBE could have a role given its relative
 strengths and weaknesses.

 154. Regardingmeasuresto strengthencompetitioninthe bankingsector,the Government
has indicatedthat it will continue its efforts to enhance efficiency and competition in the
financial sector, in order to prepare the ground for the progressive integration o f the Ethiopian
financial sector into the global financial market. IMF and Bank staff continue to encourage the
Government to allow the entry o f foreign banks into the financial sector over time, initially by
allowing foreign minority shareholding in private domestic banks. The Government, however,
reiterates its position that it i s not ready to take such measures and considers that priority should
first be given to strengthening the financial sector and enhancing supervisory capacity o f the
central bank.  23


 155. The measures that the Government is undertaking outside of CBE are also an
important part of the long-termsolution to improvingfinancialsector performance. First,
inabanking systemthat is heavily dependent on collateral, the implementationo fthe UrbanLand
Managementand Development Program land leases can be expected to result in land leases being
increasingly available for use as collateral. Second, the Government's tax reform program            -
including the unique Tax Identification Numbering system - can be expected to increase
availability o f information that banks require to undertake more sophisticated lending techniques.
Finally, the availability o f alternative instruments in the monetary and bond markets will be an
important element o freducing the Government's use o f CBE for managing its monetary policy.

F.4 World BankSupport

 156. ExistingInvestment Projects, Pipeline Projects, and AAA. While the Bank does not
have any existing PSD or FSD investmentprojects, a PSD Capacity Buildingproject (expected in
FY05) i s under preparation. This project would support capacity building at the firm level,
sector-specific institutions and economy-wide institutions including the financial sector. There i s
an existing Adaptable Program Loan for the roads sector; the total support from IDA is expected
to reach around $0.5 billion by 2013 with the first phase being provided as a grant o f $127
million in M a y 2003. There i s also an existing energy project in the amount o f $133 million
which i s assisting the Government in implementing its energy sector strategy particularly with
regardto improving power generation. Previous adjustment lending (ERSC and ESAC) focused
on the PSD agenda and the results o f this lending have been highlighted earlier. The important
elements o f the Bank's support to date have been provided through sector work (Investment
Climate Assessment and Diagnostic Trade Integration Study). The Bank has re-engaged through
the provision of technical assistance for the financial and telecommunications sectors over the last
year and i s commencing support for privatization.

157. The PRSC series will support several important policy reforms. For PRSC-I, the
Government has implemented the following prior actions: (a) it has approved and commenced
implementation o f the CBE restructuringplan; (b) it has substantially reducedthe cost (from $425
to $65) and time (from 44 to 8 days) o f registration; and (c) it has submitted its application for

WTO accession. For PRSC-11, the Government would: (a) review the micro- and rural strategy
and develop action plan to improve access to micro- and rural finance; (b) commence
implementation o f agreed measures for accelerating privatization program; (c) revise the federal
urban land lease law and adopt a new land lease proclamation in Addis Ababa; and (d) adopt a
revised telecommunications policy allowing for partial liberalization o f the telecommunications
sector.

G. HumanDevelopment

G.l Recentperformance

158. The current Government o f Ethiopia inherited a human development situation marked by
outcomes that were significantly below the average for low-income sub-Saharan Africa. The low
levels o f education, health, water and sanitation service coverage were, moreover, heavily biased
towards urban areas. In 1994 Ethiopia launched 20-year plans in both education and health to
forcefully bridge the large gaps in service coverage and outcomes, especially for the rural
population. Inthe subsequent years Ethiopia has more than doubled primary school enrollment
rates, sustained improvements in child survival rates, improved child malnutrition rates, and
haltedthe increase inthe HIV/AIDS prevalence rate. The SDPRP's three-year objectives are also
broadly embedded inthe MDG2015 targets (see Table 3 in section 11). These achievements have
not been easy. Ethiopia has very high unit costs o f basic service delivery that are not entirely
explained by low population densities.      Despite increases in the share o f the public budget
dedicated to social services, the very low per capita GDP level has posed a formidable resource
constraint to the expansion and improvement o f services. The utilization o f the development aid
resources mobilized since the latter half o f the 1990s via sector-wide development programs
(SWAP frameworks) has also often been delayed and partial due to hightransactions costs faced
by government, especially at Regional levels. Moreover, the rates at which improvements have
taken place in social outcomes indicate that other than with respect to primary school completion
rates, the attainment o f other MDGs - especially with respect to maternal and child mortality  - are
likely to remain elusive for Ethiopia.

159. If Ethiopia i s to have a greater chance to reach these goals, it will need to undertake
measures to reduce unit costs o f service delivery; improve the ability o f local authorities and
communities to exercise choice, voice and institute appropriate incentives vis-A-vis service
providers; and reduce transaction costs associated with donor financing flows. The government's
recent deepening o f decentralization to the woreda level, combined with civil service reform,
public sector capacity building measures, and the strengthening o f public expenditure
management described earlier in this document and at the core o f the PRSC Ireform program -
                                                  -
are necessary steps to improve primary service delivery. The implementation o f these measures
is, however, at an early stage and needs to be monitored closely to assess their impact on
improving effectiveness. Furthermore, as the woreda decentralization efforts stabilize in the
coming year (2003-4), it will be necessary to further articulate the sector specific reforms that will
be necessary to complement the cross-cutting public sector management reforms being rolled out
at this initial stage. Some o f these companion sector reforms are already clear in outline form
(see below), such as the shift in emphasis within health from a facility-based service delivery
mode to one which relies more on outreach and community-based preventive and curative
services.

160. Education. The education system has expanded rapidly since the adoption o f the
Education and Training Policy o f 1994, further elaborated in the Education Sector Development
Plan 1 (ESDP 1) which commenced in 1996/97, and ESDP I1which commenced in 2002/03.


                                                 53

Gross enrollment rates at the primary level (Grades 1-8) have been increasing rapidly, advancing
from 34.7% in 1996197 to 61.6% in 2001/02. More and more children o f each age cohort in
Ethiopia are completing the primary education cycle, at least through grade 5. Recent World
Bank estimates for the Education Country Status Report for Ethiopia show, for example, that the
primary completion rate (defined as Grade 5 completion rate) rose from about 18% in 1994 to
32% in 2001. The system is, however, increasingly unable to sustain the expansion without
compromising the quality o f schooling conditions. Dropout rates remain high, resulting in, for
instance, only about 38% o f those who started in grade 1 surviving in school to grade 6 in
2001/02. The proxy measures for quality such as section size, pupil: teacher ratio and pupil:
textbook ratio have also deteriorated as a result of increasing enrollments facing supply-side
constraints on service delivery. Regional and gender disparities also remain large, even though
there has been some measure o f success in narrowing the gender gap and in urban and rural
disparity over recent years. For example, the female GER has risen from 47.0 % in 1999/2000 to
51.2 % in 2001/02. Almost all performance indicators for the largely pastoralist regions o f Afar
(12.6%) and Somali (13.1%.),      however, continue to be particularly far below the national
average.   As for secondary and tertiary education performance in Ethiopia, enrollment rates
remain very low, even inthe context o f other low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.

 161. Total planned public spending on education in Ethiopia was ETB 2.85 billion (US$ $333
million) in the FY2001/02 budget, representing 13.9% o f the overall budget, and 4.5% o f GDP.
Education spending has not changed appreciably as a share o f the budget following a major
increase fromjust over 9 % o f the budget inthe late 198Os, to a more or less stable 14% since the
mid-1990s. Despite the increase innominalbudgets andbudget share for education since the past
5 years, actual expenditure per capita has not increased as appreciably. With the massive increase
inenrollments, real recurrent spending per student has infact fallen by about 20% since 1996/97
at the primary level, and by 15% at the secondary level.

 162. Health. Private and public expenditures on health services in Ethiopia are among the
lowest inthe Africa region and the world. Overall, 1.45 billion birr was spent on health services
inFY2000/01, representing approximately 22.40 birr per capita (approx. US$2.60). Ofthis,more
than half was out-of-pocket spending by individuals themselves. Ethiopia's public spending on
health services represents a significant increase over the last ten years relative to the country's
national income, rising from less than 0.9 % o f GDP in 1990/91 and reaching approximately 1.5
% by 2000/01. While undoubtedly very low in absolute per capita terms, Ethiopia's level of
health spending as a proportion o f GDP i s more or less at the expected level given the country's
level of income. The PER 2002/3 reports that in terms o f share o f overall public spending,
however, Ethiopia spends a lower share o f its public money on health than all but a handful o f
countries inAfrica.

163. Given the low absolute levels o f spending on health services, the performance in terms o f
health indicators may be regarded as being relatively good. Ethiopia, which started with child
mortality rates that were higher than the sub-Saharan average in 1960, i s slowly catching up with
the sub-Saharan average. Child mortality has declined in Ethiopia over the past 15 years and this
decline has been more pronounced over the last 10 years. Under-five mortality i s 21 % lower
now than it was five to nine years ago. The corresponding decline inneonatal and post-neonatal
mortality over the same period i s 29% and 21%, respectively. Despite these gains, almost one in
every ten babies born in Ethiopia (97 per 1,000) today does not survive to celebrate its first
birthday and one in every six children dies before its fifth birthday. Furthermore, although
improving in the latter half o f the 199Os, Ethiopia's extremely high child malnutrition rates
(moderate to severe underweight o f 47% and moderate to severe stunting o f 51%) are amongst
the highest in sub-Saharan Africa and may pose immense challenges to improving child survival.


                                                 54

Only 30% o f pregnant women received any antenatal care ffom a skilled health professional in
2000/1, with skilled birthattendants present at fewer than 10% o fbirths inEthiopia. Overall total
fertility rates also continue to be highinEthiopia (5.86).

 164. The national average masks wide urbadrural as well as regional variations in child
mortality. The infant mortality rates (IMR) were 96.5 and 114.7 in urban and rural areas
respectively, while under-five mortality rates are 148.6 and 192.5 in urban and rural areas
respectively. Regional variations are even more prominent. Addis Ababa has the lowest IMR
(81) and under-five mortality rate (113), while Gambela has the highest IMR (123) and under-
five mortality rate(233). It should be noted, however, that while Ethiopia has highlevels o f IMR
and USMR, it has lower IMR and U 5 M R and lower levels o f wealth-based inequities relative to
other countries with similar per capita incomes.

165. Reaching child survival MDGswill be challenging ifthe current pace i s maintained. At the
beginning o f the 1990s, Ethiopia would have needed to reduce under-five mortality at the rate o f
5.2 per 1000 live births each year to reach the MDG o f child survival by year 2015. However,
between 1990 and 2000, under-five child mortality decreased only by 1.9 per 1000 live birthsper
year. Only by reducing the under-five child mortality rate by 7.4 per 1000 live births per year
between 2000 and 2015 can Ethiopia hope to achieve the MDGs. This will require extraordinary
measures in improving access to and quality o f maternal and child health services, water and
sanitation services, girls' education, reduced fertility rates, and improved householdincomes.

166. Distance to the nearest health facility (public or private) did decrease from 8.8 kms. in
1995 to 7.7 kms. in 2000, yet still 30% o f households live beyond 10 km radius o f a health
facility and more than 80% travel by foot to access health facilities beyond 10 kms. Even this
level o f apparent or "potential" coverage indicated by the level o f facilities, does not necessarily
mean effective coverage given that many facilities are not staffed adequately. Ethiopia also has
one o f the world's highest ratios o f population per doctor and per nurse, and yet even this low
level o f service coverage represents an improvement in recent years: from 1996/97 to 2001/02
there have been significant increases in the numbers o f health officers (ffom 30 to 484), nurses
(4,114 to 12, 838), paramedics (1,788 to 3,706), and doctors (1,483 to 1,888); in contrast, the
number o f health assistants decreased (10,625 to 8,149).

167. HIV/AIDS. It i s estimated that about 6.6% o f adults or 2 million people are HIV positive.
Inpartnership with NGOs, the GOE increased its distribution of condoms from 50 million in
2000 to an estimated 65 million in 2002, but contraceptive prevalence rates still remain low at
about 20%.

168. Water and Sanitation. Improving access not only improves the quality o f life o f the poor,
but also is linked to improved outcomes across sectors, including health, education, agriculture,
and the environment. Access to clean water for the country as a whole was estimated at 24% in
2000, with 81% having access inurban areas.

G.2 Key constraints

169. Education. Despite the recent progress, Ethiopia's low primary completion rates are
symptomatic o f a delivery system that i s marked by high unit costs o f service delivery and low
levels o f inter-regional choice in key dimensions o f the mode o f delivery.        Analysis o f the
structural constraints indicate three major policy factors contributing to highunit costs.

0   The current requirements for teacher certification levels result in a large teaching wage bills.


                                                  55

     Teachers within the public education system are required to have completed secondary
     education plus 2 or 3 years o f pre-service training in teach training institutes and colleges.
     This level o f certification requires a commensurate salary structure which places primary
     teachers' salaries at a multiple o f the per capita GDP o f Ethiopia. Furthermore, wage bills
     use up most o f the recurrent budget spending on primary education (more than 90%), leaving
     very little fiscal space for textbooks and other pedagogical inputs. The system cannot afford
     to hire teachers at these standards as the need expands. Consequently the pupil-teacher ratio
     has been rising (average >60 inrural areas, while inurban areas, it i s about 40). The Regions
     have followed centrally set standards and coped with the lack o f resources by allowing (a)
     communities to hire and pay for their own teachers (who might receive % the pay o f a
     formally certified teacher); and (b) non-formal basic child education centers to operate using
     a curriculum that condenses 4 years o f the formal system into 3 years. Most community
     teachers and non-formal centers serve inrural areas.

     Unit costs for school construction are high (on average $16,000 per classroom block).
     Consequently, the pace o f classroom expansion i s failing to stay abreast o f the expansion in
     enrollments and has contributed significantly to the increase in pupil-to-section ratios.
     Moreover, the MOE's policy o f building large schools to serve wide catchment areas have
     contributed not only to the high unit costs o f construction, but also reduced access for
     younger school-aged children and led to a high opportunity cost for the older children who
     have to walk a long distance to and from school.

     The 8 years o f the primary schooling cycle i s longer than inmost other countries. Ethiopia's
     current primary schooling system requires a 4+4 total o f 8 years o f schooling for the
     complete cycle, whereby specialized teaching i s required from grade 5 onward. Specialized
     teaching at such an early stage also increases the teaching costs.

170. An additional constraint on Ethiopia's ability to expand education (and health) services has
been the transactions costs associated with utilization o f donor aid resources. Donor resources
earmarked for education have largely been used to support capital construction. The PER 2002/3
notes that under-spending on the capital budget has been a persistent problem in the education
sector from budgetary and aid-funded sources. Procurement bottlenecks and unpredictabilityllate
notification o f the level o f capital funding in a given year have affected both sources o f funds.
The majority o f under-spending, however, has been on the aid budget and can be linked to
difficulty in complying with multiple sets o f donor requirements for administering funds and
contracting. The PER 2002/03 finds that while on average 82% o f the domestically-financed part
o f the capital budget was spent during the period 1996/97-2000/01, only about 30% o f the
project-aid funded budget was spent in the same time period. Furthermore, the un-utilized share
o f donor resources for education could not be easily re-allocated to financing much needed
recurrent expenditures, given that the aid was project-based rather than budget-support.

171. Finally, improvementsinachievingeducational outcomes are still largely regarded as being
linked to public expenditures on the education sector per se. There i s needto buildbetter analysis
o f the demand side constraints to schooling, as well as the multi-sectoral determinants o f
education outcomes derived from the impact o f investments in other areas such as nutrition,
roads, water and sanitation, etc.

172. Health. While low absolute levels o f fundingfor health services are often indicated as the
primary driver o f low service coverage and health outcomes, there i s also scope to improve the
effectiveness and equity o f resource use in the health sector. The steady if slow improvement in
several child survival indicators reported above indicates that increased health spending i s likely


                                                  56

to lead to better health outcomes, if allocative patterns and efficiency levels remain constant. Yet
Ethiopia could elevate its level o f health spending efficiency and progress towards better
outcomes, and infact it needs to do so if SDPRP goals and MDGs are to be reached. Incremental
funding can actually be instrumental in increasing the efficiency of the system further if used to
improve allocative efficiency by focusing on increasing the coverage o f high impact
interventions.   This will imply removing the current bottlenecks to implementation o f those
activities, rather than just increasing the budget while keeping the current allocations constant.
Given that the extent to which Ethiopia's health services budget can be increased in the short to
medium term i s limited by the country's level o f poverty, it would be important to focus on
minimizing the costs o f the various service delivery strategies and ensuring that incremental
resources are made available for cost effective interventions to promote healthy behaviors,
prevent and treat the most common diseases. Several bottlenecks or constraints to improved
performance have been identified.

    The distribution o f resources i s skewed towards urban and tertiary care. Recurrent public
    health spending i s heavily oriented toward hospital care and capital investments and toward
    urban areas and wealthier populations. From the preliminary PER report the latest figures
    available for ET FY 94 indicate that the Government spent 178 million Birr on recurrent
    expenditures in the country's 90 hospitals while it spent only 142 million Birr on the primary
    health care (PHC) level which includes health centers, health stations/clinics and healthposts.
    Capital expenditures also appear skewed with about 61 million Birr spent on hospitals in ET
    FY 93 compared to 26 million for PHC facilities. Both public and private hospitals are
    utilized more by the richest quintile o f households, while public clinics, pharmacies and other
    trained private providers are usedmore by the households inthe poorest quintile. Households
    from the poorest quintile utilize public hospitals the least.

    The PHC facilities as currently constituted do not have sufficient recurrent budgets or
    outreach and community-based services.            PHC and first-level referral facilities have
    expanded in recent years, with the potential health coverage o f government health facilities
    increasing to 61%    .Yet utilization rates are still low and have even decreased from 0.25 in
    1996 to 0.23 in 2001. Increases in the number o f health posts have also not generated the
    expected improvement in utilization rates (WMS 2000). The PER indicates that the primary
    determinants o f whether a facility i s utilized by the poor or not appears to be distance (40%)
    and the quality o f care (20%), more than price o f service per se (10%).       Ethiopia has not,
    however, supported the increased capital expenditures for facility expansion by sufficient
    allocations o f recurrent expenditures that have an impact on the quality o f services (for
    example, having sufficient, well-trained and motivated staff, medical supplies especially
    drugs, and adequate maintenance o f facilities and equipment). In fact capital spending has
    increased in real terms, while recurrent spending appears to have remained constant. This
    trend lends support to concerns that Ethiopia may have been over-reliant on buildingfacilities
    that cannot be properly staffed and operated. Moreover, the question o f a "health extension
    worker" cadre who could provide outreach services directly within communities has-until
    recently (see below)-been     locked in a debate over whether the mobile workers will be able
    to deliver basic services including those which involve drugs (e.g. immunizations, malaria
    prophylaxis, ORT) or be limitedto prevention, hygiene and sanitation educationonly.

    It is necessary to address the determinants o f the scarcity o f trained health workers at various
    levels. As mentioned earlier, there i s a severe human resource constraint especially o f highly
    skilled health personnel such as physicians. High attrition rates among health personnel
    prevail, especially in rural locations, given a weak incentive structure to retain qualified
    personnel.    Fourth, similar to the education sector, the health sector has faced high


                                                  57

    transactions costs in accessing and using donor capital resources, while at the same time
    continuing to face constraints on its recurrent budget needs as well.


0   There i s as yet no clear institutional framework for multi-sectoral coordination o f nutrition
    activities. Giventhe very highchild malnutrition levels inEthiopia, it i s o f great importance
    that the coordination o f food availability, child health services, and nutritional education
    services be strengthened. While M O H and the Federal Food Security Program have distinct
    responsibilities inthis regard, the government needs to provide a clear and strong mandate to
    one institution to lead this multi-sectoralcoordinated initiative.

173. HIV/AIDS. While the SDPRP recognizes the importance o f addressing HIV/AIDS in a
comprehensive way, there i s a lack o f reliable information or a clear M&E system to assess
progress. There i s no reliable baseline information backed by data generated by a representative
sample o f biological surveys or a functional M&E system to trace achievements and failures on a
continuous basis. The sentinel sites are limited and the information generated from these sites at
present is not only unreliable (information generated through sentinel sites indicated a reduction
from 7.3% to 6.6% which may be traced to changes innumber and composition o f sentinel sites)
but also could not provide the type o f information needed to reliably assess progress such as
information on the incidence o f HIV in targeted groups, and compute the indicators for MDGs.
Interms of other communicable diseases, while estimates ofthe malariaprevalence rate varies, it
is clear that many lowland areas which are being considered as potential sites for opening new
land for agricultural production and voluntary migration has malaria.

174. Water and Sanitation. To reach the MDG for water supply o f halving the un-served
population, at least 10 millionmore people would needto be served inurban areas at an estimated
cost o f $40 million per year and 35 million more people inrural areas at about $95 million per
year.

G.3 Governmentreformstrategy

175. Education.       The Government's aim i s to increase access, completion and equity in
education; improve quality and efficiency o f the education system; and improve policy, financial
and management capacity in the sector.          Through its ESDP structure the Government has
established a strong SWAP process with its donor partners, which has been functioning since
1996/7. While in the initial years o f the ESDP the government focused heavily on increasing
enrollments, more recently the government i s also taking on the continuing challenge o f reducing
the high drop-out rate, high pupil-teacher and pupil-textbook ratios, high gender and regional
disparities. The Governmentprogram focuses on several key actions:
0   First, the government has devolved responsibility and financing decisions for primary
    education services first to Regions and as o f last year to woreda administrations to improve
    local level accountability regarding education outcomes. The federal Government's intention
    i s to go further and strengthen the role o f communities in education-related decision-making.
    In late 2002, for example, the MOE introduced a new directive for regions and woredas,
    which provides guidelines on strengthening school supervision, school management
    committees and the role o f communities, as well as a capitation-based performance grant
    from woredas to schools to ensure financing for non-salary recurrent expenses.


0    Second, the government i s revising school construction costs options to include lower-cost
    options and "village schools" which are smaller, cheaper, and may be located closer to small
    rural populations in order to reduce a major source o f high unit costs. The revision and
    adoption o f these options i s expected to be completed by the end o f the calendar year 2003.


                                                   58

    Another major area o f high unit-costs, i.e., that o f teacher certification levels, training and
    support structures, and flexibility inrecruitmentpolicies across Regions, i s an area MOE has
    begun to explore but the policy dialogue i s at an initial stage only.

    Third, the Government has undertaken several measures to address the issue o f regional
    disparities in socio-economic conditions and education outcomes.          In the Annual Review
    Meeting (ARM)o f the education sector inMay 2003, the Government decided to undertake a
    number o f studies to assess the role o f "alternative modes o f delivery" for low-enrollment
    areas. Furthermore, it has built the first stage o f a simple sector financial simulation tool that
    can enable policy trade-offs to be assessedat the Federal level, to be extended inthe next few
    months to Region-specific conditions.

    Fourth, the Government i s assessing the impact o f system expansion on quality not only in
    terms o f efficiency indicators such as drop-out rates, etc. but also in terms o f actual student
    learning outcomes. It has designed the 2nd round o f a periodic system o f evaluation o f
    student learning, to be implemented in 2004.          Currently the only measures available o f
    student learningoutcomes are at the end o f cycle national examinations.

    Fifth, the Government has also undertaken to identify the ways in which the sector review
    mechanism needs to be adjusted to better align with the Government's budget and planning
    process, in preparation for increased support to primary education via multi-sectoral program
    or budget support rather than projectizeddonor funding.

176. It i s still too early to assess how well woreda decentralization i s affecting either financing
for or quality o f primary education services. The two year period FY2002-04 are transition years
where bureaurestructuring and establishment o f woreda decision-making processes for use o f the
block grant across multiple sectors, and alignment o f sector reviews and national budget calendar
needs are being worked out. One area where already it i s clear that further action i s required i s on
timeliness in reporting on planned budget and actual expenditure at the sub-sectoral level-i.e.,
by primary, secondary and tertiary education levels. This level o f detail i s required to ensure that
the system expands within a medium-term resource envelope, protecting conditions for effective
teaching and learning and ensuring the availability o f resources for primary education, while
expanding post-primary levels.        Another key area which will need to be monitored i s the
mechanism or structure being developed to encourage better performance in an area o f national
policy importance, such as increased primary completion rates, in the context o f Regional and
woreda autonomy inbudget and service delivery choices. The availability o f human capacity in
the sector at the woreda level has become a further issue o f concern. The two-way interaction
between the public sector capacity-building agenda program and the sector-specific capacity-
buildingactivitiesneedto be sustainedand deepened.

177. Health. The analysis o f Ethiopia's performance inhealth indicators and major constraints
imply that increased spending alone will not be as effective as incremental financing increases
targeted towards services that are likely to have high impact. This conclusion i s reflected in the
latest developments o fthe HSDP.

       The Government has defined a minimum service delivery package at every service level,
       including a "health extension package" which includes support to households and
       communities and effective outreach services. These minimumpackages will form the basis
       for budgeting guidelines to be suggested to Regions and woredas and are based on the
       stated policy objective o f strengthening the recurrent budgets for PHC and first-level



                                                 59

       referral facilities. The decisions on actual budget allocations will, however, remain with
       the Regions and woredas who are responsible for pre-assigned levels o f health services
       delivery.


0      The Government has also clarified the scope o f the "health extension package" to be
       delivered by a cadre o f health extension workers who will be mobile.        Health extension
       workers will be polyvalent and trained to deliver a package o f both preventive and mostly
       drug-based curative care and reproductive health information and service. The workers
       will also liaise with PHC        facilities for patient referrals, particularly for high risk
       pregnancies and emergency obstetric care. The original Government design for health
       outreach was based solely on prevention, hygiene and sanitation education. Given a robust
       debate on the topic initiated by Regional Health Bureaus, however, the government has
       now opted for a more demand driven approach devolving to the Regions and woredas the
       responsibility o f defining their own health extension activities and the training o f health
       extension workers accordingly to meet the specific needs o f their communities.

       The Government i s also in the process o f developing a human resources strategy for the
       health sector, inthe context o f the diverse conditions and health needs across regions. The
       MOH i s cognizant that it faces a particularly difficult situation with respect to the retention
       o f skilled health workers, given the international market for skilled health workers. As
       such it i s embarking on a health worker study, incollaborationwith the World Bank, which
       will provide a detailed analysis o f the major determinants o f health worker performance,
      retention and attrition in Ethiopia. Discussions between MOH, MOFED and the Civil
       Service Reform Program (CSRP) will need to ensure that any reforms to health personnel
       hiringpolicy or performance incentives recommended by the study are developed in the
       context o f the overall CSRP.


0      InSeptember 2003 ajoin government-donor coordination group to discuss nutrition issues
       has been formed.        This is a very positive development in clarifying institutional
      responsibilities for this multi-sectoral area. This group needs to agree on the working
      relationships between the various core agencies and start the development o f a nutrition
       strategy for Ethiopia.


0     The Government also intends to define an action plan for implementation o f its Population
       and Reproductive Health Policy which was defined in 1993 but has not been appropriately
      implemented. In the process o f preparing the action plan, the policy would be reviewed
      and, if appropriate, updated for recent developments (e.g. the impact o f HIV/AIDS).

178. While the adoption o f the minimum packages and the health extension packages are
expected to expand and improve health services, important questions remain as to how these
packages will be implemented and financed. The work on costing the packages i s at an early
stage, as are guidelines on the training levels o f the health extension workers, incentives for such
workers, etc.     These choices have implications for inter-sectoral budget allocations and are
circumscribedby the overall remunerationand career structures permittedunder the public sector.
For these strategies to have a genuine impact in terms o f improving services, regional ownership
and accountability, a strong inter-sectoral and inter-governmental partnership will need to be
forged between sector-specific and coordinating agencies.

179. HIVIAIDS. The government expects to reduce new infections o f the virus by 25% by
2005 and to stabilize the infection rate thereafter at 7.3% adult population by halting new cases.



                                                  60

Inorder to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS, a multi-sectoralHIV/AIDS preventionand control
program was established in January 2001. The organizational structure i s now inplace to target
high risk groups and affect behavioral change. The strategy has been aimed at risk reduction
(such as distribution o f condoms), care and support for those already infected, support to families
caring for orphans (regardless o f whether the parents' death was due to AID or not),
mainstreaming HIV/AIDS into all government intervention, enhancing community level
response, and tracking ongoing activities. Inregard to the particular issue o f building a stronger
M&E base, the GOE has agreed to undertake a feasibility study for carrying out a national
biological survey o f HIV/AIDS prevalence.        While encouraging, the urgency o f the matter
demands that bothHAPCO and MOHproceedwith the study as quickly as possible.

180. Water. Improving access to water and sanitation not only improves the quality o f life o f
the poor, but also is linked to improved outcomes across sectors, including health, education,
agriculture, and the environment. The Government's recently completed phase o f the Water
Supply Development and Rehabilitation program improved water services in 25 towns, built
capacity for sustained service delivery in urban and rural areas, developed regional investment
strategies, and provided technical assistance to the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority.
The following phase o f the program i s under preparation, with a larger focus on rural water
supply and sanitation.

G.4 WorldBanksupport

181. Existing Investment Projects, Pipeline Projects, and A M . The Bank has supported
both the ESDP and the HSDP via two Credits o f $100 million each which are closing in June
2004, after which IDA financial support for primary and secondary service delivery i s expected to
be channeled via the series o f PRSCs. This shift to a budget-support mechanism i s expected to
provide increased flexibility to GOE in channeling aid resources to recurrent as well as capital
budgets. In addition, a Post-Secondary Education project (expected in FY04), currently under
preparation, i s expected to support undergraduate and graduate level training capacity
development and quality improvement, as well as to redirect Technical and Vocational Education
into a responsive mechanism to meet labor force needs and economic change. The Bank will also
continue to finance HIV/AIDS-related activities directly via the current Multisectoral HIV-AIDS
project I(MAP I,   US$59.7 million), and follow-on MAP I1(expected inFY05). Over the course
o f the last two years the Bank has been engaged inassisting the Government in strengthening the
analytical basis for making policy choices and deepening the reform program in the area o f
education and health service delivery through the ongoing work on the Country Status Reports in
education and health. As o f FY04, the Bank has also initiated work on a study o f basic Service
Delivery in a decentralized context to assess how national policies and service delivery standards
are being implemented at the woreda level and analyze the extent to which the institutional
relationships under the decentralization initiative are conducive to better services for the poor,
and how they may be adjusted to enhance service delivery.

182. The PRSC series will build on the Bank's prior support to the Heath and Education
sector programs. As a prior action for PRSC-I, the Government has adopted guidelines defining
the minimum package o f services at woreda level including the health extension program and
related roles for health posts and health centers. As a prior action for PRSC-11, the Government
would have completed federal design options and guidelines for primary school constructionwith
lower unit costs and community participationwould be validated and adopted by all Regions.

B. Monitoring andEvaluation

185. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) arrangements. The M&E arrangements for all
donors' multi-sectoral program and budget support operations are closely linked with the
preparation o f the first Annual Progress Report (APR) and the integration o f the M&E
arrangements for three major sectors (health, education and roads) that are well established into
the overall M&E process. The Government has ensured continuity by converting the technical
steering committee for PRSP preparation into the PRSP implementation monitoring committee.
The Welfare Monitoring Unit (WMU) o f MoFED i s the secretariat for this activity and the
Central Statistical Authority (CSA) plays a key role in data collection. To improve the existing
system based on the experience o f the first year o f implementing the PRSP, the Government has
prepared a Monitoring and Evaluation action plan and a poverty monitoring plan.

186. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M& E) action plan defines the medium-term agenda. The
short-term M&E agenda i s to better align existing M&E process at the national level and over the
medium-term to expand the M&E system to the woreda level where the primary service delivery
systems will increasingly capture data on both outputs and expenditures. CSA systems for data
storage and dissemination capacity will be improved by establishing an Ethiopian Socioeconomic
Database System through setting up an electronic household survey data library and assembling



                                                 63

all the data and metadata for the most recent HICES and W M S and storing them on CD-ROM.
Efforts will also focus on existing sector MIS systems, such as the Education MIS and Health
M I S where the medium-term goal i s to bring all sectoral information systems together into a
single uniform system coordinated by the Welfare Monitoring Unit. The plan contains the
detailed steps necessary to achieve these goals and includes various actions such as: determining
what needs to be monitored; building an integrated data management system; developing a
medium-term research agenda; strengthening environment for performance-based decision-
making; strengthening participatory monitoring (dissemination and feedback); strengthening
institutional capacity; and sector-specific activities.    Finally, the M&E program will track
improvements in public sector institutional quality i.e. adequacy and predictability o f resource
flows; fiscal autonomy; incentives or enabling environment for frontline staff; and output
efficiency o f organizations and their staff. The work in this regard will be undertaken in the
context o f the PSCAP program and the Institutional Governance Review and will be available
prior to PRSC-11.

187. Welfare Monitoring. As part o f the development o f the overall M&E system, the
Government has prepared a separate plan for poverty monitoring. The plan includes steps to:
improve the CSA's information         base for poverty and welfare monitoring; and develop a
dissemination strategy to promote data and its usage. The plan also focuses on strengthening the
capacity o f the Welfare MonitoringUnit (WMU) to integrate and analyze quantitative data for to
better understand the poverty situation in Ethiopia by monitoring the welfare and poverty
outcomes resulting from the implementation o f the SDPW.             The five year survey program
includes a combination of Household Income Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HICES)
and Welfare Monitoring Surveys (WMS)           -  including periodic use o f a lighter Core Welfare
Indicator Survey (CWIQ) methodology. The final schedule o f surveys (and the Census) to be
conducted over the next 5 years i s beingfinalized.

188. The Government will hold a consultative workshop to discuss advanced drafts o f the two
plans with various stakeholders. Issues that are likely to be clarified at the workshop will include:
tighter linkages between the sequencing o f the M&Eprogram and the APR process; greater focus
on data dissemination and the open access policy; reviewing the institutional arrangements and
organizational capacity buildingneeds o f Government institutions for data analysis in the context
o f an evolving system which would expect other stakeholders to take greater role in this regard;
and "quick win" opportunities for use o f data to improve decision making. Based on the
workshop discussions, the Government would finalize bothplans.

189. Data dissemination strategy. Several M&E activities are dependent on more clarity on
the issue of open data access to the data produced by the CSA and other institutions. These
activities include those relatedto the dissemination o f data and results from different surveys, and
the encouragement o f increased usage o f raw and processed data by different stakeholders,
including by independent research institutes and other non-governmental institutions and
organizations. The CSA has issued guidelines and service standards to ensure timely release of
and access to raw statistical data as a prior action for PRSC-I.

C. Grant Administration

190. The Grant will follow IDA'S simplified disbursement procedures for adjustment
operations. Accordingly, the Grant proceeds will be disbursed incompliance with the stipulated
single tranche release conditions. The operation uses the Bank`s standard simplified disbursement
procedures. Once the Grant i s approved by the Board, the Borrower will open and maintain a
dedicated deposit account inU S Dollars for the Borrower's use. As the single tranche i s released


                                                   64

on Grant effectiveness, IDA will disburse the proceeds o f the Grant into the deposit account.
IDAreserves the right to require anaudit o fthe deposit account.

D. EnvironmentalAssessmentandRating

 191. The project has been defined as a Sectoral Adjustment Credit with a rating of B for
purposesof environmentalassessment. Given that the objective o fthe PRSCs is to support the
Government's program, an Environmental Assessment would usually be required to analyze and
make recommendations on measures to strengthen the overall institutional framework as well as
on the capacity buildingneeds o f key environmental organizations within the Government. The
Government has, in fact, commenced such work in the context o f a Country Environmental
Analysis (CEA). The Government will review the recommendations o f the CEA, identify key
actions based on its recommendations and thereafter implement its findings. The policy related
aspects will be implementedinthe context o f future PRSCs. Given the impending completion o f
the CEA, a separate EnvironmentalAssessment has not been required.

192. The CEA was launched in April 2003 by the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority
(EPA) in close collaboration with the World Bank and DFID. The objectives o f the study are to
take a systematic look at Ethiopia's institutional capacity for sustainable environmental
management at the federal, regional, woreda, kebele and community levels. The first two phases
o f the study have been completed including (i)   literature review; (ii) research covering all
                                                                        field
regions, about 25 woredas, 15 kebeles, and several communities; and (iii)     discussions with a
broad range o f stakeholders. The third phase will focus on a synthesis and preparation o f the
report, which is scheduledto be completed by December 2003.

193. The recommendations o f the CEA are expected to focus upon mainstreamingenvironment
into development policies and sector programs; establishing incentives and conditions for
enhanced environmental governance and accountability; and focusing on decentralized support
for environmental management.          The recommendations would focus on mainstreaming
environment into development policies and sector programs by enhancing horizontal links
between relevant environmental and sector agenciedfocal pointddesks at the various
administrative levels. At the federal level, recommendations are expected to focus on the priority
to be given to the implementation o f new environmental legislation to establish environmental
capacity and units in key agencies under the coordination o f the EPA; enhancing the role o f the
recently re-established Environmental Protection Council in strengthening policy co-ordination;
and improving the environmental assessment framework. The recommendations would focus on
establishing incentives and conditions for enhanced environmental governance and accountability
through improved environmental information management (including the improvement o f
environmental data quality, use o f environmental indicators to support decision making, and
public awareness building), and the roles of public, private and non-governmental sectors.
Finally, the recommendations would focus on decentralized support for environmental
management by strengthening vertical links between the various levels, and enhancing the
capacity o f woredas and kebeles for environmental management.

E. BenefitsandRisks

194. The major benefits of PRSC-I relate to supporting a Government led process,
focusing on improving the core               public management systems, supporting the
decentralizationprocessandreducingtransaction costs.

195. First the PRSC i s supporting a PRSP - prepared with strong country ownership and


                                                 65

involving the participation o f local communities, civil society, and the private sector - which
resulted in a comprehensive strategy that i s relevant, sound, and supported by a verifiable
program o f implementation. It has also assisted the Government's policy making machinery in
focusing on the difficult area o f cross-sectoral policy choices through the thematic approach to
PRSC preparation. This work in turn i s feeding into the SDPRP monitoring process leading to a
sharper focus on the main indicators o f future progress in SDPRP implementation.

196. Second, the PRSC i s supporting the Government in improving planning and budgeting
processes inan increasingly inclusive and efficient manner. The key area o f focus duringPRSC-I
preparation has been on aligning SDPRP, planning and budgeting and sectoral review processes.
There has also been increased emphasis on the budget dialogue (Le. on the actual expenditures
and on budgetary allocations) as well as on how Public Expenditure Reviews will be unbundled
to fit into the alignedprocess.

197. Third, the PRSC supports the decentralization process - so far undertaken in a risk aware
and pragmatic manner - by adding to the pool o f fimds available for timely and predictable fiscal
support to local governments to meet their new recurrent and investment service delivery needs.
With PRSC-11, the Bank will commence the transition from separate financing instruments for
sector programs, particularly in health and education, towards supporting federal transfers to
regions and allowing regions to make cross-sectoral choices which match the local priorities for
service delivery.

198. Fourth, the PRSC preparation has reduced transaction costs by accelerating donor
harmonization around the PRSP process. Within the context o f the broader donor harmonization
agenda in Ethiopia, the Bank has worked closely with the donor community as the co-chair o f the
local Development Assistance Group. The Bank also designed the Ethiopia PRSC preparation
process to fit within the Government's aligned SDPRP and financial calendars and designed it to
be open to all donor members o f the Direct Budget Support Group and the broader donor
community. This has already led to good results as the amount o f donors' budget support i s
almost at the same level as the multi-sectoral program support provided through PRSC-I and it i s
expected to exceed future Bank PRSC contributions inthe near future.

199. There are five risks involved: predictability of donor flows to the federal government
not reachingpoint of service delivery in a timely manner, fiduciary risks beingmitigated at
a slower       pace;   slower than planned implementation of                    the private sector
development/financialsector developmentmeasures; and country political risks. These are
described inthe paragraphsbelow.

200. The first risk is that certainty provided to the federal Government through timely multi-
sectoral multi-sectoral program and donors' budget support will not benefit local governments
who plan and deliver services. There are three key measures included in the PRSC program to
mitigate these risks. First, strict adherence to the financial calendar i s required so that regions and
woredas receive their budgetary allocations in a timely manner; inthis regard, the issuance o f the
financial calendar, Cabinet approval of the MEFF and the issuance o f indicative planning figures
to regions are prior actions for PRSC-I. Second, by PRSC-11, the Government would also have
identified and financed the one-off costs o f decentralization so that the funds provided to the
regions for service delivery are not absorbed into financing the growing bureaucratic structures
resulting from decentralization.

201. The second risk relates to improvements to fiduciary management being delayed
particularly with regard to the preparation, consolidationand auditing o f financial information. It


                                                   66

should be noted that the financial management reform program has been underway for a few
years and has been strengthened based on the recommendations contained in the CFAA Action
Plan. At the federal level, an associated detailed implementation program has been prepared. At
the regional level, as noted earlier, a substantial integrated planning process was undertaken over
the summer o f 2003. Several donors are providing ongoing project financing and will be further
providing additional financing through the programmatic approach to capacity building support
through the PSCAP. The World Bank has also been supporting support inthis area through the
CBDSD project and i s preparing the proposed PSCAP project. This program will need to be
implemented in a timely and effective manner or it will impact the levels o f multi-sectoral
program or donors' budget support.

202. The third risk i s that the Government has so far completed only limited actions for private
sector development and financial sector development while recognizing that implementation o f
this program is central to achievinghigher growth rates inEthiopia. It should be noted that the
Government invested considerable effort, as part o f the SDPRP/IDA CAS preparation process,
consulting with the private sector at the national level and in major cities as it identified key
constraints to private sector development and appropriate remedial measures which it i s now in
the process o f implementing. Further, the extent o f involvement o f the private sector indifferent
sectors o f the economy while, in certain cases i s at lower levels than the Bank encouraged the
Government to consider, represents levels that the Government i s comfortable with
implementing. There are two main causes for the current lack o f progress. First, there are areas
where implementation commenced but next steps have been delayed due to issues with the
original design which require additional technical work on addressing the original design
deficiencies (competition policy, urban land lease and privatization).         Second, there are areas
where the Government's thinkinghas evolved and their new positionrequires additional technical
work (e.g. the decision on the partial liberalization o f telecommunications). The Government has
now agreed to a fairly credible and ambitious program o f private sector development actions to be
completed prior to PRSC-I1 and a considerable package o f technical assistance i s in place and
under preparationby the Bank and other donors to ensure that the Government has the resources
it requires. The implementation o fthe PRSC-I1prior actions will, hence, not only be important in
that they will remove major constraints to private sector development but also would be important
from the standpoint o f enhancing the Government's policy credibility.

203. Finally, there are country risks. Over three years have elapsed since the end o f the conflict
with Eritrea and the Government has, as noted earlier, considerably reduced defense spending
and, with assistance from IDA and other donors, also undertaken a substantial demobilization
program.       There have also been international actions including decisions by a Border
Commission, issued inearly 2003, which are still inthe process o f being implemented. Untilthe
situation i s fully resolved, the potential risk for re-emergence o f conflict with Eritrea would need
to be closely monitored.

              ANNEX 7: InternationalMonetaryFund(IMF)Relations Note

                                                                            August 28,2003


The Executive Boardo fthe InternationalMonetaryFund(IMF) has completed the fourth
review o fEthiopia's performance under a PovertyReductionandGrowthFacility (PRGF)
Arrangement. As a result, Ethiopiawill be able to draw up to SDR 10.429 million(about
US$14.3 million) under the arrangement immediately. It further extendedthe period of
the arrangement, which was due to expire on March20,2004, throughJuly 2004.

The Boardalso approved arequest for additional interimHIPC assistance for SDR 2.111
million (about US$2.9 million) for the periodNovember 8,2003-May 31,2004.

Ethiopia's PRGFarrangement was approvedon March 22,2001 (see Press Release No.
01/11) for SDR 86.9 million(about US$119 million). OnMarch 18,2002, the Board
increased the PRGF arrangement by SDR 13.38 million(about US$18 million) to help
mitigate the impact on the balance o fpayments o f a continued deterioration of the terms
o f trade and the events o f September 11.So far, Ethiopia has drawn SDR 68.99 million
(about US$94.5 million).

The PRGF is the IMF'sconcessional facility for low income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are basedon country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted ina
participatory process involving civil society anddevelopmentpartners, and articulated in
a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This i s intendedto ensure that PRGF-
supportedprograms are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic,
structural, and social policies to foster growth andreduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an
annual interest rate o f 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5 %-year grace
period.

After the ExecutiveBoard's discussion onEthiopia, ShigemitsuSugisaki, Deputy
Managing Director andActing Chairman, stated:

"Recent economic performance has been seriously affectedby a severe drought in2002,
the worst inmanyyears. As a result of the drought and a sharp drop incereal production,
real GDP declinedin2002/03, and food prices rose markedly.An estimated 12.6 million
people are inneedo f food assistance.

"Despite this shock, Ethiopia's performance duringthe second annual programwas
broadly satisfactory. All the quantitative performance criteria andbenchmarks through
December 2002, as well as the indicative targets for end-March 2003, were observed. In
particular, the introduction o f the value-added tax was carried out inJanuary 2003, a
performance contract was signedwith the Commercial Bank o f Ethiopia (CBE) inJune
2002, and an audit o f the CBE by independentauditors was completed inM a y 2003, after
a delay o f four months.The ongoing decentralizationo f fiscal powers to woredas (local

districts), however, contributed to delays inthe implementation o f structural benchmarks
(and HPC Initiative completion point triggers) relatedto the improvement o fpublic
expenditure management.

"The overall fiscal deficit (including grants and emergency programs) i s estimatedto have
declined slightly from preceding years. Several tax measures were implemented
(including the introductiono f the value-added tax and the reform o fthe import tariff
regime). Defense expenditure was contained at 5.3 percent o f GDP, while poverty-related
expenditure rose to 17.7percent in2002/03. Further progress was made inimprovingthe
soundness o f the financial sector, including the adoption o f a directive to ensure
provisioning for nonperforming loans inline with internationalbest practices, while,
interest and exchange rate policies remain appropriately flexible andmarket-determined.

"The policies to be implementedunder the third annual program aim at maintaining
macroeconomic stability and achieving rates o f economic growth that are sufficient to
reduce poverty. In2003/2004, real GDP growth, spurred by a recovery inagricultural
output, i s projectedto rise to 6.7 percent. With food supply conditions returning to a more
normal level, consumer price inflation i s projected to decline, while the external current
account deficit is expected to increase slightly.

"Fiscal policy inthe period aheadwill focus on achieving and maintaining public debt
sustainability, while maximizing the use ofhighlyconcessional resources for poverty
reduction activities. The overall deficit (including grants and special program financing)
i s expected to narrow further to 7%percent in2003/04. Implementation o f the tax reform
program will continue, including measures to collect tax arrears and strengthen the large
taxpayer unit.Defense spendingwill be reduced to 4.8 percent o f GDP, while poverty-
related spendingwill be increased further to about 18 percent o f GDP. The ongoing
decentralizationo f fiscal authority to local districts will be closely monitored.

"Attention will continue to focus on strengtheningthe financial sector. Inparticular, a
detailedrestructuring planwill be developed for the CBE to restore its profitability and
sound management, and measures will betaken to strengthenthe finances, independence,
and supervisory capacity o f the National Bank o f Ethiopia. Other structural reforms to be
pursuedinclude initiatives to improve food security, promote microfinance institutions,
and enhance the climate for private investment," Mr. Sugisaki stated.
